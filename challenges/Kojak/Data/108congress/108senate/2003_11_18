Dorr, of Iowa, to be a Member of the Board of Directors of the \nCommodity Credit Corporation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n10:30 shall be divided equally between the chairman and ranking member \nof the Agriculture Committee or their designees.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nunder the order.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, I am pleased to announce \nthat the committee acted favorably on the nomination of Thomas Dorr to \nbe Under Secretary for the Department of Agriculture for Rural \nDevelopment and has reported that nomination to the Senate. We \nunderstand that considerable debate time is planned to be used and so \nthe leader decided to file a cloture on the nomination so we could \nbring this matter to a conclusion. We will have a vote on cloture after \nthe debates. I hope the Senate will vote to cut off debate and we can \nmove to a vote on this nomination and confirm Mr. Dorr in this job as \nUnder Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. Dorr has served capably under a recess appointment which was made \nby the President on August 9, 2002. The Senate committee reviewed his \nqualifications and found him to be well qualified. Hearings were held \nback in 2001 when the other party was in the majority and controlled \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee. Opposition to the nomination of Mr. \nDorr was expressed at that time, and the nomination was virtually \nblocked and returned to the President without being acted upon.\n\n  The President resubmitted that nomination, and it has languished, in \neffect, for a good while, while Senators who have been opposed to the \nnomination have expressed their concerns. It is clear that the nominee \nis very well qualified, not only because of his experience in business \nand his knowledge of rural America and the problems we face, but his \nunderstanding of the job at the Department of Agriculture which he has \nbeen asked to assume.\n  Mr. Dorr oversees the Department's rural development mission area \nthat consists of three agencies, $14 billion of annual funding \nauthority for loans, grants and technical assistance to rural \nresidents, communities and businesses, and an $80 billion portfolio of \nexisting infrastructure loans to rural America.\n  Rural development has over 7,000 employees across the United States, \nin Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the western Pacific trust \nterritories. This is a big job. It is an enormous responsibility and \nrequires someone with a business background and with administrative \nskills to manage an agency of this size.\n  Mr. Dorr has a broad base of experience to draw upon in agriculture, \nas well as financial and business experience. He has served as a member \nof the board of directors of the Seventh District Federal Reserve Bank \nof Chicago, the Iowa Board of Regents from 1991 to 1997, and as a \nmember and officer of the Iowa and National Corn Growers Associations.\n  Prior to this appointment, Mr. Dorr was the president of a family \nagribusiness company consisting of corn and soybean farms, a State-\nlicensed commercial grain elevator and warehouse, and two limited \nliability companies. Mr. Dorr is a graduate of Morningside College, has \na BS degree in business administration, and he is from Marcus, IA. The \nsupport for the nomination is widespread. I ask unanimous consent that \ncopies of letters endorsing his nomination be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 3, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: The below signed organizations urge you to \n     vote in support of the confirmation of Thomas Dorr as Under \n     Secretary of Rural Development, United States Department of \n     Agriculture. The position of Under Secretary of Rural \n     Development is critical in a number of ways to the success of \n     rural America and agriculture communities.\n       Mr. Dorr has proven that he has the skill and experience \n     necessary to lead USDA's Rural Development efforts. The \n     Senate Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Nutrition \n     recognizes the importance of this position and favorably \n     reported (14-7) Mr. Dorr's nomination in bipartisan fashion \n     on June 18, 2003.\n       The confirmation of Mr. Dorr will allow these vital \n     programs the greatest possibility of success. Mr. Dorr \n     deserves an up or down vote in the United States Senate, we \n     urge you to vote for his confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n       National Chicken Council.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Turkey Federation.\n       United Egg Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       United Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Association.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Office for the Advancement\n\n\n                                     of Public Black Colleges,\n\n                                                  October 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: As chair of the Council of 1890 \n     Presidents/Chancellors, I am writing to express our \n     appreciation for your continued leadership and to convey our \n     support of Thomas C. Dorr, Under Secretary, Rural \n     Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n       For your information, the Council represents the nation's \n     18 Black-land-grant colleges/universities and is a \n     policymaking body that is committed to advancing the land-\n     grant mission. The 1890s are located in 17 states, the \n     District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands and enroll \n     nearly 50 percent of all students attending HBCUs. We work \n     closely with the National Association of State Universities \n     and Land-Grant Colleges and provide leadership for the \n     Council of 1890 Colleges/Universities.\n       As ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and \n     Forestry Committee, your support of the 1890s has made a \n     significant difference in the infrastructure of our \n     institutions and in our ability to assume greater \n     responsibility for advancing and securing the nation's food \n     and agricultural enterprise. Guided by our 1890 Strategic \n     Plan (copy enclosed), our universities are investing heavily \n     and wisely in:\n       Serving as a vital force in the conduct of teaching, \n     research and extension and public service; serving as an \n     adjunct to the American economy; expanding and creating new \n     partnerships with socially and economically distressed \n     communities and government, business and industry; \n     transforming the knowledge we produce into solutions designed \n     to improve the quality of life of farmers and families in \n     rural communities and; providing a seamless network of \n     resources and services to key stakeholders in the food and \n     agricultural enterprise.\n       While these achievements are worth noting, the 1890s \n     continue to face nearly insurmountable barriers in accessing \n     the breath of programs administered by USDA. In response, \n     Under Secretary Dorr has been an invaluable resource in \n     helping us build new and complementary relationships within \n     and without USDA. Most recently, he represented the \n     Department at a town hall\n\n[[Page S14975]]\n\n     meeting, ``Small Farmers' Voices,'' sponsored by the Council \n     and held at Alcorn State University.\n       More than 200 farmers from the Delta area attended the \n     forum--unabashed and relentless farmers who represent the \n     bottom of America's agriculture industry. In spite of the \n     challenge, Tom was superlative in guiding the farmers through \n     the economic and political realities of the global \n     marketplace and helping them to understand the makeup of \n     programs and the allocation of resources at USDA. He has set \n     the state for sustained dialogue between USDA, the 1890s and \n     farmers in distress. This represents only a snapshot of the \n     many challenges that Under Secretary Dorr has helped us \n     negotiate.\n       With your strong leadership and unrelenting support of \n     public servants like Thomas C. Dorr, we are confident that \n     the 1890s will continue to serve as an economic instrument of \n     the state and the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Clinton Bristow,\n       Chair, Council of 1890 Presidents/Chancellors & President, \n     Alcorn State University.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,\n\n                                                  October 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to you in support of the \n     nomination of Mr. Thomas C. Dorr. I have known Tom for almost \n     seven years and have come to greatly respect and admire his \n     dedication to the development of sound economic and \n     agriculture policies. My initial interactions with Tom \n     occurred during the time he served on the Board of Directors \n     of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. During this time and \n     over the years that have followed, I have observed Tom in \n     numerous settings. These settings have ranged from formal \n     Chicago Fed Board of Directors' meetings, to a variety of \n     less formal settings including celebratory dinners, social \n     functions, and conventions, among others. No matter what the \n     occasion, I can honestly say that I have always found Tom to \n     be the consummate gentleman, a good listener, and someone who \n     always offers comments and suggestions grounded in a solid \n     understanding of the issues.\n       I have always found Tom's insights to be extremely valuable \n     in a variety of areas, most notably that related to \n     agricultural and economic policy. However, it would be an \n     oversight not to mention the solid advice and counsel he has \n     provided on issues dealing social problems in general and the \n     impact of technological change on life in rural and \n     agriculture communities, in particular. Tom was one of a \n     handful of people to understand that while the adoption of \n     technological advances in the farm sector would lift \n     productivity to new levels, these same changes could also \n     have adverse implications for the viability of the \n     traditional family farm. In particular, he often expressed \n     concern for the plight of the traditional family farm, an \n     institution facing intense competitive pressures from larger \n     more efficient operators and one typically requiring \n     significant off-farm income just to break even. In the face \n     of these developments, Tom continually raised concern about \n     the lack of a coherent plan for maintaining the viability of \n     the small farm on the one hand and dealing with the social \n     issues likely to result from their potential displacement on \n     the other.\n       As I noted above, I admire and respect Tom. I understand \n     that some parties have claimed that Tom is insensitive to \n     issues related to diversity. As an African American that \n     recently sponsored the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's \n     bank-wide diversity program, I can honestly say that I have \n     never felt uncomfortable in Tom's presence. I have never \n     heard him offer disparaging remarks about people of color, \n     the intrinsic value of diversity, or about small farmers for \n     that matter. Based on my years of interacting with Tom, I am \n     certain that he is not racist in any way and would challenge \n     anyone that would claim otherwise.\n       Needless to say, I am a big supporter of Tom Dorr. He is \n     bright, articulate, and personable. He accepts critical \n     comments well, is not afraid to speak his mind, and \n     demonstrates rigorous economic thinking at all times. \n     Finally, he has a deep understanding and appreciation of the \n     issues confronting our rural and agriculture communities and \n     I have no doubt that he will serve our country well. I hope \n     that you find my assessment helpful in your deliberations. If \n     I can provide any further information, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     William C. Hunter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \n         Committee, Senate Russell, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: For over forty-five years, the \n     National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and its affiliated \n     states have represented US corn growers working towards a \n     prosperous rural economy and a successful agricultural \n     industry. With over 31,000 dues-paying corn growers from 48 \n     states and representing the interest of more than 300,000 \n     farmers who contribute to corn check off programs, NCGA takes \n     seriously its commitment to our membership and our colleagues \n     throughout the agricultural sector.\n       Recently, your Committee completed a hearing to review the \n     nomination of Tom Dorr for Under-Secretary for Rural \n     Development. For the past year, the Committee has let the \n     nomination languish, thereby preventing the Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) from providing needed leadership in rural \n     America. Throughout this process, we have been amazed \n     regarding the controversy surrounding Mr. Dorr's nomination. \n     While good people can disagree about ideology and philosophy, \n     we do not agree holding rural America hostage to ``inside the \n     beltway'' politics.\n       Mr. Dorr has devoted himself to the well being of the \n     family farmer and his commitment to domestic agriculture is \n     unparalleled. As a longtime farmer and livestock producer in \n     Northwest Iowa, he is intimately familiar with the challenges \n     facing the agriculture industry in the Midwest and throughout \n     the country. The Department needs a leader like Tom to help \n     breathe life into an agency whose future role will be to \n     positively facilitate change in the farm economy.\n       You should know that our association is nonpartisan and \n     does not endorse political candidates. Our Board and \n     membership serve without respect to political affiliation and \n     our policies and priorities have one singular purpose, to do \n     what is best for rural America. We believe the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee should act in a similar manner.\n       Mr. Dorr's patience throughout the confirmation process \n     illustrates his commitment to public service and singular \n     desire to help rural America. We respectfully request the \n     Committee complete the nomination process as soon as \n     possible. Not only is it the right thing to do, it is vital \n     to ensure that domestic agriculture has a strong place in the \n     future of this nation.\n         Tim Hume, President, Walsh, CO;\n         Ron Olson, Waubay, SD;\n         Fred Yoder, President-Elect, Plain City, OH;\n         Richard Peterson, Mountain Lake, MN;\n         Lee Klein, Chairman of the Board, Battle Creek, NE;\n         Kyle Phillips, Knoxville, IA;\n         Charles Alexander, Stonewall, NC;\n         John Tibbits, Minneapolis, KS;\n         Leon (Len) Corzine, Assumption; IL;\n         Gerald Tumbleson, Sherburn, MN;\n         Gregory Guenther, Belleville, IL;\n         Dee Vaughan, Dumas, TX;\n         William Horan, Rockwell City, IA;\n         Ron Woollen, Wilcox, NE;\n         Gene Youngquist, Cameron, IL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Wheat Growers,\n\n                                                   March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and \n         Nutrition, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: We are writing in support of Tom Dorr \n     to be confirmed as Under Secretary for Rural Development. Mr. \n     Dorr has the vision and experience to help revitalize the \n     rural landscape of America.\n       It is our hope that farm-state Senators will support a \n     person for Rural Development Under Secretary whom knows farm \n     issues firsthand and has experienced success in this \n     challenging and competitive environment. Tom Dorr is a true \n     leader that has the talent and tenacity to be successful. \n     National Association of Wheat Growers is confident that Tom \n     will bring solid successful solutions to the challenging \n     economic environment in America.\n       Rural America is in real trouble. Foreign Agricultural \n     competition is accelerating at a rapid pace. Foreign \n     producers can grow crops more economically because of fewer \n     regulatory burdens, relative currency values, and a host of \n     other factors. Agriculture needs strong people in senior \n     positions of USDA who will fight for farmers and rural \n     communities, and Tom Dorr is one of those people.\n       We encourage you to unite behind Tom Dorr as Under \n     Secretary for Rural Development. He encompasses the \n     creativity that can bring hope in stemming the exodus of \n     people from our rural countryside because of lack of economic \n     opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gary Broyles,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                                     May 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for giving me the \n     opportunity to express the concerns of Rural Electric \n     Cooperatives to you and Mr. Dorr, Under Secretary for Rural \n     Development.\n       Mr. Dorr's frankness in addressing the issues facing \n     Electric Cooperatives is much appreciated. His willingness to \n     answer questions recently expressed by our membership is most \n     helpful.\n       In light of your support and Mr. Dorr's commitment to Rural \n     America, as well as his willingness to work with Rural \n     Electric Cooperatives, we have no reservations regarding Mr. \n     Dorr's confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn English,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will act \nfavorably on the nomination. I stand ready to answer any questions \nspecifically\n\n[[Page S14976]]\n\nfrom any Senators about our findings during the background \ninvestigations and the hearings that were held on the nomination. I am \nconvinced he will do an excellent job.\n  Before we reported this nomination, I had an opportunity to discuss \nthe performance in office of this nominee with those who had had \npersonal contact with him and had observed closely his management of \nthis agency. I talked with the head of the State agency in Mississippi, \nfor example, Nick Walters, to get his impressions because he had done \nan excellent job in our State of managing the rural development \nprogram. I have a lot of respect for Nick Walters. He works hard. He is \na person of great ability, and I have known him a long time. He had \nunqualified support and strong words of endorsement of Mr. Dorr in how \nhe had managed this department. He said he was tough minded but fair \nminded, and he did the job in a way that reflected credit on this \nadministration.\n  I hope the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the nomination and \nthen confirm Mr. Dorr as Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural \nDevelopment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, to break the impasse here--I never really \ngot to communicate to my friend from Iowa--I have maybe about 3 minutes \nof morning business. It would go outside this debate. I do not want to \nbe a part of this particular issue. If you don't want me to, that is \nquite all right with me. But I just ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Iowa seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. I would \nappreciate the Chair notifying this Senator when I have consumed 15 \nminutes of my allotted 30 minutes.\n  The nomination of Thomas C. Dorr for the position of Under Secretary \nof Agriculture for Rural Development has been controversial from the \noutset. It has generated a great deal of concern and opposition and \nvery serious questions. The controversy has continued from Mr. Dorr's \nnomination in a previous Congress to a recess appointment and then to \nhis nomination in this Congress.\n  I regret very much so many problems have arisen regarding the \nnomination of a fellow Iowan. Just as any of us would feel, it is a \nmatter of real pride to me when someone from my State is nominated to a \nhigh position in the Federal Government, regardless of party. This is \nthe first time in my 19 years in the Senate and 10 years in the House \nthat I have opposed the nomination of an Iowan to a position in the \nFederal Government. It gives me no pleasure to do this.\n  This is not personal. I have no personal acquaintanceship with Mr. \nDorr. I met him. He came into my office last year. To the best of my \nknowledge, prior to that our paths had not crossed--maybe briefly at \nsome point. I have no personal animosity at all toward Mr. Dorr. As I \nsaid, I don't know him personally. But the record speaks for itself.\n  I believe, however, we have a responsibility to review nominees as to \nwhether they meet the minimum standards for the job. As a member of the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have a \nresponsibility concerning nominations. We all do. I have worked with \nChairman Cochran and formerly with Senator Lugar, the former chairman \nand ranking member, to move nominees through the Agriculture Committee \nand to the floor fairly and expeditiously. I have done so both as \nchairman and ranking member, and that has been true of nominees for \nboth parties.\n  It is important to stress that the Agriculture Committee did not, in \nthis the 108th Congress, hold a hearing on the nomination of Mr. Dorr. \nBecause of the serious concerns and unanswered questions about this \nnominee, I repeatedly requested that the committee hold such a hearing, \nas did other members of the committee, but that hearing was not held. \nThe committee did hold a hearing in the preceding Congress but, as I \nwill explain momentarily, that hearing raised a host of issues that \nremain unresolved to this day. The questions have not been cleared up. \nIn fact, they have multiplied.\n  It was the responsibility, I believe, of the committee to hold a \nhearing on Mr. Dorr before it reported the nomination to the full \nSenate, and the unusual circumstances of this nomination added to the \nimportance of holding that hearing. This is not a minor nomination. The \nUnder Secretary for Rural Development is critically important to \nfamily-size farms and ranches and to smaller communities all across \nAmerica. The responsibilities include helping build water and waste-\nwater facilities, financing decent, affordable housing, and supporting \nelectrical power and rural businesses such as cooperatives. They also \ninclude promoting community development and helping to boost economic \ngrowth, create jobs, and improve the quality of life in rural America. \nThese are the responsibilities of this position.\n  Given those responsibilities, one of this nominee's first \ncontroversies arose from Mr. Dorr's vision of agriculture, reported in \nthe New York Times on May 4, 1998. Mr. Dorr proposed replacing the \npresent-day version of the family farm with 225,000-acre megafarms, \nconsisting of three computer-linked pods. With the average Iowa farm of \nabout 350 acres, Mr. Dorr's vision calls for radical changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 4, 1998]\n\n  For Amber Waves of Data; After the Green Revolution Comes Farming's \n                            Geek Revolution\n\n                         (By Barnaby J. Feder)\n\n       Marcus, Iowa.--There is a haunting prescience to the \n     ``Evolution of Agriculture,'' an old chemical company poster \n     on the wall of Tom Dorr's farm office. It ends in 1981 with \n     the invention of a mobile rig to measure electronically the \n     nutritional value of animal feed--the time line's first \n     mention of a computer.\n       Seventeen years later, computers have infiltrated every \n     conceivable element of agriculture, influencing what \n     technology-savvy farmers like Mr. Dorr grow, how they grow it \n     and how they market the fruits of their labor.\n       The terminal beside Mr. Dorr's desk, for instance, links \n     him to DTN, a nationwide agricultural and weather data \n     network. There is also his personal computer and printer, \n     which is part of a local area network connecting five \n     computers and a server in this small clapboard building. \n     Formerly the home of a tenant worker, the office is now the \n     information hub of 3,800 acres of northwestern Iowa prairie \n     where Mr. Dorr and his 11 full- and part-time employees raise \n     corn, soybeans and hogs, sell seed and run a grain elevator \n     that serves his and neighboring farms.\n       With gross revenue of about $2 million in most years, the \n     Dorr operations rank among the 4 percent of the largest \n     commercial farms that account for 50 percent of the nation's \n     agricultural output. Such commercial-scale farmers are \n     usually among those most active in experimenting with new \n     equipment and management techniques.\n       To really understand how far things have evolved and get a \n     glimpse of where they might be headed, it helps to stroll \n     past Mr. Dorr's secretary (and her computer), past the \n     bathroom (crowded with three retired computers saved for \n     spare parts), and into the electronics-stuffed lair of \n     Francis Swain, the technology manager.\n       Mr. Swain, a tall, 27-year-old son of a used-car dealer \n     whose reddish hair is greased back like a 1950's rock-and-\n     roller, describes himself as ``not in love with crops or pigs \n     or cows.'' He represents a new breed of worker, though, whom \n     many big farms will eventually need: an agro-geek with a \n     passion for computers and the information revolution.\n       In the increasingly global agricultural market, American \n     farmers will come to rely heavily on technology and \n     information systems to compete with nations that have cheaper \n     land and labor, according to experts like Jess Lowenberg-\n     DeBoer, a Purdue University agriculture economist who has \n     studied the adoption of computer-driven farm technology.\n       And so Mr. Dorr is doing what thousands of other American \n     farmers are doing: using machinery laden with electronic \n     controls and sensors to achieve pinpoint seed spacing, \n     analyze soils for moisture and nutrients, track weather and \n     manage the rates at which fertilizer and pesticides are \n     applied. He has  experimented with global positioning via \n     satellites to track exactly where each machine is as it \n     carries out these functions. And come harvest season, \n     still other devices will calculate crop yields in real \n     time.\n        What sets the Dorr operation apart from most, though, is \n     having an employee like Mr.\n\n[[Page S14977]]\n\n     Swain assigned to the task of figuring out how to improve and \n     harness the information flow.\n        Each tractor, pig and farm field is, in Mr. Swain's eyes, \n     simply a source of data that can make the farm more \n     profitable if properly analyzed. The questions that captivate \n     him include how much it would cost to track soil conditions \n     more thoroughly, how yield data from a combine might be \n     correlated with weather data or fertilizer records, and how \n     computer simulations of projected crop growth could be used \n     to fine-tune marketing decisions like what portion of the \n     crop to pre-sell before harvest.\n        ``My dream is not to farm but to own the information \n     company that farmers hook up to for information on logistics, \n     crop data, whatever,'' Mr. Swain said.\n        Mr. Dorr, 51, who began farming with his father and his \n     uncle in the 1970's, has a love of the soil that Mr. Swain \n     lacks. But Mr. Dorr does not let agrarian sentimentality \n     befuddle his business acumen. The family farm he grew up with \n     was part of an agricultural enterprise that besides livestock \n     and crops, included a feed store and turkey hatchery.\n        After graduating from Morningside College in Sioux City, \n     Iowa, with a Bachelor of Science in business, Mr. Dorr worked \n     for an educational research company for three years.\n        That experience exposed him to computers. While traveling \n     for the research company, Mr. Dorr made side trips to visit \n     farmers who were transforming family farms into far larger \n     commercial operations. When he returned to join the Dorr \n     farm, he was convinced of the need to scrupulously log as \n     much information as possible about operations.\n        Mr. Dorr had already invested more than $20,000 in \n     personal computers and farm management software when he hired \n     Mr. Swain in 1990 as office manager and accountant. ``Fran \n     was ill at ease and less qualified on paper than other \n     candidates,'' Mr. Dorr recalled. But Mr. Swain had studied \n     computer science at Nettleton Business College in Sioux \n     Falls, S.D., while completing the college's two-year \n     accounting program and his references raved about his \n     enthusiasm and organizational skills.\n        By last year, so much of Mr. Swain's work involved \n     updating and expanding the farm's information technology \n     systems that Mr. Dorr changed his title to technology \n     manager.\n        Mr. Swain, who has often urged Mr. Dorr to invest more \n     rapidly in cutting-edge technology, occasionally chafes at \n     more mundane tasks like analyzing past weather data to be \n     sure the strains of corn now going into particular fields are \n     likely to have time to mature before harvest.\n        ``His lack of experience in production gets him out into \n     left field sometimes,'' Mr. Dorr said of Mr. Swain's \n     proposals, like his suggestion to set up wireless \n     communications from field equipment to the office so that the \n     costs of pesticides are apportioned to the owners of a rented \n     field as the chemicals are applied. While intriguing, such \n     ideas would typically cost too much or not be reliable enough \n     with current technology, Mr. Dorr said.\n        Still. Mr. Dorr gave Mr. Swain his new title to encourage \n     him to continue thinking broadly and to make it clear to \n     skeptical old-time farmhands that Mr. Dorr valued Mr. Swain's \n     work.\n        Bob Kranig is a 56-year-old equipment operator and \n     mechanic who, along with Mike Schwarz, a 38-year-old \n     equipment operator for the Dorr farm, has been the main \n     employee coping with the surge in data gathering. ``Mike and \n     I are intimidated to a point by the new technology,'' Mr. \n     Kranig conceded.\n        They will have to get over those fears if Mr. Dorr and Mr. \n     Swain are to pursue their vision of a 225,000-acre operation \n     made up of three ``pods,'' each with its own manager but \n     sharing an information system back at farm headquarters. Such \n     an enterprise would be big enough to keep 100-unit \n     trains running to far-away seaports, making the farm \n     likely to receive volume railroad discounts. Such an \n     agricultural factory could also negotiate bargain prices \n     from suppliers and other concessions, like just-in-time \n     delivery.\n       To really prosper, though, this type of megafarm would need \n     a 21st-century computer network capable of rapidly \n     integrating information that is piling up in various, \n     incompatible forms--as well as other data that so far go \n     ungathered.\n       Such integration may be an uphill battle for years to come. \n     Researchers have raised questions about just how precise soil \n     samplers, yield monitors and other pieces of today's \n     equipment really are. And internet chat sessions, farm \n     conventions, and plain old coffee shop conversations in rural \n     towns are alive these days with earthy gripes about \n     proprietary product that do not interface with each other and \n     new technology that promises more than it can deliver.\n       Still, Mr. Dorr clings to his vision of a farm sprawling \n     over thousands of individual fields--many of which might be \n     only partly owned by Mr. Dorr and his relatives, while others \n     could be rented, either for money or for a share of the crop.\n       His information system would know what was grown in each \n     field in the past and how much it yielded under different \n     growing conditions. It would also know about crucial \n     characteristics of the field like irrigation, drainage and \n     soil.\n       The system would also have constantly updated information \n     on available labor, machinery and supplies. Operations like \n     storage, marketing and distribution would be tied in, so that \n     the past and the projected profitability of each field would \n     be constantly visible to Mr. Dorr, his employees, landowners \n     and the investors he says would be needed to spread the \n     financial risks of such a big enterprise.\n       Assembling this digitally enhanced megafarm would require, \n     by Mr. Dorr's and Mr. Swain's guesstimate, at least a $2 \n     million technology investment. Put it all together, though, \n     and one can envision a farm that rearranges planting or \n     harvesting on the fly as weather changes or new sales \n     opportunities arise.\n       Without such size and information-management capabilities, \n     Mr. Dorr fears that most farms will end up with as little \n     control over their destiny and profitability as those that \n     today raise chickens under contract to giant producers like \n     Tyson and Perdue. In addition, he says, such size and \n     sophistication will be needed to provide the kind of job \n     opportunities that will keep the best and brightest rural \n     youngsters from moving way.\n       So far, Mr. Dorr and Mr. Swain concede, it has been hard to \n     sell their vision, which Mr. Dorr sees as too risky to pursue \n     on his own. Investment bankers have said the project is too \n     small and the business plan too fuzzy to interest them, and \n     other farmers are hanging back.\n       Some are merely skeptical. Others are downright hostile to \n     visions like Mr. Dorr's because they see aggressive growth \n     strategies as a threat to the majority of family farms, which \n     are run by part-time farmers who also hold down other jobs. \n     But Mr. Dorr considers such thinking a denial of the \n     inevitable. ``The typical farmer's tendency is to go it alone \n     until it's too late,'' he said.\n       Yet even Mr. Swain concedes the risks of racing toward a \n     more computerized future. ``About half of all information \n     technology projects fail,'' he said.\n       And he knows full well that the problem is often the \n     unpredictable human element. Noting that he has software on \n     his Gateway 2000 laptop that keeps fitness records and \n     designs workouts for him, he added, ``The flaw is that it \n     doesn't motivate me to exercise.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. On another occasion, at a 1999 conference at Iowa State \nUniversity, Mr. Dorr criticized the State of Iowa for failing to move \naggressively toward very large, vertically integrated hog production \nfacilities. The record also shows Mr. Dorr attacking the ISU extension \nservice and harassing the director of the ISU Leopold Center for \nSustainable Agriculture. Is this really the attitude and the vision for \nagriculture and rural communities the Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment ought to bring to the job?\n  The person in that position also must be responsive and sensitive to \nthe demands of serving America's very diverse citizens and communities. \nThat requirement cannot be overemphasized in a department that has been \nplagued with civil rights abuses of both employees and clients. Here is \nwhat Mr. Dorr had to say about ethnic and religious diversity at that \nIowa State University Congress; these are Mr. Dorr's own words on the \nrecord:\n\n       I know this is not at all the correct environment to say \n     this, but I think you ought to perhaps go out and look at \n     what you perceive [are] the three most successful rural \n     economic environments in this state. . . . And you'll notice \n     when you get to looking at them, that they're not \n     particularly diverse, at least not ethnically diverse. \n     They're very diverse in their economic growth, but they have \n     been very focused, have been very non-diverse in their ethnic \n     background and their religious background, and there's \n     something there obviously that has enabled them to succeed \n     and to succeed very well.\n\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the transcript of this meeting be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Comments by Tom Dorr; Transcriptions of Iowa Tape\n\n       I've got just a couple of comments, and as one of the few \n     farmers here, I think I'll take an opportunity--I listened to \n     this comment earlier about the ``wow'' statements, that you \n     wanted something to get to the New York Times. I caution you \n     that that happened to me once a couple of years ago when I \n     suggested to me that the appropriate model of a corn soybean \n     farm in Iowa would mesh around 225,000 acre operation in an \n     interview that got the front page of the New York Times \n     business section. It screamed around the world and got back \n     to my hometown, and I am now presently the pariah of Marcus?, \n     so what you wish is what you may get if you're not careful.\n       My observation though today, that what you're really about, \n     as precipitated by this gracious gift, is you're really \n     trying to find your souls. Some of you have heard me say that \n     before, and I say that in the context that I as a former \n     member of the board of regents, and one who has always had an \n     abiding interest in education, have felt that to some extent, \n     some of the leadership, myself included, have failed the \n     institutions starting back during the ag crisis of the '80s \n     that\n\n[[Page S14978]]\n\n     particularly that precipitated all of this--in the sense that \n     what actually diverted you from your primary responsibility \n     of teaching and doing research and expected you to develop \n     economic development opportunities that would quickly turn \n     into more growth for the state. And I think that has been a \n     rather misguided approach, not in every case, but I think \n     that that was somewhat of a mistake. And as a result, I think \n     you're really trying to grope with whether or not you are a \n     group of physical scientists or social scientists. In \n     agronomy, I guess I've always assumed that you were physical \n     scientists, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. \n     And I'm not sure--I'm not making judgmental--I'm not sure \n     that's good or bad. You're obviously very very passionate \n     about what you do and so am I. I'm very passionate about what \n     I think we have to be doing in agriculture. My greatest fear \n     in listening to this discussion for the last short day is \n     that, as one of my peers on this panel suggested earlier, \n     when I put it in the context if after 60 years of Triple A or \n     Agriculture Adjustment Act Programs, our farm policy or farm \n     policy governance has literally frozen us in our ability to \n     be creative in our thought processes as it related to \n     production agriculture.\n       I caution you in the standpoint that the Iowa agriculture \n     rural landscapes are at great risk. They are truly at great \n     risk of becoming barren economic landscapes. And I say this, \n     and I've mentioned this earlier at least in a couple of the \n     groups, and I don't say this from the standpoint of sounding \n     like sour grapes. That's not what it's intended to, but most \n     of you in this institution through the various programs, \n     whether you're a merit employee P and S or an active (?) \n     admission, your salaries and your retirement programs through \n     TIA CREP will leave most of you much better off than most \n     farmers that you think you're trying to advantage out here in \n     the country at the time you complete 30 years of employment \n     in the institution. And as a result, I think it has to be a \n     paramount focus to a more income growth in the Iowa \n     agriculture sector. Quality is fine--it's a laudable goal, \n     but income growth has to be at the bottom of what you're \n     about. And if it's not, then I think we'll be back here \n     several more times trying to figure out what it is.\n       The other thing that's interesting to me, and I know this \n     is not at all the correct environment to say this, but I \n     think you ought to perhaps go out and look at what you \n     perceive the three most successful rural economic \n     environments in this state. And I'm not talking about those \n     associated with metropolitan areas. But I would submit to you \n     that they're probably the three most successful ones. If \n     they're not the three, two of these are the three, and it \n     would be Carroll County, Sioux County, and Lyon County. And \n     you'll notice when you get to looking at them, that they're \n     not particularly diverse, at least not ethnically diverse. \n     They're very diverse in their economic growth, but they have \n     been very focused and have been very non-diverse in their \n     ethnic background and their religious background, and there's \n     something there obviously that has enabled them to succeed \n     and to succeed very well.\n       I think we also need to recognize the fact that the change \n     in the hog industry did not occur in a vacuum, and it didn't \n     occur in North Carolina and the South by accident. It \n     occurred because we did not create the opportunities, the \n     investment opportunities and the environment in this state to \n     make it happen. And I submit to you that it would have \n     occurred and it would have occurred with a lot more of our \n     producers being involved in these kinds of enterprises in a \n     much more broad scope had we been more aggressive about \n     determining what was going to make it happen. And I will \n     caution you that this very thing is going to happen in crop \n     production in land management. The tools are in place, you \n     have economists on this staff that understand what I'm \n     talking about, and this will happen. It will evolve into \n     large grain farming operations that if we battle it, if we \n     don't analyze it and facilitate the growth in this, it could \n     be very disheartening.\n       I think our goal ought to be to turn the state into a \n     vibrant food producing value-added state, but it will not \n     happen that way within the existing structure of production \n     agriculture. So when we look at who we serve, I think in all \n     honesty that if you truly focus on doing good research, good \n     science driven research, and maintaining high pedagogical \n     standards and teaching students, that you're products and \n     your science, your products in terms of your students and \n     your science will serve you most appropriately wherever they \n     may end up at, and probably in a much finer model than you \n     would perhaps suspect.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, should we have as Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment someone who lacks the judgment to avoid uttering such \nintentionally provocative and divisive remarks? How does this sort of \ninsensitivity serve the urgent need to reverse USDA's poor civil rights \nrecord?\n  I repeat what Mr. Dorr said:\n\n       I know this is not at all the correct environment to say \n     this.\n\n  Evidently he is saying it is all right to say it, it must be all \nright to believe it, but you just don't say it publicly in a meeting \nsuch as that. In other words, he is kind of saying be careful of where \nyou say it but it is OK to go ahead and believe what he says here, that \nsomehow economic progress equates with lack of ethnic and religious \ndiversity.\n  Let me also point to a memorandum Mr. Dorr sent to me, in October of \n1999, to complain about charges on his telephone bill for the national \naccess fee and the Federal universal service fee. The proceeds from \nthese relatively modest fees go to help provide telephone service and \nInternet access to rural communities, hospitals, and schools. It just \nstrikes me as very odd that Mr. Dorr would have responsibility for \nhelping rural communities obtain telecommunications services and \ntechnology when he was so vehemently opposed to a program that serves \nthat very purpose. This is what he said in that letter, in reference to \nthe national access fee and the Federal universal service fee:\n\n       With these kind of taxation and subsidy games, you \n     collectively are responsible for turning Iowa into a State of \n     peasants, totally dependent on your largesse. But should you \n     decide to take a few side trips through the Iowa countryside, \n     you'll see an inordinate number of homes surrounded by five \n     to 10 cars. The homes generally have a value of less than \n     $10,000. This just confirms my ``10 car $10,000 home \n     theory.'' The more you try to help, the more you hinder. The \n     results are everywhere.\n\n  What a slap in the face to poor rural people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire substance of the letter and a \nmemorandum that was sent to me dated 10-8-99 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Date: 10/8/99\n     To: See Distribution List\n     From: Thomas C. Dorr\n     Re: Telephone and TeleCommunication Taxes\n       Attached to this memo-fax is an information insert I \n     received with my recent long distance billing. The total tax \n     for this statement is 14.65%. This is outrageous, especially \n     when you consider that government has had minimal influence \n     on the evolution of the telecommunications technology.\n       The monthly National Access Fee per business line of $4.31 \n     in conjunction with the 4.5% ``Federal Universal Access Fee'' \n     frequently exceeds the total monthly phone usage charges, \n     which are necessary to have emergency phone lines at our \n     individual farm and hog sites. Those taxes don't include the \n     Federal and State excise and sales taxes.\n       These taxes are confiscatory. School and local government \n     systems in Iowa alone have been subsidized so long without \n     commensurate performance expectations that a large number \n     have slipped into a slothful state far exceeding mediocrity. \n     They probably don't receive 30% of these taxes, and they \n     surely don't need them.\n       With these kinds of taxation and subsidy games, you \n     collectively are responsible for turning Iowa into a state of \n     peasants totally dependent on your largesse. This is \n     unacceptable.\n       I am sure my ranting won't change your approach to \n     maintaining a constituency dependent on government revenue. \n     But should you decide to take a few side trips through the \n     Iowa countryside, you'll see an inordinate number of homes \n     surrounded by five to ten cars. The homes generally have a \n     value of less than $10,000. This just confirms my ``10 car \n     $10,000 home theory''. The more you try to help the more you \n     hinder. The results are everywhere.\n       I strongly suggest you take time to read Thomas Friedman's \n     new book ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree'', then ask \n     yourselves what really makes sound governance policy. I don't \n     think confiscatory tax initiatives count. It is a cinch we \n     aren't getting wealth in Iowa.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Important Information on Service Fees\n\n       Recent regulatory and industry changes will affect two \n     charges on your current invoice. The Federal Communications \n     Commission recently approved larger universal service \n     subsidies for schools and libraries.\n       Like other carriers, MCI WorldCom SM collects \n     its contributions for the universal service fund by assessing \n     a fee on customer invoices. In order to recover the cost of \n     increased universal service contributions, beginning with \n     this invoice, the monthly Federal Universal Service Fund \n     charge (FUSF) is calculated at 4.5% of regulated interstate \n     and international billing, reflecting an increase of 0.4%.\n       Also effective with this invoice, the monthly National \n     Access Fee (NAF) increased to $4.31 per Business Line, $0.48 \n     per Business Centrex line, and $21.55 per ISDN PRI or \n     Supertrunk line. The NAF results from monthly per-line \n     charges imposed by many local service providers on long \n     distance carriers for connections to local telephone \n     networks.\n       As a valued customer, you will continue to be notified of \n     any future changes that affect what you pay for service.\n\n[[Page S14979]]\n\n       Thank you for using the MCI WorldCom program. We appreciate \n     your business and the opportunity to serve you.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Mr. Dorr was given every opportunity but \ncould not explain this broad attack against helping rural communities. \nIt seems clear that Mr. Dorr was degrading the very people and the very \nrural communities he is nominated to serve at USDA. He was making light \nof lower income Americans in rural communities who are struggling to \nmake a living and get ahead. And he is saying that it is \ncounterproductive to try to help. He said:\n\n       The more you try to help the more you hinder.\n\n  In testimony before the committee, Mr. Dorr admitted that he had \ngotten federally guaranteed student loans. He admitted that he had \ngotten very generous farm program payments and that these did not seem \nto hinder him at all. But to try to help poor people who live in \n$10,000 homes, that hinders them, you see. Talk about insensitivity.\n  This is a letter he sent to me. In that letter, he was complaining \nabout the taxation for the Federal universal service fee. Do you know \nwhat the bill was? It was $4.74. He is saying it is confiscatory. On \nthe other page, here is the Federal universal service fee--3 cents out \nof a $21.27 bill, and he is complaining about it. This is someone who \nis going to be the Under Secretary of Rural Development?\n  To do any job well, one has to believe in its value. Yet the very \npurposes of USDA's Rural Development programs are an anathema to the \nbeliefs and philosophy of Mr. Dorr.\n  Lastly, for any nominee the Senate has a responsibility to examine \ntheir financial backgrounds and dealings. Secretary Veneman put it \nperfectly when she wrote to me:\n\n       Any person who serves this Nation should live by the \n     highest standards.\n\n  Let us see if Mr. Dorr meets this standard.\n  Mr. Door was a self-described president and chief executive officer \nof Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Company of which he and his wife were the \nsole shareholders. In that position as president and CEO, Mr. Dorr \ncreated an exceedingly complex web of farming arrangements.\n  This is what it kind of looks like. I will not try to explain it. It \nis very complex and very interlocking. But the operations included land \nin two trusts that were set up in 1977. For a time, Tom Dorr through \nhis company, Dorr's Pine Grove Farm, the major company, farmed the land \nheld in these trusts under a 50-50 share lease with half of the crop \nproceeds and half of the farm program benefits going to Dorr's Pine \nGrove Farm and half to these trusts. This is what is normally called a \ncrop share arrangement.\n  Then, beginning in 1988, Mr. Dorr filed documents with the USDA \nstating that his operation had changed. He was no longer farming on a \ncrop share basis, but he was going to custom farm, saying that each \ntrust had a 100-percent share in the crop proceeds and were entitled to \nreceive 100 percent of Federal farm program benefits.\n  Tom Dorr, acting through Dorr's Pine Grove Farm, still farmed the \nland as before, but he had claimed and stated and signed his name on a \ndocument that the arrangement had become a custom farming arrangement.\n  This is very important. He knowingly signed that document.\n  At some point, one of the trust beneficiaries, Mr. Dorr's brother, \nPaul Dorr, began to question why the custom farming fees were so high. \nPaul Dorr taped at least two conversations with his brother, Tom Dorr, \nthat corroborated his suspicions that Tom Dorr was engaged in \nmisrepresentation. That tape was made public. Mr. Dorr admitted that \nthat was his voice on the tape. Paul Dorr contacted the Farm Service \nAgency and persisted in his request for an investigation.\n  Finally, in the spring of 1996, the FSA conducted a review of the \nMelvin G. Dorr Irrevocable Trust. The FSA found that the forms filed \nand signed by Thomas Dorr for the 1993, 1994, and 1995 crop-years \nmisrepresented the facts. The trust was required to repay $16,638 to \nthe Federal Government.\n  Let us fast forward.\n  In the fall of 2001, the USDA Office of Inspector General conducted a \nfurther review of Mr. Dorr's affairs. The Office of Inspector General \nasked the Farm Service Agency to review another trust, the Harold E. \nDorr Irrevocable Family Trust. Once again, the trust was found to be in \nviolation of program rules because of the misrepresentation on forms \nsigned by Thomas Dorr. The trust had to pay USDA a total of $17,151.87 \nin program benefits and interest for crop-years 1994 and 1995.\n\n  Investigations by the USDA Office of Inspector General and the Farm \nService Agency determined that for the years examined, the forms signed \nby Tom Dorr misrepresented the trusts' shares in the crop proceeds. FSA \nfound that in reality the land in both of these trusts was farmed on a \n50-50 crop share basis and not on a custom farming basis. The trusts \nwere, therefore, not eligible for the 100-percent share of program \nbenefits because Tom Dorr had misrepresented the actual farming \narrangement.\n  Mr. Dorr would have us believe that either the misrepresentations \nwere innocent or that there were no misrepresentations. But the record \nshows that he knowingly carried on a crop share lease arrangement \nbetween Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Company and each of the trusts even as \nhe represented to the Farm Service Agency that it was custom farming \nand not crop share leasing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, in the telephone conversations that Paul \nDorr taped, Tom Dorr admitted that the so-called custom farming \narrangement was, in fact, a crop share. This is in a telephone \nconversation in which Mr. Dorr said:\n\n       Besides those two machine charges, everything is done on a \n     50-50 normal crop share basis. It always has.\n\n  These are not my words; these are Tom Dorr's own words on tape.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the transcript of that tape be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTranscript of Audio Tape Provided Upon Request From the Iowa State FSA \n      Office, Identified as: Copy of Tape Labeled ``Excerpts From \n         Conversation Between Tom Dorr and Paul Dorr 6/14/95''\n\n       The parties are identified as Person 1 (assumed to be Paul \n     Dorr) and Person 2 (assumed to be Tom Dorr).\n       The following are excerpts from a telephone conversation \n     that was recorded on June 14, 1995, occurring between Tom \n     Dorr and Paul Dorr.\n       Person 1: I, I guess I'd like to know as a beneficiary what \n     . . . you know, I know, I understand your desire to keep this \n     all out fr . . . , in the government's eyes, um, but I still \n     think there should be some sort of explanation as to how \n     these, you know exactly how this percentage, allocation is \n     broken out, how its, how its applied each year.\n       Person 2: 50/50. I charge the Trust their half of the \n     inputs, not the machine work. And I charge the, I charge the, \n     I take that back, the only machine charge, the machine charge \n     that I have charged always is $12.50 an acre for combining. \n     That was an arrangement that was entered into when dad and \n     Harold were still alive because of the high cost of combines.\n       Person 1: Yeah . . .\n       Person 2: Beside from that, uh, I take that back, and they \n     also, and we have always charged the landlords a nickel a \n     bushel to haul the grain into the elevator.\n       Person 1: Um Hmm . . .\n       Person 2: Beside those two machine charges everything is \n     done on a 50/50 normal crop share basis, it always has. And, \n     and, and frequently, quite frankly, I've, I've kicked stuff \n     in, or, you know, if there is a split that isn't quite equal \n     I always try to err on the side of the, on the side of the \n     Trust. So, that's, that's the way its been, that's the way it \n     always has been and that's the way these numbers will all \n     resolve themselves if somebody wants to sit down and go \n     through them that way.\n       Person 1: It, this was all done that way in an effort to . \n     . .\n       Person 2: . . . avoid the $50,000 payment limitation to \n     Pine Grove Farms.\n       Person 1: And. . . to, it is to your benefit to your other \n     crop acres . . .\n       Person 2: . . . that's right . . .\n       Person 1: . . . that, that um, this arrangement is set up \n     in, in such a fashion?\n       Person 2: That's correct.\n       Person 1: Uh, do we, as a Trust, um, have any risk if the \n     government ever audits such an arrangement? Or, was it done \n     your saying back when it was legal? Is it still legal?\n\n[[Page S14980]]\n\n       Person 2: I have no idea if its legal. No one has ever \n     called me on it. I've done it this way. I've clearly kept \n     track of all paper work this way. And, uh . . .\n       Person 1: I, I understand how it works, now . . .\n       Person 2: I have no idea. I suspect if they would audit, \n     and, and somebody would decide to come in and take a look at \n     this thing, they could, they could probably if they really \n     wanted to, raise hell with us. Yep, you're absolutely right. \n     Uh, and I'm trying to find out where I've overcharged at.\n       Person 1: Well, I, I don't know what the extension service \n     includes in their, in their, um, uh, estimated figure on, on \n     machinery expense.\n       Person 2: That, that, that figure, I mean if you look at \n     that figure, and I believe, and I'd have to go back and find \n     it, but I know that I discussed this with the trustees and \n     I'm fairly certain that its in one of your annual reports. \n     Uh, that custom fee actually is not a custom fee. That's crop \n     rental income to me. That's my share of the income. I mean if \n     you just sat down and, and, and . . . (5 second pause with \n     music in the background) excuse me . . .\n       Person 1: That's ok.\n       Person 2: Uh, what actually happened there was way back in, \n     uh, perhaps even 89, but no, no that was in 90 because that \n     doesn't show up until then, Either 90 or 91, uh, I refiled \n     the way the farm, the Trust land both for the Melvin Dorr \n     Trust and the, the uh, Harold Dorr Trust are operated with \n     the ASCS to, quite frankly, avoid minimum payment \n     limitations. OK?\n       Person 1: Right\n       Person 2: And I basically told the ASCS and reregistered \n     those two operations such that they are, uh, singularly farm \n     operations on their own, OK?\n       Person 1: OK\n       Person 2: And I custom farm it. Alright, so how are you \n     going to custom farm it? The reason I did it was, was to \n     eliminate any potential, uh, when I could still do it at that \n     point, of, of the government not liking the way I was doing \n     it. I knew what was coming. I anticipated it the same as I \n     did with proven corn yields way back in the 70's when I began \n     to prove our yields and got basis and the proven yields \n     up. I transferred these out when it was still legal and \n     legitimate to do so and basically they stand alone. Now, \n     obviously I'm not going to go out here and operate all \n     this ground and provide all this management expertise \n     singularly, uh, for the purpose of, of, of doing it on a \n     $60 an acre custom fee basis. Subsequently, what's \n     happened is, the farm, I mean the, the family Trust pays \n     all of its expenses and then we reimburse it and it sells \n     all the income, and it sells all the crop, and it \n     reimburses us with the 50/50 split basis.\n       Person 1: I, I, I remember vaguely something being \n     discussed about that, I'll have to go back to the file. . .\n       Person 2: . . . that's exactly what's going on \n     (unintelligible) . . . those custom fees the way they are . . \n     .\n       Person 1: . . . and then to determine, um, that, that was, \n     again if that was in writing to us beneficiaries, I guess I \n     missed that and I'll look for that again. Um . . .\n       Person 2: Even if it wasn't I know that that was clearly \n     discussed with the trustees. The beneficiaries really had \n     nothing to do with it.\n       Person 1: OK, well, well, I appreciate your correcting me \n     on the interest and, uh, allocating those incomes to those \n     different years. That does make a difference with that \n     income. I think the custom fees, uh, when I took a look at \n     that one, and I, you know, I just started looking at this in \n     the last 6 weeks. When I took a look at that last figure, uh, \n     and looking back on in the file, it may not hurt for you to \n     remind everybody, um, maybe even in the annual report. . . .\n       Person 2: I don't, I don't, really want to tell everybody, \n     not because I'm trying to hide the custom work fees from \n     anybody, but because I don't want to make any bigger deal out \n     of it than I have to, relative to everybody knowing about it, \n     including the government.\n       End of Recording.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, again he said on the tape,\n\n       Everything is done on a 50-50 normal crop share basis. It \n     always has.\n\n  He says that to his brother on the tape, but he says to the FSA, to \nthe taxpayers of America: No, it is not. I am custom farming.\n  What would be the purpose of misrepresenting these arrangements? Mr. \nDorr's own statements show the motives in this telephone call. As Tom \nDorr said to his brother, the bogus custom farming arrangements were \nset up to ``avoid the $50,000 payment limitation to Pine Grove Farms.''\n  Again, my fellow Senators, these are not my words. These are Tom \nDorr's own words--his own words. He admits in his own words that he \nmisrepresented to the Federal Government his farming arrangements, and \nhe did it to get around payment limitations.\n  There was the payment limitation connection. A part of the farm \nprogram payments for land in these two trusts should have been paid \ndirectly to Dorr's Pine Grove Farm under a normal crop share \narrangement. But they would have counted against Mr. Dorr's payment \nlimitation. But instead, because of Mr. Dorr's misrepresentations, the \nUSDA payments that should have gone to him were funneled through the \ntrusts and not counted against his payment limitations.\n  Indeed, the FSA review of Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Company found that \nMr. Dorr's misrepresentations `` . . . had the potential to result in \nPine Grove Farms receiving benefits indirectly that would exceed the \nmaximum payment limitation.''\n  Federal law provides criminal penalties for knowingly making false \nstatements for the purpose of obtaining farm program benefits. The USDA \nOffice of Inspector General referred the Dorr matter to the U.S. \nAttorney for the Northern District of Iowa.\n  In February of 2002, that office declined criminal prosecution due to \nstatute of limitations issues. We may hear some claim that the Office \nof Inspector General exonerated Mr. Dorr. That simply is not so. The \nOIG simply closed the case after the U.S. attorney decided it could not \nproceed because the statute of limitations had run.\n\n  Is this the rule by which we say to someone they can now get a \nposition in the Federal Government? You tried to cheat the Federal \nGovernment out of money, you got caught, you had to pay it back, and \nyou didn't get prosecuted because the statute of limitations had run. \nThat is OK, you can take a position in the Federal Government.\n  Based on the seriousness of the violations involved, I believe it was \nthe responsibility of the committee to exercise due diligence regarding \nother parts of his complex farming arrangement and to take a look at \nsome years that had not been involved in the FSA and OIG \ninvestigations. Shortly after the March 2002 nomination hearing, \nSenator Mark Dayton sent a letter dated March 21 asking for information \non the various financial entities from 1988 through 1995, 1988 being \nthe year in which he first changed or said he changed his operation. I \nwrote Secretary Venenman on May 17, 2002, and on June 6, 2002, seeking \na response to the committee's questions.\n  We received some responses but critical questions remained unanswered \nand new questions arose. The materials provided in June show that over \n$70,000 in farm program payments had been received by the two trusts \nfrom 1988 through 1992 under, apparently, the very same type of \nmisrepresentation that was found in later years. Each time the USDA \nprovided the committee with some of the requested information that \nturned up new problems. Again, we tried to get to the bottom of his \ncomplex financial dealings. We know the crop shares were misrepresented \nfor two of the entities but we did not have sufficient information \nabout the others, so the committee requested additional documents from \nUSDA. We asked the nominee additional questions. These were reasonable \nrequests pertaining to valid questions. Secretary Venenman made clear \nin her letter back to the committee that neither the Department nor the \nnominee would cooperate with or provide any more information to the \ncommittee.\n  I ask consent that a letter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus \ndated May 22, 2003, strongly opposing this nominee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Harkin: On behalf \n     of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, we write to express our \n     continued opposition to the confirmation of Thomas Dorr for \n     Undersecretary of Agriculture for Rural Development. \n     Furthermore, we urge that Mr. Dorr's confirmation process not \n     bypass the required hearings necessary to provide a full \n     accounting of Mr. Dorr's very troubling views on agriculture \n     and his equally upsetting stated views on racial diversity in \n     America.\n       This opposition is not arbitrary, but based on reasonable \n     concerns. Our opposition is based on Mr. Dorr's vocal stances \n     on his vision of farming and his resistance to sustainable \n     agriculture. One of the biggest threats to independent \n     producers, farm workers, and rural communities is the growing \n     corporate control of the nation's food production system. \n     Undersecretary Dorr's vision of farming\n\n[[Page S14981]]\n\n     is one of 225,000 acre operations--one farm for every 350 \n     square miles. This is 656 times the size of the average farm. \n     Such a vision is antithetical to a broader vision of broad-\n     based and equitably distributed growth for all of rural \n     America.\n       In addition, in comments made publicly and reported in the \n     Des Moines press, Mr. Dorr believes that diversity of race, \n     ethnicity, and religion detract from economic productivity. \n     He claimed in a meeting in 1999 that three of Iowa's more \n     prosperous counties do well economically because ``they have \n     been very non-diverse in their ethnic background and their \n     religious background.'' These comments are puzzling, and \n     raise concerns about his racial sensitivity.\n       The Undersecretary of Rural Development must support a \n     viable and equitable vision for our rural communities. Mr. \n     Dorr's opposition to sustainable agriculture programs, \n     support for corporate control of farms, and his contention \n     that economic prosperity can be contributed to lack of ethnic \n     and religious diversity are the worst possible answers to the \n     economic, social and environmental problems facing farm \n     workers and their communities in rural America. Based on Mr. \n     Dorr's background and his tenure at the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture, it is easy to understand why both civil rights \n     and farmer interest organizations have opposed him, his \n     extreme corporate views and racial insensitivity.\n       The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Latinos, farmers, \n     farmworkers, and farmer organizations throughout the country \n     oppose the confirmation of Thomas Dorr. What we need are USDA \n     officials who represent family farmers, farmworkers, and \n     sensible farm policies. Farmers from his own state and from \n     throughout the country oppose his confirmation. This \n     opposition may explain why President Bush found it necessary \n     to initially appoint Undersecretary Dorr through a recess \n     appointment rather than allowing his nomination to move \n     through a transparent and formal process in the US Senate. \n     Last, the appointment of Mr. Dorr does little to improve the \n     image of an agency plagued with civil rights violations and \n     class action lawsuits from minority farmers.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly oppose the \n     confirmation of Mr. Thomas Dorr and strongly urge that his \n     views and tenure at USDA be explored in confirmation \n     hearings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                The Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also have a letter from a number of groups dated \nOctober 8, 2003, representing family farmers and farm workers across \nAmerica opposed to this nominee. I ask it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 8, 2003.\n       Dear Senator, The undersigned organizations are dedicated \n     to promoting social, environmental and economic justice \n     throughout rural and urban America. We are writing to ask you \n     to vote against the nomination of Thomas Dorr as USDA \n     Undersecretary for Rural Development when it comes to the \n     Senate floor. This nomination, now more than two years old, \n     has received on-going, widespread grassroots opposition.\n       In August 2002 President Bush appointed Mr. Dorr to the \n     USDA in order to avoid the certain rejection of this \n     unsuitable nominee by the full Senate. His recess appointment \n     followed the Senate Agriculture Committee's vote of no \n     confidence when they released his nomination without \n     recommendation. Earlier this year, the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee, without a hearing, sent the nomination to the \n     Senate floor.\n       We object to Thomas Dorr's nomination for many reasons. \n     First, Mr. Dorr deliberately misrepresented his farming \n     operations structure to order to cheat the U.S. government \n     and circumvent payment limitations. On the morning of the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on his nomination in \n     March 2002 the Des Moines Register published excerpts from a \n     taped conversation between Mr. Dorr and his brother. In this \n     conversation, Mr. Dorr stated that he had misrepresented the \n     structure of his farming operations to ``quite frankly avoid \n     minimum payment limitations.'' The U.S. government required \n     he return $17,000 in 1995 after a review of his Iowa farm \n     operation.\n       In 2002, in the wake of the Senate Agriculture hearing and \n     further investigation, the Dorr family trust was obligated to \n     repay another $17,000. During the August 2002 Senate \n     Agriculture Committee meeting, Senator Harken raised \n     concerned that according to materials provided in June, two \n     Dorr family trusts received some $65,000 in farm program \n     payments from 1988 through 1993. These payments apparently \n     fall under the very same circumstances that led to the total \n     repayment of $34,000 for 1994 and 1995. Nevertheless, the \n     USDA continues to withhold further records of Mr. Dorr from \n     the Committee and the public.\n       Second, Thomas Dorr's vision for increased concentration in \n     U.S. agriculture and the consolidation of many family farms \n     into singular ``megafarms'' is counter to effective rural \n     development and the promotion of family farm and ranch-based \n     agriculture that is at the foundation of healthy rural \n     economies and agriculture communities. He is also on record \n     as strongly opposing sustainable agriculture, including the \n     cutting-edge work of the Leopold Center at Iowa State \n     University.\n       Third, Mr. Dorr has made comments tying rural economic \n     development with lack of ethnic and religious diversity. \n     Diversity is increasing in our nation's rural communities, \n     and we are concerned that Mr. Dorr's perspective will prevent \n     him from effectively meeting the needs of minority \n     populations. As Senator Harkin said during the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee Hearing on August 1, how does Mr. \n     Dorr's insensitivity fit the urgent need to reverse the \n     USDA's poor civil rights record?\n       Fourth, Mr. Dorr strengthened our opposition to his \n     nomination with his testimony before the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee in March 2002 during which, in a letter to Senator \n     Harkin written by Mr. Dorr himself, he revealed his disdain \n     for rural residents who utilize government programs. In this \n     letter, Mr. Dorr complained about a miniscule tax on his \n     telephone service saying he believed government payments \n     destroyed the initiative of beneficiaries. This seriously \n     calls into question Mr. Dorr's ability to fairly administer \n     programs providing millions of dollars in federal loans and \n     grants to those he is mandated to serve, but about whom he \n     has made antagonizing statements.\n       Mr. Dorr's track record in the USDA since his recess \n     appointment has not mitigated our objections. On Friday May \n     16, 2003, Mr. Dorr testified before the Senate Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development. As part of \n     the budget request for FY 2004, he stated that he views his \n     agency as the ``venture capitalists'' of rural America, \n     instead of lender of last resort, its primary historical \n     mission.\n       It is not in our nation's best interest to have an \n     Undersecretary for Rural Development who has admitted misuse \n     of U.S. government programs, antagonized those he would be \n     charged to serve, and who envisions a structure of \n     agriculture that would further depopulate our rural \n     communities. The Undersecretary for Rural Development should \n     support policies that ensure thriving and viable rural \n     communities and uphold USDA standards. This person should \n     also believe in the government programs he administers.\n       The undersigned organizations remain concerned about Mr. \n     Dorr's vision, his current USDA record, and the USDA's \n     failure to respond to pending questions from the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee. We strongly urge you to vote against \n     Mr. Dorr's nomination.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter from the Black Caucus expressing deep \nconcern about this nomination and pointing out: Before moving forward \nwith the nomination, we urge you to carefully consider the concerns we \nhave outlined here, ``only when all parties are satisfied should he be \ngiven a vote.'' I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord, along with a letter signed by 44 Senators, dated June 24, 2003, \nto Majority Leader Frist, basically saying they are opposed to going \nahead with this nomination until one, the nominee furnishes requested \ninformation, and two, until a hearing under oath is held on Mr. Dorr's \nnomination according to committee rules and normal practice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We write to express our deep concern about \n     the nomination of Thomas C. Dorr as Under Secretary for Rural \n     Development and member of the Commodity Credit Corporation \n     board at the Department of Agriculture. The nomination was \n     reported from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n     Forestry on June 18.\n       From the outset, Mr. Dorr has been a highly controversial \n     nominee, due in part to his insensitive and divisive remarks \n     concerning ethnic and religious diversity, his disparaging \n     comments about low income rural Americans and his advocacy of \n     huge mega-farms at the expense of family farms. Accordingly, \n     the Congressional Hispanic Caucus opposes Mr. Dorr's \n     confirmation and the Congressional Black Caucus has expressed \n     ``deep concern'' about the nomination.\n       Of critical importance is evidence that Mr. Dorr signed and \n     submitted documents to the Department of Agriculture in which \n     he misrepresented his farming arrangements with two family \n     trusts for the purpose of evading statutory limitations on \n     the amount of farm program payments he could receive. In \n     fact, Mr. Dorr specifically stated in a conversation with his \n     brother that he had set up the arrangements to ``avoid a \n     50,000-dollar payment limitation'' to his own farm \n     corporation. The misrepresentations, made by Mr. Dorr on \n     behalf of the trusts, were a necessary part of his plan to \n     evade payment limitations. When USDA discovered the \n     misrepresentations, it required the trusts to make \n     restitution to the federal government of nearly $34,000. In \n     addition, the evidence showed that USDA had paid out over \n     $70,000 in earlier years in the same manner and under the \n     same arrangements that USDA had found improper and which led \n     to the required $34,000 payment. USDA failed to investigate \n     these payments, but they raised\n\n[[Page S14982]]\n\n     additional doubts about Mr. Dorr's dealings with USDA, \n     including those through other parts of his large and complex \n     farming operations.\n       The Agriculture Committee has a responsibility to \n     investigate these matters as part of its examination of the \n     fitness of this nominee to serve. In the previous Congress, \n     the Committee sought unravel the complicated web of Mr. \n     Dorr's financial dealings with USDA. A hearing was held in \n     February of 2002, but it raised more questions than it \n     answered, including disturbing new issues about Mr. Dorr's \n     truthfulness and veracity in sworn testimony to the \n     Committee. The nominee and the administration rebuffed \n     subsequent efforts by the Committee to obtain information \n     that would have addressed these very serious questions \n     pertaining directly to Mr. Dorr's honesty and integrity. \n     Despite these unresolved problems, the nominee received a \n     recess appointment in August of 2002.\n       Mr. Dorr was renominated for the position early this year. \n     Despite repeated requests, the current Chairman of the \n     Agriculture Committee has refused to hold a hearing on the \n     serious issues involving Mr. Dorr's nomination, even though \n     this is a new Congress with many new members of the \n     Agriculture Committee, it is a new nomination and there are \n     substantial concerns about Mr. Dorr's performance in his \n     recess appointment. The nominee and the administration \n     continue to stonewall reasonable efforts and requests \n     intended to resolve the very serious unanswered issues about \n     Mr. Dorr's fitness as a nominee for high federal office.\n       Indeed, during the June 18 Committee business meeting at \n     which Mr. Dorr's nomination was reported, the Chairman would \n     not even yield to allow the minority to debate the nomination \n     or offer a motion for a hearing--contrary to normal practice \n     and the Chairman's previous commitment on the record that the \n     minority would be allowed to debate the nomination. A request \n     for as little as three minutes to speak was denied.\n       Under the circumstances, we are opposed to any action on \n     the Senate floor pertaining to the nomination of Mr. Dorr \n     until such time as 1) the nominee furnishes requested \n     information that would clear up serious questions about his \n     honesty and integrity in financial dealings with USDA and his \n     truthfulness and veracity in sworn testimony to a Senate \n     Committee and 2) a hearing under oath is held on Mr. Dorr's \n     nomination according to Committee rules and normal practice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: At the request of members of the \n     Congressional Black Caucus, I am providing you with a copy of \n     a letter which outlines the reservations many of us have \n     regarding the nomination of Thomas Dorr for the \n     Undersecretary of Rural Development at United States \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       Please find the enclosed letter for your information. If \n     additional information is required, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Bennie G. Thompson,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: We are writing today to register our \n     deep concern regarding the proposed nomination of Tom Dorr \n     for the Undersecretary of Rural Development at the US \n     Department of Agriculture. Recent developments have cast \n     doubt upon the Mr. Dorr's ability to serve all American \n     farmers in a way that is sensitive to their needs and \n     struggles.\n       In particular, we are disturbed by recent remarks \n     attributed to Mr. Dorr regarding ethnic diversity and \n     economic development. On May 10, the DesMoines Register \n     quoted Mr. Dorr as saying the following:\n       ``This is not at all the correct environment to say this, \n     but I think you ought to perhaps go out and look at what you \n     perceive the three most successful rural economic \n     environments in this state . . . you'll notice when you get \n     to looking at them that they're not particularly diverse, at \n     least not ethnically diverse. . . . There's something there \n     obviously that has enabled them to succeed very well.''\n       Given the past record of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture on matters of ethnic diversity and civil rights, \n     we are shocked to learn that the proposed nominee would \n     express the belief that ethnic diversity is an impediment to \n     economic growth. Mr. Dorr's nomination for a position that \n     would require him to work in counties with extensive ethnic \n     diversity makes it difficult for us to understand, much less \n     reconcile ourselves to, such seemingly insensitive \n     statements.\n       The Congressional Black Caucus has long worked to \n     ameliorate USDA's historic bias against minority farmers and \n     to improve the capacity of USDA to work with minority and \n     economically disadvantaged farmers. Given the ongoing efforts \n     that many members of this caucus have made in this regard, it \n     is possible, even likely, that to confirm Mr. Dorr as the \n     Undersecretary for Rural Development without a deeper \n     investigation into his sentiments regarding ethnic diversity \n     would send the message that the Administration lacks an \n     adequate commitment to civil rights and minority farmers.\n       Additionally, we have reservations about reports that Mr. \n     Dorr has proposed that the future of American farming lies in \n     mega-farms of 225,000 acres. As the American agricultural \n     sector becomes increasingly concentrated and mechanized, \n     small and medium size farms are already finding it difficult \n     to compete with larger and more powerful agricultural \n     operations and interests. In recent decades small farmers, \n     especially minority farmers, have slowly disappeared as our \n     agricultural system has increasingly become dependent upon a \n     small number of large farms.\n       As large farms have gained marketshare, there has been no \n     commensurate improvement in the fortunes of small and medium \n     farmers. If they are able to stay in business at all, many of \n     these farmers are forced to fight for an ever dwindling share \n     of the agricultural market. In addition, those who are unable \n     to maintain the economic viability of their farms find \n     themselves faced with limited off-farm employment and \n     educational opportunities.\n       Rather than accepting the demise of the small farmer as a \n     historical inevitability, it is critical that the Department \n     of Agriculture seek ways in which to harness new and creative \n     means by which to ensure that farms of all sizes can \n     flourish. The future of rural America need not reside only in \n     ever increasing economies of scale and market concentration. \n     Rural America faces struggles that go considerably beyond the \n     fields. Rather, it faces issues of crumbling infrastructure, \n     lack of planning capacity, outmigration of youth, and a \n     growing digital divide between urban and rural communities. \n     Any policy for rural America which does not recognize the \n     interplay of these many complex and intersecting concerns \n     does rural America injustice.\n       As you move forward with the consideration of the \n     nomination of Mr. Dorr for the Undersecretary of Rural \n     Development at USDA, we urge you to carefully consider the \n     concerns that we have enumerated here. In particular, we urge \n     you to delay confirmation until you have an adequate \n     satisfaction that Mr. Dorr has the requisite expertise and \n     sensitivity to enable him to address the broad range of needs \n     and issues facing rural America, particularly issues relating \n     to ethnic diversity and small farms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   The Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am pleased to yield 12 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have heard about the past and Tom \nDorr. I will speak about the present and the future because all the \nstatements about the past are not in any way reflected in the year and \na half that he served as Acting Under Secretary.\n  Madam President, I rise this morning to support the confirmation of \nUnder Secretary Thomas Dorr.\n  I know this man. I know what he stands for. I know what he has \naccomplished. Tom Dorr is a fourth generation ``dirt under the \nfingernails'' family farmer. He is a man of vision, a successful farmer \nand business operator. He possesses outstanding financial and business \nexpertise. He is a community leader and person of character. He is one \nof the best, in my opinion, thinkers on rural policy issues.\n  I respect what he has done with USDA's Rural Development mission \narea. USDA's Rural Development is one of the most vital mission areas \nin the U.S. Government for rural areas of this country, like those of \nmy hone State of Iowa.\n  Rural America is home to 65 million Americans. USDA's Rural \nDevelopment implements programs that aid in the development of the \ninfrastructure, and provide assistance for housing and business \ndevelopment opportunities essential to rural America.\n  This position requires a leader and manager with vision, foresight, \nand leadership skills. President Bush appointed such a leader over 15 \nmonths ago. President Bush wants Tom Dorr confirmed to that position in \norder that he may continue to provide him guidance.\n  Because of his recess appointment, we have a track record by which to \njudge Tom. Tom has served 15 months as the Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment. I, as have many of you,\n\n[[Page S14983]]\n\nhave heard from not only Secretary Veneman and others at USDA of Mr. \nDorr's accomplishments, but also from career staff, and groups who \noriginally had concerns. They talk about his leadership, his vision, \nhis intellect, and most importantly, his commitment to rural America. \nWhen I hear of comments like this from his peers and those who work \nwith him, I take particular note. Let me illustrate some of the results \nthat have been brought to my attention.\n  No. 1, he expedited the release of $762 million of water and \nwastewater infrastructure funds provided in the 2002 farm bill in just \n3 months.\n  No. 2, he led the effort to complete the rulemaking process in order \nthat the $1.5 billion broadband program could begin taking applications \nthis year. He believes that if Americans are to live locally and \ncompete globally, that it is as imperative to wire the country for \ntechnology access as it was to electrify it over 60 years ago.\n  No. 3, in order to facilitate the review and announcement of the $37 \nmillion in value-added development grants, he is using private-sector \nresources to expedite the process.\n  No. 4, in order to deliver the financial grants authorized through \nthe Delta Regional Authority, he helped develop and get signed a \nmemorandum of understanding between Rural Development and the Delta \nRegional Authority. This will allow Rural Development to assist in \ndelivering joint projects at no added cost to the DRA.\n  No. 5, he facilitated the development of a memorandum of \nunderstanding, signed last June by Secretaries Veneman and Martinez, \nbetween the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development that is focused on better serving housing and \ninfrastructure needs.\n  No. 6, he has developed a series of initiatives with HUD that will \nallow Rural Development to more cost effectively meet the housing needs \nof rural America. These have allowed the Department to provide greater \naccess to housing for all rural Americans, but especially minority \nrural Americans in fulfillment of the President's housing initiative.\n  No. 7, he has initiated a review of the Multi Family Housing program. \nThis includes the hiring of an outside contractor to conduct a \ncomprehensive property assessment to evaluate the physical condition, \nmarket position, and operational status of the more than 17,000 \nproperties USDA has financed, all while determining how best to meet \nthe needs of the underhoused throughout rural America.\n  No. 8, he has initiated a major outreach program to insure that USDA \nRural Development programs are more easily made available to all \nqualified individuals, communities and rural regions, and qualified \norganizations.\n  Although this is an incomplete list of his accomplishments, it is \neasy to see that Under Secretary Dorr has done a great job in the short \n15 months that he has served at Rural Development. Why folks want to \nlet him go now is beyond me.\n  I have known Thomas Dorr for many years and expected this kind of \nperformance. I have also been very impressed with his ability to \narticulate a vision for rural America, when he appeared before my \nSenate Finance Committee in August, representing President Bush's \nprograms.\n  In addition, I am not the only person that has been impressed by \nTom's work at USDA. Listen to these testimonials:\n\n       Secretary Dorr has been an invaluable resource in helping \n     us build new and complementary relationships within and \n     without USDA, the 1890's and farmers in distress.\n\n  That is a quote from Dr. Clinton Bristow, chair of the Council of \n1890 Presidents and president of Alcorn State University.\n\n       Under Secretary Dorr has been the first person in this \n     position in several years to creatively tackle the tough \n     problems facing Multi-Family Housing at USDA Rural \n     Development.\n\n  That is a quote from Dr. Clinton Jones, senior counsel, House \nFinancial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity.\n  Clearly, impartial leaders are impressed with Tom Dorr's job \nperformance.\n  Tom Dorr has worked as a dedicated public servant for many years in \nour home State. Tom Dorr served on the Iowa Board of Regents for all of \nIowa's universities. This speaks volumes about Tom's ability and \ncharacter. Tom also served as a member of the Chicago Federal Reserve \nBank Board of Directors for two complete 3-year terms, the maximum \nallowed. Tom also served as an officer and director of the Iowa and \nNational Corn Growers Associations in the beginning stages of the push \nfor ethanol and renewable energy.\n  Under Secretary Dorr has done an exemplary job at USDA. No one denies \nthis. This is no surprise to those of us that know him or have worked \nwith him in the past. The only thing that has come as a surprise, \nrelated to Tom's service, are the rumors that have been generated to \nundermine Tom.\n  Due to my great distaste for perpetuating false accusations, I have \ngreat reluctance even addressing these malicious points, but because of \nthe fact that these issues have been raised, I will quickly address \nthem.\n  The first false accusation: There is an issue with farm program \npayments to a family trust associated with Tom's farming operation. \nTom's father and uncle each established a trust in the late 1970s to \ninsure the family farming operation continued, and more importantly \nthat Tom or any of his eight siblings and his uncle's five children \nmight also farm if they wished.\n  When established, the trusts and the farm operating company were \nconsistent with the provision of the farm bill. However, with the \nchange of farm bills, there were questions raised whether the \noperations exceeded payment limitations. Rather than incur the legal \ncosts to challenge to defend their structure, which would have been \nmore costly, the family trust repaid $17,000 and changed their farming \noperations as recommended by the county FSA committee.\n  Further, and as a result of his nomination process, a nonpartisan IG \ninvestigation found that Tom nor any of his family members had done \nanything wrong. This opinion is consistent with the conclusions reached \nduring two reviews by USDA under both the Clinton and Bush \nadministrations. Tom Dorr has been cleared of any wrongdoing regarding \nfarm payments by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  Second false accusation: Tom Dorr supports big farms, not family \nfarms. I talked with Tom about this accusation because I am adamantly \nopposed to the concentration and consolidation occurring in rural \nAmerica and I wanted to hear his explanation.\n  In 1998, Tom Dorr was interviewed by the New York Times and asked to \nprovide his vision of efficient farming. With his strong understanding \nof economics, he explained his ideas for the use of new technologies to \ntake advantage of input discounts. He also spoke about the ability to \nenhance machinery and logistics savings between family farmers, and to \nimprove commodity marketing by establishing technology driven \narrangements between cooperative groups of family farmers.\n  This is certainly not a new concept. This is the principle on which \ncooperatives were based and formed. Tom felt that there were more \nopportunities for cooperative efforts that farmers could take advantage \nof, including more efficient use of expensive harvesting and processing \nequipment. That is exactly the challenge that many new generation \ncooperatives are undertaking. We should appreciate new and bold \nthinking rather than criticize those the suggest new ideas or concepts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I need maybe 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, before yielding further time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the time for debate prior to the cloture vote be \nextended by 15 minutes, to be equally divided in the usual form. This \nhas been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Finally, the third, and most egregious, false \naccusation: Tom is a racist.\n  This hurts me to even say it. From the projects listed earlier to the \ncomments I read you, it is clear that Tom has demonstrated the ability \nas well as understands the importance of working\n\n[[Page S14984]]\n\nto empower the underserved and underutilized minority communities.\n  Simply put Tom Dorr is no racist, and anyone who has worked with or \naround him knows that. The comment that has been manipulated to \ngenerate this accusation, made during a forum at Iowa State University, \nwas taken out of context.\n  I have not yet met or had any participant of this conference tell me \nthat he or she believes Tom's remarks were meant to promote a lack of \ndiversity. Quite the contrary, his actions while at USDA have served to \nshow anyone who is interested that he is insightful and extremely \nsensitive to the ongoing issues of the minority populations that are \nunderhoused, underbanked, and in general, underserved.\n  If anyone should question Tom's service at USDA, all you need do is \nvisit with former Congresswoman Eva Clayton, Dr. Clinton Bristow, Ralph \nPaige, executive director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, \nand see what they think of Tom Dorr.\n  Tom Dorr is the person for the job. His background, recommendations, \nand now his track record more than provide justification for him to be \nconfirmed as the Under Secretary for Rural Development.\n  Tom has already suffered a terrible disservice through the political \nwitch hunt to which he has been subjected. It would be outrageous if \nrural America were to be deprived of the leadership and talent that \nPresident Bush has provided for this terribly important position. Rural \nAmerica is regaining its economic, social, and cultural momentum. It \nwould be a shame to deprive it of leadership at this critical juncture.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to \nsupport the ultimate confirmation of this committed and talented \nleader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use leader time so as not to \ntake from the time that is currently allotted in the debate.\n  Let me first begin by saying how much I admire the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Iowa. I have applauded him publicly and privately \nfor weeks, if not months now, for all of his work on a number of issues \nthat I care a great deal about and find myself in the uncomfortable \nposition in this case disagreeing with him with regard to this \nnomination. But I admire him for many other reasons.\n  I also must say I am very grateful for the effort made by Senator \nHarkin over the course of the last 2 days to educate us all with regard \nto this particular nominee. The concerns he has raised are ones that I \nshare.\n\n  This is the first time, he told me last night, in I think he said 29 \nyears, where he has ever opposed a nominee from Iowa. I know he doesn't \ndo it lightly. I know he does it after a great deal of very careful \nthought about this man's qualifications.\n  Before I talk about the qualifications of Mr. Dorr, let me say we \nhave a lot of good people down at the Department of Agriculture. They \nare Republicans. They are Democrats. They are Independents. They care a \nlot about rural America. They do their best to implement the laws we \nwrite, to regulate where regulation is required.\n  I believe we ought to salute them and thank them for the job they do. \nI am always appreciative of the extraordinary task they have been \ncharged with implementing, given how little fanfare and how little \nthanks they oftentimes get. That is especially true for the FSA offices \nin every county in most of our States. So I salute them.\n  I am disappointed this matter has reached the Senate floor at all. I \nhave two concerns about Mr. Dorr. The first is the one expressed very \neloquently and powerfully last night. I think it sends all the wrong \nsignals when a person who has falsified documents can be confirmed for \none of the highest positions in the Department of Agriculture. We are \ntold he wasn't prosecuted for having falsified documents, but we also \nknow the reason he wasn't prosecuted is that the statute of limitations \nhad run out. People hadn't fully been apprised of the circumstances \nuntil it was too late. That is the fact.\n  Falsifying documents in this day and age, given all of the \nrepercussions legally and ethically in the Department of Agriculture as \nwell as throughout the entire Government, ought to be taken very \nseriously. To promote somebody who falsifies documents not only \ndestroys the credibility and the essence of our understanding of the \nrespect for the rule of law but sends a clear message to others who are \nexpected to abide by the law and the regulations of the land.\n  Falsifying documents is wrong. There can be no explanation. There can \nbe no acceptance. And there ought to be no tolerance. There certainly \nshould be no confirmation of someone who has been found in violation of \nthe regulations with regard to those documents and the regulations \nprovided by the legislation we have passed into law.\n  The second is the divisive nature of some of his views. To say that \nthose counties succeed in large measure where there is no diversity, \nwhere there is no ethnic or religious difference, sends again the wrong \nmessage about the importance of embracing diversity, of embracing the \nkind of differences we find in our country to be a strength rather than \na weakness.\n  I am not sure what he had in mind when he said it. In fact, he even \nrecognized, as he was about to say it, that maybe he shouldn't have \nsaid it. Well, he was right. But, again, whether it was a comment or \nwhether it is his philosophical approach, if we are going to discourage \ndiversity, discourage ethnicity, discourage religious tolerance, that, \ntoo, raises grave questions about the eligibility of somebody of this \nstature in the Department of Agriculture or in the Federal Government \nunder any circumstances.\n  I can't recall the last time I opposed a nominee for the Department \nof Agriculture for anything. In 25 years, I think I have supported \nvirtually every nominee, Republican and Democrat.\n\n  I come to the floor, like my colleague Senator Harkin, expressing \nregret that we have to be here at all, expressing regret that this \nnominee has reached this point, expressing regret that a nominee of the \nstature required for this position has falsified documents and used \nrhetoric that goes beyond what I consider to be the acceptable tenor of \ndebate and approach with regard to diversity and the acceptance of our \nmultiracial and multicultural society today.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in recognition that we can do \nbetter than this and that we need, at those times when we find somebody \nwho is not qualified, to simply say so. It is incumbent upon us to take \nthe responsibility to do that. That is our task this morning as we \nvote.\n  I urge those who will vote to vote no on cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes, 43 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me first of all say that while I appreciate the \ncomments of the minority leader, I don't believe it is accurate to make \nsome of the accusations in terms of destroying records. It is my \nunderstanding that the Farm Service Agencies have said that after \nexamining it, there was no intent to deceive. It was something that was \ndone in error and good faith or however you want to characterize it.\n  I don't want to see happening here what appears to be happening in a \nsimilar way to the nominee to be Administrator of the EPA. Certainly \nMike Leavitt was one of the most qualified individuals, and yet his \nnomination was strung out for days and days and weeks. It ended up at \n56 days. I hope we are not going to get so partisan that this happens \nagain in this case.\n  I believe Tom Dorr has completely resurfaced USDA Rural Development. \nAs Under Secretary, Dorr has set a clear vision for USDA Rural \nDevelopment as a venture capital firm for rural America. The agency \nonce was thought of as the lender of last resort, but the mindset has \nbeen changed to one where employees aggressively seek out investments \nto make in people and in organizations.\n  I am really pleased when I see what has happened in the State of \nOklahoma. We have never had anyone who\n\n[[Page S14985]]\n\nhas performed like Tom Dorr has performed there. All I hear from \nDemocrats and Republicans all around the State is what a truly great \njob he has done.\n  For example, 3 years ago my State had $29 million in guaranteed \nhousing loans but, thanks to Tom Dorr, last year we had $60 million. It \ndoubled, to the people who are really deserving of it, and now we have \nmore and more Oklahomans who own their own homes rather than rent them.\n  In addition, since Tom Dorr has been the Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment for the USDA, the amount of business loan programs in my \nState of Oklahoma has doubled. Both housing and loan programs have \nactually doubled in my State.\n  I would like also to go back to the people who speak to the real \npeople out there, not the politicians, not people who somehow think \nthey can have some kind of a gain if they can kill one of the \nPresident's nominees. Look at the National Corn Growers Association, \nthe board of directors stated in a letter to Senator Tom Harkin--this \nis a quote from the National Corn Growers Association; all those \nfarmers out there who grow corn belong to this:\n\n       The Department [of Agriculture] needs a leader like Tom \n     Dorr to help breathe life into an agency whose future role \n     will be to positively facilitate change in the farm economy.\n\n  The Wheat Growers Association--my State is a big wheat State, and we \nhave an interest in this. You go out and see these people. These people \nare just trying to survive right now, and yet they are just praising \nthe work of Tom Dorr.\n  The Wheat Growers said in a letter to Tom Harkin:\n\n       We encourage you to unite behind Tom Dorr as Under \n     Secretary of Rural Development. He encompasses the creativity \n     that can bring hope in stemming the exodus of people from our \n     rural countrysides because of lack of economic opportunity.\n\n  That is all we are trying to do in Oklahoma is survive. Our farmers \nare trying to survive out there.\n  This is Terry Barr from the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, \nthe co-ops--I don't know what we would have done--who said:\n\n       We understand the Senate may soon consider the nomination \n     of Thomas Dorr as Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural \n     Development. . . .\n       Rural development and related programs carried out by the \n     United States Department of Agriculture are of vital \n     importance to farmers and their cooperatives. These include \n     programs aimed at encouraging and promoting the ability of \n     farmers to join together in cooperative efforts to improve \n     their income from the marketplace.\n\n  Again, this is the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives:\n\n       Mr. Dorr, we believe, has demonstrated that he has the \n     background, experience and understanding necessary for \n     success in this important position of leadership.\n       We urge the Senate to confirm his nomination.\n\n  So you hear from all the users out there and from the farmers--those \nindividuals out there who are trying to survive.\n  Also, keep in mind one other thing. Thomas Dorr came from a small \nfarmer community. He understands how they think. I think it is critical \nthat we confirm him as soon as possible.\n   To reiterate, on March 22, 2001, President Bush announced his \nintention to nominate Tom Dorr of Marcus, IA, to serve as Under \nSecretary of Rural Development for USDA. Two and a half years later, \nhis nomination is still pending.\n   This is obstruction. Thomas Dorr is not the only nominee being \nblocked for confirmation. As chairman of the EPW Committee, I dealt \nwith this same problem--obstruction--with the nomination of Governor \nMike Leavitt to be administrator of the EPA.\n   This is about politics, not nominees. Thomas Dorr is more than \nqualified to hold the position of Under Secretary for Rural Development \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I don't think anyone has \nquestioned that the motivation for these delays was partisan \npresidential politics.\n  Apparently nominations are no longer about a nominee's qualifications \nand support, but simply about partisan politics.\n  Americans expect and want the Senate confirmation process to be \nthoughtful and thorough, but they certainly don't think it should drag \non year after year.\n   Tom Dorr has completely resurfaced USDA Rural Development. As Under \nSecretary, Dorr has set a clear vision for USDA Rural Development as \nthe venture capital firm for rural America. The agency was once thought \nof as the lender of last resort, but the mindset has been changed to \none where employees aggressively seek out investments to make in people \nand organizations that will fulfill the mission.\n   Under Secretary Dorr ran his farm and business from a small town so \nhe understands well the needs of rural America, including the need for \ntechnology to allow these communities to compete. He believes that \nbroadband is as meaningful to rural America today as rural \nelectrification was in the mid-20th century. He led the effort to \ncomplete the rulemaking process and begin accepting applications for \nthe new broadband program. Through his efforts, $1.5 billion is \navailable this year to help build rural technology infrastructure.\n   The list of improvements that increased economic opportunity and \nimproved the quality of life in rural America that were spearheaded by \nTom Dorr is endless.\n   He has tackled the very complicated and difficult problems involved \nin the Multi Family Housing Program, that, according to the one \ncongressional staffer, ``were ignored by all previous Under \nSecretaries''--he believes all rural citizens deserve safe and secure \nhousing.\n   Dorr initiated an aggressive marketing program to extend the \noutreach of USDA Rural Development programs to more deserving rural \nAmericans and qualified organizations, especially minorities.\n   In addition, he is proponent of renewable energy, which led to \nmillions of dollars in grants to develop renewable energy sources; he \nhas greatly boosted the morale of USDA Rural Development employees; has \ngreatly aided in the development of community water/wastewater \ninfrastructure--and the list goes on and on.\n   For my State of Oklahoma, the strong leadership at the top of Thomas \nDorr has resulted in an increase of millions of dollars in rural \ndevelopment.\n   For example, 3 years ago my State had $29 million in guaranteed \nhousing loans, but thanks to Tom Dorr, this last year Oklahoma had $60 \nmillion in guaranteed housing loans. That represents an increase of $31 \nmillion worth of Oklahomans that now own their homes rather than \nrenting them.\n   In addition, since Thomas Dorr has been the Under Secretary of Rural \nDevelopment of the USA, the State of Oklahoma's amount of business loan \nprograms has doubled from $15 million to $30 million.\n   Tom Dorr has gained support from a spectrum of organizations and \nindividuals: The National Corn Growers Association Board of Directors \nstated in a letter to Senator Tom Harkin: ``The Department [of \nAgriculture] needs a leader like Tom Dorr to help breathe life into an \nagency whose future role will be to positively facilitate change in the \nfarm economy.''\n   In another letter to Tom Harkin, the President of the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers stated: ``We encourage you to unite behind \nTom Dorr as Under Secretary for Rural Development. He encompasses the \ncreativity that can bring hope in stemming the exodus of people from \nour rural countryside because of lack of economic opportunity.''\n   However, surprisingly enough, Tom Harkin is one of the main reasons \nTom Dorr's application is still pending today.\n   In a letter to Senator Blanche Lincoln, the USDA Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights points out that Tom Dorr is a leader in the \nadvancement of civil rights: ``I have no vested interest in seeing \nindividuals advance in this administration who I fear will hamper the \nprogress of civil rights within the USDA. Mr. Dorr is not such an \nindividual. If confirmed, I believe that Mr. Dorr would continue to \nwork with me to advance civil rights at USDA.''\n   It is obvious that Tom Dorr is the most qualified person for the \nposition of Under Secretary of Rural Development for the USDA. He has \ncompletely turned around the USDA office of Rural Development, and has \nclearly gained praise from all sorts of individuals, agencies, and \norganizations. Do not let this man fall victim to partisan politics.\n\n[[Page S14986]]\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today in support of Tom Dorr and \nto urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  As chairman and one-time ranking member of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization, I \nhave had the opportunity to work with Tom Dorr from the time he was \nnominated in April 2001, and I have had the pleasure of working with \nhim for the past year in his capacity as Under Secretary of Rural \nDevelopment.\n  I would like to share with my distinguished colleagues some of the \ncomments that I have received from people in Idaho about Tom Dorr's \nefforts: ``He has a real passion for rural America,'' ``He has vision \nand courage,'' ``It would be a real loss if he is not confirmed,'' \n``there is confidence in his clear vision for how Rural Development can \nhelp rural America''. ``He is providing real leadership, and has the \ntrust of everyone that works here.''\n  Mr. President, Tom Dorr has what we look for in our Under \nSecretaries, vision and leadership. He is making real changes at USDA \nthat will benefit the rural citizens of my State and the country.\n  One of my priorities has been to help bring and build jobs in Idaho, \nparticularly in rural Idaho. Tom Dorr shares those priorities and is \nworking to build on USDA Rural Development's capacity as a jobs \ncreation agency.\n  He recognizes that building the infrastructure to attract and develop \nlong-term growth is vital to the well-being of the communities.\n  Many of us choose to live in rural America for its values, community, \nand character. We need to work to ensure that those who wish to live in \nrural America can. The jobs need to be there and the infrastructure \nneeds to be there. Tom Dorr recognizes that.\n  In 2001 when Tom was first nominated for this position, and in 2002 \nwhen the Senate first began to consider his nomination, I was convinced \nthat he was qualified to lead the agency.\n  Since the President appointed him during the August recess last year, \nhe has proved that he is qualified to lead the agency.\n  To those who would argue that the Senate needs more deliberation, I \nsay that the Senate has deliberated long enough.\n  Tom Dorr was first nominated in April 2001. A hearing was held in \nMarch 2002, after three previously scheduled hearings were cancelled. \nPrior to the committee reporting out his nomination, he answered \nhundreds of questions from Committee Members. In fact, the committee's \nranking member requested more than 1,000 documents or pieces of \ninformation.\n  When the committee considered his nomination this year, it reported \nhim out by a vote of 14 to 7. Did we report him out in one day, no. At \nthe confirmation hearing, the ranking member was given the opportunity \nto expound on why he opposed the nominee, and he did so until the \ncommittee no longer had a quorum.\n  Madam President, Tom Dorr has been available for questioning and \nwe've had the opportunity for oversight since his nomination in 2001 \nand his appointment in 2002.\n  Throughout this process, some have sought not to deliberate on his \nnomination, but to delay it in the hopes it might whither on the vine.\n  I ask my colleagues for an up or down vote on his nomination. He \ndeserves it. And, I believe, the country deserves his leadership.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today I am voting against ending the \ndebate on the nominations of Thomas C. Dorr to serve as the Under \nSecretary for Rural Development at the Department of Agriculture and \nalso as a member of the Commodity Credit Corporation because I believe \nit is premature for this body to be voting on the appropriateness of \nMr. Dorr to assume these positions. This is an unusual step for me, \nbut, then again, this is a very unusual situation.\n  I have long recognized that a President should generally be entitled \nto have executive branch agencies run by the people he chooses. While \nhis selections should be given considerable deference, the President's \npower of appointment is limited by the duty of the Senate to provide \n``advice and consent.'' Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have \nsupported countless nominees for Cabinet and other high-level \npositions, including many with whom I have disagreed on certain \npolicies, but I have also cast my vote against confirmation when I have \nbecome convinced that the nominee is not suitable to fill the role. In \nthis instance, I do not believe the Senate has all the facts that are \nnecessary to make an informed judgment.\n  During this confirmation process, serious questions were raised about \nmisrepresentations made by Mr. Dorr to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture regarding his farming arrangements with two family trusts \nin an effort to secure farm program payments, and the subsequent \nrestitution made to the Federal Government of nearly $34,000. Rather \nthan resolving these questions, last year's hearing on this nomination \nheld by the Senate Agriculture Committee raised additional and \ndisturbing questions, and the nominee thereafter failed to supply \ndocuments that might remove the cloud over this matter. That is why \nlast June, I joined many of my colleagues in the Senate in urging the \nmajority leader to withhold further Senate action on these nominations \nuntil the nominee furnished the requested information to clarify the \nimportant questions raised about his integrity in financial dealings \nwith USDA and his truthfulness and veracity in sworn testimony before \nthe Senate committee. I am disappointed that, rather than helping to \nsecure a resolution of these serious issues, the majority leader has \nchosen to move these nominations forward. As such, I am left with no \nrecourse other than to oppose cloture on these nominations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Thomas C. Dorr as Under Secretary for Rural Development and as a \nmember of the Commodity Credit Corporation board at the Department of \nAgriculture (USDA). The position at USDA to which Mr. Dorr has been \nnominated is highly influential in the continued development of rural \nAmerica, holding the unique responsibility of coordinating Federal \nassistance to rural areas of the Nation.\n  Many people, when they think of rural America, may think of small \ntowns, miles of rivers and streams, and perhaps farm fields. But I know \nthat rural Wisconsin is also characterized by communities in need of \nfirefighting equipment, seniors who need access to affordable \nhealthcare services, and low-income families in need of a home. The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development programs and \nservices can help individuals, families, and communities address these \nand other concerns, which is why the office of Under Secretary for \nRural Development is so important.\n  I have deep concerns regarding Mr. Dorr's comments and opinions about \nthe future of rural America, particularly in light of his nomination to \nthis important post. I disagree with Mr. Dorr's promotion of large \ncorporate farms and his vision of the future of agriculture. \nNevertheless, when it comes to confirming presidential nominees for \npositions advising the President, I will act in accordance with what I \nfeel is the proper constitutional role of the Senate. I believe that \nthe Senate should allow a President to appoint people to advise him who \nshare his philosophy and principles. My approach to judicial \nnominations, of course, is different--nominees for lifetime positions \nin the judicial branch warrant particularly close scrutiny.\n  So, although I may disagree with Mr. Dorr's views on agriculture \nissues, I am not prepared at this point to oppose Mr. Dorr's nomination \non those grounds. However, those are not the only grounds to oppose the \nnomination. I also have strong reservations about Mr. Dorr's public \ncomments on issues of race and ethnicity and I am troubled by Mr. \nDorr's apparent abuse of the Government's farm programs.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Dorr has not yet provided information to the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry that has been \nrequested of him. This information would clarify questions about his \nhonesty and integrity in financial dealings with the Department of \nAgriculture as well as in sworn testimony to the Committee. I am \nconcerned that Agriculture Committee rules and practice were apparently \nnot followed with respect to the nomination hearing of Mr. Dorr. I am \nnot alone in expressing these sentiments--I joined with forty-two of my\n\n[[Page S14987]]\n\ncolleagues, led by the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, in \nconveying these concerns to the majority leader.\n  The Senate should not be forced to vote on a nomination before we \nhave all of the information that we feel is needed to make an informed \ndecision. There may be good explanations for Mr. Dorr's testimony and \nanswers, but the Senate does not have them yet. And we should get them \nbefore we vote on the nomination. I will therefore vote no on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe President's nomination of Thomas Dorr to serve as the Under \nSecretary of Agriculture for Rural Development and to be a Member of \nthe Board of Directors of the Commodity Credit Corporation. The \nPresident appointed Mr. Dorr to the position of Under Secretary of \nAgriculture and Rural Development during Senate recess on August 9, \n2002.\n  Following the August recess of 2001, the nominations were resubmitted \nby the President, and received in the Senate on September 4, 2001.\n  The President then resubmitted the nominations to the Senate on \nSeptember 30, 2002; again the nominations were not acted upon and \nconsequently returned to the President on November 20, 2002.\n  Following the adjournment of the 107th Congress, the President once \nagain resubmitted Mr. Dorr's nominations on January 9, 2003 for \nconsideration during the 108th Congress.\n  Obviously, the President believes Mr. Dorr to be qualified for this \npost, and Mr. Dorr's record during the appointment to the position \ncertainly supports the President's confidence in him. While serving in \nthe position of Undersecretary of Agriculture for Rural Development, \nMr. Dorr has performed his duties in a way that has reflected credit on \nthe Administration of President Bush. He deserves to be confirmed.\n  Specifically, Mr. Dorr has helped expedite the release of $762 \nmillion to help reduce the backlog of community water and wastewater \ninfrastructure applications.\n  Mr. Dorr led the effort to complete the rulemaking process and begin \naccepting applications for the new program to provide broadband \nInternet access to rural communities.\n  He has utilized private sector resources to help expedite the review \nand announcement of $37 million in Value Added Agriculture Product \nMarket Development Grants.\n  Mr. Dorr has been instrumental in facilitating the pending agreement \nbetween the Small Business Administration and USDA Rural Development on \nthe new Rural Business Investment Program created in the Farm Bill.\n  Under his stewardship, more rural families own homes where they live \nin safety and comfort: Mr. Dorr has worked with Congress to convert $11 \nmillion in carryover housing funds to support $900 million in new \nfunding for guaranteed loans--creating an additional 12,000 \nhomeownership opportunities.\n  He worked to help the families of economically distressed areas in \nthe Southwest colonias through a formal agreement with the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development.\n  He has insisted on fairness to improve accountability and performance \non minority homeownership loans by working with the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Authority and \nVeterans Affairs in development of consolidated minority tracking \nreports.\n  Madam President, the committee has received numerous letters \nsupporting this nomination.\n  For the benefit of Senators and for their information, I am going to \npoint out a few things contained in the letters that I think are \nparticularly persuasive and support this nomination.\n  This is a letter that is signed by 14 different agricultural \ncommodity groups and organizations, and by the American Farm Bureau \nFederation:\n\n       Mr. Dorr has proven that he has the skill and experience \n     necessary to lead USDA's rural development efforts.\n\n  Another letter, written by a constituent from my State, a copy of \nwhich was given to all members of our committee, written by Dr. Clinton \nBristow, the president of Alcorn State University at Lorman, MS. He \nwrote in his capacity as chair of the Council of 1890 Presidents and \nChancellors. In his letter supporting this nomination he said:\n\n       Secretary Dorr has been an invaluable resource in helping \n     us build new and complementary relationships within and \n     without USDA. . . .\n       Most recently, he represented the department at a town hall \n     meeting for small farmers voices, sponsored by the council \n     and held at Alcorn State University. More than 200 farmers \n     from the delta area attended the forum--unabashed and \n     relentless farmers who represent the bottom of America's \n     agricultural industry.\n       In spite of the challenge, Tom was superlative in guiding \n     the farmers through the economic and political realities of \n     the global marketplace and helping them to understand the \n     makeup of programs and the allocation of resources at USDA. \n     He has set stage for sustained dialog between USDA, the \n     1890s, and farmers in distress. This represents only a \n     snapshot of the many challenges that Under Secretary Dorr has \n     helped us negotiate.\n\n  Madam President, another letter from William C. Hunter, senior vice \npresident and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nChicago. He says:\n\n       As an African American, I can honestly say that I have \n     never felt uncomfortable in Tom's presence.

Here is another from the Webster Agricultural Letter, which is an \ninteresting discussion of the political confrontation that is reflected \nin this nomination in opposition to it. Also, here is a copy of the \nNational Review Online, with a description of the controversy over the \nDorr nomination but coming down in support of his confirmation.\n  I ask unanimous consent copies of these editorials and newsletters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the DesMoinesRegister.com, June 3, 2002]\n\n                   Editorial: Make a Decision on Dorr\n\n       Every shred of evidence of alleged wrongdoing by USDA \n     nominee Thomas Dorr has been pursued. To the point of tedium. \n     It is time to move on: Senator Tom Harkin should quit holding \n     Dorr hostage.\n       Dorr is a Marcus, Ia., farmer and agribusinessman who was \n     appointed months ago by President Bush to be U.S. \n     undersecretary of agriculture for rural development. Harkin \n     is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which must \n     decide whether to send Dorr's nomination to the full Senate \n     for a confirmation vote.\n       Questions have been raised about Dorr's fitness for the \n     job. Some of those questions are matters of philosophy that, \n     like it or not, should be of no concern to the Senate. On \n     appointments within the executive branch, the president \n     should have wide discretion in staffing his administration \n     with people of his choosing, even if that means confirming \n     individuals some senators find distasteful.\n       Some questions--namely whether Dorr broke any rules when \n     receiving federal farm payments--are relevant, but they seem \n     to have been answered now that the USDA's inspector general \n     has closed the books on its inquiry after finding \n     insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.\n       Harkin may have good reason to persist in raising questions \n     about whether Dorr properly followed the rules in receiving \n     crop-subsidy payments: Just because there's insufficient \n     evidence to warrant a criminal investigation does not mean \n     Dorr's skirts are clean. Harkin should not, however, use that\n\n[[Page S14988]]\n\n     as an excuse to hold the Dorr nomination in limbo.\n       That is what the Republicans did to Clinton administration \n     nominees for everything from surgeon general to the federal \n     courts. It was wrong when the Republicans ran the Senate; and \n     it is wrong now that the Democrats are in control.\n       Harkin owes it to Dorr and to the White House to move \n     forward. Give Dorr another opportunity at another hearing to \n     answer any and all questions, and then vote his confirmation \n     up or down.\n       By delaying so long, Harkin gives credence to critics who \n     say he's only playing political games.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Sioux City Journal, July 10, 2001]\n\n                Informed Iowans should support Tom Dorr\n\n                           (By Donald Etler)\n\n       Algona, Iowa.--A recent Associated Press article described \n     a petition fronted by the National Farm Action Campaign, \n     NFAC, and signed by representatives of 161 organizations \n     calling for the rejection of Iowa businessman and farmer Tom \n     Dorr in consideration of his nomination for USDA \n     undersecretary for rural development. It is unfortunate that \n     Dorr cannot respond in deference to the request of the White \n     House. But, does anyone really believe the claim of the NFAC \n     that Tom Dorr advocates one farmer for every 350 square miles \n     or that he thinks 500 of every 501 farmers should go out of \n     business?\n       I have dealt with Tom Dorr on both professional and \n     personal levels. This man does not deserve the distorted, \n     severe attacks upon his beliefs and character. I believe I \n     know Tom well enough to be correct in believing that his work \n     ethic, business sense, tenacity and moral foundation would \n     serve rural America, and rural Iowa, quite well.\n       Those who choose to distort Dorr's words regarding farm \n     program policies must be doing so solely for political \n     reasons because as undersecretary for rural development Mr. \n     Dorr's responsibilities would not be in areas that deal with \n     USDA commodity programs or environmental regulations which \n     most directly impact independent farmers. Political reasons \n     probably explain why a website has been set up where with the \n     click of a button a letter to the editor opposing Dorr can be \n     downloaded. Seeing this reminds me of the old West lynch \n     mobs.\n       The undersecretary for rural development is primarily \n     responsible for policies affecting infrastructure and \n     commerce in rural communities. Ninety percent of rural \n     America's jobs are found in those communities and not on the \n     farms. Most of our farmers now have off-farm jobs. As our \n     rural communities struggle to survive with an aging and \n     shrinking population, with the exit of businesses to larger \n     regional communities, and with the retirement of up to 25 \n     percent of surrounding cropland under existing farm programs, \n     rural communities should be demanding that federal rural \n     development policies to be retooled and redirected to reverse \n     the long decline. In opposing Dorr, the NFAC empowers \n     entrenched bureaucrats to continue failed programs to our \n     continued harm.\n       Do the members of those groups that oppose Dorr's \n     nomination truly want to hold the status quo which, in the \n     case of the USDA rural public policy, has been ineffectual if \n     not harmful for rural communities across the country? I \n     believe Tom Dorr will tackle failed and misguided rural \n     development programs from a new perspective. He will demand \n     accountability of the entrenched bureaucracy and he will \n     bring the new ideas and vision that are so sorely needed.\n       In the interests of the multitude of Iowa's struggling \n     rural communities, informed Iowans would be well served to \n     support the nomination of one of our own.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From World Perspectives, Inc., Mar. 6, 2002]\n\n                   Apollo 13 and the Tom Dorr Hearing\n\n                          (By Emily S. French)\n\n       If you're Tom Dorr, the nominee for Undersecretary for \n     Rural Development at USDA, you know you're having a bad day \n     when the Senate Ag Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA) says, \n     ``to quote Apollo 13--Houston we've got a problem,'' just \n     prior to a two hour recess during your confirmation hearing. \n     That is what happened today.\n       Already a controversial federal nominee, Dorr came under \n     additional fire as the Des Moines Register ran an article \n     today, citing a recorded phone conversation in which Dorr \n     allegedly said that government officials might ``raise hell'' \n     if they audited his participation in federal farm subsidy \n     programs. The tape was sent anonymously to the Des Moines \n     Register last month; five people familiar with Dorr, \n     according to the paper, identified his voice in what was \n     represented as a 1995 phone conversation. The Register made \n     no comments on how or why the tape was made. Surprisingly, no \n     one defending Dorr referred to the . . .\n       The Controversy: The Iowa Farm Service Agency (FSA) \n     reviewed one of the many trusts belonging to various members \n     of the Dorr clan during 1995. During the taped conversations \n     between, allegedly, Tom Dorr and his brother Paul Dorr, Tom \n     Dorr said that the two trusts--the Belva Dorr Trust and the \n     Harold Dorr Trust--are operated with the ASCS (now known as \n     the FSA), to ``quite frankly avoid'' minimum payment \n     limitations.\n       The Ruling: The state FSA office concluded that the farm \n     wasn't properly structured within the family trust. But that \n     there was no scheme on the part of the family to defraud the \n     government. A repayment of $17,000 was ordered and made.\n       The Politics: The division of corporations, family farms or \n     individuals who receive payments from the federal government \n     under the Farm Bill program are allowed. There is nothing \n     illegal with setting up a corporation, a limited partnership, \n     a trust or an individual to receive payments from the federal \n     government under this program and registering these entities \n     with the FSA. The 1996 Farm Bill allows this under its \n     ``three entity rule'' whereby one person is eligible for \n     payments on up to three farm entities. The payment limit on \n     the number 2 and 3 entities is half the amount on the first \n     farm. It looks like this is what Dorr was doing, which is not \n     surprising for any individual or company to look at all \n     opportunities to legally maximize their operation's \n     profitability, would be against any economic rationale.\n       The Senate farm bill changes this rule. In fact, Dorr \n     supporter, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) is the author of \n     the provision that tightens down payment caps. But it seems \n     that Chairman Harkin, who didn't have such a provision in the \n     bill he brought to the Senate floor, is ready to try Dorr for \n     what he did in 1995, under rules that aren't even in effect \n     yet in 2002.\n       This controversy has largely replaced the flap over \n     statements Dorr made about ethnic and religious diversity in \n     Iowa. In case clients missed that one--Dorr pointed out that \n     there wasn't a lot of diversity in Iowa, and specifically in \n     a couple counties that were growing economically anyway. And \n     he did so in response to a question, stating fact. But Dorr's \n     opponents have used this as a means of labeling him racist--\n     an effective and particularly damning charge that is hard to \n     shake. It seems, however, that payment limits, racial \n     insensitivities, etc. are just side issues to the real reason \n     why so many people in ag and farm policy so stridently oppose \n     Dorr. He's a guy who openly talks about agriculture as a \n     business that needs to be shaken up, revitalized, \n     restructured, in order to re-capture its place in the U.S. \n     and world economy.\n       WPI Analysis: This analysis is perhaps a bit more personal \n     than usual, but it goes to a broader point about the economic \n     future of agriculture. I will start by stating that until \n     this morning, I had never met Tom Dorr (though several of my \n     colleagues at WPI do know him). I knew of the controversy \n     surrounding his appointment, but had not heard Mr. Dorr speak \n     for himself. Instead, I had relied on translation of what his \n     foes or friends say he said. Moreover, I should state that I \n     grew up on a farm in Northern Idaho. There were 12 people in \n     my high school class. I went on to attend a land-grant \n     university. I am a product of rural America, a fact that \n     defines me as a human being. I understand all the emotions of \n     how ``special'' rural America and the ag economy are. But \n     while I am extremely passionate about production \n     agriculture--and the way of life that accompanies it--I chose \n     to leave farming as a career. And, subsequently, I left rural \n     America for better opportunities. I didn't want my future to \n     be based on a farming operation that made a 5-6 percent \n     return of investment in a ``good'' year. Tom Dorr is a guy \n     who spent most of his career on the farm trying to wring out \n     better returns and did a good job of it. Now he wants to come \n     to Washington and take a job to try to change, for the \n     better, economic opportunities in rural America.\n       After listening to comments from various Senators on the \n     Senate Ag Committee, I can only shake my head in finally \n     realizing why the farm bill has an additional $73 billion \n     over 10 years in payments of one kind or another. I would \n     challenge those ``decision makers'' over the idea that \n     infusing cash and protecting the small family farm is somehow \n     saving rural America or promoting rural development. It would \n     seem all that it is doing is making more people reliant on \n     the government and, in fact, rather than promoting \n     development that spending probably hinders progress. All that \n     federal spending buys more of is the status quo; there is no \n     need to change, diversity or become more efficient.\n       It's clear to me after hearing him today, Tom Dorr feels \n     the same way--that policies need to be changed. That--not any \n     alleged payment scandal or racial insensitivities--is why so \n     many policy makers oppose him, including one of his own home \n     state Senators, Chairman Harkin. When asked by Harkin to \n     clarify his ideas, Mr. Dorr summarized technology as the one \n     thing that would give farmers the ability to access world \n     markets, access information and, as a result, expand farm \n     gate margins. That doesn't sound controversial. If a producer \n     were able to expand margins and become more efficient, \n     perhaps there would be less reliance on the government for \n     bloated farm bill budgets? It's only controversial if you are \n     used to being the ones that get credit doe providing those \n     budgets.\n       If the USDA and the Bush Administration wants a person that \n     understands rural development and understands the way of life \n     in rural America, then it not be a person that has `dirt \n     under their fingers' as Senator Lugar said numerous times \n     during the hearing this morning. Tom Dorr is such a person. \n     His vision for farming, is one based on basic economics. \n     Perhaps it is a little Darwinistic ``survival of the \n     fittest'' approach, but the real irony is, as Undersecretary \n     for Rural Development he wouldn't be in charge of farm \n     programs or policy. No matter, there are still many Senators \n     who think his views\n\n[[Page S14989]]\n\n     on farm policy disqualify him from having a job in \n     Washington.\n       In closing, it is with amazement and frustration that I \n     note: only Senator Thomas of Wyoming asked Mr. Dorr about his \n     vision for rural development. And this was after almost two \n     and half hours of testimony and questions. A sad state of \n     affairs indeed as Washington, USDA, and rural development \n     needs more ``out of the box'' thinkers whom challenge the \n     status quo.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Webster Agricultural Letter, June 15, 2001]\n\n       Dear Subscriber:\n       Killing the messenger?

Only three times in three decades have we seen even \n     minimal pressure to block a nominee. Only one succeeded: the \n     late Kathleen Lawrence asked her nomination by withdrawn in \n     the face of bipartisan an opposition (see The Agricultural \n     Credit Letter, 3/20/87 P6). Family farm advocates failed to \n     stop Bank of American executive Robert W. Long from becoming \n     assistant secretary for research in 1973. A farm women's \n     group persuaded only a minority of Senate Agriculture \n     Committee remembers to oppose Carol Tucker Foreman as \n     assistant secretary for food and consumer services in 1977.\n       But those are the exceptions. By and large, senators \n     believe presidents are entitled to their choices, absent \n     overriding scandal or ideological aberration. Neither of \n     those factors applies in the matter instant, the nomination \n     of Iowa farmer Thomas C. Dorr to be under secretary of \n     agriculture for rural development. Trouble for Dorr arises \n     from two directions: family farm advocates who challenge his \n     vision of agriculture and minority groups who feel his \n     remarks about diversity raise questions about his commitment \n     to protecting civil rights.\n       ``The level and intensity of opposition to Dorr is \n     unprecedented, testimony to today's issue-intensity politics \n     and the near-instant organizing proficiency of interest \n     groups. Opponents claim more than 160 organizations have \n     joined the campaign. Most appear to have little more than a \n     letterhead and some Willie Nelson money but some have real \n     members or deep foundation pockets. Among those: American \n     Corn Growers Association, Environmental Working Group, \n     Federalism of Southern Cooperatives, Institute for \n     Agriculture and Trade Policy and National Farmers \n     Organization.''\n       The critics engage in political hyperbole, reading too much \n     into Dorr's impolitic style of provocative comment. A more \n     balanced appraisal sees him merely stating the obvious--even \n     foresight--in describing the industrialization of agriculture \n     or in asking why three Iowa counties with little ethnic and \n     religious diversity succeeded with economic development. \n     Assuming he can take the heat and Secretary of Agriculture \n     Ann M. Veneman and the White House stand fast (so far no \n     evidence to the contrary) Dorr should make a persuasive case \n     at a conformation hearing. He might adapt a line from \n     Purdue's Mike Boehlje: ``I'm not saying I like what I'm \n     saying: I'm saying `this is'.'' Scheduling a hearing depends \n     on when the Senate agrees on rules to organize committees. \n     Whether he's confirmed will test whether the political clout \n     of his critics equals their formidable skill at using the \n     news media.\n       Despite higher payments and marketing loan gains under the \n     Senate bill in the first two years, the House version would \n     favor the major program crops--by an average of $206 million \n     a year over five years or $799 million a year over a decade. \n     Soybeans would gain more under the Senate bill while corn, \n     wheat, cotton and rice would gain more under the House.\n       ``FAPRI estimates the Senate bill would result in slightly \n     more acreage planted to major crops than the House bill, with \n     the largest increases for wheat and feed grains. The Senate's \n     payment limitations could have proportionally larger effects \n     on cotton and rice producers than on producers of other \n     crops. Senate dairy provisions would mean slightly higher \n     average returns (14 cents per cwt.) to milk producers in \n     2002-06 than the House, with a greater boost in returns to \n     farmers in the Northeast than in the rest of the country.''\n       FAPRI calculates a chance of about one in three that either \n     would cause the United States to exceed World Trade \n     Organization limits on amber box subsidies but the \n     probability would decline in later years. Federal spending on \n     commodity and conservation programs over the next 10 years \n     would increase by $59.8 billion for the House bill and by \n     $63.5 billion for the Senate bill. The Senate bill would \n     result in higher government costs in 2002 and 2003 while the \n     House bill would mean more spending in seven of the next \n     eight years.\n\n  Killing the Messenger? Visionary's Foes Hope To Extinguish a Vision\n\n       After persistent, mostly hostile questioning in a Senate \n     Agriculture Committee hearing Wednesday, prospects for \n     confirmation of Iowa farmer Thomas C. Dorr as under secretary \n     of agriculture for rural development nominee are up in the \n     air. But committee approval may not be as doomed as some \n     think--USDA and White House lobbyists need to convince only \n     one Democrat to join what likely will be 10 solid Republican \n     votes to move the nomination to the floor, where a single \n     opponent could, using a Senate prerogative, delay a vote \n     indefinitely.\n       Given the first opportunity since his nomination last April \n     to rebut allegations, Dorr clearly won the day on the merits. \n     But he did not appear to convince Democrats who disagree with \n     both his political philosophy and his clear vision of what is \n     happening in agriculture. He was able to put to rest \n     allegations that he advocated large-scale agriculture, \n     opposed ethnic and religious diversity and was antagonistic \n     to ``sustainable'' and organic agriculture and the \n     agricultural extension. He also satisfied any impartial \n     observer that he did not improperly farm the farm program, \n     noting he repaid USDA $17,000 in program payments in the \n     early 1990s--the result of a difference of opinion \n     interpreting rules governing participation.\n       ``To Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the hearing had \n     earmarks of a `political lynching' with the `opposition \n     fomented from inside the beltway here in Washington, D.C.' \n     Opposing witnesses appeared to make little headway with \n     allegations he was a cheerleader for industrial-scale \n     agriculture and antagonistic to racial and religious \n     diversity. But skeptical Democrats were more receptive to \n     recent revelations of his participation in farm programs and \n     his philosophy about the federal rural development programs \n     he would administer. To Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Dorr's \n     philosophy appeared `antithetical to rural America.' ''\n       Dorr's difficulty stems from an uncanny perception of the \n     forces shaping agriculture and his willingness to describe \n     them in blunt terms--attributes rarely found in public \n     service. ``He has simply stated the obvious,'' says \n     University of Maryland agriculture dean Thomas A. Fretz, who \n     was associate dean at Iowa State when Dorr was a member of \n     the state board of regents. ``What Tom Dorr brings is `out of \n     the box' thinking that challenges bureaucratic normalcy.'' \n     Dorr's widely quoted comment that some ethnically homogeneous \n     Iowa counties were successful with economic development, \n     Fretz added, ``simply stated the reality.''\n       One of the strongest testimonials came from Varel Bailey, \n     Anita, Iowa farmer and former National Corn Growers \n     Association president who worked with Dorr in modernizing an \n     antiquated NCGA in the late 1970s. ``He is very aware of the \n     plight of rural America,'' Bailey said of Dorr. ``He has \n     lived and farmed through the economic, social and political \n     decline. The difference between Tom and most other people is \n     that he steps up and tries to help.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, June 1, 2001]\n\n                              Dorr-versity\n\n                            (By Roger Clegg)\n\n       Once upon a time, if you read the words ``diversity'' and \n     ``farming'' in the same sentence, you could be pretty sure \n     that the article would be about crop rotation.\n       Those days, of course, are long gone. See the word \n     ``diversity'' now, in any context, and you know it's going to \n     be another article about melanin content and national origin.\n       On Wednesday this week, the New York Times and Washington \n     Post both reported that the Bush administration's nominee to \n     head the Agriculture Department's rural-development programs, \n     Thomas C. Dorr, was under fire for comments that the \n     Congressional Black Caucus, NAACP, and Black Farmers \n     Association fear may show him to be anti-diversity. On \n     December 11, 1999, Dorr was videotaped at a meeting at which \n     the economic successes of three Iowa counties--populated \n     largely by descendants of Dutch Protestant and German \n     Catholic settlers--were being discussed. Said Mr. Dorr: ``And \n     you'll notice when you get to looking at them that they're \n     not particularly diverse. At least not, uh, ethnically \n     diverse. They're very diverse in their economic growth, but \n     they're very focused, uh, have been very non-diverse in their \n     ethnic background and their religious background, and there's \n     something there that has enabled them to succeed and succeed \n     very well.''\n       The quoted statement underscores, in an unintentionally \n     amusing way, that some kinds of diversity are politically \n     correct and relevant but some aren't. It is at least a little \n     odd that Dutch Protestants and German Catholics are now \n     thrown together and considered to be just a bunch of white \n     Christian dudes. Wasn't there some recent unpleasantness when \n     the Dutch and Germans were shooting at each other with guns, \n     and some less recent unpleasantness when Protestants and \n     Catholics in Europe were shooting at each other with bows and \n     arrows? No matter: Now they're all just ``white,'' unless \n     they're lesbians--no more diverse than those other white \n     guys, Israelis and Palestinians.\n       Likewise, Americans with ancestors from Cuba, Mexico, \n     Puerto Rico, and Brazil may have absolutely nothing in common \n     when it comes to income, religion, language, politics, or \n     culture, but they're all ``Hispanic'' because those ancestors \n     come from countries that centuries ago were settled--probably \n     a politically incorrect concept--by people who came from \n     somewhere on the Iberian peninsula. Makes them all the same. \n     Ditto for\n\n[[Page S14990]]\n\n     Filipinos, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, and Pakistanis--they \n     may have hated each other for centuries, but in this country, \n     by God, they're all ``Asians and Pacific Islanders'' as far \n     as government bureaucracies, university admission officials, \n     and the civil-rights establishment are concerned.\n       The Bush administration has announced that Mr. Dorr has its \n     ``full support,'' and an unnamed source there said that \n     Dorr's words have been taken out of context, since he had \n     simply been pointing out a demographic fact, not suggesting a \n     causal relationship. How, it is quite possible that the words \n     were taken out of context, as I'll discuss in a moment, but \n     the words quoted from the videotape seem to make it pretty \n     clear that he was in fact suggesting a causal relationship.\n       I haven't seen the videotape, but it wouldn't surprise me \n     if Mr. Dorr brought up the lack of diversity in these three \n     successful counties because, earlier in the discussion, \n     someone had been talking about how diversity was essential \n     for economic success--a common, if false, platitude these \n     days, especially in academic settings (the meeting was of the \n     Iowa State University board of regents). Oh yeah, says Dorr, \n     well looky here: Economic success and no diversity in sight. \n     So there.\n       Satisfying as it may have been, in making this observation \n     Mr. Dorr touched the third rail of American politics. \n     Elizabeth Salinas Newby, administrator of the Iowa Division \n     of Latino Affairs, has retorted: ``It sounds like he's trying \n     to say diversity isn't important for growth. It is exactly \n     diversity that has helped this state grow.''\n       So who's right: Dorr, if in fact he was saying that lack of \n     diversity can breed economic success, or Salinas Newby, who \n     says that, to the contrary, diversity helps in succeeding \n     economically? The answer is, to some extent both are right, \n     but mostly both are wrong.\n       There may be some situations where diversity can help an \n     enterprise. In a sales operation, for instance, it may make \n     it marginally more likely that companies will develop \n     insights into how best to market products to some demographic \n     groups--although, I hasten to add, it might not: Non-\n     Hispanics can learn how to market to Hispanics, and there are \n     as many differences among Hispanics as there are \n     similarities.\n       There are, conversely, probably some situations where a \n     lack of diversity can help. Having a common heritage and set \n     of values, customs, and manners can foster greater trust, \n     better morale, and closer teamwork. It also cuts down on \n     interracial and interethnic conflict, as well as other \n     potential distractions. This point should be borne in mind by \n     those who rely on pseudo-studies to support diversity through \n     affirmative action. If these studies, and the benefits from \n     diversity they purport to find, are viewed as sufficient to \n     justify racial and ethnic preferences favoring \n     ``underrepresented'' groups, then it follows that similar \n     studies about the costs of diversity will be sufficient to \n     justify racial and ethnic discrimination against those \n     groups.\n       But in the vast majority of economic enterprises, diversity \n     or lack of diversity is either completely irrelevant, cuts in \n     both directions, or makes only a marginal difference. Any \n     advantages or disadvantages will be completely swamped by \n     factors having nothing to do with skin color or ancestry, \n     like talent, intelligence, education, and willingness to work \n     hard.\n       Whether one succeeds or fails as a farmer in Iowa will be \n     influenced much more by the weather than the color of one's \n     neighbor. What one learns and achieves, as a student at Iowa \n     State will hinge on one's talent and teachers, not the \n     distant ancestry of the other kids in the lecture hall. But \n     no matter how the debate over Mr. Dorr's nomination plays \n     out, one doubts that anyone involved will fail to genuflect \n     before the altar of diversity.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I salute my colleague, Senator Harkin, \nfor his outstanding principles and his considerable fortitude. This is \nnot a pleasant task, and I know it is one that has been very difficult \nfor my friend and colleague, my neighbor to the south, who at the time \nof this coming forward was the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Contrary to what some are perhaps alluding to, and what others \nobserving this may suspect, this is not planned or contrived on \nanybody's part. In fact, it was the day of the Senate Agriculture \nconfirmation hearing last year, Senator Harkin chairing--and I served \nas a member--the very day of the hearing, the largest circulation paper \nin Iowa, highly respected for its integrity and its veracity, ran a \nmajor investigative story about Mr. Dorr and set forth many of the \nreferences that Senator Harkin has just made, and others as well, \ndetailing and making the charge and the case that Mr. Dorr had cheated \nthe Federal farm programs; that he had misrepresented partnerships of \nwhich he was managing trustee; that he had misrepresented payments for \nwhat services they were being provided; and that he had falsified \nclaims that he had signed as the managing trustee in order to get paid \nmore public money from these Federal farm programs than he was legally \nentitled. It is not just for 1 year but for several years, not just one \nfalsification but repetitive falsifications which resulted in \ndetermined overpayments of $17,000 for 3 years for one partnership. He \nhimself testified before the committee that there were seven \npartnerships and there was a period of 7 to 8 years where these kinds \nof arrangements existed--those records, as others have said, not being \navailable for examination.\n  Who brought these charges forward? Mr. Dorr's brother, also a partner \nin these family-owned trusts and farms, farming operations. He provided \na tape recording of a telephone conversation to support these \ncontentions he was making, and so we have on transcript Mr. Thomas \nDorr's own words, his own statements about these matters.\n  At the end of that process of reviewing all of the information, I \ncame to the conclusion, regretfully so, that Mr. Dorr does not meet the \nminimum requirements of honesty and integrity for the position he has \nnow been recessed appointed to and is being considered for by this body \ntoday, and that his attitudes and his ideologies concerning the rural \nAmericans he is supposed to serve make him an unacceptable choice for \nthe Rural Development Under Secretary. I say that regretfully.\n  I served as State auditor for Minnesota for 4 years. I had the \nresponsibility of upholding the public trust and oversight for the \nproper expenditure of State and local funds. I took very seriously the \nresponsibility to approach these matters objectively, knowing I was \ngoing to be accused of being partisan, unprincipled, and unfair. I \nalways tried to get the facts, set forth the facts, determine what the \nfacts were, and let the facts make the determination one way or \nanother.\n  I regret some of the assertions that this is a witch hunt or that it \nis unsubstantiated, and I refer to the Farm Service Agency's own \nletter, based on reviews both in 1996 and in 2001, which concluded that \nthe arrangement between Mr. Dorr's Pine Grove Farms and each of these \ntrusts--quoting FSA--was a crop share arrangement, not the custom \nfarming arrangement it was represented to be.\n  It was on that basis that the trusts were required to pay some \n$17,000 in farm program payments they had improperly received for those \nyears, but that did not occur until 2001 and in fact they were not even \nrepaid until the summer of 2002, after Mr. Dorr had been nominated for \nthis high office.\n  In fact, I have a letter from the USDA to Mr. Dorr dated June 5, \n2002. Mr. Dorr, in his own comments to his brother, according to the \ntranscript, admitted that what he had charged for a custom fee is not a \ncustom fee, ``it is actually crop rental income to me. That is my share \nof the income.'' Asked why he was following these procedures, he said \nit was to avoid a $50,000 payment limitation to Pine Grove Farms.\n  At another point the transcript says: Mr. Dorr, I, we filed away the \nfarm, the trust land--both the Melvin Dorr trust and the Harold Dorr \ntrust are operated with ASCS--to quite frankly avoid payment and \nlimitations. Okay?\n  Now, we can all decide what to do with these facts, but I regret, for \nthose who do not want to face them and claim they do not exist, we have \na standard for this high office. Farmers in Minnesota, as do other \nfarmers in this country, apply to this office for program funding. They \ndeserve someone who can administer the programs faithfully because they \nhave practiced them honestly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes on the minority side and 5 \nminutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself about 4 minutes right \nnow.\n  There have been some statements made regarding the fact that the \nOffice\n\n[[Page S14991]]\n\nof Inspector General has somehow exonerated Mr. Dorr; that it found no \nwrongdoing. That is just simply not the case at all. Federal law \nprovides criminal penalties for knowingly making false statements for \nthe purpose of obtaining farm program payments. The USDA Office of \nInspector General looked at all of this and they referred it. The OIG \nfound enough concerns about Mr. Dorr's dealings with the USDA Farm \nService Agency to refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Iowa.\n  As I said before, the U.S. attorney declined to proceed because the \nstatute of limitations had run. So attempts by the administration to \ncharacterize this as an exoneration are simply wrong. Procedural \ntechnicalities do not equate to no wrongdoing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Iowa dated February 2, 2002, be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                                 February 7, 2002.\n     S/A Dallas L. Hayden,\n     U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n     Great Plains Region,\n     Mission, KS.\n       Dear Mr. Hayden: After reviewing the investigative report \n     dated September 26, 2001, regarding the above subject and our \n     telephone discussion of this date, we are declining criminal \n     prosecution and any affirmative civil enforcement due to \n     statute of limitations issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles W. Larson, Sr.,\n       United States Attorney.\n     By: Judith A. Whetstine,\n       Assistant United States Attorney.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is a letter to Dallas Hayden. I do not know who \nDallas Hayden is. It says, regarding Thomas C. Dorr, Marcus, IA:\n\n       Dear Mr. Hayden: After reviewing the investigative report \n     dated September 26, 2001, regarding the above subject [that \n     is Thomas Dorr] and our telephone discussion of this date, we \n     are declining criminal prosecution and any affirmative civil \n     enforcement due to statute of limitations issues. Sincerely, \n     Charles W. Larson, Sr., United States Attorney.\n\n  So to characterize this as being an exoneration--he was exonerated \nbecause he beat the rap. He escaped the statute of limitations. That is \nhardly being exonerated.\n  Again, look at what he said with his own words, saying he had set \nthis up to get around the payment limitation. These are Mr. Dorr's own \nwords.\n  We know crop shares are misrepresented for two of the entities in \nthis complex web he has woven for himself. We do not know about the \nrest, and that is what we did not have sufficient information about--\nabout the other corporations, partnerships, and individuals involved.\n  So the committee requested additional documents. We asked for \nadditional documents and we asked the nominee additional questions. I \nbelieve these were reasonable requests pertaining to valid questions.\n  Secretary Veneman made clear in her letter back to the committee that \nneither the Department nor the nominee would cooperate with or provide \nany more information to the committee.\n  Almost without exception, nominees seek to clear up and resolve any \nquestions about the propriety of their financial dealings most \ncertainly when they involve the Federal Government. In this case, Mr. \nDorr refused to provide information and answer questions. Instead, he \nand the administration decided to stonewall and withhold critical \ninformation. That is why 44 Senators said we do not want to take action \nuntil the nominee furnishes the requested information and, two, a \nhearing under oath is held on Mr. Dorr's nomination according to \ncommittee rules and normal practice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time remains on both sides of the issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes on the majority side and 3 \nminutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have just heard that Mr. Dorr \nescaped prosecution because of the statute of limitations. That is to \nassume guilt. There were not charges filed, and I think it is wrong for \nus to assume anybody is guilty, under our system of law that a person \nis innocent until proven guilty.\n  I wish to go to some records from people who live within no more than \n25 miles of this operation and explain what authorities for the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture had to say about this, and I will enter these \ntwo letters in the Record. One is January 8, 1997, from Michael \nHouston, county executive director of the Farm Service Administration. \nIt says:\n\n       The Cherokee County Committee met on December 19, 1996, and \n     determined that M.G. Dorr Irrevocable Trust had a shares \n     violation for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995; that is the \n     Trust's total contributions to the farming operation were not \n     commensurate with the claimed shares for the crop years 1993, \n     1994 and 1995.\n       The County Committee [meaning the county committee of the \n     Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture] \n     determined a refund will be required but there was no \n     criminal intent.\n\n  Then, on February 4, 2002, we have this letter signed by the same \nMichael Houston. It is entitled ``End of Year Review, 1994-1995.''\n\n       The Cherokee County Committee reviewed the End of Year \n     Review, in particular the worksheet number 9.5, pages 1 and \n     2--attached. The County Committee determined that there was \n     no evidence of receiving benefits indirectly or directly that \n     would exceed the maximum payment limitations. The County \n     Committee also agrees that there was no evidence that the \n     Dorr's Pine Grove Farm nor Tom Dorr participated in a scheme \n     or device to evade the maximum payment limitations \n     regulations.\n       The End of Year Review for the year 2000 concluded that the \n     Dorr's Pine Grove Farms had no deficiencies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                          Farm Service Agency,\n\n                                    Cherokee, IA, January 8, 1997.\n     Paul R. Dorr,\n     Ocheyedan, IA.\n       Dear Sir: The Cherokee County Committee met on December 19, \n     1996 and determined that M. G.

Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael W. Houston,\n                                        County Executive Director,\n                                       Cherokee County FSA Office.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. But I think I want to go to the bigger picture in \nending my justification for this confirmation. That goes back to all \nthat we heard during the year 2001, when this nomination was presented \nto the Senate, going into the year 2002. There were a lot of \norganizations that testified against his nomination. There were a lot \nof accusations made. There was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of \nnewspaper articles.\n  This may not be a sound way to make a judgment about whether \nsomething is right or wrong, but if I hear from the grassroots of Iowa \nright away about a nomination, I take that much more seriously. But \nmost of the accusations against Tom Dorr came after there were articles \nin the New York Times and the Washington Post, and then interest in \nthis nomination in the Iowa newspapers came about the same time, and \nthe accusations that were put in place.\n  Then I heard something. Obviously, when you hear from your \nconstituents against a nominee you want to take that into \nconsideration. So then nothing happened to this nomination until the \nPresident has pushed it, during the\n\n[[Page S14992]]\n\nnew Congress. In the meantime, then, Secretary Dorr has been in a \nposition for well over a year. During that 1 year, none of the people \nor organizations that came out so strongly against Tom Dorr in the \nprevious Congress has raised complaints about his doing the job that he \nis doing. It tells me, then, we ought to look at on-the-job performance \nas criteria for this person moving forward with this nomination.\n  That is what I ask my colleagues to do as they consider it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And how much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just have 3 minutes left? I will try to sum up here.\n  Madam President, as I said in the beginning I don't take any pleasure \nin what we are doing this morning and the position I am taking. In my \n29 years here, 10 in the House and 19 in the Senate, I have never \nopposed an Iowan for a position in the Federal Government--under the \nReagan administration, Ford, Carter, any of them. It does not give me a \ngreat deal of pleasure to oppose this one.\n  I think the record is clear. The record is clear that this \nindividual, in his own words, said he misrepresented to the Federal \nGovernment what he was doing in order to avoid payment limitations.\n  These are not my words. These are his own words on tape. It is his \nown words when he denigrated racial diversity, ethnic diversity, \nreligious diversity, in saying counties in Iowa which were very \nsuccessful--were most successful--lacked diversity, and there is \nsomething there that caused that because they didn't have racial, \nethnic, or religious diversity. Those were his own words.\n  It was Mr. Dorr's own words when he said you drive around Iowa and \nyou see a $10,000 house and you see 10 cars, he said, which confirms my \n``10 cars-$10,000 home theory,'' denigrating poor people.\n  Sure they may have a lot of cars around because they can't afford a \nnew one. They take parts off of one or another, we know that.\n  He said the more you help the more you hinder. But then he didn't \nmind taking Government money. He didn't mind taking student loans when \nhe was a student. He didn't mind taking Federal payments for his farm. \nThat didn't seem to hinder him any.\n  Last, on the OIG, I have to say again, the Office of Inspector \nGeneral referred this to the U.S. attorney for prosecution. The U.S. \nattorney did not prosecute because the statute of limitations had run, \nthat is all. They didn't say he was guilty or not, but that is not an \nexoneration either.\n  But on the matter of racial diversity, there was some mention about \nwhether Ralph Paige supports Mr. Dorr. I previously put in the Record a \nletter opposing Mr. Dorr's nomination signed by the Federation of \nSouthern Cooperatives, which is Mr. Paige's operation.\n  One of my friends in Iowa said if you can't get along with your \nneighbors, you probably can't get along with too many other people. \nThis is in the record, in the newspaper, his neighbors talking about \nhim. Verdell Johnson a Republican, a former neighbor who lives in a \nnearby Cleghorn, said:\n\n       He would be very counter to rural development, unless you \n     would consider that rural development is one farmer in every \n     county.\n\n  Marvin Pick, whose farm is next to one of Dorr's farms said: ``Who \nare his friends? I don't think he's got any.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, until we get the documents for which we \nhave asked, and until such time as we have him under oath to answer \nquestions about these dealings, I do not think the Senate should invoke \ncloture and proceed with a vote until such time as we get that \ndocumentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the standing rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 237, the nomination of Thomas Dorr to be Under \n     Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development.\n         Bill Frist, Thad Cochran, Saxby Chambliss, Rick Santorum, \n           Norm Coleman, Craig Thomas, Jeff Sessions, Pat Roberts, \n           Kay Bailey Hutchison, George Voinovich, Chuck Grassley, \n           Wayne Allard, Michael Enzi, Elizabeth Dole, John \n           Sununu, Sam Brownback, John Warner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nis raised.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate debate on Executive \nCalendar No. 237, the nomination of Thomas C. Dorr to be Under \nSecretary of Agriculture for Rural Development shall be brought to a \nclose? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I know we are going to move on to other \nlegislation and I am sure we are going to hear from our leaders today \nabout what the rest of the week's schedule looks like and possible \nstrategy for adjournment, but I think it is critically important before \nwe adjourn we address the unemployment needs of Americans. While we in \nthis body last year adjourned without fully taking care of the \nunemployed and the unemployment benefit extension program, I think it \nis unconscionable we would do that this year.\n  While the economy may have slightly improved, we still have huge \nunemployment across the country. For us in the State of Washington, \nwith nearly 7\\1/2\\ percent unemployment, this problem continues.\n  Unemployment benefit insurance is a stimulus. For every dollar paid \nin unemployment benefits, it generates $2.15 into the economy. This is \nwhat we need to be doing to take care of Americans. We cannot continue \nto give tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans and tax incentives in \nthe Energy bill and tax breaks in a lot of other programs and not take \ncare of basic Americans who would rather have a job but do not have \nthat opportunity and are depending on those unemployment benefits to \nmake mortgage and health care payments.\n  Last year we really did leave Americans with a lump of coal in their \nstocking. Instead of saying to them we are going to make sure that as \nthe economy starts to recover we are taking care of you to give you \nthat security, we said we are going to terminate this program. Even \nthough the Senate did its homework and the House failed to pass this, \nwe left many Americans without that security.\n  Constituents of mine basically took money out of their long-term \npension savings at huge penalties just to make up for the unemployment \nbenefit program that would not continue. It is imperative before we \nadjourn we pass the Unemployment Benefit Program extension.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 1853, a bill to extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits for displaced workers; that the Senate proceed to \nits immediate consideration, the bill be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, very \nsimply put, when the Democrats were in control of the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate, and the Presidency back in 1993, the \nunemployment rate, when they terminated the program, was 6.4 percent \nnationally. It is now 6.0 percent, lower than it was in 1993 when every \nDemocrat voted to terminate the program. So with that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S14993-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14993-S14996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To include an evaluation of the impact of a final rule \npromulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n       in a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, in January 2003, the Senate approved a \nvery similar amendment by Senator Inhofe to the Fiscal Year 2003 \nconsolidated appropriations bill. That amendment initiated a study at \nthe National Academy of Sciences to look at the effects of the EPA's \nfirst set of New Source Review rules, published on December 31, 2002, \non emissions, human health, pollution control technology, and energy \nefficiency.\n  That amendment provided that the National Academy will submit an \ninterim report to Congress no later than March 3, 2004, approximately 1 \nyear after passage.\n  In September 2003, the EPA provided an oral authorization to the \nacademy to begin work. Unfortunately, the agency has still not provided \nthe contract papers necessary for the project to start. I do not know \nwhat the holdup might be.\n  However, that study, if it ever gets funded by EPA, would not review \nthe effects of the second set of NSR rules on routine equipment \nreplacement which were published on October 27, 2003. It should and, \nsince EPA has not yet funded the study and it has not started, there is \nstill plenty of time to revise the mission statement and do the work. I \nam advised by academy staff that this expansion would entail minimal \nadditional cost to EPA.\n  As I have noted, my amendment simply extends the NAS study to cover \nthe effects of the second set of rules looking at the same criteria and \nextends the interim report deadline by 10 months to January 1, 2005.\n  I am pleased the managers have agreed to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are ready to accept the amendment by \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2199.\n  The amendment (No. 2199) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nInhofe, providing for implementation plans and no preclusion of other \nprovisions relating to the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport \nCommission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2200.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

We have no further statements on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2200) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2193\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2193 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2193 is pending.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I defer to the ranking member.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, we acknowledge the very able Senator from \nMinnesota has offered an amendment for the full funding of the \nWellstone Memorial in this year's appropriation.\n  We acknowledge the vigorous advocacy of Senator Dayton for not only \nMinnesota but for his dear and beloved colleague, Senator Wellstone, of \nhappy memory. We all remember with great melancholy that terrible day \nwhen Senator Wellstone lost his life. We promised we wanted to have a \npermanent memorial to the legacy of truly an extraordinary American. I \nassure the Senator from Minnesota and all the people of Minnesota, we \nhave the will to help complete this memorial. We are a little tight on \nthe wallet.\n  I wonder if the Senator would accept essentially a 2-year funding \npromise, that we fund this this year at $500,000 and that next year we \ncomplete it with $700,000. This way it keeps the money in the pipeline \nso the memorial can be sure it can meet its bottom line, and that we \ncan continue to stay the course on creating this most appropriate \nmemorial to our beloved colleague.\n  Would the Senator accept that as a way of keeping the process moving \nforward but understanding that we are a bit tight this year? I know, \nbecause the Wellstone legacy was in championing veterans, I say to my \ncolleague from Minnesota, we have been able to add $1.3 billion, and if \nI know our colleague, that is what he would be happy about.\n  But we are not going to abandon the memorial, either. Does this sound \nlike a reasonable, rational, and acceptable approach?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator and the chairman of the subcommittee. \nI know these two leaders have been under the greatest of pressures and \nfinancial strictures. They both have performed heroically in getting \nthe money for veterans.\n  My colleague is right. My former colleague, Senator Wellstone, would \nbe happy beyond belief for the veterans of Minnesota and of America. I \nthank you for your extraordinary efforts. I salute the efforts of both \ndistinguished colleagues and I thank them for this matter.\n  I certainly meant no disrespect to anyone yesterday in my remarks. My \ndistress was primarily because I felt that again my friend Paul's \nmemory would not be well served by having the folks in Minnesota or \nanywhere else losing out. So his memory would be served, I wanted this \nmemorial, this\n\n[[Page S14995]]\n\ntribute from the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the \nPresident of the United States, and they have been very supportive and \ngracious throughout all this. We finally fulfill that.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for making this possible, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I further say to my unflagging colleague from \nMinnesota, this $500,000 will not come out of other Minnesota projects. \nOK? The memorial to Senator Wellstone is a national project of national \nimpact and, therefore, will not impact upon the Minnesota projects \nwhich are also so important and needed.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2193, As Modified\n\n  MS. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of the \nDayton amendment and ask such modification reflect the agreement we had \nhere and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the Dayton \namendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2193), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, line 21, strike ``$1,112,130,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,111,530,000''.\n       On page 125, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 418. There shall be made available $1,500,000 to the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purposes \n     of making the grant authorized under section 3 of the Paul \n     and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. We are happy to accept it. We appreciate working with the \nSenator from Minnesota, in fact both Senators from Minnesota. Senator \nDayton and Senator Coleman have both been very strong, vocal \nsupporters. We know how important it is to Minnesota. We are sorry we \nare in such tight fiscal constraints, but we want to put the money in \nthis year with the sure knowledge that we will be able to come back and \nfinish it next year, which I trust will not delay the construction of \nthe memorial.\n  Furthermore, since Senator Coleman has been active on this, on his \nbehalf, I ask that he be listed as a cosponsor of the amendment. I know \nthe people of Minnesota want to know both of their Senators are very \nvigorous champions of this great memorial to a man we will always miss.\n  I didn't always agree with him but it was always interesting, and I \nhad many, many good and pleasant exchanges with him. We worked together \non many issues. The Government Printing Office now uses soy ink because \nof our amendment. We used to tease each other, that in Minnesota he \nwould claim it as the Wellstone amendment; I would claim it as the Bond \namendment in Missouri. But neither one of us would mention the \ncosponsor in our States.\n  But we worked closely together. His is a wonderful spirit that is \nstill with us.\n  I believe there are no further comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator will be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask we adopt it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2193), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, may I have 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank, again, the chairman for his \nwonderful remarks. I know my departed colleague enjoyed his camaraderie \nwith his colleagues here as much as he enjoyed the debates and \ndisagreements. He respected all of them as individuals and the process \nas we are all engaged in as the essence of our democracy.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for those gracious \ncomments. Again, I thank the ranking member, the great Senator from \nMaryland, for her help in this matter and our successful resolution.\n  I wish to give credit to my colleague, Senator Coleman, who is \nchairing a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He \nhas been very supportive of this throughout and was instrumental \nearlier this year in getting the funding raised to its current level. I \ncannot speak for him, but I am sure he is grateful, as I am, that this \nhas been resolved.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the VA-HUD \nNASA flat-line budget. The bill has NASA funded at $15.3 billion. This \nis the same as the amount enacted in fiscal year 2003. As many of you \nmay recall, I have fought to plus up the shuttle upgrades program for \nyears. I still firmly believe that adequate supportability and safety \nupgrades budgets, coupled with supporting infrastructure, are needed to \nkeep the shuttle operating safely.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board chaired by Admiral Gehman \nconcluded that throughout the decade, the Shuttle Program has had to \nfunction within an increasingly constrained budget. Both the shuttle \nbudget and workforce have been reduced by over 40 percent during the \npast decade. The White House, Congress, and NASA leadership exerted \nconstant pressure to reduce or at least freeze operating costs. As a \nresult, there was little margin in the budget to deal with unexpected \ntechnical problems or make shuttle improvements.\n  Most people believe we will continue to fly the shuttle for the life \nof the station, but we continue to base our budgetary decisions on the \nlong-lost premise that the shuttle will be replaced in the near term.\n  The fact of the matter is that the shuttle must return to flight to \ncomplete the assembly of the International Space Station. Return to \nflight will take funds, and we don't know if NASA has enough funds to \nfully cover the cost of return to flight since the fiscal year 2004 \nsupplemental was never sent to Congress and the fiscal year 2005 budget \nremains embargoed. We do know that NASA plans to reprogram $200 million \nout of station reserves and $107 million out of the Service Life \nExtension Program, SLEP, to cover some of the fiscal year 2004 costs. \nThe requisite funds should not be robbed from other NASA accounts as \nhas been practiced in the past. Perhaps it would be better to provide \nNASA enough money to adequately fund all the NASA initiatives without \nresorting to starving one account to feed another.\n  The shuttle needs to be able to fly safely as long as this country \nneeds it. To even consider using upgrade and infrastructure funds for \nreturn to flight is unconscionable and certainly not in the long-term \nbest interest of our Nation's space program.\n  It is important that we build, maintain and fly the safest vehicle \npossible. We cannot afford to have accountants making technical \ndecisions instead of engineers and program managers if we want to \nmaintain our technology edge.\n  Reducing the NASA budget for the International Space Station program \nin fiscal year 2004 could force NASA to transfer skilled, knowledgeable \npersonnel--civil service and contractor--to other programs. A lesson \nlearned from the Columbia accident was that we must retain the \ntechnical knowledge within human space flight programs so that \npotential life-threatening problems can reliably be identified and \ncorrectly addressed.\n  The science and technology payback from the ISS is proportional to \nthe size of the crew working there. There are now two crew members \nonboard but the program plan calls for an increase up to seven when the \nshuttle is returned to flight and emergency crew return capability is \nonboard. That increase also requires that the ISS's life support \nsystems be beefed up to provide greater oxygen generation and carbon \ndioxide removal among other capabilities. The fiscal year 2004 ISS \nbudget request includes capability upgrades that are the upfront \nsystems that will allow that increase in crew size. This development is \nprogrammed to be continued in fiscal year 2005 from program budget \nreserves. If the ISS budget is reduced in fiscal year 2004 that \nreduction will come from existing reserves that would have been carried \nforward to fiscal year 2005 and paid for the continuation of these \nnecessary developments. A cut this year will most\n\n[[Page S14996]]\n\nlikely force NASA to cut back on this development and further delay \ncrew size increase and consequently the scientific return from the ISS.\n  Because a reduction in the ISS budget for fiscal year 2004 will \nlikely be taken from program reserves that is like tying one arm behind \nthe program's management. ISS is a developing human space flight \nvehicle, with inherent schedule and technical risks. Managing the \nunknowns that will occur requires appropriate flexibility in the \nmanagement's budget, budget reserves. Reducing the program budget and \nas a consequence reducing those reserves is simply dangerous.\n  We cannot allow this budget to be flat lined from fiscal year 2003. \nNASA cannot do everything it hopes to do on the cheap. The fiscal year \n2004 Presidential request should be approved and in addition $300 \nmillion added to ensure human space flight achieves its objectives \nwithout jeopardizing safety and delays to completing the ISS. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting an increase to the NASA top line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S14996-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14996-S15021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my appreciation to Chairman Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their hard work in developing the Senate fiscal year 2004 \nVA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. Considering the \nlow authorization level for this important bill, they have done an \nexcellent job maintaining priorities in Veterans health care, the \nenvironment and housing. It is vital that the full Senate-passed amount \nfor Veterans healthcare be maintained in conference so that we don't \nlose more ground in caring for those who have borne the battle. \nHowever, it is obvious that additional resources are critically needed \nfor many programs in these areas if they are to work as intended.\n  Understanding the difficult authorization level facing this \ncommittee, I would still like to express my strong support for \nadditional funding for YouthBuild in the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies conference report. Despite the repeated support of \nover 57 of our Senate colleagues for a funding level of $90 million, \nand despite the President's Budget request and House-passed level of \n$65 million, the Senate bill could only provide $60 million for a \nprogram that has proven its value and that is crucial to the lives of \nmany young people. At the same time, 1,400 YouthBuild participants who \nare building housing for homeless and low-income people have lost \naccess to AmeriCorps education awards due to the cutbacks in \nAmeriCorps.\n  Each year, YouthBuild receives strong bipartisan support because the \nprogram works. Eighty-five percent of students who complete the \nYouthBuild program either secure a job--at an average wage of more than \n$7.60 per hour--or go on to postsecondary education. The program's \nsuccess rate is especially notable since YouthBuild serves an at-risk \npopulation, 80 percent of whom have previously dropped out of high \nschool.\n  YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive program that offers at-risk \nyouth an immediately productive role rebuilding their communities. \nAlong with attending basic education classes for 50 percent of the \nprogram time, students receive job skills training in the well-paid \nconstruction field, personal counseling from respected mentors, a \nsupportive peer group with positive values, and experience in community \nleadership and civic engagement. To date, 25,000 YouthBuild students \nhave built over 10,000 units of affordable housing.\n  Despite its obvious success, YouthBuild is losing ground with more \nthan 30 sites that have closed due to lack of funds since 1996. Most of \nthe remaining programs enroll 25 percent fewer students than they did \nin 1997. In 2001, 56 experienced YouthBuild sites that qualified for \nfunding from HUD did not receive it solely due to a lack of funding. \nOnly two local programs have been funded continuously since 1994.\n  During the House-Senate conference, I hope that the Senate will yield \nto the House and provide $65 million for YouthBuild as the President \nhas requested and the House of Representatives has provided. This is \nthe least we can do. We must continue to fight to open the doors of \nopportunity and service to America's youth by supporting \nYouthBuild.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their hard work on this important legislation \nwhich provides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. \nUnfortunately, I must again speak about the unacceptably high funding \nlevels of parochial projects in this appropriations bill. Overall, this \nlegislation contains approximately $1.2 billion in unrequested spending \nand locality-specific earmarks.\n  The Committee provides $29.3 billion in discretionary funding for the \nVA. That amount is $1.3 billion more than the President's budget \nrequest and $2.8 billion above the amount in fiscal year 2003. Some \nprogress has been made to reduce the overall amount of earmarks for the \nVA in this spending bill.\n  Among other Senators who have stood on the Senate floor to fight for \nadditional funding for veterans' healthcare, I am concerned that the \nCommittee has directed critical dollars from veterans' healthcare to \nfund spending projects that have not been properly reviewed. Certain \nprovisions funded under the VA in this legislation illustrate that \nCongress still does not have its priorities in order.\n  One especially troubling expense, neither budgeted for nor requested \nby the Administration over the past twelve years, is a provision that \ndirects the VA to continue the twelve year old demonstration project \ninvolving the Clarksburg, WV, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) \nand the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Several \nyears ago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 \nmillion for the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's \nline-item veto list and since then the millions keep flowing.\n  Three years ago, the Committee `recommended' $1 million for the \ndesign of a nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV, VAMC. Two years \nago they strengthened their report language urging `the VA to \naccelerate the design of the nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV \nVAMC.'' Last year, they have urged the VA ``to include sufficient \nfunding'' for a new nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV VAMC. \nThis year, they urge the VA to include sufficient funding in the 2005 \nbudget request.\n  For St. Louis, MO, the Committee `encouraged' the VA to pursue an \ninnovative approach at a cost of $7 million for leasing parking spaces \nat the John Cochran Division of the VA Medical Center in St. Louis as a \nmeans to address a parking shortfall at the VA hospital.\n  Additionally, the Committee ``supports continuation'' at the current \nspending level of the Rural Veterans Health Care Initiative at the \nWhite River Junction, VT VAMC. The current level is an astounding $7 \nmillion.\n  While I am encouraged by the increase specifically in veterans health \ncare funding over last year's enacted levels, we must do much more. We \nmade a promise to our veterans that we would take care of their mental \nand physical health needs incurred for their many sacrifices for our \nnation. The VA currently has an incredible backlog of claims. \nCurrently, four out of every ten claims for veterans' disability \nbenefits are decided incorrectly further contributing to the backlog. \nThe millions in dollars wasted in pork barrel spending would go a long \nway to decreasing the backlog in veterans claims by funding additional \nclaims adjudicators and training.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out the provisions in this \nlegislation related to AmeriCorps. Whether it is tutoring inner-city \nyouth or fighting forest fires in the West, the lives of countless \npeople are touched by AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps' efforts to reach out to \nthose affected by natural disasters are paying serious dividends. Over \n246,000 victims of fires, floods and hurricanes have been aided by \nAmeriCorps volunteers working in conjunction with groups such as the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  Despite AmeriCorps' countless success stories, the appropriators have \nfunded AmeriCorps $93.2 million below\n\n[[Page S14997]]\n\nthe President's request, while imposing incredibly restrictive report \nlanguage that could very well fundamentally change the face of a very \nsuccessful program.\n  I was heartened when I saw that the President requested funding to \nexpand AmeriCorps to 75,000 volunteers in Fiscal Year 2004. This was an \nimportant first step on the road to large scale expansion of \nAmeriCorps. Despite the President's request, the appropriators took it \nupon themselves to ensure that we do not provide adequate funding to \nreach this ambitious level set forth by the President. The \nAppropriations Committee's counterparts in the House of Representatives \nfunded AmeriCorps with $23.4 million more than the Senate, yet only \nbelieve that they can fund 55,000 volunteers.\n  Everybody is well aware of money management problems that the \nCorporation for National Service and AmeriCorps have faced over the \nlast few years. I am confident that the change in leadership at the \ncorporation should help minimize the potential for these same problems \nto repeat themselves. However, if we do not provide the amount of money \nthe corporation says it will need to fully fund 75,000 volunteers, we \nare inviting a disastrous repeat of history. If we do not want to \nrepeat this summer's battle for supplemental funds for AmeriCorps, we \nmust fully fund AmeriCorps to the level that the Corporation feels is \nadequate, not the appropriators.\n  The last authorization for the AmeriCorps program lapsed in 1996. It \nis time to reauthorize the program. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has oversight responsibility for this program. It is \ntime that we hold hearings to reauthorize this program and markup the \nCall to Service Act, which I authored with Senator Bayh and Senator \nKennedy. If there is a need to impose restrictions on how AmeriCorps \nchooses its volunteers or how awards are given out, the HELP committee \nis where that debate needs to take place, not by the appropriators, \nwithout so much as a hearing. We have no idea what effect the \nrestrictions in this legislation will have on AmeriCorps. We have not \nbothered to run them by the Corporation. Mr. President, we are failing \nin our oversight responsibilities.\n  The overwhelming support for AmeriCorps among the grassroots groups \nis clear. Recently, an event called Voices for AmeriCorps was staged. \nThis 100-hour event featured 130 AmeriCorps Alumni and 51 Members of \nCongress. In all over 700 people, representing 47 states expressed \ntheir support for AmeriCorps. During the summer, letters were sent to \nthe President urging him to support an emergency appropriation request \nfor AmeriCorps. These letters were sent by a bipartisan group of 79 \nSenators, 228 members of the House of Representatives, 44 Governors and \n148 Mayors. The list of supporters is not restricted to elected \nofficials. 250 private sector leaders took out a full page ad in The \nNew York Times expressing support. 1100 community organizations have \nshown their support. The support for AmeriCorps is clear. It is time \nthat we acknowledge their efforts and not only fully fund the \nPresident's request but expand AmeriCorps to new levels.\n  This legislation also contains the funding for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. The programs administered by HUD help \nour nation's families purchase their homes, helps many low-income \nfamilies obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the \nhousing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our \nnation's most vulnerable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged--have \naccess to safe and affordable housing\n  Unfortunately, this bill shifts money away from many critical housing \nand community programs by bypassing the appropriate competitive process \nand inserting earmarks and set-asides for special projects that \nreceived the attention of the Appropriations Committee. This is unfair \nto the many communities and families who do not have the good fortune \nof residing in a region of the country represented by a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  In the report accompanying this bill, the Appropriators have taken \ntwo accounts, originally created as competitive grant programs to be \nadministered by HUD, and earmarked close to 100% of those accounts. \nThis bill funds the Economic Development Initiative at $140 million. \nHowever, the report lists 331 earmarks for that program, totaling over \n$136 million. Similarly, the committee funds the Neighborhood \nInitiatives program at $21 million, with report language listing 20 \nearmarks, totaling over $20 million. I am deeply concerned that once \ncompetitive programs have become nothing more than slush funds to \nfulfill influential members' parochial interests.\n  Some of the earmarks for special projects in this legislation \ninclude:\n  $1,000,000 for the Tongass Coast Aquarium in Ketchikan, AK for \nimprovements;\n  $400,000 for Love, Inc. in Fairbanks, AK for a social service \nfacility;\n  $250,000 for the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage for \nimprovements;\n  $1,000,000 for Fort Westernaire in Golden, CO for the expansion of \nthe Westernaire museum;\n  $500,000 for Miami Dade County, FL for the construction of the Miami \nDade County Performing Arts Center;\n\n  $500,000 for the Hawaii Nature Center in Wailuku, HI for the Maui \nRenovation Project;\n  $500,000 for the Field Museum in Chicago, IL;\n  $100,000 for the Iowa State Fair Board in DesMoines, IA for a \nstatewide awareness and education/exhibit.\n  $280,000 for the City of Waterloo, IA for the John Deere brownfield \nand bio-based incubator project;\n  $500,000 for the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD for building \nrenovations;\n  $187,500 for Heartland Corn Products in Winthrop, MN for construction \nof a new facility;\n  $100,000 for the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hateras, NC to \ncomplete construction;\n  $450,000 for the Johnny Appleseed Heritage Center, Inc. in Ashland \nCounty, OH for construction of facilities;\n  $200,000 for Holt Hotel in Wichita Falls, TX for continued \nrenovations to the Holt Hotel;\n  $250,000 for the Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser, WA \nfor costs associated with its construction;\n  $500,000 for Appalachian Bible College in Beckley, WV to complete its \nlibrary resource center; and\n  $1,000,000 for the Huntington Area Development Council in Huntington, \nWV for the construction of a business incubator.\n  This bill also funds the Environmental Protection Agency which \nprovides resources to help state, local and tribal communities enhance \ncapacity and infrastructure to better address their environmental \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, the most egregious provision under the EPA section is \nthe language that would significantly change states' authority under \nthe Clean Air Act in order to protect an engine manufacturer in \nMissouri. This policy change has been advanced to serve the concerns of \nBriggs and Stratton, although its September 2003 filing to the SEC \nindicated that there would not be ``a material effect on its financial \ncondition or results of operations'' and it has not been able to \nsubstantiate job loss claims. However, what has been substantiated by \nthe many public health, state environmental departments, and \nenvironmental groups opposed to this are the detrimental effects it \nwould have on air quality including ozone levels in many states, \nincluding my own. On behalf of the health of the citizens of our \nrespective states, every Senator in this chamber should oppose this \nblatant and unacceptable change in national air pollution control \npolicy which restricts every state's ability to make decisions that \nbest serve the economic and environmental interests of the state.\n  I support directing more resources to communities that are most in \nneed and facing serious public health and safety threats from \nenvironmental problems. Unfortunately, after a review of this year's \nbill for EPA programs, I do not believe that we are responding to the \nmost urgent environmental needs. Our nation's key environmental laws \nare an empty promise of protection without adequate enforcement. I am \ngratified that Senator Lautenberg's amendment was accepted to bring \nessential enforcement activities at EPA to levels comparable to last \nyear's appropriation. Enforcement actions have been declining \nsignificantly in conjunction with the Administration's enforcement \nbudget cuts. We cannot allow this trend to continue and uphold our \nresponsibility to protect human health\n\n[[Page S14998]]\n\nand our vital natural resources under existing laws.\n  The funding priorities in this bill seem to be slanted toward \nsatisfying parochial and institutional interests rather than providing \nfor robust implementation of national environmental laws. Many of the \nearmarks provided for the EPA are targeted for consortiums, \nuniversities, or foundations. There are many environmental needs in \ncommunities back in my home state of Arizona, but these communities \nwill be denied funding as long as we continue to tolerate earmarking \nthat circumvents a regular merit-review process.\n  For example, some of the earmarks include:\n  An increase of $500,000 for the painting and coating assistance \ninitiative through the University of Northern Iowa;\n  An increase of $500,000 for the Kenai River Center in Kenai, AK;\n  An increase of $1,000,000 for the University of South Alabama for the \nCenter for Estuarine Research;\n  An increase of $250,000 for the Midwest Technology Assistance Center \nat the University of Illinois;\n  An increase of $400,00 for the County of Hawaii and the Hawaii Island \nEconomic Development Board for community-based waste recycling and \nreuse system;\n  An increase of $425,000 for Southeastern Louisiana University for the \nTurtle Cove research station;\n  $1 million for the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, FL for \ncontinued construction of the Tri-County Biosolids Pelletization \nFacility;\n  $600,000 for the City of Jackson, TN for the Sandy Creek Sanitary \nSewer Overflow Project;\n  $1 million for Washoe County, NV for the North Lemmon Valley \nArtificial Recharge Project;\n  $400,000 for Wright City, MO for the construction of an elevated \nwater storage tank; and\n  $300,000 to the City of Lancaster to construct an advanced \nultrafiltration membrane water treatment system in Lancaster County, \nPA.\n  While these projects may be important, why do they rank higher than \nother environmental priorities? It is also important to note that none \nof the earmarks for the EPA were even requested by the President's \nbudget.\n  For independent agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, this bill also includes earmarks of money for locality-\nspecific projects such as:\n  An increase of $2.5 million to Marshall University in Bridgeport, WV \nfor the Hubble Telescope Project;\n  An increase of $2.5 million to the University of Mississippi for the \nEnterprise for Innovative Geospatial Solutions;\n  An increase of $3 million for the University of Alaska for weather \nand ocean research;\n  An increase of $1 million to the Delaware Aerospace Education and \nFoundation in Kent County, DE;\n  An increase of $1.5 million for the Adventure Science Center in \nNashville, TN for the Sudekum Planetarium;\n  An increase of $2 million to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX for \nequipment at the Experimental Sciences Building; and\n  An increase of $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, UT for \nthe Intermountain Region Digital Image Archive and Processing Center.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to what I consider to be a very serious \nfunding issue concerning the future of our space program.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has authorizing jurisdiction over NASA, I am \ngreatly concerned that we apparently have not learned from last \nFebruary's tragic Columbia Space Shuttle accident. What I find to be \nparticularly remarkable is that while the Appropriators were not able \nto fully fund NASA, somehow the accompanying report still earmarks \n$81.6 million worth of pork and unrequested items in NASA's Science, \nAeronautics and Exploration Account. Clearly, now more than ever, we \nshould be doing everything in our power to ensure we aren't short-\nchanging NASA safety needs.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), which was assigned \nto determine the cause of that accident and to prevent future \naccidents, describes NASA as, ``An Agency Trying To Do Too Much With \nToo Little.'' The CAIB report, released in August, describes NASA's \nbudget situation as follows:\n\n       Between 1993 and 2002, the government's discretionary \n     spending grew in purchasing power by more than 25 percent, \n     defense spending by 15 percent, and non-defense spending by \n     40 percent. NASA's budget, in comparison, showed little \n     change, going from $14.31 billion in Fiscal Year 1993 to a \n     low of $13.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2000, and increasing to \n     $14.87 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. This represented a loss \n     of 13 percent in purchasing power over the decade.\n\n  The report also raised very serious concerns regarding how earmarking \nhas restricted NASA's ability to fund its priorities:\n\n       Pressure on NASA's budget has come not only from the White \n     House, but also from the Congress. In recent years there has \n     been an increasing tendency for the Congress to add \n     ``earmarks''--congressional additions to the NASA budget \n     request that reflect targeted Members' interests. These \n     earmarks come out of already-appropriated funds, reducing the \n     amounts available for the original tasks.\n\n  Have we learned nothing from the Shuttle accident and the CAIB report \nfindings? I am afraid not, since this bill does not provide the level \nof funding for NASA and its programs requested by the President, yet \ncontinues the disturbing trend of earmarking NASA's budget in ways that \nhave nothing to do with fulfilling its mission and purpose. We must do \nbetter. As Admiral Gehman testified during one of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's hearings this year, when I asked him about the effects of \nthe $167 million that was earmarked in last year's appropriations bill \n(FY 2003), he said ``$100 million will buy a lot of safety engineers.'' \nUnfortunately, last year's earmarks did not allow for NASA to buy those \nneeded safety engineers.\n  I am not alone in my concern over the earmarks envisioned in this \nbill. The Administration's Statement of Administrative Policy goes so \nfar as to call out an earmark for an entity in Hampton, VA, to prepare \na research budget as ``one particularly troublesome earmark,'' stating \nthat ``[b]udget development is clearly the purview of the executive \nbranch and the Congress and the proposed effort is redundant and \nunnecessary.''\n  I think that it is important to know how we are spending the \ntaxpayers' hard earned money, and have included a list of these \nearmarks at the end of my statement.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss the International Space \nStation (ISS). The bill provides $200 million less than the President's \nrequest at a time when a number of serious safety concerns have been \nraised about the Space Station.\n  For example, William F. Readdy, the NASA Associate Administrator at \nthe Office of Space Flight, testified before the Commerce Committee \nthat the Space Station onboard environmental monitoring system which, \n``provides very high accuracy information on atmospheric composition \nand presence of trace elements . . . is not operating at full \ncapacity.'' He also testified that the crew health countermeasures, \nwhich include an onboard treadmill and associated resistive exercise \ndevices, were ``operating at various degrees of reduced capacity and \nneeded to be repaired, upgraded or replaced.''\n  Recent articles in the Washington Post paint an even more disturbing \npicture. An October 23, 2003, article describes:\n\n       The problems with monitoring environmental conditions \n     aboard the space station have festered for more than a year, \n     some NASA medical officials said. Space station astronauts \n     have shown such symptoms as headaches, dizziness and ``an \n     inability to think clearly,'' according to a medical officer \n     who asked not to be named. The onboard sensors designed to \n     provide real-time analysis of the air, water and radiation \n     levels have been broken for months, which has made it \n     impossible to determine at any given time whether there is a \n     buildup of trace amounts of dangerous chemical compounds that \n     could sicken astronauts, or worse.\n\n  A November 9, 2003, Washington Post article reports that:\n\n       A recent NASA study found that the risk of fire aboard the \n     station has grown because the crew is stowing large \n     quantities of supplies, equipment and waste in front of or \n     near 14 portals that would be crucial for detecting and \n     extinguishing a fire in any of the station's various \n     compartments. There is\n\n[[Page S14999]]\n\n     also concern that a portion of the station's water stores \n     supplied by the Russians may have high levels of carbon \n     tetrachloride, a toxic contaminant.\n\n  This article further stated that:\n\n       As far back as March, internal studies warned of a host of \n     dangers for six separate systems, including the thermal \n     controls that cool the station's computers and interiors, \n     that would likely grow out of trying to run the station with \n     limited supplies and a caretaker crew of two instead of the \n     normal complement of three.\n\n  Before the recent launch of Expedition 8, the Chief of NASA's \nHabitability and Environmental Factors Office and NASA's Chief of Space \nMedicine signed a dissent to the ``flight readiness certificate.'' The \ndissent declared that ``the continued degradation in the environmental \nmonitoring system, exercise countermeasures system, and the health \nmaintenance system, coupled with a planned increment duration of \ngreater than 6 months and extremely limited resupply, all combine to \nincrease the risk to the crew to the point where initiation of [the \nmission] is not recommended.\n  These are very serious issues that cannot be ignored, yet here we \nare, about to approve more than $81 million for unrequested earmarks \nwhile underfunding more pressing needs. How will these cuts to the \nPresident's budget request affect the safety of the space station? Are \nwe really willing to take any risks?\n  Furthermore, how do we explain to the public that we could not find \nthe money to fully fund the International Space Station, but were able \nto earmark $81.6 million worth of pork barrel funding in NASA's \nScience, Aeronautics and Exploration Account? Again, this is the very \ntype of earmarking that the CAIB report identified as serious cause for \nconcern.\n  That this practice continues in the face of legitimate safety \nconcerns is simply unacceptable given the tragedies experienced just \nthis year. When one considers the importance of ensuring the safety of \nthe astronauts aboard the Space Station, don't you have to question the \nfunding priority for projects such as the ultra-long balloon program at \nNew Mexico State University, and the Classroom of the Future at \nWheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia? These and other projects \nare the types of earmarks discussed by the CAIB.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy opposes this $200 million \nreduction, stating that: ``After diligently rebuilding reserves to \nplace the Station on sound financial ground, this reduction would \ndeplete reserves deemed critical by independent cost estimates and \nlimit the program's ability to address risks in FY 2004, including \nimpacts from the Columbia accident.'' In addition, I have been informed \nthat this reduction would place at risk actions that NASA is taking to \naddress the Independent Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task \nForce recommendations to ensure a ``credible'' ISS Program.\n  This bill would also reduce funding for other NASA programs. For \nexample, it would reduce funding for the Global Climate Change Research \nInitiative by $11 million, a decrease of 47 percent. This reduction \nwould significantly impact the development of the Advanced Polarimeter \nSensor, which is designed to measure methane, tropospheric ozone, \naerosols and black carbon in the atmosphere. The proposed reduction \nwould delay the purchase of ``long-lead'' item purchases, which could \npotentially delay the launch date of the satellite from 2007 to 2008.\n  The bill also would reduce funding for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter \n(JIMO) by $20 million. This reduction would disrupt and delay the \nformulation of the JIMO and its associated space nuclear power and \npropulsion technologies. It also would also reduce funding for the \npreparation of solicitations for the science community and science \ninvestigations. In addition, it would reduce funding for spacecraft \nstudies by three competing industry teams, which would result in \ndelayed, less efficient, and disrupted spacecraft conceptual design \nwork. Most importantly, funding for the Department of Energy reactor \nstudies and technology recapture activities would be reduced. The \nreactor is the ``long-lead'' component of JIMO, and any delay to the \nreactor could eventually delay the launch of the vehicle.\n  Finally, the bill would reduce funding for NASA's Earth Science \nApplications by $15 million a 20 percent decrease. This decrease would \nsuspend or terminate projects in over 12 states that support the \nintegration of Earth observations into decision support systems. The \nreduction would also suspend NASA's interagency commitments to \nestablish best-practice solutions for the integration of Earth science \nresearch results into products and services for food and fiber \nproduction, coastal management, energy management, aviation safety, \ndisaster management, and air quality forecasting.\n  It is important to note for all of these projects that further delays \nusually equate to greater cost.\n  I think it is important to comment on the fact that the \nadministration has not provided any cost estimates for the space \nshuttle's return to flight, even though NASA has issued two versions of \nits Return To Flight plan. It is difficult to expect an appropriations \nbill to provide sufficient resources without the relevant information \nfrom NASA regarding the cost of these Shuttle operations, and I \ncontinue to request the administration provide this critical \ninformation to the Congress.\n  The CAIB has listed 15 recommendations that must be implemented \nbefore the Space Shuttle can return to flight. These recommendations \nvary in technical complexity, and include modifying the Memorandum of \nAgreement with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency to ensure that \nimages are taken of each Shuttle while on orbit, and developing a \ncomprehensive inspection plan using non-destructive inspection \ntechnology to determine the structural integrity of all Reinforced \nCarbon-Carbon system components. The CAIB also recommends that NASA \nprepare a detailed plan for establishing an independent Technical \nEngineering Authority, independent safety program, and reorganized \nSpace Shuttle Integration Office. Some of these recommendations will \npotentially be expensive to implement, and the Congress needs to have \nan estimate of their cost soon. We cannot wait until the FY 2005 budget \nsubmission to find out how much Return To Flight activities will cost \nif the Shuttle is expected to fly again next fall.\n  I am also concerned about the Orbital Space Plane program, the \ndevelopment of which is estimated to cost the taxpayers upwards of $15 \nbillion. This amount is already close to the original estimated \ndevelopment costs of $17.4 billion for the International Space Station. \nIt is amazing that the escape vehicle for the station is about to cost \nas much as the Station was originally expected to cost.\n  We must ensure due diligence is taken to protect this public \ninvestment. NASA has limited the competition to two companies, yet it \nhas not provided a sufficient explanation to the authorizing committees \nof jurisdiction as to the merits of such a decision. I am not convinced \nthis will generate either the cost savings or the innovation necessary \nto make this a successful program.\n  Perhaps the more fundamental question is whether the OSP is the right \napproach in the first place. As the rush begins to develop this \nvehicle, many Members in both Houses are not sure how or if this \nproject fits within the overall plans for the future of NASA. I share \nthese concerns.\n  We do not want to make the same mistakes that we made on the ISS. \nThose mistakes cost the American taxpayers dearly as the development \ncosts of the ISS sky-rocketed by more than 50 percent. Even today, we \nstill do not know the final costs of the Station, because of the delay \ncaused by the grounding of the Space Shuttle.\n  I believe it wise to wait for the results of the on-going inter-\nagency review of the nation's space program being undertaken by the \nadministration before we dole out $15 billion that may be inconsistent \nwith the future goals of the space program.\n  We need to make the safety of the astronauts on the space station a \ntop priority. We cannot risk placing the earmarks for parochial \ninterests above the critical need to fund legitimate safety concerns.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are awaiting one more Senator who has an \namendment to be offered. We are getting to the point where we hope we \ncan go to a voice vote on final passage as soon as possible to expedite \nthe work of\n\n[[Page S15000]]\n\nthe committee. I have asked our cloakroom to check to see if the \nSenator is going to be joining us to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers have worked this down to one \namendment being left. There was an agreement this morning, and Senator \nMcCain is willing to take a very short time agreement. I think it is 20 \nminutes evenly divided. This bill will be finished before the normal \nrecess.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I might say to the wonderful \ndistinguished whip and my colleague from Missouri, at 2:30 the Senator \nfrom Maryland, along with the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, are receiving a national award. It will occur in Statuary Hall.\n  It is really important, if the Senator from Arizona could come next, \nwe could finish this bill. It will be very awkward to try to do the \nbill at 2:30. I will be here. I will give up the reception of this \naward. It is really awkward when we are ready to go. I respect the \nimpeccable credentials of the Senator from Arizona on national \nsecurity. We know what he wants to offer. We could deal with this now \nand have him present his arguments and our rebuttal, and perhaps do \nthis before the luncheon recess. We would like to get this done before \nthe Senate recesses for the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for about 3 \nminutes.\n  First, I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their work on this legislation and particularly \nfor their commitment to the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  This is such an important part of what we are as a people. We are a \nnation of explorers. This represents a commitment by the American \npeople to explore our solar system and, as far as possible, the \nuniverse as we know it.\n  We have had a tough year. With the shuttle disaster and seven \nastronauts lost, a tremendous effort has been ongoing to deal with the \nproblem so it will not happen again as part of the return to space \nprogram. It has cost us a good bit of money.\n  It is important to note NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe is doing a \nterrific job. He has served as former Secretary of the Navy, former \nComptroller of the Department of Defense, chaired departments at Johns \nHopkins, Syracuse, Penn State, and has dealt with governmental \nmanagement. He is doing a good job. That was confirmed just 2 days ago \nwhen NASA was rated the best place to work in the Federal Government. \nIn fact, I was particularly proud that Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, AL, the part of NASA where the Saturn 5 was originally set \nup by Werner Von Braun, is rated the best of the best in the entire \nU.S. Government. A lot of good things are happening despite the \ndifficulties.\n  One thing, though, that our leaders were not able to do: Under the \npressure that was upon them, they believed it necessary to reduce the \nInternational Space Station funding by $200 million. I know there is a \nlot of pressure. I understand the difficulties they face. The House has \nnot done that.\n\n  I urge our colleagues as they go to conference--and I intend to \nsupport this bill--to see if we can't get back that $200 million. We \ndon't know all of the challenges they will face, but we know we really \nhave to do a lot of extra work on the return to space. It has drained a \nlot of our money. If we could keep that $200 million in and keep this \nspace station going, I think it would maintain our progressive vision \nfor space and continue our commitment to explore our solar system. I \nthink it is very important.\n  I urge my colleagues to do all they can to see if that can be worked \nout. I thank them for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \ncomments on space exploration and the space station.\n  He noted the delays in the space station operations because of the \nunavailability of the space shuttle. That is one of the reasons we put \nsome of those funds in other priority programs. We are trying to get \nback into space so we can get the space shuttle. We very much \nappreciate that.\n\n\n                          VETERANS' CEMETERIES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator from Missouri \nbe willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with my friend \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I have come to the floor today to speak about \nan issue of great importance; the need to construct new national \nveterans cemeteries.\n  National cemeteries are reaching capacity throughout the United \nStates as veterans, particularly those from World War II and the Korean \nWar, die in increasing numbers. By the end of 2004, only 64 of the 124 \nveterans national cemeteries will be available for both casketed and \ncremated remains.\n  Recognizing the need to establish new cemeteries, Congress recently \npassed the National Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003 (H.R. 1516). This \nbill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to construct a new \nnational veterans cemetery in the following six cities: Jacksonville, \nFL; Sarasota, FL; Birmingham, AL; Bakersfield, CA; Philadelphia, PA; \nand Columbia, SC. These cities were identified by VA as being the areas \nin the greatest need of a new cemetery.\n  As cemetery service capabilities decrease, veterans in areas near \ncemeteries that are at capacity will lose access to burial options \nwithin a reasonable distance of their homes. In order to ensure that \nburial options are provided for veterans and their family members, we \nmust develop new cemeteries and expand existing cemeteries. This \nprocess must start as soon as possible because the construction of a \nnew cemetery takes an average of seven years.\n  I respectfully request that the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee work to include advance planning funds in conference so we \nbegin constructing these new cemeteries and ensure our veterans have \nthe burial options they deserve.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree this is an important issue and I will try to \naddress it in conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman for his efforts and I look forward to the final conference \nreport.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincerest appreciation to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, without whom we could not have \ngotten them done. We were under very tight time pressures and with very \nlimited resources.\n  I express my thanks to the chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Byrd, for making enough money available so we can \nrestore the full amount of funding for veterans health care which was a \ntop priority.\n  This was an extremely difficult year for us. We could not have gotten \nit done without an extremely able staff who worked, I imagine, more \nthan 100 hours a week and 20 hours several days.\n  Thanks on the minority side to Paul Carliner, Alexa Sewell, Gabrielle \nBatkin; and, on my side, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, Allan Cutler, Jennifer \nStoripan, and Rebecca Benn. We sincerely appreciate their good work.\n  I ask my colleague for any comments, and then we are ready to go to \nfinal passage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have fully funded the VA including a \n$1.5 billion increase over the President's request for VA medical care.\n  We have provided $28.5 billion for medical care, a 12 percent \nincrease over last year's level. with no deductibles, no co-pays, and \nno membership fees for veterans. Promises made to our veterans must be \npromises kept and we have kept our promises to veterans in this bill.\n  In the area of housing and community development, we continue our \ncommitment to core housing programs, including Community Development \nBlock Grants, HOME, HOPE VI, and Section 8. These programs provide \nflexible funding for local communities for a range of activities, such \nas new rental housing, rehabilitation of dilapidated properties, and \nchild care centers.\n  Last year, CDBG funds created or retained over 100,000 jobs \nnationwide.\n  We also keep our commitment to the environment helping local \ncommunities protect their citizens' health and their environment.\n  EPA helps communities by cleaning up Brownfields, improving air \nquality,\n\n[[Page S15001]]\n\nand fixing water and sewer systems. We provide $8.2 billion to the EPA, \n$105 million above last year, and $500 million above the President's \nbudget request.\n  In water and sewer needs, communities all across the country are \nfaced with aging water and sewer systems. The costs of fixing and \nmaintaining these aging systems continue to increase. That is why \nSenator Bond and I worked together to restore the administration's $500 \nmillion cut to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund.\n  We have also fully funded environmental cops on the beat so that we \ncatch polluters who threaten public health and the environment.\n  We have provided a record amount for Americorps, $340 million, so \nthat Americorps can enroll more volunteers to serve in our communities.\n  In NASA, we provided the full amount for the Space Shuttle--$3.9 \nbillion. Senator Bond and I have always made the Space Shuttle safety a \npriority.\n  The bill also funded all major programs in space science, earth \nscience, and aeronautics.\n  In order to keep our manufacturing jobs here, we increase our \ninvestment in the National Science Foundation. We win the Nobel Prizes, \nand they win the markets. That is why we provide NSF with the largest \nbudget in its history.\n  We have increased funding for education to attract and train more \nscientists, engineers and teachers of science.\n  Again, I joined this Subcommittee to meet the needs of our veterans, \nempower communities, and create new jobs. This bill has accomplished \nall three goals.\n  I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for the wonderful job he has done \non this bill on the part of representing the Democratic side. I thank \nhim for all the courtesies and collegiality. Most of all, I thank him \nfor really not playing politics with veterans health care, as I did \nnot. As we approached this bill, when it came to looking out for \nveterans health care, we weren't the Republican Party; we weren't the \nDemocratic Party; we were the red, white, and blue party. Therefore, we \ncould raise the funding for veterans medical care by 12 percent with no \ndeductibles, with no new deductibles, no new copayments, and no \nmembership fees. That was due in large part to our mutual advocacy and \nthe wonderful cooperation of Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd.\n  I joined this subcommittee for two reasons: To meet the day-to-day \nneeds of my constituents--our veterans--housing, the environment; and \nthe long-range investments needed for our country in science and \ntechnology. I believe we have accomplished both.\n  I also thank the staff who enabled us to do this: On my own side, \nPaul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin, Alexa Sewell, and Jennifer Storipan; \nand the staff of the distinguished Senator from Missouri: Jon Karmarck, \nCheh Kim, Allan Cutler, and Rebecca Benn.\n  I also thank the floor staff of both the majority and the minority \nwho helped us expedite the bill. No kinder words could be said by me \nthan to express my gratitude to Senator Harry Reid, the whip on our \nside, who really also helped bring this bill to closure. This is why we \ncome to the Senate, to try to use the taxpayers' money in a wise way. \nIt keeps promises made to our U.S. veterans, but adds value to our \ncountry, whether through empowering neighborhoods, protecting the \nenvironment, or investing in science and technology so we not only win \nthe Nobel Prizes but we win the markets.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. We are ready for final passage.\n  The amendment (No. 2150), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2861), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2861\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2861) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Veteran Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for \n     sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2004, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       Compensation and Pensions\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 \n     U.S.C.

(a) Treatment of Pioneer Homes in Alaska as State \n     Home for Veterans.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may--\n       (1) treat the Pioneer Homes in the State of Alaska \n     collectively as a single State home for veterans for purposes \n     of section 1741 of title 38, United States Code; and\n       (2) make per diem payments to the State of Alaska for care \n     provided to veterans in the Pioneer Homes in accordance with \n     the provisions of that section.\n       (b) Treatment Notwithstanding Non-Veteran Residency.--The \n     Secretary shall treat the Pioneer Homes as a State home under \n     subsection (a) notwithstanding the residency of non-veterans \n     in one or more of the Pioneer Homes.\n       (c) Pioneer Homes Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Pioneer Homes'' means the six regional homes in the State \n     of Alaska known as Pioneer Homes, which are located in the \n     following:\n       (1) Anchorage, Alaska.\n       (2) Fairbanks, Alaska.\n       (3) Juneau, Alaska.\n       (4) Ketchikan, Alaska.\n       (5) Palmer, Alaska.\n       (6) Sitka, Alaska.\n\n[[Page S15004]]\n\n       Sec. 119. (a) Findings on Access to Primary Health Care of \n     Veterans in Rural Areas.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has appointed a \n     commission, called the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced \n     Services (CARES) Commission, and directed it to make specific \n     recommendations regarding the realignment and allocation of \n     capital assets necessary to meet the demand for veterans \n     health care services over the next 20 years.\n       (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs accessibility \n     standard for primary health care provides that at least 70 \n     percent of the veterans enrolled in each of the regional \n     ``markets'' of the Department should live within a specified \n     driving time of a Department primary care facility. That \n     driving time is 30 minutes for veterans living in urban and \n     rural areas and 60 minutes for veterans living in highly \n     rural areas.\n       (3) The Draft National CARES Plan issued by the Under \n     Secretary for Health would place veterans in 18 rural and \n     highly rural regional markets outside the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care until at least \n     fiscal year 2022, which means that thousands of veterans will \n     have to continuing traveling up to 3-4 hours each way to \n     visit a Department primary care facility.\n       (4) The 18 rural and highly rural markets that will remain \n     outside the Department accessibility standard for primary \n     health care comprise all or parts of Arkansas, Idaho, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, \n     Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North \n     Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, \n     Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n       (5) Health care facilities for veterans are \n     disproportionately needed in rural and highly rural areas \n     because the residents of such areas are generally older, \n     poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the CARES Commission should give as much attention to \n     solving the special needs of veterans who live in rural areas \n     as it does to providing for the health care needs of veterans \n     living in more highly populated areas;\n       (2) the CARES Commission should reject the portions of the \n     Draft National CARES Plan that would prevent any regional \n     market of the Department from complying with the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care, which \n     provides that at least 70 percent of the veterans residing in \n     each market be within specified driving times of a Department \n     primary care facility; and\n       (3) the CARES Commission should recommend to the Secretary \n     the investments and initiatives that are necessary to achieve \n     the Department accessibility standard for primary health care \n     in each of the rural and highly rural health care markets of \n     the Department.\n       Sec. 120. Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine \n     of the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement the \n     Institute of Medicine shall develop and evaluate \n     epidemiological studies on Vietnam veterans in accordance \n     with the recommendations of the 2003 National Academy of \n     Sciences report entitled ``Characterizing Exposure of \n     Veterans to Agent Orange and Other Herbicides Used in \n     Vietnam: Interim Findings and Recommendations''.\n       Sec. 121. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs by this Act or any \n     other Act may be obligated or expended to implement the \n     policy contained in the memorandum of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs dated July 18, 2002, from the Deputy Under \n     Secretary for Health for Operations and Management with the \n     subject ``Status of VHA Enrollment and Associated Issues'' or \n     any other policy prohibiting the Directors of the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) from conducting outreach \n     or marketing to enroll new veterans within their Networks.\n\n         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n                       Public and Indian Housing\n\n\n

contributions contract, and by applying \n     an inflation factor based on local or regional factors to the \n     actual per unit cost as reported: Provided further, That \n     funds may be made available in this paragraph to support a \n     total number of unit months under lease that exceeds a public \n     housing agency's authorized level of units under lease to the \n     extent that the use of these funds is part of a strategy for \n     a public housing agency to attain its authorized level of \n     units under contract: Provided further, That when a public \n     housing agency is over its authorized contract level, that \n     public housing agency may not issue another voucher \n     (including turnover vouchers) until that public housing \n     agency is at or

authorized vouchers, and for contract amendments resulting \n     from a significant increase in per-unit costs, or otherwise \n     provide funds so that public housing agencies may lease units \n     up to their authorized unit level: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary may use up to $36,000,000 in such funds for \n     incremental vouchers under section 8 of the Act to be used \n     for non-elderly disabled families affected by the designation \n     of a public housing development under section 7 of the Act, \n     the establishment of preferences in accordance with section \n

U.S.C. 13618): Provided further, That the Secretary may only \n     allocate the incremental vouchers under the previous proviso \n     upon a determination that there are adequate funds under this \n     heading to fund all voucher needs in this fiscal year: \n     Provided further, That if a public housing agency, at any \n     point in time during their fiscal year, has obligated the \n     amounts made available to such agency pursuant to paragraph \n     (1) under this heading for the renewal of expiring section 8 \n     tenant-based annual contributions contracts, and if such \n     agency has expended 50 percent of the amounts available to \n     such agency in its annual contributions contract reserve \n     account, the Secretary shall make available such amounts as \n     are

contract: Provided further, That the Secretary shall \n     provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations \n     of the House and the Senate on the obligation of funds \n     provided

Sense of the Senate. (a) Findings.--The Senate \n     finds that--\n       (1) 30 percent of American families have housing \n     affordability problems, with 14,300,000 families paying more \n     than half of their income for housing costs, and 17,300,000 \n     families paying 30 to 50 percent of their income towards \n     housing costs;\n       (2) 9,300,000 American families live in housing that is \n     overcrowded or distressed;\n       (3) 3,500,000 households in the United States will \n     experience homelessness at some point this year, including \n     1,350,000 children;\n       (4) the number of working families who are unable to afford \n     adequate housing is increasing, as the gap between wages and \n     housing costs grows;\n       (5) there is no county or metropolitan area in the country \n     where a minimum wage earner can afford to rent a modest 2-\n     bedroom apartment, and on average, a family must earn over \n     $15 an hour to afford modest rental housing, which is almost \n     3 times the minimum wage;\n       (6) section 8 housing vouchers help approximately 2,000,000 \n     families with children, senior citizens, and disabled \n     individuals afford a safe and decent place to live;\n       (7) utilization of vouchers is at a high of 96 percent, and \n     is on course to rise to 97 percent in fiscal year 2004, \n     according to data provided by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development;\n       (8) the average cost per voucher has also steadily \n     increased from just over $6,400 in August of 2002, to $6,756 \n     in April, 2003, due largely to rising rents in the private \n     market, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \n     the cost per voucher in fiscal year 2004 will be $7,028, $560 \n     more per voucher than the estimate contained in the fiscal \n     year 2004 budget request; and\n       (9) the congressionally appointed, bipartisan Millennial \n     Housing Commission found that housing vouchers are ``the \n     linchpin of a national housing policy providing very low-\n     income renters access to privately-owned housing stock''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) housing vouchers are a critical resource in ensuring \n     that families in America can afford safe, decent, and \n     adequate housing;\n       (2) public housing agencies must retain the ability to use \n     100 percent of their authorized vouchers to help house low-\n     income families; and\n       (3) the Senate expects the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development to take all necessary actions to encourage full \n     utilization of vouchers, and to use all legally available \n     resources as needed to support full funding for housing \n     vouchers in fiscal year 2004, so that every voucher can be \n     used by a family in need.\n       Sec. 419. Section 106(d) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5306(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``shall not exceed 2 \n     percent'' and inserting ``shall not, subject to paragraph \n     (6), exceed 3 percent'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``not to exceed 1 \n     percent'' and inserting ``subject to paragraph (6), not to \n     exceed 3 percent'';\n       (3) by redesignating the second paragraph (5) and paragraph \n     (6) as paragraphs (7) and (8), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following:\n       ``(6) Of the amounts received under paragraph (1), the \n     State may deduct not more than an aggregate total of 3 \n     percent of such amounts for--\n       ``(A) administrative expenses under paragraph (3)(A); and\n       ``(B) technical assistance under paragraph (5).''.\n       Sec. 420.

Section 221 of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1301) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f), by striking ``2002 and 2003'' and \n     inserting ``2005 and 2006'';\n       (2) in subsection (g)(1)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2002'' and \n     inserting ``2005''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2002'' and inserting ``2005'';\n       (3) in subsection (g)(2)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2003'' and \n     inserting ``2006''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2006''; and\n       (4) in subsection (i), by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2006''.\n       Sec. 421. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm (in this section, collectively referred to as the \n     ``First Gulf War''), the regime of Saddam Hussein committed \n     grave human rights abuses and acts of terrorism against the \n     people of Iraq and citizens of the United States.\n       (2) United States citizens who were taken prisoner by the \n     regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War were \n     brutally tortured and forced to endure severe physical trauma \n     and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The regime of Saddam Hussein used civilian citizens of \n     the United States who were working in the Persian Gulf region \n     before and during the First Gulf War as so-called human \n     shields, threatening the personal safety and emotional well-\n     being of such civilians.\n       (4) Congress has recognized and authorized the right of \n     United States citizens, including prisoners of war, to hold \n     terrorist states, such as Iraq during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, liable for injuries caused by such states.\n       (5) The United States district courts are authorized to \n     adjudicate cases brought by individuals injured by terrorist \n     states.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) notwithstanding section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 \n     Stat. 579) and any other provision of law, a citizen of the \n     United States who was a prisoner of war or who was used by \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein and by Iraq as a so-called human \n     shield during the First Gulf War should have the opportunity \n     to have any claim for damages caused by the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein and by Iraq incurred by such citizen fully \n     adjudicated in the appropriate United States district court;\n       (2) any judgment for such damages awarded to such citizen, \n     or the family of such citizen, should be fully enforced; and\n       (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations \n     with each such citizen, or the family of each such citizen, \n     to develop a fair and reasonable method of providing \n     compensation for the damages each such citizen incurred, \n     including using assets of the regime of Saddam Hussein held \n     by the Government of the United States or any other \n     appropriate sources to provide such compensation.\n       Sec. 422. None of the funds provided in this Act may be \n     expended to apply, in a numerical estimate of the benefits of \n     an agency action prepared pursuant to Executive Order 12866 \n     or section 812 of the Clean Air Act, monetary values for \n     adult premature mortality that differ based on the age of the \n     adult.\n       Sec. 423.

(a) Extension.--The \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall extend the \n     term of the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement entered \n     into between a public housing agency and the Secretary under \n     section 204, title V, of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions \n     and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134, April 26, \n     1996) if--\n       (1) the public housing agency requests such extension in \n     writing;\n       (2) the public housing agency is not at the time of such \n     request for extension in default under its Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement; and\n       (3) the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement to be \n     extended would otherwise expire on or before December 31, \n     2004.\n       (b) Terms.--Unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the public housing agency otherwise agree, \n     the extension under subsection (a) shall be upon the \n     identical terms and conditions set forth in the extending \n     agency's existing Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement, \n     except that for each public housing agency that has been or \n     will be granted an extension to its original Moving to Work \n     agreement, the Secretary shall require that data be collected \n     so that the effect of Moving to Work policy changes on \n     residents can be measured.\n       (c) Extension Period.--The extension under subsection (a) \n     shall be for such period as is requested by the public \n     housing agency, not to exceed 3 years from the date of \n     expiration of the extending agency's existing Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement.\n       (d) Breach of Agreement.--Nothing contained in this section \n     shall limit the authority of the Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development to terminate any Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement of a public housing agency if the \n     public housing agency is in breach of the provisions of such \n     agreement.\n       Sec. 424.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my appreciation to Chairman Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their hard work in developing the Senate fiscal year 2004 \nVA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. Considering the \nlow authorization level for this important bill, they have done an \nexcellent job maintaining priorities in Veterans health care, the \nenvironment and housing. It is vital that the full Senate-passed amount \nfor Veterans healthcare be maintained in conference so that we don't \nlose more ground in caring for those who have borne the battle. \nHowever, it is obvious that additional resources are critically needed \nfor many programs in these areas if they are to work as intended.\n  Understanding the difficult authorization level facing this \ncommittee, I would still like to express my strong support for \nadditional funding for YouthBuild in the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies conference report. Despite the repeated support of \nover 57 of our Senate colleagues for a funding level of $90 million, \nand despite the President's Budget request and House-passed level of \n$65 million, the Senate bill could only provide $60 million for a \nprogram that has proven its value and that is crucial to the lives of \nmany young people. At the same time, 1,400 YouthBuild participants who \nare building housing for homeless and low-income people have lost \naccess to AmeriCorps education awards due to the cutbacks in \nAmeriCorps.\n  Each year, YouthBuild receives strong bipartisan support because the \nprogram works. Eighty-five percent of students who complete the \nYouthBuild program either secure a job--at an average wage of more than \n$7.60 per hour--or go on to postsecondary education. The program's \nsuccess rate is especially notable since YouthBuild serves an at-risk \npopulation, 80 percent of whom have previously dropped out of high \nschool.\n  YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive program that offers at-risk \nyouth an immediately productive role rebuilding their communities. \nAlong with attending basic education classes for 50 percent of the \nprogram time, students receive job skills training in the well-paid \nconstruction field, personal counseling from respected mentors, a \nsupportive peer group with positive values, and experience in community \nleadership and civic engagement. To date, 25,000 YouthBuild students \nhave built over 10,000 units of affordable housing.\n  Despite its obvious success, YouthBuild is losing ground with more \nthan 30 sites that have closed due to lack of funds since 1996. Most of \nthe remaining programs enroll 25 percent fewer students than they did \nin 1997. In 2001, 56 experienced YouthBuild sites that qualified for \nfunding from HUD did not receive it solely due to a lack of funding. \nOnly two local programs have been funded continuously since 1994.\n  During the House-Senate conference, I hope that the Senate will yield \nto the House and provide $65 million for YouthBuild as the President \nhas requested and the House of Representatives has provided. This is \nthe least we can do. We must continue to fight to open the doors of \nopportunity and service to America's youth by supporting \nYouthBuild.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their hard work on this important legislation \nwhich provides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. \nUnfortunately, I must again speak about the unacceptably high funding \nlevels of parochial projects in this appropriations bill. Overall, this \nlegislation contains approximately $1.2 billion in unrequested spending \nand locality-specific earmarks.\n  The Committee provides $29.3 billion in discretionary funding for the \nVA. That amount is $1.3 billion more than the President's budget \nrequest and $2.8 billion above the amount in fiscal year 2003. Some \nprogress has been made to reduce the overall amount of earmarks for the \nVA in this spending bill.\n  Among other Senators who have stood on the Senate floor to fight for \nadditional funding for veterans' healthcare, I am concerned that the \nCommittee has directed critical dollars from veterans' healthcare to \nfund spending projects that have not been properly reviewed. Certain \nprovisions funded under the VA in this legislation illustrate that \nCongress still does not have its priorities in order.\n  One especially troubling expense, neither budgeted for nor requested \nby the Administration over the past twelve years, is a provision that \ndirects the VA to continue the twelve year old demonstration project \ninvolving the Clarksburg, WV, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) \nand the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Several \nyears ago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 \nmillion for the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's \nline-item veto list and since then the millions keep flowing.\n  Three years ago, the Committee `recommended' $1 million for the \ndesign of a nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV, VAMC. Two years \nago they strengthened their report language urging `the VA to \naccelerate the design of the nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV \nVAMC.'' Last year, they have urged the VA ``to include sufficient \nfunding'' for a new nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV VAMC. \nThis year, they urge the VA to include sufficient funding in the 2005 \nbudget request.\n  For St. Louis, MO, the Committee `encouraged' the VA to pursue an \ninnovative approach at a cost of $7 million for leasing parking spaces \nat the John Cochran Division of the VA Medical Center in St. Louis as a \nmeans to address a parking shortfall at the VA hospital.\n  Additionally, the Committee ``supports continuation'' at the current \nspending level of the Rural Veterans Health Care Initiative at the \nWhite River Junction, VT VAMC. The current level is an astounding $7 \nmillion.\n  While I am encouraged by the increase specifically in veterans health \ncare funding over last year's enacted levels, we must do much more. We \nmade a promise to our veterans that we would take care of their mental \nand physical health needs incurred for their many sacrifices for our \nnation. The VA currently has an incredible backlog of claims. \nCurrently, four out of every ten claims for veterans' disability \nbenefits are decided incorrectly further contributing to the backlog. \nThe millions in dollars wasted in pork barrel spending would go a long \nway to decreasing the backlog in veterans claims by funding additional \nclaims adjudicators and training.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out the provisions in this \nlegislation related to AmeriCorps. Whether it is tutoring inner-city \nyouth or fighting forest fires in the West, the lives of countless \npeople are touched by AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps' efforts to reach out to \nthose affected by natural disasters are paying serious dividends. Over \n246,000 victims of fires, floods and hurricanes have been aided by \nAmeriCorps volunteers working in conjunction with groups such as the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  Despite AmeriCorps' countless success stories, the appropriators have \nfunded AmeriCorps $93.2 million below\n\n[[Page S14997]]\n\nthe President's request, while imposing incredibly restrictive report \nlanguage that could very well fundamentally change the face of a very \nsuccessful program.\n  I was heartened when I saw that the President requested funding to \nexpand AmeriCorps to 75,000 volunteers in Fiscal Year 2004. This was an \nimportant first step on the road to large scale expansion of \nAmeriCorps. Despite the President's request, the appropriators took it \nupon themselves to ensure that we do not provide adequate funding to \nreach this ambitious level set forth by the President. The \nAppropriations Committee's counterparts in the House of Representatives \nfunded AmeriCorps with $23.4 million more than the Senate, yet only \nbelieve that they can fund 55,000 volunteers.\n  Everybody is well aware of money management problems that the \nCorporation for National Service and AmeriCorps have faced over the \nlast few years. I am confident that the change in leadership at the \ncorporation should help minimize the potential for these same problems \nto repeat themselves. However, if we do not provide the amount of money \nthe corporation says it will need to fully fund 75,000 volunteers, we \nare inviting a disastrous repeat of history. If we do not want to \nrepeat this summer's battle for supplemental funds for AmeriCorps, we \nmust fully fund AmeriCorps to the level that the Corporation feels is \nadequate, not the appropriators.\n  The last authorization for the AmeriCorps program lapsed in 1996. It \nis time to reauthorize the program. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has oversight responsibility for this program. It is \ntime that we hold hearings to reauthorize this program and markup the \nCall to Service Act, which I authored with Senator Bayh and Senator \nKennedy. If there is a need to impose restrictions on how AmeriCorps \nchooses its volunteers or how awards are given out, the HELP committee \nis where that debate needs to take place, not by the appropriators, \nwithout so much as a hearing. We have no idea what effect the \nrestrictions in this legislation will have on AmeriCorps. We have not \nbothered to run them by the Corporation. Mr. President, we are failing \nin our oversight responsibilities.\n  The overwhelming support for AmeriCorps among the grassroots groups \nis clear. Recently, an event called Voices for AmeriCorps was staged. \nThis 100-hour event featured 130 AmeriCorps Alumni and 51 Members of \nCongress. In all over 700 people, representing 47 states expressed \ntheir support for AmeriCorps. During the summer, letters were sent to \nthe President urging him to support an emergency appropriation request \nfor AmeriCorps. These letters were sent by a bipartisan group of 79 \nSenators, 228 members of the House of Representatives, 44 Governors and \n148 Mayors. The list of supporters is not restricted to elected \nofficials. 250 private sector leaders took out a full page ad in The \nNew York Times expressing support. 1100 community organizations have \nshown their support. The support for AmeriCorps is clear. It is time \nthat we acknowledge their efforts and not only fully fund the \nPresident's request but expand AmeriCorps to new levels.\n  This legislation also contains the funding for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. The programs administered by HUD help \nour nation's families purchase their homes, helps many low-income \nfamilies obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the \nhousing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our \nnation's most vulnerable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged--have \naccess to safe and affordable housing\n  Unfortunately, this bill shifts money away from many critical housing \nand community programs by bypassing the appropriate competitive process \nand inserting earmarks and set-asides for special projects that \nreceived the attention of the Appropriations Committee. This is unfair \nto the many communities and families who do not have the good fortune \nof residing in a region of the country represented by a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  In the report accompanying this bill, the Appropriators have taken \ntwo accounts, originally created as competitive grant programs to be \nadministered by HUD, and earmarked close to 100% of those accounts. \nThis bill funds the Economic Development Initiative at $140 million. \nHowever, the report lists 331 earmarks for that program, totaling over \n$136 million. Similarly, the committee funds the Neighborhood \nInitiatives program at $21 million, with report language listing 20 \nearmarks, totaling over $20 million. I am deeply concerned that once \ncompetitive programs have become nothing more than slush funds to \nfulfill influential members' parochial interests.\n  Some of the earmarks for special projects in this legislation \ninclude:\n  $1,000,000 for the Tongass Coast Aquarium in Ketchikan, AK for \nimprovements;\n  $400,000 for Love, Inc. in Fairbanks, AK for a social service \nfacility;\n  $250,000 for the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage for \nimprovements;\n  $1,000,000 for Fort Westernaire in Golden, CO for the expansion of \nthe Westernaire museum;\n  $500,000 for Miami Dade County, FL for the construction of the Miami \nDade County Performing Arts Center;\n\n  $500,000 for the Hawaii Nature Center in Wailuku, HI for the Maui \nRenovation Project;\n  $500,000 for the Field Museum in Chicago, IL;\n  $100,000 for the Iowa State Fair Board in DesMoines, IA for a \nstatewide awareness and education/exhibit.\n  $280,000 for the City of Waterloo, IA for the John Deere brownfield \nand bio-based incubator project;\n  $500,000 for the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD for building \nrenovations;\n  $187,500 for Heartland Corn Products in Winthrop, MN for construction \nof a new facility;\n  $100,000 for the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hateras, NC to \ncomplete construction;\n  $450,000 for the Johnny Appleseed Heritage Center, Inc. in Ashland \nCounty, OH for construction of facilities;\n  $200,000 for Holt Hotel in Wichita Falls, TX for continued \nrenovations to the Holt Hotel;\n  $250,000 for the Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser, WA \nfor costs associated with its construction;\n  $500,000 for Appalachian Bible College in Beckley, WV to complete its \nlibrary resource center; and\n  $1,000,000 for the Huntington Area Development Council in Huntington, \nWV for the construction of a business incubator.\n  This bill also funds the Environmental Protection Agency which \nprovides resources to help state, local and tribal communities enhance \ncapacity and infrastructure to better address their environmental \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, the most egregious provision under the EPA section is \nthe language that would significantly change states' authority under \nthe Clean Air Act in order to protect an engine manufacturer in \nMissouri. This policy change has been advanced to serve the concerns of \nBriggs and Stratton, although its September 2003 filing to the SEC \nindicated that there would not be ``a material effect on its financial \ncondition or results of operations'' and it has not been able to \nsubstantiate job loss claims. However, what has been substantiated by \nthe many public health, state environmental departments, and \nenvironmental groups opposed to this are the detrimental effects it \nwould have on air quality including ozone levels in many states, \nincluding my own. On behalf of the health of the citizens of our \nrespective states, every Senator in this chamber should oppose this \nblatant and unacceptable change in national air pollution control \npolicy which restricts every state's ability to make decisions that \nbest serve the economic and environmental interests of the state.\n  I support directing more resources to communities that are most in \nneed and facing serious public health and safety threats from \nenvironmental problems. Unfortunately, after a review of this year's \nbill for EPA programs, I do not believe that we are responding to the \nmost urgent environmental needs. Our nation's key environmental laws \nare an empty promise of protection without adequate enforcement. I am \ngratified that Senator Lautenberg's amendment was accepted to bring \nessential enforcement activities at EPA to levels comparable to last \nyear's appropriation. Enforcement actions have been declining \nsignificantly in conjunction with the Administration's enforcement \nbudget cuts. We cannot allow this trend to continue and uphold our \nresponsibility to protect human health\n\n[[Page S14998]]\n\nand our vital natural resources under existing laws.\n  The funding priorities in this bill seem to be slanted toward \nsatisfying parochial and institutional interests rather than providing \nfor robust implementation of national environmental laws. Many of the \nearmarks provided for the EPA are targeted for consortiums, \nuniversities, or foundations. There are many environmental needs in \ncommunities back in my home state of Arizona, but these communities \nwill be denied funding as long as we continue to tolerate earmarking \nthat circumvents a regular merit-review process.\n  For example, some of the earmarks include:\n  An increase of $500,000 for the painting and coating assistance \ninitiative through the University of Northern Iowa;\n  An increase of $500,000 for the Kenai River Center in Kenai, AK;\n  An increase of $1,000,000 for the University of South Alabama for the \nCenter for Estuarine Research;\n  An increase of $250,000 for the Midwest Technology Assistance Center \nat the University of Illinois;\n  An increase of $400,00 for the County of Hawaii and the Hawaii Island \nEconomic Development Board for community-based waste recycling and \nreuse system;\n  An increase of $425,000 for Southeastern Louisiana University for the \nTurtle Cove research station;\n  $1 million for the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, FL for \ncontinued construction of the Tri-County Biosolids Pelletization \nFacility;\n  $600,000 for the City of Jackson, TN for the Sandy Creek Sanitary \nSewer Overflow Project;\n  $1 million for Washoe County, NV for the North Lemmon Valley \nArtificial Recharge Project;\n  $400,000 for Wright City, MO for the construction of an elevated \nwater storage tank; and\n  $300,000 to the City of Lancaster to construct an advanced \nultrafiltration membrane water treatment system in Lancaster County, \nPA.\n  While these projects may be important, why do they rank higher than \nother environmental priorities? It is also important to note that none \nof the earmarks for the EPA were even requested by the President's \nbudget.\n  For independent agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, this bill also includes earmarks of money for locality-\nspecific projects such as:\n  An increase of $2.5 million to Marshall University in Bridgeport, WV \nfor the Hubble Telescope Project;\n  An increase of $2.5 million to the University of Mississippi for the \nEnterprise for Innovative Geospatial Solutions;\n  An increase of $3 million for the University of Alaska for weather \nand ocean research;\n  An increase of $1 million to the Delaware Aerospace Education and \nFoundation in Kent County, DE;\n  An increase of $1.5 million for the Adventure Science Center in \nNashville, TN for the Sudekum Planetarium;\n  An increase of $2 million to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX for \nequipment at the Experimental Sciences Building; and\n  An increase of $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, UT for \nthe Intermountain Region Digital Image Archive and Processing Center.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to what I consider to be a very serious \nfunding issue concerning the future of our space program.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has authorizing jurisdiction over NASA, I am \ngreatly concerned that we apparently have not learned from last \nFebruary's tragic Columbia Space Shuttle accident. What I find to be \nparticularly remarkable is that while the Appropriators were not able \nto fully fund NASA, somehow the accompanying report still earmarks \n$81.6 million worth of pork and unrequested items in NASA's Science, \nAeronautics and Exploration Account. Clearly, now more than ever, we \nshould be doing everything in our power to ensure we aren't short-\nchanging NASA safety needs.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), which was assigned \nto determine the cause of that accident and to prevent future \naccidents, describes NASA as, ``An Agency Trying To Do Too Much With \nToo Little.'' The CAIB report, released in August, describes NASA's \nbudget situation as follows:\n\n       Between 1993 and 2002, the government's discretionary \n     spending grew in purchasing power by more than 25 percent, \n     defense spending by 15 percent, and non-defense spending by \n     40 percent. NASA's budget, in comparison, showed little \n     change, going from $14.31 billion in Fiscal Year 1993 to a \n     low of $13.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2000, and increasing to \n     $14.87 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. This represented a loss \n     of 13 percent in purchasing power over the decade.\n\n  The report also raised very serious concerns regarding how earmarking \nhas restricted NASA's ability to fund its priorities:\n\n       Pressure on NASA's budget has come not only from the White \n     House, but also from the Congress. In recent years there has \n     been an increasing tendency for the Congress to add \n     ``earmarks''--congressional additions to the NASA budget \n     request that reflect targeted Members' interests. These \n     earmarks come out of already-appropriated funds, reducing the \n     amounts available for the original tasks.\n\n  Have we learned nothing from the Shuttle accident and the CAIB report \nfindings? I am afraid not, since this bill does not provide the level \nof funding for NASA and its programs requested by the President, yet \ncontinues the disturbing trend of earmarking NASA's budget in ways that \nhave nothing to do with fulfilling its mission and purpose. We must do \nbetter. As Admiral Gehman testified during one of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's hearings this year, when I asked him about the effects of \nthe $167 million that was earmarked in last year's appropriations bill \n(FY 2003), he said ``$100 million will buy a lot of safety engineers.'' \nUnfortunately, last year's earmarks did not allow for NASA to buy those \nneeded safety engineers.\n  I am not alone in my concern over the earmarks envisioned in this \nbill. The Administration's Statement of Administrative Policy goes so \nfar as to call out an earmark for an entity in Hampton, VA, to prepare \na research budget as ``one particularly troublesome earmark,'' stating \nthat ``[b]udget development is clearly the purview of the executive \nbranch and the Congress and the proposed effort is redundant and \nunnecessary.''\n  I think that it is important to know how we are spending the \ntaxpayers' hard earned money, and have included a list of these \nearmarks at the end of my statement.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss the International Space \nStation (ISS). The bill provides $200 million less than the President's \nrequest at a time when a number of serious safety concerns have been \nraised about the Space Station.\n  For example, William F. Readdy, the NASA Associate Administrator at \nthe Office of Space Flight, testified before the Commerce Committee \nthat the Space Station onboard environmental monitoring system which, \n``provides very high accuracy information on atmospheric composition \nand presence of trace elements . . . is not operating at full \ncapacity.'' He also testified that the crew health countermeasures, \nwhich include an onboard treadmill and associated resistive exercise \ndevices, were ``operating at various degrees of reduced capacity and \nneeded to be repaired, upgraded or replaced.''\n  Recent articles in the Washington Post paint an even more disturbing \npicture. An October 23, 2003, article describes:\n\n       The problems with monitoring environmental conditions \n     aboard the space station have festered for more than a year, \n     some NASA medical officials said. Space station astronauts \n     have shown such symptoms as headaches, dizziness and ``an \n     inability to think clearly,'' according to a medical officer \n     who asked not to be named. The onboard sensors designed to \n     provide real-time analysis of the air, water and radiation \n     levels have been broken for months, which has made it \n     impossible to determine at any given time whether there is a \n     buildup of trace amounts of dangerous chemical compounds that \n     could sicken astronauts, or worse.\n\n  A November 9, 2003, Washington Post article reports that:\n\n       A recent NASA study found that the risk of fire aboard the \n     station has grown because the crew is stowing large \n     quantities of supplies, equipment and waste in front of or \n     near 14 portals that would be crucial for detecting and \n     extinguishing a fire in any of the station's various \n     compartments. There is\n\n[[Page S14999]]\n\n     also concern that a portion of the station's water stores \n     supplied by the Russians may have high levels of carbon \n     tetrachloride, a toxic contaminant.\n\n  This article further stated that:\n\n       As far back as March, internal studies warned of a host of \n     dangers for six separate systems, including the thermal \n     controls that cool the station's computers and interiors, \n     that would likely grow out of trying to run the station with \n     limited supplies and a caretaker crew of two instead of the \n     normal complement of three.\n\n  Before the recent launch of Expedition 8, the Chief of NASA's \nHabitability and Environmental Factors Office and NASA's Chief of Space \nMedicine signed a dissent to the ``flight readiness certificate.'' The \ndissent declared that ``the continued degradation in the environmental \nmonitoring system, exercise countermeasures system, and the health \nmaintenance system, coupled with a planned increment duration of \ngreater than 6 months and extremely limited resupply, all combine to \nincrease the risk to the crew to the point where initiation of [the \nmission] is not recommended.\n  These are very serious issues that cannot be ignored, yet here we \nare, about to approve more than $81 million for unrequested earmarks \nwhile underfunding more pressing needs. How will these cuts to the \nPresident's budget request affect the safety of the space station? Are \nwe really willing to take any risks?\n  Furthermore, how do we explain to the public that we could not find \nthe money to fully fund the International Space Station, but were able \nto earmark $81.6 million worth of pork barrel funding in NASA's \nScience, Aeronautics and Exploration Account? Again, this is the very \ntype of earmarking that the CAIB report identified as serious cause for \nconcern.\n  That this practice continues in the face of legitimate safety \nconcerns is simply unacceptable given the tragedies experienced just \nthis year. When one considers the importance of ensuring the safety of \nthe astronauts aboard the Space Station, don't you have to question the \nfunding priority for projects such as the ultra-long balloon program at \nNew Mexico State University, and the Classroom of the Future at \nWheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia? These and other projects \nare the types of earmarks discussed by the CAIB.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy opposes this $200 million \nreduction, stating that: ``After diligently rebuilding reserves to \nplace the Station on sound financial ground, this reduction would \ndeplete reserves deemed critical by independent cost estimates and \nlimit the program's ability to address risks in FY 2004, including \nimpacts from the Columbia accident.'' In addition, I have been informed \nthat this reduction would place at risk actions that NASA is taking to \naddress the Independent Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task \nForce recommendations to ensure a ``credible'' ISS Program.\n  This bill would also reduce funding for other NASA programs. For \nexample, it would reduce funding for the Global Climate Change Research \nInitiative by $11 million, a decrease of 47 percent. This reduction \nwould significantly impact the development of the Advanced Polarimeter \nSensor, which is designed to measure methane, tropospheric ozone, \naerosols and black carbon in the atmosphere. The proposed reduction \nwould delay the purchase of ``long-lead'' item purchases, which could \npotentially delay the launch date of the satellite from 2007 to 2008.\n  The bill also would reduce funding for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter \n(JIMO) by $20 million. This reduction would disrupt and delay the \nformulation of the JIMO and its associated space nuclear power and \npropulsion technologies. It also would also reduce funding for the \npreparation of solicitations for the science community and science \ninvestigations. In addition, it would reduce funding for spacecraft \nstudies by three competing industry teams, which would result in \ndelayed, less efficient, and disrupted spacecraft conceptual design \nwork. Most importantly, funding for the Department of Energy reactor \nstudies and technology recapture activities would be reduced. The \nreactor is the ``long-lead'' component of JIMO, and any delay to the \nreactor could eventually delay the launch of the vehicle.\n  Finally, the bill would reduce funding for NASA's Earth Science \nApplications by $15 million a 20 percent decrease. This decrease would \nsuspend or terminate projects in over 12 states that support the \nintegration of Earth observations into decision support systems. The \nreduction would also suspend NASA's interagency commitments to \nestablish best-practice solutions for the integration of Earth science \nresearch results into products and services for food and fiber \nproduction, coastal management, energy management, aviation safety, \ndisaster management, and air quality forecasting.\n  It is important to note for all of these projects that further delays \nusually equate to greater cost.\n  I think it is important to comment on the fact that the \nadministration has not provided any cost estimates for the space \nshuttle's return to flight, even though NASA has issued two versions of \nits Return To Flight plan. It is difficult to expect an appropriations \nbill to provide sufficient resources without the relevant information \nfrom NASA regarding the cost of these Shuttle operations, and I \ncontinue to request the administration provide this critical \ninformation to the Congress.\n  The CAIB has listed 15 recommendations that must be implemented \nbefore the Space Shuttle can return to flight. These recommendations \nvary in technical complexity, and include modifying the Memorandum of \nAgreement with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency to ensure that \nimages are taken of each Shuttle while on orbit, and developing a \ncomprehensive inspection plan using non-destructive inspection \ntechnology to determine the structural integrity of all Reinforced \nCarbon-Carbon system components. The CAIB also recommends that NASA \nprepare a detailed plan for establishing an independent Technical \nEngineering Authority, independent safety program, and reorganized \nSpace Shuttle Integration Office. Some of these recommendations will \npotentially be expensive to implement, and the Congress needs to have \nan estimate of their cost soon. We cannot wait until the FY 2005 budget \nsubmission to find out how much Return To Flight activities will cost \nif the Shuttle is expected to fly again next fall.\n  I am also concerned about the Orbital Space Plane program, the \ndevelopment of which is estimated to cost the taxpayers upwards of $15 \nbillion. This amount is already close to the original estimated \ndevelopment costs of $17.4 billion for the International Space Station. \nIt is amazing that the escape vehicle for the station is about to cost \nas much as the Station was originally expected to cost.\n  We must ensure due diligence is taken to protect this public \ninvestment. NASA has limited the competition to two companies, yet it \nhas not provided a sufficient explanation to the authorizing committees \nof jurisdiction as to the merits of such a decision. I am not convinced \nthis will generate either the cost savings or the innovation necessary \nto make this a successful program.\n  Perhaps the more fundamental question is whether the OSP is the right \napproach in the first place. As the rush begins to develop this \nvehicle, many Members in both Houses are not sure how or if this \nproject fits within the overall plans for the future of NASA. I share \nthese concerns.\n  We do not want to make the same mistakes that we made on the ISS. \nThose mistakes cost the American taxpayers dearly as the development \ncosts of the ISS sky-rocketed by more than 50 percent. Even today, we \nstill do not know the final costs of the Station, because of the delay \ncaused by the grounding of the Space Shuttle.\n  I believe it wise to wait for the results of the on-going inter-\nagency review of the nation's space program being undertaken by the \nadministration before we dole out $15 billion that may be inconsistent \nwith the future goals of the space program.\n  We need to make the safety of the astronauts on the space station a \ntop priority. We cannot risk placing the earmarks for parochial \ninterests above the critical need to fund legitimate safety concerns.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are awaiting one more Senator who has an \namendment to be offered. We are getting to the point where we hope we \ncan go to a voice vote on final passage as soon as possible to expedite \nthe work of\n\n[[Page S15000]]\n\nthe committee. I have asked our cloakroom to check to see if the \nSenator is going to be joining us to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers have worked this down to one \namendment being left. There was an agreement this morning, and Senator \nMcCain is willing to take a very short time agreement. I think it is 20 \nminutes evenly divided. This bill will be finished before the normal \nrecess.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I might say to the wonderful \ndistinguished whip and my colleague from Missouri, at 2:30 the Senator \nfrom Maryland, along with the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, are receiving a national award. It will occur in Statuary Hall.\n  It is really important, if the Senator from Arizona could come next, \nwe could finish this bill. It will be very awkward to try to do the \nbill at 2:30. I will be here. I will give up the reception of this \naward. It is really awkward when we are ready to go. I respect the \nimpeccable credentials of the Senator from Arizona on national \nsecurity. We know what he wants to offer. We could deal with this now \nand have him present his arguments and our rebuttal, and perhaps do \nthis before the luncheon recess. We would like to get this done before \nthe Senate recesses for the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for about 3 \nminutes.\n  First, I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their work on this legislation and particularly \nfor their commitment to the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  This is such an important part of what we are as a people. We are a \nnation of explorers. This represents a commitment by the American \npeople to explore our solar system and, as far as possible, the \nuniverse as we know it.\n  We have had a tough year. With the shuttle disaster and seven \nastronauts lost, a tremendous effort has been ongoing to deal with the \nproblem so it will not happen again as part of the return to space \nprogram. It has cost us a good bit of money.\n  It is important to note NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe is doing a \nterrific job. He has served as former Secretary of the Navy, former \nComptroller of the Department of Defense, chaired departments at Johns \nHopkins, Syracuse, Penn State, and has dealt with governmental \nmanagement. He is doing a good job. That was confirmed just 2 days ago \nwhen NASA was rated the best place to work in the Federal Government. \nIn fact, I was particularly proud that Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, AL, the part of NASA where the Saturn 5 was originally set \nup by Werner Von Braun, is rated the best of the best in the entire \nU.S. Government. A lot of good things are happening despite the \ndifficulties.\n  One thing, though, that our leaders were not able to do: Under the \npressure that was upon them, they believed it necessary to reduce the \nInternational Space Station funding by $200 million. I know there is a \nlot of pressure. I understand the difficulties they face. The House has \nnot done that.\n\n  I urge our colleagues as they go to conference--and I intend to \nsupport this bill--to see if we can't get back that $200 million. We \ndon't know all of the challenges they will face, but we know we really \nhave to do a lot of extra work on the return to space. It has drained a \nlot of our money. If we could keep that $200 million in and keep this \nspace station going, I think it would maintain our progressive vision \nfor space and continue our commitment to explore our solar system. I \nthink it is very important.\n  I urge my colleagues to do all they can to see if that can be worked \nout. I thank them for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \ncomments on space exploration and the space station.\n  He noted the delays in the space station operations because of the \nunavailability of the space shuttle. That is one of the reasons we put \nsome of those funds in other priority programs. We are trying to get \nback into space so we can get the space shuttle. We very much \nappreciate that.\n\n\n                          VETERANS' CEMETERIES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator from Missouri \nbe willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with my friend \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I have come to the floor today to speak about \nan issue of great importance; the need to construct new national \nveterans cemeteries.\n  National cemeteries are reaching capacity throughout the United \nStates as veterans, particularly those from World War II and the Korean \nWar, die in increasing numbers. By the end of 2004, only 64 of the 124 \nveterans national cemeteries will be available for both casketed and \ncremated remains.\n  Recognizing the need to establish new cemeteries, Congress recently \npassed the National Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003 (H.R. 1516). This \nbill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to construct a new \nnational veterans cemetery in the following six cities: Jacksonville, \nFL; Sarasota, FL; Birmingham, AL; Bakersfield, CA; Philadelphia, PA; \nand Columbia, SC. These cities were identified by VA as being the areas \nin the greatest need of a new cemetery.\n  As cemetery service capabilities decrease, veterans in areas near \ncemeteries that are at capacity will lose access to burial options \nwithin a reasonable distance of their homes. In order to ensure that \nburial options are provided for veterans and their family members, we \nmust develop new cemeteries and expand existing cemeteries. This \nprocess must start as soon as possible because the construction of a \nnew cemetery takes an average of seven years.\n  I respectfully request that the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee work to include advance planning funds in conference so we \nbegin constructing these new cemeteries and ensure our veterans have \nthe burial options they deserve.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree this is an important issue and I will try to \naddress it in conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman for his efforts and I look forward to the final conference \nreport.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincerest appreciation to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, without whom we could not have \ngotten them done. We were under very tight time pressures and with very \nlimited resources.\n  I express my thanks to the chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Byrd, for making enough money available so we can \nrestore the full amount of funding for veterans health care which was a \ntop priority.\n  This was an extremely difficult year for us. We could not have gotten \nit done without an extremely able staff who worked, I imagine, more \nthan 100 hours a week and 20 hours several days.\n  Thanks on the minority side to Paul Carliner, Alexa Sewell, Gabrielle \nBatkin; and, on my side, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, Allan Cutler, Jennifer \nStoripan, and Rebecca Benn. We sincerely appreciate their good work.\n  I ask my colleague for any comments, and then we are ready to go to \nfinal passage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have fully funded the VA including a \n$1.5 billion increase over the President's request for VA medical care.\n  We have provided $28.5 billion for medical care, a 12 percent \nincrease over last year's level. with no deductibles, no co-pays, and \nno membership fees for veterans. Promises made to our veterans must be \npromises kept and we have kept our promises to veterans in this bill.\n  In the area of housing and community development, we continue our \ncommitment to core housing programs, including Community Development \nBlock Grants, HOME, HOPE VI, and Section 8. These programs provide \nflexible funding for local communities for a range of activities, such \nas new rental housing, rehabilitation of dilapidated properties, and \nchild care centers.\n  Last year, CDBG funds created or retained over 100,000 jobs \nnationwide.\n  We also keep our commitment to the environment helping local \ncommunities protect their citizens' health and their environment.\n  EPA helps communities by cleaning up Brownfields, improving air \nquality,\n\n[[Page S15001]]\n\nand fixing water and sewer systems. We provide $8.2 billion to the EPA, \n$105 million above last year, and $500 million above the President's \nbudget request.\n  In water and sewer needs, communities all across the country are \nfaced with aging water and sewer systems. The costs of fixing and \nmaintaining these aging systems continue to increase. That is why \nSenator Bond and I worked together to restore the administration's $500 \nmillion cut to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund.\n  We have also fully funded environmental cops on the beat so that we \ncatch polluters who threaten public health and the environment.\n  We have provided a record amount for Americorps, $340 million, so \nthat Americorps can enroll more volunteers to serve in our communities.\n  In NASA, we provided the full amount for the Space Shuttle--$3.9 \nbillion. Senator Bond and I have always made the Space Shuttle safety a \npriority.\n  The bill also funded all major programs in space science, earth \nscience, and aeronautics.\n  In order to keep our manufacturing jobs here, we increase our \ninvestment in the National Science Foundation. We win the Nobel Prizes, \nand they win the markets. That is why we provide NSF with the largest \nbudget in its history.\n  We have increased funding for education to attract and train more \nscientists, engineers and teachers of science.\n  Again, I joined this Subcommittee to meet the needs of our veterans, \nempower communities, and create new jobs. This bill has accomplished \nall three goals.\n  I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for the wonderful job he has done \non this bill on the part of representing the Democratic side. I thank \nhim for all the courtesies and collegiality. Most of all, I thank him \nfor really not playing politics with veterans health care, as I did \nnot. As we approached this bill, when it came to looking out for \nveterans health care, we weren't the Republican Party; we weren't the \nDemocratic Party; we were the red, white, and blue party. Therefore, we \ncould raise the funding for veterans medical care by 12 percent with no \ndeductibles, with no new deductibles, no new copayments, and no \nmembership fees. That was due in large part to our mutual advocacy and \nthe wonderful cooperation of Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd.\n  I joined this subcommittee for two reasons: To meet the day-to-day \nneeds of my constituents--our veterans--housing, the environment; and \nthe long-range investments needed for our country in science and \ntechnology. I believe we have accomplished both.\n  I also thank the staff who enabled us to do this: On my own side, \nPaul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin, Alexa Sewell, and Jennifer Storipan; \nand the staff of the distinguished Senator from Missouri: Jon Karmarck, \nCheh Kim, Allan Cutler, and Rebecca Benn.\n  I also thank the floor staff of both the majority and the minority \nwho helped us expedite the bill. No kinder words could be said by me \nthan to express my gratitude to Senator Harry Reid, the whip on our \nside, who really also helped bring this bill to closure. This is why we \ncome to the Senate, to try to use the taxpayers' money in a wise way. \nIt keeps promises made to our U.S. veterans, but adds value to our \ncountry, whether through empowering neighborhoods, protecting the \nenvironment, or investing in science and technology so we not only win \nthe Nobel Prizes but we win the markets.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. We are ready for final passage.\n  The amendment (No. 2150), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2861), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2861\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2861) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Veteran Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for \n     sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2004, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       Compensation and Pensions\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 \n     U.S.C.

That \n     driving time is 30 minutes for veterans living in urban and \n     rural areas and 60 minutes for veterans living in highly \n     rural areas.\n       (3) The Draft National CARES Plan issued by the Under \n     Secretary for Health would place veterans in 18 rural and \n     highly rural regional markets outside the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care until at least \n     fiscal year 2022, which means that thousands of veterans will \n     have to continuing traveling up to 3-4 hours each way to \n     visit a Department primary care facility.\n       (4) The 18 rural and highly rural markets that will remain \n     outside the Department accessibility standard for primary \n     health care comprise all or parts of Arkansas, Idaho, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, \n     Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North \n     Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, \n     Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n       (5) Health care facilities for veterans are \n     disproportionately needed in rural and highly rural areas \n     because the residents of such areas are generally older, \n     poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the CARES Commission should give as much attention to \n     solving the special needs of veterans who live in rural areas \n     as it does to providing for the health care needs of veterans \n     living in more highly populated areas;\n       (2) the CARES Commission should reject the portions of the \n     Draft National CARES Plan that would prevent any regional \n     market of the Department from complying with the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care, which \n     provides that at least 70 percent of the veterans residing in \n     each market be within specified driving times of a Department \n     primary care facility; and\n       (3) the CARES Commission should recommend to the Secretary \n     the investments and initiatives that are necessary to achieve \n     the Department accessibility standard for primary health care \n     in each of the rural and highly rural health care markets of \n     the Department.\n       Sec. 120. Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine \n     of the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement the \n     Institute of Medicine shall develop and evaluate \n     epidemiological studies on Vietnam veterans in accordance \n     with the recommendations of the 2003 National Academy of \n     Sciences report entitled ``Characterizing Exposure of \n     Veterans to Agent Orange and Other Herbicides Used in \n     Vietnam: Interim Findings and Recommendations''.\n       Sec. 121. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs by this Act or any \n     other Act may be obligated or expended to implement the \n     policy contained in the memorandum of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs dated July 18, 2002, from the Deputy Under \n     Secretary for Health for Operations and Management with the \n     subject ``Status of VHA Enrollment and Associated Issues'' or \n     any other policy prohibiting the Directors of the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) from conducting outreach \n     or marketing to enroll new veterans within their Networks.\n\n         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n                       Public and Indian Housing\n\n\n

    heading to fund all voucher needs in this fiscal year: \n     Provided further, That if a public housing agency, at any \n     point in time during their fiscal year, has obligated the \n     amounts made available to such agency pursuant to paragraph \n     (1) under this heading for the renewal of expiring section 8 \n     tenant-based annual contributions contracts, and if such \n     agency has expended 50 percent of the amounts available to \n     such agency in its annual contributions contract reserve \n     account, the Secretary shall make available such amounts as \n     are

Sense of the Senate. (a) Findings.--The Senate \n     finds that--\n       (1) 30 percent of American families have housing \n     affordability problems, with 14,300,000 families paying more \n     than half of their income for housing costs, and 17,300,000 \n     families paying 30 to 50 percent of their income towards \n     housing costs;\n       (2) 9,300,000 American families live in housing that is \n     overcrowded or distressed;\n       (3) 3,500,000 households in the United States will \n     experience homelessness at some point this year, including \n     1,350,000 children;\n       (4) the number of working families who are unable to afford \n     adequate housing is increasing, as the gap between wages and \n     housing costs grows;\n       (5) there is no county or metropolitan area in the country \n     where a minimum wage earner can afford to rent a modest 2-\n     bedroom apartment, and on average, a family must earn over \n     $15 an hour to afford modest rental housing, which is almost \n     3 times the minimum wage;\n       (6) section 8 housing vouchers help approximately 2,000,000 \n     families with children, senior citizens, and disabled \n     individuals afford a safe and decent place to live;\n       (7) utilization of vouchers is at a high of 96 percent, and \n     is on course to rise to 97 percent in fiscal year 2004, \n     according to data provided by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development;\n       (8) the average cost per voucher has also steadily \n     increased from just over $6,400 in August of 2002, to $6,756 \n     in April, 2003, due largely to rising rents in the private \n     market, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \n     the cost per voucher in fiscal year 2004 will be $7,028, $560 \n     more per voucher than the estimate contained in the fiscal \n     year 2004 budget request; and\n       (9) the congressionally appointed, bipartisan Millennial \n     Housing Commission found that housing vouchers are ``the \n     linchpin of a national housing policy providing very low-\n     income renters access to privately-owned housing stock''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) housing vouchers are a critical resource in ensuring \n     that families in America can afford safe, decent, and \n     adequate housing;\n       (2) public housing agencies must retain the ability to use \n     100 percent of their authorized vouchers to help house low-\n     income families; and\n       (3) the Senate expects the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development to take all necessary actions to encourage full \n     utilization of vouchers, and to use all legally available \n     resources as needed to support full funding for housing \n     vouchers in fiscal year 2004, so that every voucher can be \n     used by a family in need.\n       Sec. 419. Section 106(d) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5306(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``shall not exceed 2 \n     percent'' and inserting ``shall not, subject to paragraph \n     (6), exceed 3 percent'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``not to exceed 1 \n     percent'' and inserting ``subject to paragraph (6), not to \n     exceed 3 percent'';\n       (3) by redesignating the second paragraph (5) and paragraph \n     (6) as paragraphs (7) and (8), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following:\n       ``(6) Of the amounts received under paragraph (1), the \n     State may deduct not more than an aggregate total of 3 \n     percent of such amounts for--\n       ``(A) administrative expenses under paragraph (3)(A); and\n       ``(B) technical assistance under paragraph (5).''.\n       Sec. 420.

Section 221 of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1301) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f), by striking ``2002 and 2003'' and \n     inserting ``2005 and 2006'';\n       (2) in subsection (g)(1)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2002'' and \n     inserting ``2005''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2002'' and inserting ``2005'';\n       (3) in subsection (g)(2)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2003'' and \n     inserting ``2006''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2006''; and\n       (4) in subsection (i), by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2006''.\n       Sec. 421. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm (in this section, collectively referred to as the \n     ``First Gulf War''), the regime of Saddam Hussein committed \n     grave human rights abuses and acts of terrorism against the \n     people of Iraq and citizens of the United States.\n       (2) United States citizens who were taken prisoner by the \n     regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War were \n     brutally tortured and forced to endure severe physical trauma \n     and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The regime of Saddam Hussein used civilian citizens of \n     the United States who were working in the Persian Gulf region \n     before and during the First Gulf War as so-called human \n     shields, threatening the personal safety and emotional well-\n     being of such civilians.\n       (4) Congress has recognized and authorized the right of \n     United States citizens, including prisoners of war, to hold \n     terrorist states, such as Iraq during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, liable for injuries caused by such states.\n       (5) The United States district courts are authorized to \n     adjudicate cases brought by individuals injured by terrorist \n     states.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) notwithstanding section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 \n     Stat. 579) and any other provision of law, a citizen of the \n     United States who was a prisoner of war or who was used by \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein and by Iraq as a so-called human \n     shield during the First Gulf War should have the opportunity \n     to have any claim for damages caused by the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein and by Iraq incurred by such citizen fully \n     adjudicated in the appropriate United States district court;\n       (2) any judgment for such damages awarded to such citizen, \n     or the family of such citizen, should be fully enforced; and\n       (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations \n     with each such citizen, or the family of each such citizen, \n     to develop a fair and reasonable method of providing \n     compensation for the damages each such citizen incurred, \n     including using assets of the regime of Saddam Hussein held \n     by the Government of the United States or any other \n     appropriate sources to provide such compensation.\n       Sec. 422. None of the funds provided in this Act may be \n     expended to apply, in a numerical estimate of the benefits of \n     an agency action prepared pursuant to Executive Order 12866 \n     or section 812 of the Clean Air Act, monetary values for \n     adult premature mortality that differ based on the age of the \n     adult.\n       Sec. 423.

(a) Extension.--The \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall extend the \n     term of the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement entered \n     into between a public housing agency and the Secretary under \n     section 204, title V, of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions \n     and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134, April 26, \n     1996) if--\n       (1) the public housing agency requests such extension in \n     writing;\n       (2) the public housing agency is not at the time of such \n     request for extension in default under its Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement; and\n       (3) the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement to be \n     extended would otherwise expire on or before December 31, \n     2004.\n       (b) Terms.--Unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the public housing agency otherwise agree, \n     the extension under subsection (a) shall be upon the \n     identical terms and conditions set forth in the extending \n     agency's existing Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement, \n     except that for each public housing agency that has been or \n     will be granted an extension to its original Moving to Work \n     agreement, the Secretary shall require that data be collected \n     so that the effect of Moving to Work policy changes on \n     residents can be measured.\n       (c) Extension Period.--The extension under subsection (a) \n     shall be for such period as is requested by the public \n     housing agency, not to exceed 3 years from the date of \n     expiration of the extending agency's existing Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement.\n       (d) Breach of Agreement.--Nothing contained in this section \n     shall limit the authority of the Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development to terminate any Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement of a public housing agency if the \n     public housing agency is in breach of the provisions of such \n     agreement.\n       Sec. 424.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my appreciation to Chairman Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their hard work in developing the Senate fiscal year 2004 \nVA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. Considering the \nlow authorization level for this important bill, they have done an \nexcellent job maintaining priorities in Veterans health care, the \nenvironment and housing. It is vital that the full Senate-passed amount \nfor Veterans healthcare be maintained in conference so that we don't \nlose more ground in caring for those who have borne the battle. \nHowever, it is obvious that additional resources are critically needed \nfor many programs in these areas if they are to work as intended.\n  Understanding the difficult authorization level facing this \ncommittee, I would still like to express my strong support for \nadditional funding for YouthBuild in the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies conference report. Despite the repeated support of \nover 57 of our Senate colleagues for a funding level of $90 million, \nand despite the President's Budget request and House-passed level of \n$65 million, the Senate bill could only provide $60 million for a \nprogram that has proven its value and that is crucial to the lives of \nmany young people. At the same time, 1,400 YouthBuild participants who \nare building housing for homeless and low-income people have lost \naccess to AmeriCorps education awards due to the cutbacks in \nAmeriCorps.\n  Each year, YouthBuild receives strong bipartisan support because the \nprogram works. Eighty-five percent of students who complete the \nYouthBuild program either secure a job--at an average wage of more than \n$7.60 per hour--or go on to postsecondary education. The program's \nsuccess rate is especially notable since YouthBuild serves an at-risk \npopulation, 80 percent of whom have previously dropped out of high \nschool.\n  YouthBuild is a uniquely comprehensive program that offers at-risk \nyouth an immediately productive role rebuilding their communities. \nAlong with attending basic education classes for 50 percent of the \nprogram time, students receive job skills training in the well-paid \nconstruction field, personal counseling from respected mentors, a \nsupportive peer group with positive values, and experience in community \nleadership and civic engagement. To date, 25,000 YouthBuild students \nhave built over 10,000 units of affordable housing.\n  Despite its obvious success, YouthBuild is losing ground with more \nthan 30 sites that have closed due to lack of funds since 1996. Most of \nthe remaining programs enroll 25 percent fewer students than they did \nin 1997. In 2001, 56 experienced YouthBuild sites that qualified for \nfunding from HUD did not receive it solely due to a lack of funding. \nOnly two local programs have been funded continuously since 1994.\n  During the House-Senate conference, I hope that the Senate will yield \nto the House and provide $65 million for YouthBuild as the President \nhas requested and the House of Representatives has provided. This is \nthe least we can do. We must continue to fight to open the doors of \nopportunity and service to America's youth by supporting \nYouthBuild.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their hard work on this important legislation \nwhich provides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. \nUnfortunately, I must again speak about the unacceptably high funding \nlevels of parochial projects in this appropriations bill. Overall, this \nlegislation contains approximately $1.2 billion in unrequested spending \nand locality-specific earmarks.\n  The Committee provides $29.3 billion in discretionary funding for the \nVA. That amount is $1.3 billion more than the President's budget \nrequest and $2.8 billion above the amount in fiscal year 2003. Some \nprogress has been made to reduce the overall amount of earmarks for the \nVA in this spending bill.\n  Among other Senators who have stood on the Senate floor to fight for \nadditional funding for veterans' healthcare, I am concerned that the \nCommittee has directed critical dollars from veterans' healthcare to \nfund spending projects that have not been properly reviewed. Certain \nprovisions funded under the VA in this legislation illustrate that \nCongress still does not have its priorities in order.\n  One especially troubling expense, neither budgeted for nor requested \nby the Administration over the past twelve years, is a provision that \ndirects the VA to continue the twelve year old demonstration project \ninvolving the Clarksburg, WV, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) \nand the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Several \nyears ago, the VA-HUD appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 \nmillion for the Clarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's \nline-item veto list and since then the millions keep flowing.\n  Three years ago, the Committee `recommended' $1 million for the \ndesign of a nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV, VAMC. Two years \nago they strengthened their report language urging `the VA to \naccelerate the design of the nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV \nVAMC.'' Last year, they have urged the VA ``to include sufficient \nfunding'' for a new nursing home care unit at the Beckley, WV VAMC. \nThis year, they urge the VA to include sufficient funding in the 2005 \nbudget request.\n  For St. Louis, MO, the Committee `encouraged' the VA to pursue an \ninnovative approach at a cost of $7 million for leasing parking spaces \nat the John Cochran Division of the VA Medical Center in St. Louis as a \nmeans to address a parking shortfall at the VA hospital.\n  Additionally, the Committee ``supports continuation'' at the current \nspending level of the Rural Veterans Health Care Initiative at the \nWhite River Junction, VT VAMC. The current level is an astounding $7 \nmillion.\n  While I am encouraged by the increase specifically in veterans health \ncare funding over last year's enacted levels, we must do much more. We \nmade a promise to our veterans that we would take care of their mental \nand physical health needs incurred for their many sacrifices for our \nnation. The VA currently has an incredible backlog of claims. \nCurrently, four out of every ten claims for veterans' disability \nbenefits are decided incorrectly further contributing to the backlog. \nThe millions in dollars wasted in pork barrel spending would go a long \nway to decreasing the backlog in veterans claims by funding additional \nclaims adjudicators and training.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out the provisions in this \nlegislation related to AmeriCorps. Whether it is tutoring inner-city \nyouth or fighting forest fires in the West, the lives of countless \npeople are touched by AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps' efforts to reach out to \nthose affected by natural disasters are paying serious dividends. Over \n246,000 victims of fires, floods and hurricanes have been aided by \nAmeriCorps volunteers working in conjunction with groups such as the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  Despite AmeriCorps' countless success stories, the appropriators have \nfunded AmeriCorps $93.2 million below\n\n[[Page S14997]]\n\nthe President's request, while imposing incredibly restrictive report \nlanguage that could very well fundamentally change the face of a very \nsuccessful program.\n  I was heartened when I saw that the President requested funding to \nexpand AmeriCorps to 75,000 volunteers in Fiscal Year 2004. This was an \nimportant first step on the road to large scale expansion of \nAmeriCorps. Despite the President's request, the appropriators took it \nupon themselves to ensure that we do not provide adequate funding to \nreach this ambitious level set forth by the President. The \nAppropriations Committee's counterparts in the House of Representatives \nfunded AmeriCorps with $23.4 million more than the Senate, yet only \nbelieve that they can fund 55,000 volunteers.\n  Everybody is well aware of money management problems that the \nCorporation for National Service and AmeriCorps have faced over the \nlast few years. I am confident that the change in leadership at the \ncorporation should help minimize the potential for these same problems \nto repeat themselves. However, if we do not provide the amount of money \nthe corporation says it will need to fully fund 75,000 volunteers, we \nare inviting a disastrous repeat of history. If we do not want to \nrepeat this summer's battle for supplemental funds for AmeriCorps, we \nmust fully fund AmeriCorps to the level that the Corporation feels is \nadequate, not the appropriators.\n  The last authorization for the AmeriCorps program lapsed in 1996. It \nis time to reauthorize the program. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has oversight responsibility for this program. It is \ntime that we hold hearings to reauthorize this program and markup the \nCall to Service Act, which I authored with Senator Bayh and Senator \nKennedy. If there is a need to impose restrictions on how AmeriCorps \nchooses its volunteers or how awards are given out, the HELP committee \nis where that debate needs to take place, not by the appropriators, \nwithout so much as a hearing. We have no idea what effect the \nrestrictions in this legislation will have on AmeriCorps. We have not \nbothered to run them by the Corporation. Mr. President, we are failing \nin our oversight responsibilities.\n  The overwhelming support for AmeriCorps among the grassroots groups \nis clear. Recently, an event called Voices for AmeriCorps was staged. \nThis 100-hour event featured 130 AmeriCorps Alumni and 51 Members of \nCongress. In all over 700 people, representing 47 states expressed \ntheir support for AmeriCorps. During the summer, letters were sent to \nthe President urging him to support an emergency appropriation request \nfor AmeriCorps. These letters were sent by a bipartisan group of 79 \nSenators, 228 members of the House of Representatives, 44 Governors and \n148 Mayors. The list of supporters is not restricted to elected \nofficials. 250 private sector leaders took out a full page ad in The \nNew York Times expressing support. 1100 community organizations have \nshown their support. The support for AmeriCorps is clear. It is time \nthat we acknowledge their efforts and not only fully fund the \nPresident's request but expand AmeriCorps to new levels.\n  This legislation also contains the funding for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. The programs administered by HUD help \nour nation's families purchase their homes, helps many low-income \nfamilies obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the \nhousing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our \nnation's most vulnerable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged--have \naccess to safe and affordable housing\n  Unfortunately, this bill shifts money away from many critical housing \nand community programs by bypassing the appropriate competitive process \nand inserting earmarks and set-asides for special projects that \nreceived the attention of the Appropriations Committee. This is unfair \nto the many communities and families who do not have the good fortune \nof residing in a region of the country represented by a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  In the report accompanying this bill, the Appropriators have taken \ntwo accounts, originally created as competitive grant programs to be \nadministered by HUD, and earmarked close to 100% of those accounts. \nThis bill funds the Economic Development Initiative at $140 million. \nHowever, the report lists 331 earmarks for that program, totaling over \n$136 million. Similarly, the committee funds the Neighborhood \nInitiatives program at $21 million, with report language listing 20 \nearmarks, totaling over $20 million. I am deeply concerned that once \ncompetitive programs have become nothing more than slush funds to \nfulfill influential members' parochial interests.\n  Some of the earmarks for special projects in this legislation \ninclude:\n  $1,000,000 for the Tongass Coast Aquarium in Ketchikan, AK for \nimprovements;\n  $400,000 for Love, Inc. in Fairbanks, AK for a social service \nfacility;\n  $250,000 for the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage for \nimprovements;\n  $1,000,000 for Fort Westernaire in Golden, CO for the expansion of \nthe Westernaire museum;\n  $500,000 for Miami Dade County, FL for the construction of the Miami \nDade County Performing Arts Center;\n\n  $500,000 for the Hawaii Nature Center in Wailuku, HI for the Maui \nRenovation Project;\n  $500,000 for the Field Museum in Chicago, IL;\n  $100,000 for the Iowa State Fair Board in DesMoines, IA for a \nstatewide awareness and education/exhibit.\n  $280,000 for the City of Waterloo, IA for the John Deere brownfield \nand bio-based incubator project;\n  $500,000 for the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD for building \nrenovations;\n  $187,500 for Heartland Corn Products in Winthrop, MN for construction \nof a new facility;\n  $100,000 for the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hateras, NC to \ncomplete construction;\n  $450,000 for the Johnny Appleseed Heritage Center, Inc. in Ashland \nCounty, OH for construction of facilities;\n  $200,000 for Holt Hotel in Wichita Falls, TX for continued \nrenovations to the Holt Hotel;\n  $250,000 for the Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser, WA \nfor costs associated with its construction;\n  $500,000 for Appalachian Bible College in Beckley, WV to complete its \nlibrary resource center; and\n  $1,000,000 for the Huntington Area Development Council in Huntington, \nWV for the construction of a business incubator.\n  This bill also funds the Environmental Protection Agency which \nprovides resources to help state, local and tribal communities enhance \ncapacity and infrastructure to better address their environmental \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, the most egregious provision under the EPA section is \nthe language that would significantly change states' authority under \nthe Clean Air Act in order to protect an engine manufacturer in \nMissouri. This policy change has been advanced to serve the concerns of \nBriggs and Stratton, although its September 2003 filing to the SEC \nindicated that there would not be ``a material effect on its financial \ncondition or results of operations'' and it has not been able to \nsubstantiate job loss claims. However, what has been substantiated by \nthe many public health, state environmental departments, and \nenvironmental groups opposed to this are the detrimental effects it \nwould have on air quality including ozone levels in many states, \nincluding my own. On behalf of the health of the citizens of our \nrespective states, every Senator in this chamber should oppose this \nblatant and unacceptable change in national air pollution control \npolicy which restricts every state's ability to make decisions that \nbest serve the economic and environmental interests of the state.\n  I support directing more resources to communities that are most in \nneed and facing serious public health and safety threats from \nenvironmental problems. Unfortunately, after a review of this year's \nbill for EPA programs, I do not believe that we are responding to the \nmost urgent environmental needs. Our nation's key environmental laws \nare an empty promise of protection without adequate enforcement. I am \ngratified that Senator Lautenberg's amendment was accepted to bring \nessential enforcement activities at EPA to levels comparable to last \nyear's appropriation. Enforcement actions have been declining \nsignificantly in conjunction with the Administration's enforcement \nbudget cuts. We cannot allow this trend to continue and uphold our \nresponsibility to protect human health\n\n[[Page S14998]]\n\nand our vital natural resources under existing laws.\n  The funding priorities in this bill seem to be slanted toward \nsatisfying parochial and institutional interests rather than providing \nfor robust implementation of national environmental laws. Many of the \nearmarks provided for the EPA are targeted for consortiums, \nuniversities, or foundations. There are many environmental needs in \ncommunities back in my home state of Arizona, but these communities \nwill be denied funding as long as we continue to tolerate earmarking \nthat circumvents a regular merit-review process.\n  For example, some of the earmarks include:\n  An increase of $500,000 for the painting and coating assistance \ninitiative through the University of Northern Iowa;\n  An increase of $500,000 for the Kenai River Center in Kenai, AK;\n  An increase of $1,000,000 for the University of South Alabama for the \nCenter for Estuarine Research;\n  An increase of $250,000 for the Midwest Technology Assistance Center \nat the University of Illinois;\n  An increase of $400,00 for the County of Hawaii and the Hawaii Island \nEconomic Development Board for community-based waste recycling and \nreuse system;\n  An increase of $425,000 for Southeastern Louisiana University for the \nTurtle Cove research station;\n  $1 million for the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, FL for \ncontinued construction of the Tri-County Biosolids Pelletization \nFacility;\n  $600,000 for the City of Jackson, TN for the Sandy Creek Sanitary \nSewer Overflow Project;\n  $1 million for Washoe County, NV for the North Lemmon Valley \nArtificial Recharge Project;\n  $400,000 for Wright City, MO for the construction of an elevated \nwater storage tank; and\n  $300,000 to the City of Lancaster to construct an advanced \nultrafiltration membrane water treatment system in Lancaster County, \nPA.\n  While these projects may be important, why do they rank higher than \nother environmental priorities? It is also important to note that none \nof the earmarks for the EPA were even requested by the President's \nbudget.\n  For independent agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, this bill also includes earmarks of money for locality-\nspecific projects such as:\n  An increase of $2.5 million to Marshall University in Bridgeport, WV \nfor the Hubble Telescope Project;\n  An increase of $2.5 million to the University of Mississippi for the \nEnterprise for Innovative Geospatial Solutions;\n  An increase of $3 million for the University of Alaska for weather \nand ocean research;\n  An increase of $1 million to the Delaware Aerospace Education and \nFoundation in Kent County, DE;\n  An increase of $1.5 million for the Adventure Science Center in \nNashville, TN for the Sudekum Planetarium;\n  An increase of $2 million to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX for \nequipment at the Experimental Sciences Building; and\n  An increase of $1 million to Utah State University in Logan, UT for \nthe Intermountain Region Digital Image Archive and Processing Center.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to what I consider to be a very serious \nfunding issue concerning the future of our space program.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has authorizing jurisdiction over NASA, I am \ngreatly concerned that we apparently have not learned from last \nFebruary's tragic Columbia Space Shuttle accident. What I find to be \nparticularly remarkable is that while the Appropriators were not able \nto fully fund NASA, somehow the accompanying report still earmarks \n$81.6 million worth of pork and unrequested items in NASA's Science, \nAeronautics and Exploration Account. Clearly, now more than ever, we \nshould be doing everything in our power to ensure we aren't short-\nchanging NASA safety needs.\n  The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), which was assigned \nto determine the cause of that accident and to prevent future \naccidents, describes NASA as, ``An Agency Trying To Do Too Much With \nToo Little.'' The CAIB report, released in August, describes NASA's \nbudget situation as follows:\n\n       Between 1993 and 2002, the government's discretionary \n     spending grew in purchasing power by more than 25 percent, \n     defense spending by 15 percent, and non-defense spending by \n     40 percent. NASA's budget, in comparison, showed little \n     change, going from $14.31 billion in Fiscal Year 1993 to a \n     low of $13.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2000, and increasing to \n     $14.87 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. This represented a loss \n     of 13 percent in purchasing power over the decade.\n\n  The report also raised very serious concerns regarding how earmarking \nhas restricted NASA's ability to fund its priorities:\n\n       Pressure on NASA's budget has come not only from the White \n     House, but also from the Congress. In recent years there has \n     been an increasing tendency for the Congress to add \n     ``earmarks''--congressional additions to the NASA budget \n     request that reflect targeted Members' interests. These \n     earmarks come out of already-appropriated funds, reducing the \n     amounts available for the original tasks.\n\n  Have we learned nothing from the Shuttle accident and the CAIB report \nfindings? I am afraid not, since this bill does not provide the level \nof funding for NASA and its programs requested by the President, yet \ncontinues the disturbing trend of earmarking NASA's budget in ways that \nhave nothing to do with fulfilling its mission and purpose. We must do \nbetter. As Admiral Gehman testified during one of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's hearings this year, when I asked him about the effects of \nthe $167 million that was earmarked in last year's appropriations bill \n(FY 2003), he said ``$100 million will buy a lot of safety engineers.'' \nUnfortunately, last year's earmarks did not allow for NASA to buy those \nneeded safety engineers.\n  I am not alone in my concern over the earmarks envisioned in this \nbill. The Administration's Statement of Administrative Policy goes so \nfar as to call out an earmark for an entity in Hampton, VA, to prepare \na research budget as ``one particularly troublesome earmark,'' stating \nthat ``[b]udget development is clearly the purview of the executive \nbranch and the Congress and the proposed effort is redundant and \nunnecessary.''\n  I think that it is important to know how we are spending the \ntaxpayers' hard earned money, and have included a list of these \nearmarks at the end of my statement.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss the International Space \nStation (ISS). The bill provides $200 million less than the President's \nrequest at a time when a number of serious safety concerns have been \nraised about the Space Station.\n  For example, William F. Readdy, the NASA Associate Administrator at \nthe Office of Space Flight, testified before the Commerce Committee \nthat the Space Station onboard environmental monitoring system which, \n``provides very high accuracy information on atmospheric composition \nand presence of trace elements . . . is not operating at full \ncapacity.'' He also testified that the crew health countermeasures, \nwhich include an onboard treadmill and associated resistive exercise \ndevices, were ``operating at various degrees of reduced capacity and \nneeded to be repaired, upgraded or replaced.''\n  Recent articles in the Washington Post paint an even more disturbing \npicture. An October 23, 2003, article describes:\n\n       The problems with monitoring environmental conditions \n     aboard the space station have festered for more than a year, \n     some NASA medical officials said. Space station astronauts \n     have shown such symptoms as headaches, dizziness and ``an \n     inability to think clearly,'' according to a medical officer \n     who asked not to be named. The onboard sensors designed to \n     provide real-time analysis of the air, water and radiation \n     levels have been broken for months, which has made it \n     impossible to determine at any given time whether there is a \n     buildup of trace amounts of dangerous chemical compounds that \n     could sicken astronauts, or worse.\n\n  A November 9, 2003, Washington Post article reports that:\n\n       A recent NASA study found that the risk of fire aboard the \n     station has grown because the crew is stowing large \n     quantities of supplies, equipment and waste in front of or \n     near 14 portals that would be crucial for detecting and \n     extinguishing a fire in any of the station's various \n     compartments. There is\n\n[[Page S14999]]\n\n     also concern that a portion of the station's water stores \n     supplied by the Russians may have high levels of carbon \n     tetrachloride, a toxic contaminant.\n\n  This article further stated that:\n\n       As far back as March, internal studies warned of a host of \n     dangers for six separate systems, including the thermal \n     controls that cool the station's computers and interiors, \n     that would likely grow out of trying to run the station with \n     limited supplies and a caretaker crew of two instead of the \n     normal complement of three.\n\n  Before the recent launch of Expedition 8, the Chief of NASA's \nHabitability and Environmental Factors Office and NASA's Chief of Space \nMedicine signed a dissent to the ``flight readiness certificate.'' The \ndissent declared that ``the continued degradation in the environmental \nmonitoring system, exercise countermeasures system, and the health \nmaintenance system, coupled with a planned increment duration of \ngreater than 6 months and extremely limited resupply, all combine to \nincrease the risk to the crew to the point where initiation of [the \nmission] is not recommended.\n  These are very serious issues that cannot be ignored, yet here we \nare, about to approve more than $81 million for unrequested earmarks \nwhile underfunding more pressing needs. How will these cuts to the \nPresident's budget request affect the safety of the space station? Are \nwe really willing to take any risks?\n  Furthermore, how do we explain to the public that we could not find \nthe money to fully fund the International Space Station, but were able \nto earmark $81.6 million worth of pork barrel funding in NASA's \nScience, Aeronautics and Exploration Account? Again, this is the very \ntype of earmarking that the CAIB report identified as serious cause for \nconcern.\n  That this practice continues in the face of legitimate safety \nconcerns is simply unacceptable given the tragedies experienced just \nthis year. When one considers the importance of ensuring the safety of \nthe astronauts aboard the Space Station, don't you have to question the \nfunding priority for projects such as the ultra-long balloon program at \nNew Mexico State University, and the Classroom of the Future at \nWheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia? These and other projects \nare the types of earmarks discussed by the CAIB.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy opposes this $200 million \nreduction, stating that: ``After diligently rebuilding reserves to \nplace the Station on sound financial ground, this reduction would \ndeplete reserves deemed critical by independent cost estimates and \nlimit the program's ability to address risks in FY 2004, including \nimpacts from the Columbia accident.'' In addition, I have been informed \nthat this reduction would place at risk actions that NASA is taking to \naddress the Independent Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task \nForce recommendations to ensure a ``credible'' ISS Program.\n  This bill would also reduce funding for other NASA programs. For \nexample, it would reduce funding for the Global Climate Change Research \nInitiative by $11 million, a decrease of 47 percent. This reduction \nwould significantly impact the development of the Advanced Polarimeter \nSensor, which is designed to measure methane, tropospheric ozone, \naerosols and black carbon in the atmosphere. The proposed reduction \nwould delay the purchase of ``long-lead'' item purchases, which could \npotentially delay the launch date of the satellite from 2007 to 2008.\n  The bill also would reduce funding for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter \n(JIMO) by $20 million. This reduction would disrupt and delay the \nformulation of the JIMO and its associated space nuclear power and \npropulsion technologies. It also would also reduce funding for the \npreparation of solicitations for the science community and science \ninvestigations. In addition, it would reduce funding for spacecraft \nstudies by three competing industry teams, which would result in \ndelayed, less efficient, and disrupted spacecraft conceptual design \nwork. Most importantly, funding for the Department of Energy reactor \nstudies and technology recapture activities would be reduced. The \nreactor is the ``long-lead'' component of JIMO, and any delay to the \nreactor could eventually delay the launch of the vehicle.\n  Finally, the bill would reduce funding for NASA's Earth Science \nApplications by $15 million a 20 percent decrease. This decrease would \nsuspend or terminate projects in over 12 states that support the \nintegration of Earth observations into decision support systems. The \nreduction would also suspend NASA's interagency commitments to \nestablish best-practice solutions for the integration of Earth science \nresearch results into products and services for food and fiber \nproduction, coastal management, energy management, aviation safety, \ndisaster management, and air quality forecasting.\n  It is important to note for all of these projects that further delays \nusually equate to greater cost.\n  I think it is important to comment on the fact that the \nadministration has not provided any cost estimates for the space \nshuttle's return to flight, even though NASA has issued two versions of \nits Return To Flight plan. It is difficult to expect an appropriations \nbill to provide sufficient resources without the relevant information \nfrom NASA regarding the cost of these Shuttle operations, and I \ncontinue to request the administration provide this critical \ninformation to the Congress.\n  The CAIB has listed 15 recommendations that must be implemented \nbefore the Space Shuttle can return to flight. These recommendations \nvary in technical complexity, and include modifying the Memorandum of \nAgreement with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency to ensure that \nimages are taken of each Shuttle while on orbit, and developing a \ncomprehensive inspection plan using non-destructive inspection \ntechnology to determine the structural integrity of all Reinforced \nCarbon-Carbon system components. The CAIB also recommends that NASA \nprepare a detailed plan for establishing an independent Technical \nEngineering Authority, independent safety program, and reorganized \nSpace Shuttle Integration Office. Some of these recommendations will \npotentially be expensive to implement, and the Congress needs to have \nan estimate of their cost soon. We cannot wait until the FY 2005 budget \nsubmission to find out how much Return To Flight activities will cost \nif the Shuttle is expected to fly again next fall.\n  I am also concerned about the Orbital Space Plane program, the \ndevelopment of which is estimated to cost the taxpayers upwards of $15 \nbillion. This amount is already close to the original estimated \ndevelopment costs of $17.4 billion for the International Space Station. \nIt is amazing that the escape vehicle for the station is about to cost \nas much as the Station was originally expected to cost.\n  We must ensure due diligence is taken to protect this public \ninvestment. NASA has limited the competition to two companies, yet it \nhas not provided a sufficient explanation to the authorizing committees \nof jurisdiction as to the merits of such a decision. I am not convinced \nthis will generate either the cost savings or the innovation necessary \nto make this a successful program.\n  Perhaps the more fundamental question is whether the OSP is the right \napproach in the first place. As the rush begins to develop this \nvehicle, many Members in both Houses are not sure how or if this \nproject fits within the overall plans for the future of NASA. I share \nthese concerns.\n  We do not want to make the same mistakes that we made on the ISS. \nThose mistakes cost the American taxpayers dearly as the development \ncosts of the ISS sky-rocketed by more than 50 percent. Even today, we \nstill do not know the final costs of the Station, because of the delay \ncaused by the grounding of the Space Shuttle.\n  I believe it wise to wait for the results of the on-going inter-\nagency review of the nation's space program being undertaken by the \nadministration before we dole out $15 billion that may be inconsistent \nwith the future goals of the space program.\n  We need to make the safety of the astronauts on the space station a \ntop priority. We cannot risk placing the earmarks for parochial \ninterests above the critical need to fund legitimate safety concerns.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are awaiting one more Senator who has an \namendment to be offered. We are getting to the point where we hope we \ncan go to a voice vote on final passage as soon as possible to expedite \nthe work of\n\n[[Page S15000]]\n\nthe committee. I have asked our cloakroom to check to see if the \nSenator is going to be joining us to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers have worked this down to one \namendment being left. There was an agreement this morning, and Senator \nMcCain is willing to take a very short time agreement. I think it is 20 \nminutes evenly divided. This bill will be finished before the normal \nrecess.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I might say to the wonderful \ndistinguished whip and my colleague from Missouri, at 2:30 the Senator \nfrom Maryland, along with the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, are receiving a national award. It will occur in Statuary Hall.\n  It is really important, if the Senator from Arizona could come next, \nwe could finish this bill. It will be very awkward to try to do the \nbill at 2:30. I will be here. I will give up the reception of this \naward. It is really awkward when we are ready to go. I respect the \nimpeccable credentials of the Senator from Arizona on national \nsecurity. We know what he wants to offer. We could deal with this now \nand have him present his arguments and our rebuttal, and perhaps do \nthis before the luncheon recess. We would like to get this done before \nthe Senate recesses for the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for about 3 \nminutes.\n  First, I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for their work on this legislation and particularly \nfor their commitment to the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  This is such an important part of what we are as a people. We are a \nnation of explorers. This represents a commitment by the American \npeople to explore our solar system and, as far as possible, the \nuniverse as we know it.\n  We have had a tough year. With the shuttle disaster and seven \nastronauts lost, a tremendous effort has been ongoing to deal with the \nproblem so it will not happen again as part of the return to space \nprogram. It has cost us a good bit of money.\n  It is important to note NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe is doing a \nterrific job. He has served as former Secretary of the Navy, former \nComptroller of the Department of Defense, chaired departments at Johns \nHopkins, Syracuse, Penn State, and has dealt with governmental \nmanagement. He is doing a good job. That was confirmed just 2 days ago \nwhen NASA was rated the best place to work in the Federal Government. \nIn fact, I was particularly proud that Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, AL, the part of NASA where the Saturn 5 was originally set \nup by Werner Von Braun, is rated the best of the best in the entire \nU.S. Government. A lot of good things are happening despite the \ndifficulties.\n  One thing, though, that our leaders were not able to do: Under the \npressure that was upon them, they believed it necessary to reduce the \nInternational Space Station funding by $200 million. I know there is a \nlot of pressure. I understand the difficulties they face. The House has \nnot done that.\n\n  I urge our colleagues as they go to conference--and I intend to \nsupport this bill--to see if we can't get back that $200 million. We \ndon't know all of the challenges they will face, but we know we really \nhave to do a lot of extra work on the return to space. It has drained a \nlot of our money. If we could keep that $200 million in and keep this \nspace station going, I think it would maintain our progressive vision \nfor space and continue our commitment to explore our solar system. I \nthink it is very important.\n  I urge my colleagues to do all they can to see if that can be worked \nout. I thank them for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \ncomments on space exploration and the space station.\n  He noted the delays in the space station operations because of the \nunavailability of the space shuttle. That is one of the reasons we put \nsome of those funds in other priority programs. We are trying to get \nback into space so we can get the space shuttle. We very much \nappreciate that.\n\n\n                          VETERANS' CEMETERIES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator from Missouri \nbe willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with my friend \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I have come to the floor today to speak about \nan issue of great importance; the need to construct new national \nveterans cemeteries.\n  National cemeteries are reaching capacity throughout the United \nStates as veterans, particularly those from World War II and the Korean \nWar, die in increasing numbers. By the end of 2004, only 64 of the 124 \nveterans national cemeteries will be available for both casketed and \ncremated remains.\n  Recognizing the need to establish new cemeteries, Congress recently \npassed the National Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003 (H.R. 1516). This \nbill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to construct a new \nnational veterans cemetery in the following six cities: Jacksonville, \nFL; Sarasota, FL; Birmingham, AL; Bakersfield, CA; Philadelphia, PA; \nand Columbia, SC. These cities were identified by VA as being the areas \nin the greatest need of a new cemetery.\n  As cemetery service capabilities decrease, veterans in areas near \ncemeteries that are at capacity will lose access to burial options \nwithin a reasonable distance of their homes. In order to ensure that \nburial options are provided for veterans and their family members, we \nmust develop new cemeteries and expand existing cemeteries. This \nprocess must start as soon as possible because the construction of a \nnew cemetery takes an average of seven years.\n  I respectfully request that the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee work to include advance planning funds in conference so we \nbegin constructing these new cemeteries and ensure our veterans have \nthe burial options they deserve.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree this is an important issue and I will try to \naddress it in conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman for his efforts and I look forward to the final conference \nreport.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincerest appreciation to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, without whom we could not have \ngotten them done. We were under very tight time pressures and with very \nlimited resources.\n  I express my thanks to the chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Byrd, for making enough money available so we can \nrestore the full amount of funding for veterans health care which was a \ntop priority.\n  This was an extremely difficult year for us. We could not have gotten \nit done without an extremely able staff who worked, I imagine, more \nthan 100 hours a week and 20 hours several days.\n  Thanks on the minority side to Paul Carliner, Alexa Sewell, Gabrielle \nBatkin; and, on my side, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, Allan Cutler, Jennifer \nStoripan, and Rebecca Benn. We sincerely appreciate their good work.\n  I ask my colleague for any comments, and then we are ready to go to \nfinal passage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have fully funded the VA including a \n$1.5 billion increase over the President's request for VA medical care.\n  We have provided $28.5 billion for medical care, a 12 percent \nincrease over last year's level. with no deductibles, no co-pays, and \nno membership fees for veterans. Promises made to our veterans must be \npromises kept and we have kept our promises to veterans in this bill.\n  In the area of housing and community development, we continue our \ncommitment to core housing programs, including Community Development \nBlock Grants, HOME, HOPE VI, and Section 8. These programs provide \nflexible funding for local communities for a range of activities, such \nas new rental housing, rehabilitation of dilapidated properties, and \nchild care centers.\n  Last year, CDBG funds created or retained over 100,000 jobs \nnationwide.\n  We also keep our commitment to the environment helping local \ncommunities protect their citizens' health and their environment.\n  EPA helps communities by cleaning up Brownfields, improving air \nquality,\n\n[[Page S15001]]\n\nand fixing water and sewer systems. We provide $8.2 billion to the EPA, \n$105 million above last year, and $500 million above the President's \nbudget request.\n  In water and sewer needs, communities all across the country are \nfaced with aging water and sewer systems. The costs of fixing and \nmaintaining these aging systems continue to increase. That is why \nSenator Bond and I worked together to restore the administration's $500 \nmillion cut to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund.\n  We have also fully funded environmental cops on the beat so that we \ncatch polluters who threaten public health and the environment.\n  We have provided a record amount for Americorps, $340 million, so \nthat Americorps can enroll more volunteers to serve in our communities.\n  In NASA, we provided the full amount for the Space Shuttle--$3.9 \nbillion. Senator Bond and I have always made the Space Shuttle safety a \npriority.\n  The bill also funded all major programs in space science, earth \nscience, and aeronautics.\n  In order to keep our manufacturing jobs here, we increase our \ninvestment in the National Science Foundation. We win the Nobel Prizes, \nand they win the markets. That is why we provide NSF with the largest \nbudget in its history.\n  We have increased funding for education to attract and train more \nscientists, engineers and teachers of science.\n  Again, I joined this Subcommittee to meet the needs of our veterans, \nempower communities, and create new jobs. This bill has accomplished \nall three goals.\n  I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for the wonderful job he has done \non this bill on the part of representing the Democratic side. I thank \nhim for all the courtesies and collegiality. Most of all, I thank him \nfor really not playing politics with veterans health care, as I did \nnot. As we approached this bill, when it came to looking out for \nveterans health care, we weren't the Republican Party; we weren't the \nDemocratic Party; we were the red, white, and blue party. Therefore, we \ncould raise the funding for veterans medical care by 12 percent with no \ndeductibles, with no new deductibles, no new copayments, and no \nmembership fees. That was due in large part to our mutual advocacy and \nthe wonderful cooperation of Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd.\n  I joined this subcommittee for two reasons: To meet the day-to-day \nneeds of my constituents--our veterans--housing, the environment; and \nthe long-range investments needed for our country in science and \ntechnology. I believe we have accomplished both.\n  I also thank the staff who enabled us to do this: On my own side, \nPaul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin, Alexa Sewell, and Jennifer Storipan; \nand the staff of the distinguished Senator from Missouri: Jon Karmarck, \nCheh Kim, Allan Cutler, and Rebecca Benn.\n  I also thank the floor staff of both the majority and the minority \nwho helped us expedite the bill. No kinder words could be said by me \nthan to express my gratitude to Senator Harry Reid, the whip on our \nside, who really also helped bring this bill to closure. This is why we \ncome to the Senate, to try to use the taxpayers' money in a wise way. \nIt keeps promises made to our U.S. veterans, but adds value to our \ncountry, whether through empowering neighborhoods, protecting the \nenvironment, or investing in science and technology so we not only win \nthe Nobel Prizes but we win the markets.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. We are ready for final passage.\n  The amendment (No. 2150), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2861), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2861\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2861) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Veteran Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for \n     sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2004, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       Compensation and Pensions\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 \n     U.S.C.

That \n     driving time is 30 minutes for veterans living in urban and \n     rural areas and 60 minutes for veterans living in highly \n     rural areas.\n       (3) The Draft National CARES Plan issued by the Under \n     Secretary for Health would place veterans in 18 rural and \n     highly rural regional markets outside the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care until at least \n     fiscal year 2022, which means that thousands of veterans will \n     have to continuing traveling up to 3-4 hours each way to \n     visit a Department primary care facility.\n       (4) The 18 rural and highly rural markets that will remain \n     outside the Department accessibility standard for primary \n     health care comprise all or parts of Arkansas, Idaho, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, \n     Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North \n     Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, \n     Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.\n       (5) Health care facilities for veterans are \n     disproportionately needed in rural and highly rural areas \n     because the residents of such areas are generally older, \n     poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the CARES Commission should give as much attention to \n     solving the special needs of veterans who live in rural areas \n     as it does to providing for the health care needs of veterans \n     living in more highly populated areas;\n       (2) the CARES Commission should reject the portions of the \n     Draft National CARES Plan that would prevent any regional \n     market of the Department from complying with the Department \n     accessibility standard for primary health care, which \n     provides that at least 70 percent of the veterans residing in \n     each market be within specified driving times of a Department \n     primary care facility; and\n       (3) the CARES Commission should recommend to the Secretary \n     the investments and initiatives that are necessary to achieve \n     the Department accessibility standard for primary health care \n     in each of the rural and highly rural health care markets of \n     the Department.\n       Sec. 120. Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine \n     of the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement the \n     Institute of Medicine shall develop and evaluate \n     epidemiological studies on Vietnam veterans in accordance \n     with the recommendations of the 2003 National Academy of \n     Sciences report entitled ``Characterizing Exposure of \n     Veterans to Agent Orange and Other Herbicides Used in \n     Vietnam: Interim Findings and Recommendations''.\n       Sec. 121. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs by this Act or any \n     other Act may be obligated or expended to implement the \n     policy contained in the memorandum of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs dated July 18, 2002, from the Deputy Under \n     Secretary for Health for Operations and Management with the \n     subject ``Status of VHA Enrollment and Associated Issues'' or \n     any other policy prohibiting the Directors of the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) from conducting outreach \n     or marketing to enroll new veterans within their Networks.\n\n         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT\n\n                       Public and Indian Housing\n\n\n

    heading to fund all voucher needs in this fiscal year: \n     Provided further, That if a public housing agency, at any \n     point in time during their fiscal year, has obligated the \n     amounts made available to such agency pursuant to paragraph \n     (1) under this heading for the renewal of expiring section 8 \n     tenant-based annual contributions contracts, and if such \n     agency has expended 50 percent of the amounts available to \n     such agency in its annual contributions contract reserve \n     account, the Secretary shall make available such amounts as \n     are

Sense of the Senate. (a) Findings.--The Senate \n     finds that--\n       (1) 30 percent of American families have housing \n     affordability problems, with 14,300,000 families paying more \n     than half of their income for housing costs, and 17,300,000 \n     families paying 30 to 50 percent of their income towards \n     housing costs;\n       (2) 9,300,000 American families live in housing that is \n     overcrowded or distressed;\n       (3) 3,500,000 households in the United States will \n     experience homelessness at some point this year, including \n     1,350,000 children;\n       (4) the number of working families who are unable to afford \n     adequate housing is increasing, as the gap between wages and \n     housing costs grows;\n       (5) there is no county or metropolitan area in the country \n     where a minimum wage earner can afford to rent a modest 2-\n     bedroom apartment, and on average, a family must earn over \n     $15 an hour to afford modest rental housing, which is almost \n     3 times the minimum wage;\n       (6) section 8 housing vouchers help approximately 2,000,000 \n     families with children, senior citizens, and disabled \n     individuals afford a safe and decent place to live;\n       (7) utilization of vouchers is at a high of 96 percent, and \n     is on course to rise to 97 percent in fiscal year 2004, \n     according to data provided by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development;\n       (8) the average cost per voucher has also steadily \n     increased from just over $6,400 in August of 2002, to $6,756 \n     in April, 2003, due largely to rising rents in the private \n     market, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \n     the cost per voucher in fiscal year 2004 will be $7,028, $560 \n     more per voucher than the estimate contained in the fiscal \n     year 2004 budget request; and\n       (9) the congressionally appointed, bipartisan Millennial \n     Housing Commission found that housing vouchers are ``the \n     linchpin of a national housing policy providing very low-\n     income renters access to privately-owned housing stock''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) housing vouchers are a critical resource in ensuring \n     that families in America can afford safe, decent, and \n     adequate housing;\n       (2) public housing agencies must retain the ability to use \n     100 percent of their authorized vouchers to help house low-\n     income families; and\n       (3) the Senate expects the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development to take all necessary actions to encourage full \n     utilization of vouchers, and to use all legally available \n     resources as needed to support full funding for housing \n     vouchers in fiscal year 2004, so that every voucher can be \n     used by a family in need.\n       Sec. 419. Section 106(d) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5306(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``shall not exceed 2 \n     percent'' and inserting ``shall not, subject to paragraph \n     (6), exceed 3 percent'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``not to exceed 1 \n     percent'' and inserting ``subject to paragraph (6), not to \n     exceed 3 percent'';\n       (3) by redesignating the second paragraph (5) and paragraph \n     (6) as paragraphs (7) and (8), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following:\n       ``(6) Of the amounts received under paragraph (1), the \n     State may deduct not more than an aggregate total of 3 \n     percent of such amounts for--\n       ``(A) administrative expenses under paragraph (3)(A); and\n       ``(B) technical assistance under paragraph (5).''.\n       Sec. 420.

Section 221 of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1301) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f), by striking ``2002 and 2003'' and \n     inserting ``2005 and 2006'';\n       (2) in subsection (g)(1)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2002'' and \n     inserting ``2005''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2002'' and inserting ``2005'';\n       (3) in subsection (g)(2)--\n       (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2003'' and \n     inserting ``2006''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2006''; and\n       (4) in subsection (i), by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2006''.\n       Sec. 421. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert \n     Storm (in this section, collectively referred to as the \n     ``First Gulf War''), the regime of Saddam Hussein committed \n     grave human rights abuses and acts of terrorism against the \n     people of Iraq and citizens of the United States.\n       (2) United States citizens who were taken prisoner by the \n     regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf War were \n     brutally tortured and forced to endure severe physical trauma \n     and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The regime of Saddam Hussein used civilian citizens of \n     the United States who were working in the Persian Gulf region \n     before and during the First Gulf War as so-called human \n     shields, threatening the personal safety and emotional well-\n     being of such civilians.\n       (4) Congress has recognized and authorized the right of \n     United States citizens, including prisoners of war, to hold \n     terrorist states, such as Iraq during the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein, liable for injuries caused by such states.\n       (5) The United States district courts are authorized to \n     adjudicate cases brought by individuals injured by terrorist \n     states.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) notwithstanding section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 \n     Stat. 579) and any other provision of law, a citizen of the \n     United States who was a prisoner of war or who was used by \n     the regime of Saddam Hussein and by Iraq as a so-called human \n     shield during the First Gulf War should have the opportunity \n     to have any claim for damages caused by the regime of Saddam \n     Hussein and by Iraq incurred by such citizen fully \n     adjudicated in the appropriate United States district court;\n       (2) any judgment for such damages awarded to such citizen, \n     or the family of such citizen, should be fully enforced; and\n       (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations \n     with each such citizen, or the family of each such citizen, \n     to develop a fair and reasonable method of providing \n     compensation for the damages each such citizen incurred, \n     including using assets of the regime of Saddam Hussein held \n     by the Government of the United States or any other \n     appropriate sources to provide such compensation.\n       Sec. 422. None of the funds provided in this Act may be \n     expended to apply, in a numerical estimate of the benefits of \n     an agency action prepared pursuant to Executive Order 12866 \n     or section 812 of the Clean Air Act, monetary values for \n     adult premature mortality that differ based on the age of the \n     adult.\n       Sec. 423.

(a) Extension.--The \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall extend the \n     term of the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement entered \n     into between a public housing agency and the Secretary under \n     section 204, title V, of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions \n     and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134, April 26, \n     1996) if--\n       (1) the public housing agency requests such extension in \n     writing;\n       (2) the public housing agency is not at the time of such \n     request for extension in default under its Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement; and\n       (3) the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement to be \n     extended would otherwise expire on or before December 31, \n     2004.\n       (b) Terms.--Unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the public housing agency otherwise agree, \n     the extension under subsection (a) shall be upon the \n     identical terms and conditions set forth in the extending \n     agency's existing Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement, \n     except that for each public housing agency that has been or \n     will be granted an extension to its original Moving to Work \n     agreement, the Secretary shall require that data be collected \n     so that the effect of Moving to Work policy changes on \n     residents can be measured.\n       (c) Extension Period.--The extension under subsection (a) \n     shall be for such period as is requested by the public \n     housing agency, not to exceed 3 years from the date of \n     expiration of the extending agency's existing Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement.\n       (d) Breach of Agreement.--Nothing contained in this section \n     shall limit the authority of the Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development to terminate any Moving to Work \n     Demonstration Agreement of a public housing agency if the \n     public housing agency is in breach of the provisions of such \n     agreement.\n       Sec. 424.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2765, the D.C. Appropriations bill; \nfurther, that an amendment that is at the desk regarding title II be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I further \nask that the substitute amendment then be agreed to, the bill be read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; provided further that the Senate then insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I do intend to make a \nfew brief remarks and then will not object to the unanimous consent, \nbut I would like to speak for as much time as I might consume. \nHopefully, it will not be more than about 7 to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized on her reservation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I first compliment Senator DeWine for \nthe outstanding job he has done. He is in a meeting and is not in the \nSenate at this moment, but we have worked closely together in our \ncapacity now as chair and ranking member, as when I chaired the \ncommittee and he served as the ranking member. We have worked together \nthrough many different issues. I cannot say enough about his commitment \nto helping steer a bill that in many instances is contentious--not \nnecessarily because of anything related to the District of Columbia \nspecifically, but of other ideas and ideologies that sometimes find \ntheir way into this bill. He and I are both very sensitive to that and \nsupport the new leadership team of the District and have tried our best \nto steer this bill through for the District as well as for the Nation.\n  I wanted to begin by complimenting him and also say, second, there \nare some terrific new initiatives in this bill, very much needed. One, \nled by Senator DeWine, is the continued effort to reform the foster \ncare system, first acknowledging the Mayor himself has taken quite a \nleadership role and has appointed very able leaders in the District to \ntake a system that is broken, that was in many ways completely \ndysfunctional, and to begin to bring framework, parameters, results to \nit which will literally save children's lives, heal families, and find \nhomes for children who have no homes.\n  Senator DeWine and I believe, along with Mayor Williams, there is no \nsuch thing as an unwanted child; there are just unfound families. There \nare indeed families not only in the District of Columbia but around the \nNation which are in need of our assistance, our charity, our help, and \nour care. When we cannot heal a family and keep them strong to raise \nthe children born to them, it is our responsibility to find a new \nfamily for that child or that sibling as quickly as possible. We will \nnot stop until it is achieved. Senator DeWine has provided some \nadditional framework in which to make that possible.\n  In addition, I am very pleased, along with Senator Byrd, who chaired \nthis committee for many years, that there is also a critical \ninfrastructure piece which indicates we as a Congress have a \nresponsibility, in that the District is not a State, it does not have a \nState government but it has the same needs, and Congress has stepped up \nfor infrastructure investments in the District which benefit the whole \nregion--Maryland and Virginia as well. One of the primary projects we \nhave funded is the cleanup of the Anacostia waterway which affects the \nregion. It is a major environmental project getting tremendous help and \nsupport in this bill.\n  The security enhancements for emergency planning for the District, I \nneed not tell of its importance. It is in the Nation's Capital, under \nthe threat of terror, that we continue to function. We know how \nimportant that is. I begin with compliments to the Chair for including \nthese and many other provisions.\n  I take the next 5 minutes to lay down some other important points \nregarding the most contentious issue in this bill. This issue was at \nthe core or center of the debate over the future of public education in \nthe United States of America. It has to do with a proposal of vouchers, \ntaking money from public schools to send children to private schools. \nThat issue is the center of debate over the future of public schools in \nAmerica. It is that issue, unfortunately, because of the nature of the \nprocess in the Senate, which is going to be put into the omnibus \nappropriations bill. I want to go on record as strongly objecting to it \nonce again and to set the myths from the facts.\n\n  The first myth is: The voucher proposal does not drain money from \npublic schools or from other Federal priorities, that this is ``new'' \nmoney.\n  For the record, the $40 million used to pay for this three-pronged \napproach--of which a third is for vouchers--was taken from the \nCommerce-Justice-State bill. In other words, that is $39 million less \nspent on law enforcement, homeland security, or health care.\n  Again, this is not new money. There were no new taxes raised. There \nwere no new taxes identified to pay for this. This $39 million came out \nof already existing Federal revenues that are now going to fund \nvouchers for 1,500 children in the District of Columbia. It is not new \nmoney. It is coming from the Commerce-Justice-State bill. I contend \nunless a new tax is raised at the Federal level or in the District of \nColumbia, it is not new money. It is a myth.\n  The next myth I would like to put to rest is the voucher proposal is \nlimited to children in failing schools. Some of us who have opposed \nthis proposal, without certain amendments, have continued to say--not \neverybody on the Democratic side, for sure, but I have said, as the \nranking member, I could support a program that had full accountability \nand was aimed at helping children in failing schools. Why? Because it \nis not their fault the schools have failed. It is our fault. It is not \nnecessarily their parents' fault, because parents do not run the \nschools. Parents are busy trying to run their households, take care of \ntheir children, and sometimes work two or three jobs. If we have failed \nthe children, then let us give them help as we reconstitute those \nschools under the new accountability proposal, and give them some \ntemporary help to move to a school that might be performing.\n  I offered that proposal. It was rejected. This proposal is not \nlimited or designed specifically for children in failing schools \nbecause the power behind this wants to undermine public schools, not \nhelp poor children in failing schools. That is the truth.\n  The fact is, there is nothing in this language that prevents a child \nenrolled in a high-performing public school or a private school, for \nthat matter, from attending a private school at public expense.\n  Let me repeat, there is nothing in the language the Republican \nmajority is pushing that prevents a child enrolled in a high-performing \npublic or private school from attending a private school at public \nexpense, with no accountability to the public taxpayer.\n  The third myth is this is not just a voucher demonstration program; \nit is a balanced, three-pronged approach for school improvement.\n  The fact is, in the language pushed by the Republican majority, the \nonly part of this three-pronged demonstration program that is \nauthorized to receive funding for more than 1 year is the voucher \nportion. What is more, the\n\n[[Page S15022]]\n\nonly one that will be evaluated for success at the end of 5 years is \nthe voucher program.\n  First, let me say the only part of this demonstration program that is \nauthorized in this bill to receive funding for more than 1 year is for \nvouchers. My opponents will say: Senator, the other funding is \nauthorized in other parts of the education bill. That may be correct. \nTechnically, it is correct. But in this proposal--that has been sold, \nand sold again, once, twice, and sold as a three-pronged approach--this \nlanguage only has one prong that is authorized and funded, and that is \nvouchers. That is a fact, and that is wrong.\n\n  What is more, the proponents will say at least one good thing at the \nend of this 5-year ``demonstration project'' is, we will know \ndefinitively whether vouchers work or not. The fact is, Senator Carper \nand I, who tried to negotiate a compromise, felt strongly that would be \na very good benefit to know finally. Cleveland and Milwaukee have \ndemonstrated with this. There is so much misinformation. We said, at \nleast it would be worth it to our Democrats who oppose it and to \nRepublicans who think vouchers are the answer, the only answer, to \npublic schools in the Nation, and that is what they want. I think they \nare wrong. We said, let's have a comprehensive demonstration program. \nBut this language does not have the evaluation language. It dropped the \nevaluation language. The only thing we will know is, do children who \nreceive vouchers do better in higher performing private schools than \nthey did in poorly performing public schools? I would suggest we \nalready know the answer to that. We do not have to spend $13 million of \ntaxpayer money that is unaccountable to find out. We already know the \nanswer to that.\n  What we do not know the answer to is if children are given vouchers \nto leave a low-performing public school to go to a higher performing \nprivate school, or if those same children are given a chance in a \nhigher performing public school, or if those same children are given a \nchance in a higher performing public charter school, do they do \nessentially better? Does the voucher itself, the essence of the voucher \nitself, have any bearing on the academic achievement of the child? That \nwe do not know, and we will not find out, thanks to the language that \nis in this bill.\n  The fourth myth is: At the end of this 5-year demonstration program, \nwe will finally know if vouchers are a solution. I spoke about that.\n  The fifth myth is: Vouchers help to improve student achievement. We \nwill not know that after 5 years because of the language that was taken \nout.\n  In conclusion, there were some of us willing to support a true three-\npronged demonstration program. This is only one prong. There were some \nof us who would be willing to say we could go through the demonstration \nif, at the end, we actually knew and had the tight evaluation that \nwould tell us some answers the country would be very interested in \nknowing. That language was dropped.\n  There were some of us who said, if accountability was part of this, \nas the administration promised--accountability, not just to the \nparents, and not just responsibility to students, but accountability to \nthe taxpayers who pick up millions and millions of dollars--billions of \ndollars--in education expenses--they want to know, is their money \nworking. But the authors--not Senator DeWine, the chairman, but others \nwho have pushed this--are obviously not interested in letting the \ntaxpayers know if their money is actually accomplishing anything, \nbecause the test language and the accountability language has been \ndropped. It is a false hope.\n  I will conclude. When we make promises to people with power and money \nand status, and we do not keep those promises, that is bad enough. But \nwhen we offer false hope to children who have very little, to families \nwhich have been discriminated against, to poor people who have little, \nand we fail to keep those promises, that is a sin indeed. We should be \nashamed of the actions that represent this bill today.\n  I withdraw my objection to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2201) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2201 to Amendment No. 1783\n\n       Strike all of title II, beginning on

GEN. ROBERT T. CLARK TO BE LIEUTENANT GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, pursuant to the order of November 14, I \nask that the Senate now proceed to executive session to begin \nconsideration of Executive Calendar No. 418, the nomination of Maj. \nGen. Robert T. Clark to be Lieutenant General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Maj. Gen. \nRobert T. Clark to be Lieutenant General.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators who desire \nto speak. I will just say a few words. To accommodate my distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky, who has been a valiant supporter of this \nnomination and very persistent over this long period of time, I will \nyield the floor. He then could be followed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and then I would continue my remarks.\n  I wonder if I just might ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia proceed for not to exceed 3 or 4 minutes, followed by the \nSenator from Kentucky for about 10 or 12 minutes, followed by the \nSenator from Massachusetts. How much time does my colleague desire?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think 40 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Not to exceed a period of about 40 minutes for the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think Senator Dayton also had 15 minutes. I think \nthere is a unanimous consent agreement for this; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was not able to hear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think there is a consent that has been agreed to \nwhereby there are 2 hours equally divided, with 40 minutes for myself \nand 15 minutes for Senator Dayton.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct on that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not necessarily take all of that time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Major General Clark is a highly qualified officer for promotion to \nthe rank of lieutenant general. I have met with him several times. His \nproposed assignment by the Secretary of Defense is to be Commander of \nthe Fifth U.S. Army.\n  He was first nominated for this position in the fall of 2002. He has \nappeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in executive \nsession on two separate occasions. On both occasions he conducted \nhimself with deference and respect not only for the serious issues at \nhand but for all persons involved in this tragic sequence of facts \nwhich preceded his nomination.\n  He expressed great respect for the constitutionally-based advise and \nconsent power and the responsibility of the Senate to look into this \nnomination with great thoroughness. Not surprisingly, General Clark has \nthe full support of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Schoomaker, \nand the civilian leadership of the Army for this promotion. Indeed, the \nSecretary of Defense personally, in a very respectful way, has talked \nto me about this nomination and his strong support for this nominee.\n  I will detail at length later on in the course of this debate the \nvery thorough steps taken by the Senate Armed Services Committee. I \ncommend my colleagues on the committee. There were unusual facts \nassociated with this nomination involving tragic loss of life, a strong \ndisciplinary action against those who brought about the direct harm to \nthe victim who gave his life. In the course of that, I and other \nmembers of the committee took it upon ourselves to meet with the family \nmembers of the deceased victim in this particular case. I wish to \ncommend them. They handled themselves in a manner of great distinction, \ngiven the depth of emotion on their part.\n  I also commend the former Vice Chief of the Army, General Keane. He \ntook it upon himself time and time again, working with the \ndistinguished Under Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee, to repeatedly \ngo back and reinvestigate certain aspects of this case, I hope to the \nsatisfaction of all Members, certainly to this Senator and generally \nmembers of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to accommodate my colleague. I again \nthank him for his strong tenacity in supporting this nomination \nthroughout.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of MG Robert \nClark to the rank of lieutenant general and commander of the Fifth \nArmy. I first met General Clark over 5 years ago when he was commander \nof the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY. Since that time, I \nhave known General Clark to be an honest man and an excellent soldier. \nThe military communities in Kentucky and Tennessee surrounding Fort \nCampbell admire General Clark very much. He is well respected \nthroughout the Army, and we should be grateful that we have soldiers \nlike General Clark serving and protecting our Nation.\n  GEN Jack Keane, who commanded General Clark at Fort Campbell, said \nthis about him:\n\n       In my 37 years of service, I have never met an officer who \n     is such a tower of character and integrity. His peers, \n     subordinates, and superiors all respect and admire him for \n     the truly special person that he is.\n\n  General Clark loves the Army and he loves his country. Some may even \nsay that General Clark was born with the desire to serve his country in \nhis blood. Both of his grandfathers served in both World War I and \nWorld War II. His father served for 31 years and fought in both World \nWar II and the Korean conflict. His older brother served in Vietnam. \nOne of his younger brothers is an Air Force colonel, and another \nbrother is an Army lieutenant colonel on the front lines in Korea.\n  The Clark family has made many sacrifices so that future generations \nof Americans can live in peace. General Clark has given 33 years of his \nlife in the armed service to this great Nation. He is a decorated \nsoldier and has shed his own blood for our country. He led a platoon in \nVietnam, commanded a brigade that was dropped deep into Iraq during \nOperation Desert Storm.\n  As commanding general of the 101st Screaming Eagles, he deployed \nhimself, with his troops, all over the world, from Kuwait to El \nSalvador. Most recently, General Clark has been deputy commander of the \nFifth Army and mobilized Guard and Reserves for homeland defense and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. He has worn just about every hat the Army has \nto offer.\n  COL Mike Oates, who served under General Clark at Fort Campbell, said \nthis about him:\n\n       He spoke straight to the soldiers. He looked them in the \n     eye and he set high standards for wearing our equipment and \n     how we behaved. Discipline is what keeps good units effective \n     and reliable. He enforced discipline and set the example \n     himself.\n\n  I could go on and on about General Clark's distinguished career. But \nI need to address the tragic incident that has held up his nomination, \nwhich occurred while General Clark was at Fort Campbell. A murder \noccurred at Fort Campbell on July 5, 1999. PVT Barry Winchell was \nkilled in a tragic event that none of us should ever forget. Private \nWinchell was murdered by a fellow soldier, who is serving--and \ndeservedly so--a life sentence for this horrendous crime.\n  I do not wish to address the details of this horrible murder, but I \ndo wish to\n\n[[Page S15030]]\n\nextend my thoughts and prayers to Private Winchell's family and \nfriends. I have spoken with General Clark several times about this \ntragic incident. I know how sorry he is about the murder of Private \nWinchell, especially since it did happen on his post and under his \nleadership.\n  But it is important to note that after the incident--and as the \ngeneral court martial convening authority--General Clark approved the \nmaximum punishment for the convicted murderer.\n\n  I want to set the record straight. A small, yet loud minority has \nblamed General Clark for this tragic death. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  A man who has given 33 years of his life to protect all Americans--\nall Americans--does not deserve to be treated this way. Army \ninvestigations and many interviews were conducted to dispel the \nmisinformation over this incident. And the Army has recommended General \nClark for nomination to lieutenant general and commander of the Fifth \nArmy because he is the most qualified soldier for this job.\n  The President nominated General Clark for this post and important \nrank. It is important to note that the Senate Armed Services Committee \napproved his nomination.\n  I thank Committee Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin for \nhelping to move his nomination through the committee.\n  Mr. President, our military has an old saying: ``Not for self, but \nfor country.''\n  Those who know General Clark in the Army and in the communities in \nwhich he has served all think of him when they hear this statement. \nGeneral Clark is a man who has given his entire life not for self but \nfor God and country. I thank him for it.\n  We should all be grateful to him for all the sacrifices he has made \nfor our freedoms and our protections. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe nomination of GEN Robert Clark. He deserves it and he has earned \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I express appreciation to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky again for his taking long hours to personally look into \nthis case in a very objective way and in reaching his conclusions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to remind me when I have \nused 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Major General \nClark to the rank of lieutenant general.\n  I agree that General Clark has a strong record as a soldier. He has \nreceived numerous decorations for his distinguished service and \ncourage, and he has served in a number of leadership capacities during \nhis more than 30 years in the Army.\n  I am concerned, however, about General Clark's performance as \nCommanding General at Fort Campbell, KY, at the time of the brutal \nmurder of PVT Barry Winchell on the base in 1999.\n  There are few more respected units in the Army than the 101st \nAirborne Division at Fort Campbell. The ``Screaming Eagles,'' as the \ndivision is called, has a well-deserved reputation of professionalism, \nheroism, and outstanding performance. Yet, in the months leading up to \nthe murder of Private Winchell, the command climate at Fort Campbell \nwas seriously deficient. According to a report by the Army inspector \ngeneral, Fort Campbell had command-wide low morale, and inadequate \ndelivery of health care to soldiers and their families, and the \nleadership condoned widespread, leader-condoned underage drinking in \nthe barracks.\n  There is compelling evidence that anti-gay harassment was pervasive \nat Fort Campbell during this period. The inspector general reported \nmultiple examples of anti-gay graffiti, the use of anti-gray slurs in \ncadences by non-commissioned officers during training runs, and routine \nremarks and bantering that, in the inspector general's words, ``could \nbe viewed as harassment.'' Outside groups have documented many \ninstances of anti-gay harassment in the months leading up to the \nmurder.\n  The inspector general also found that prior to the murder, there was \nno sustainment training at Fort Campbell on the proper implementation \nof the Homosexual Conduct Policy, known as ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \nand that, as a result, ``most officers, NCOs, and soldiers at Fort \nCampbell lacked an understanding and working knowledge of the Policy.''\n  In his response to my questions, General Clark stated that he agrees \nwith these findings, but that he was nevertheless not aware of even a \nsingle instance of anti-gay harassment before the murder.\n  On July 5, 1999, after enduring anti-gay harassment for many months, \nincluding harassment by members of his chain of command, Private \nWinchell was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat by a fellow \nsoldier in his barracks.\n  It seems clear that if General Clark had exercised his responsibility \nto deal with the serious anti-gay harassment that was prevalent at Fort \nCampbell during his 17 months of command leading up to the murder of \nPrivate Winchell, the murder would probably not have occurred.\n  Even more serious, however, was General Clark's performance at Fort \nCampbell in the days, weeks, and months following the murder. A brutal \nbias-motivated hate crime is an extraordinary event in any community, \ncivilian or military, and it demands an extraordinary response from the \ncommunity's leaders. Such a crime sends the poisonous message that some \nmembers of the community deserve to be victimized solely because of who \nthey are. The potential for such a crime was magnified in this case \nbecause of the existing climate of anti-gay harassment at Fort \nCampbell, but the available evidence indicates that General Clark's \nresponse was not adequate with respect to his contacts with Private \nWinchell's family or his command responsibilities at Fort Campbell.\n  One factual issue which I have repeatedly asked the Army to resolve, \nwithout receiving a satisfactory response, is why General Clark did not \nmeet with the parents of Private Barry Winchell, Patricia and Wally \nKutteles, in the days following his murder.\n  Following such a brutal murder it is difficult to believe that such a \nmeeting did not take place. Any responsible and compassionate \ncommanding officer would want to meet with and console the parents of \nthe murdered soldier, even if no request for such a meeting had \nformally been made.\n  I understand that during the 4 days immediately following the murder, \nGeneral Clark was at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington \nwith his wife, who was undergoing tests for a longstanding illness. It \nis understandable that General Clark had declined to meet with the \nparents for this reason, during that period and did not attend the \nmemorial service for Private Winchell on July 9. But Clark did not meet \nwith the parents in the days after his return to Fort Campbell from \nWalter Reed Hospital nor in the weeks and months that followed the \nWinchell murder. Instead, he states that he never received a request to \nmeet with the parents, but he would gladly have met with then if he had \nreceived a request to do so.\n  Patricia Kutteles, Private Winchell's mother, has submitted a sworn \naffidavit stating that she and her husband traveled to Fort Campbell \nimmediately after hearing about her son's murder. She was assigned an \nArmy liaison officer, Lieutenant Colonel Stratis, as their point of \ncontact with Fort Campbell and the Army. Two or three days after the \nmurder, she made a request to Lieutenant Colonel Stratis to meet with \nGeneral Clark to talk about her son's death. Lieutenant Colonel Stratis \ntold her that General Clark was unable to meet with them.\n  There are three possible explanations for this dispute of fact: Ms. \nKutteles may have submitted a false affidavit, General Clark may have \ngiven false information to the Committee, or General Clark was, for \nsome reason, not informed by his staff about the parent's request.\n  Like others on the Armed Services Committee, I have met with the \nparents, and I was struck by their sincerity, their patriotism, and \ntheir continuing support for our Armed Forces in spite of the tragedy. \nI find it difficult to believe that they are lying or\n\n[[Page S15031]]\n\nmistaken when they say they asked for a meeting with General Clark.\n  Nevertheless, that appears to be the position of the Army inspector \ngeneral, who states in his most recent memorandum, dated October 20, \n2003, that the mother's statement in the affidavit is ``unfounded.'' \nThe inspector general states that his office ``determined, after \nextensive interviews, none of the key staff members and other relevant \nwitnesses recalled receiving or learning of such a request.''\n  I have seen several of the affidavits relied upon by the inspector \ngeneral, and I found the statements relied on to be disturbingly non-\nresponsive. These affidavits fail to resolve the serious factual \ndispute about whether the parents requested a meeting with General \nClark, and it seems improper for the Army inspector general to suggest \nthat no such request was made.\n  I believe that it is inappropriate for the Senate to act on this \nnomination until this issue is more satisfactorily resolved.\n  General Clark states that he was not aware of any instance of anti-\ngay harassment on the base before the murder. At the very least, the \nmurder should have made painfully clear that anti-gay bias and anti-gay \nharassment were real and pressing problems at Fort Campbell, problems \nthat demanded an immediate and effective response. Yet from the very \nstart, and throughout the remainder of his command, General Clark and \nhis office took patently ineffective steps to respond to these specific \nproblems.\n  Two days after the murder, the Fort Campbell public affairs office \nissued a statement describing the incident as a ``physical altercation \nin a post barracks,'' insinuating that Winchell was partly responsible \nfor his own death. In fact, Winchell was asleep in the barracks when he \nwas attacked by his killer. General Clark stated that he probably \nlearned about the false press statement 3 or 4 days later, following \nhis return to Fort Campbell from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. \nHe said he did not instruct the public affairs office to retract the \nstatement or issue a correction because ``comments by my command \nspokesperson regarding the case might well have influenced the \ninvestigation, or suggested that I had reached premature conclusions \nabout the case, and might have influenced or tainted the deliberations \nof any soldier serving on a court martial-panel.''\n  It is important for a commanding officer not to make statements that \nmight influence an investigation or court-martial. But it is well \nestablished in military law that a statement may be made to correct a \nfalse public statement, in order to avoid prejudice to the Government \nor the accused.\n  General Clark's explanation is doubly unconvincing in the light of \nthe fact that the Fort Campbell public affairs office made a statement, \n2 days after Clark returned to Fort Campbell, that there was ``no \nevidence'' that Private Winchell was killed because he was gay. This \nstatement was clearly false, and it also raised a far more serious \nissue about whether the command at Fort Campbell was undermining the \nability of the Government to prosecute the murder as a bias-motivated \noffense.\n  In fact, anti-gay harassment continued in the months following the \nmurder.\n  The continuing anti-gay harassment at Fort Campbell was also \naccompanied by a sudden exodus of soldiers discharged for violations of \nthe Homosexual Conduct Policy. In the 10 months after the murder, 120 \nsoldiers were discharged from Fort Campbell under this policy, compared \nto only 6 such discharges from Fort Campbell during the same time \nperiod in the previous year. In all of 1999, there were 271 such \ndischarges in the entire Army.\n  Instead of dealing directly with the problem of anti-gay harassment, \nGeneral Clark chose to deny that any problem existed. In an op-ed \narticle in the New York Times, a year after the murder, he stated that \n``There is not, nor has there ever been during my times here, a climate \nof homophobia on post.''\n  In addition, he refused to meet with groups concerned about the \nwelfare of gay soldiers, including a local gay community group, and the \nServicemembers Legal Defense Network, a national organization.\n  Another of General Clark's most serious failure of leadership after \nthe murder is the fact that, from all the evidence we have seen, he did \nnot even once speak out against the specific problems of anti-gay \nharassment and anti-gay violence, or implement any training for the \nsoldiers against it.\n  He did take general steps after the Winchell murder to address the \nquality of life for soldiers at Fort Campbell, and he reinforced \nexisting programs on the need to treat all soldiers with ``dignity and \nrespect.'' These measures were helpful, but hardly sufficient to \naddress the specific problem of anti-gay harassment.\n  Private Winchell's murder was an anti-gay hate crime, and it called \nfor, at the very least, a clear and unequivocal statement by Fort \nCampbell's commanding officer that violence against homosexuals is \nwrong. According to the record, no such statement was ever made.\n  General Clark has been asked repeatedly for instances in which he \nspoke publicly about anti-gay harassment. In his response last November \n6, 2002 to written questions, he listed a number of speeches, press \nconferences, and publications, but none of these examples dealt with \nthe specific problem of anti-gay harassment.\n  For example, General Clark wrote that on January 14, 2000:\n\n       I published an article in the post newspaper, The Fort \n     Campbell Courier, in which I emphasized the quality of \n     soldiers serving at Fort Campbell, and outlines the \n     initiatives we had undertaken to eliminate anti-gay \n     harassment. I also reinforced our longstanding policy of \n     treating all soldiers with dignity and respect.\n\n  In fact the article itself contains no information regarding efforts \nto address anti-gay harassment--not even a statement that such \nharassment is wrong. The article includes only two references to \nhomosexuality.\n  First, General Clark writes that he has requested a review and \nassessment:\n\n     to determine whether any member of this command violated the \n     Department of Defense Homosexual Conduct Policy in any \n     interaction with PFC Barry Winchell.\n\n  Second, he writes that he has:\n\n     issued a policy on the handling of discharges for homosexual \n     conduct to ensure these matters preserve the privacy and \n     dignity of individual soldiers.\n\n  There is nothing in the article about anti-gay harassment. It deals \nonly with the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy.\n  The article refers only to General Clark's efforts to improve \nbarracks conditions generally and his ``special emphasis'' on the \ndignity of all soldiers. Much of the article is defensive in tone; \nGeneral Clark writes that the soldiers at Fort Campbell are the ``best \nwe have ever had,'' that they are ``intolerant of abuse of anybody for \nany reason,'' and that ``leaders'' at Fort Campbell ``set the example \nthrough word and deed.'' He concludes with this sentence:\n\n       This is the climate that exists at Fort Campbell, in \n     contrast to which you have seen on TV and in the papers \n     during these past few months.\n\n  This tone has characterized much of General Clark's public statements \nduring the remainder of his command at Fort Campbell. On June 9, 2000, \nhe said at a news conference that he objects:\n\n     in the strongest terms to the way our soldiers, and the \n     climate that embraces them, have been characterized.\n\n  At a Rotary Club meeting in March 2000--another event listed by \nGeneral Clark as an example of his efforts to address anti-gay \nharassment--press reports, say that he:\n\n     used the Rotary speech to lambaste the Kentucky New Era and \n     other area newspapers\n\nfor printing an earlier story on his refusal to allow Servicemembers \nLegal Defense Network to place an advertisement in the post newspaper.\n  The ad had listed an anonymous hotline number for the Army inspector \ngeneral's office and the telephone number for the organization. General \nClark justified his decision to reject the ad on the ground that the \ninspector general's office had all the access it needed to soldiers on \npost. Newspaper reports of General Clark's Rotary Club speech contained \nno mention of any statement condemning anti-gay harassment.\n  I have repeatedly asked the Department to investigate this issue \nfurther, to find out whether in fact General Clark made any statements \nspecifically addressing anti-gay harassment and anti-gay violence \nfollowing the\n\n[[Page S15032]]\n\nWinchell murder. But the responses of the Department have been \ninadequate.\n  In response to similar questions by the parents, the inspector \ngeneral stated:\n\n       During the 6 months following the murder, Major General \n     Clark was personally involved in talking to Commanders at all \n     levels about the anti-gay harassment.\n\n  There have been other cases where commanding officers have had to \nrespond to tragedies, and they have done so in a variety of ways that \ndemonstrate their leadership.\n  Many have drawn comparisons between General Clark's response in this \ncase and General John Keane's response to the murder of African \nAmerican civilians at Fort Bragg by racist soldiers. After these \nmurders, General Keane held a 1-year anniversary remembrance and \npublicly offered his condolences. He met with the NAACP and the Anti-\nDefamation League to discuss the murders and consider ways to improve \nthe racial climate.\n  General Keane offered very strong public statements against racism, \nand he implemented sensitivity training on the base. General Clark did \nnone of this.\n  In all the services, discrimination against gays is codified in the \nban on their service in military. In reporting anti-gay discrimination, \nsoldiers face potential investigation, further harassment, and even \ndischarge. This makes this population even more vulnerable to acts of \nharassment and violence, which makes it even more essential for leaders \nto act quickly and effectively in response to attacks on soldiers \nperceived to be gay.\n  In the recent controversy at the Air Force Academy, the senior \nleadership has been held accountable, from the Commandant of the \nAcademy, to the Secretary of the Air Force. The Commandant of the Air \nForce Academy has been held responsible for the shortcomings of his \nsubordinate commanders.\n  General Clark never held a single officer responsible for the command \nclimate that led to the murder of Private Winchell. General Clark did \nnot take responsibility for addressing the problem of anti-gay \nharassment at Fort Campbell after the murder. He should bear the \nultimate responsibility for the climate that led to this tragedy and \nfor not remedying that climate afterwards.\n  These are important questions that go to the heart of this officer's \nsuitability for promotion to lieutenant general. The Senate deserves \nbetter information acting on such a controversial nomination.\n  I will just review for a few moments the difference between Fort \nBragg and Fort Campbell. This is the difference, the comparison between \nGeneral Keane's response to the murder of two African-American \ncivilians and General Clark's response to the murder of PVT Barry \nWinchell. Fort Bragg:\n\n       In December 1995, three White Fort Bragg soldiers murdered \n     two Black North Carolina civilians. Then Fort Bragg \n     commanding general, LTG John Keane, currently General Keane, \n     did the following actions after the murder:\n       At Fort Bragg, an on-base memorial service for \n     ``remembrance and reconciliation'' was held 1 year after the \n     murders. Lieutenant General Keane publicly communicated \n     strong condolences.\n\n  On General Clark's actions after the murder, he declined to meet with \nthe Winchell family, did not attend the Winchells' on-base memorial \nservice held shortly following the murder, and did not hold any \nsubsequent memorial events.\n  LTG John Keane invited the NAACP and the ADL to discuss the murders \nand work with the base to improve the racial climate. The local NAACP \nleader, James Florence, on the NAACP's relationship with Fort Bragg, \nsaid:\n\n       Since [the murders] we have had a liaison with Fort Bragg. \n     We can talk with them almost any time we need.\n\n  General Clark declined to meet with the gay groups, declined to meet \nwith the legal defense funds, and declined to meet with gay veterans \norganizations.\n  There is a dramatic difference between two commanding officers and \nhow they dealt with the hate crimes. General Keane's response to the \nsoldiers after the murders? LTG John Keane and the Army launched an \naggressive program to ``weed skinheads and extremists out of the \nmilitary.'' General Keane said:\n\n       We did not see this cancer coming. We missed the signs, \n     symbols, and manifestations of extremism.\n\n  General Keane implemented sensitivity training at Fort Bragg \nregarding race relations. He said:\n\n       We've educated our people, in terms of what to look for and \n     how to deal with it, and when we find soldiers whose \n     attitudes and behavior are disruptive to good order and \n     discipline of our unit, we are going to act.\n\n  General Clark publicly stated there was not a climate of homophobia \non Fort Campbell, did not make any public statements or issue any \nwritten directives and never publicly communicated an appreciation of \nthe harm caused by the antigay murder.\n  There are dramatic differences between how an officer dealt with \nthis, who continues to serve with great distinction in our service, and \nthe nominee.\n  Finally, here is the comparison between General Clark's response to \nthe murder of PVT Barry Winchell and the response of the Air Force \nAcademy leaders on sexual assaults. At the Air Force Academy during the \nperiod of 1993 through 2003, 60 cases of sexual assault were reported. \nEarlier this year, LTG John Dallager, the academy commandant from 2000 \nto 2003, lost his third star and retired as a major general because the \nSecretary of the Air Force determined he ``did not exercise the degree \nof leadership in this situation that we expect of our commanders.''\n  In September 2003, an independent panel commissioned to review the \nclimate situation issued a report supporting the demotion of General \nDallager and recommending an additional review to assess the actions \ntaken by other leaders and holding individuals accountable.\n\n  On General Clark, in July 1999, two Fort Campbell soldiers murdered \nBarry Winchell because they believed him to be gay. This murder \noccurred on the base, in the barracks. This murder and additional \nproblems with antigay harassment occurred during the tenure of \nCommander Clark and there has been no response.\n  My final point on the ultimate responsibility:\n\n       General Dallager is the Academy leader--[this was the \n     finding]--bearing ultimate responsibility for the failure to \n     adequately respond to sexual assault issues.\n       The Panel concurs with the decision . . . to retire General \n     Dallager. . . .\n\n  Retire him.\n  On the ultimate responsibility, Army leadership doctrine states that \ncommanders:\n\n     . . . have to answer for how their subordinates live and what \n     they do after work.\n\n  That is in the field manual.\n  In a July 19, 2000 article in the New York Times, General Clark \nstated:\n\n       There is no, nor has there ever been during my times here, \n     a climate of homophobia on post.\n\n  General Shinseki, on July 21, 2000, stated in a DoD News Briefing:\n\n       We take full responsibility for what happened to Private \n     Winchell. . . .\n\n  There is General Shinseki taking responsibility. There is a general.\n\n       We take full responsibility for what happened to Private \n     Winchell.\n\n  General Clark has failed to accept similar responsibility in this \ncase and doesn't deserve the promotion.\n  On another matter, I believe there is some remaining time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was going to reply to some of the points \nmy colleague from Massachusetts made. As you well know, the General----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I reserve the remainder of my time? Is this on the \nSenator's time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Since I had the floor, I want this additional comment I \nwould like to make on another subject, but I also want to respond to \nthe questions of the Senator, so I will be glad to do whatever you \nwould like.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary question: We are on this \nnomination with 2 hours of debate and 1 hour each divided equally. I \nmanage this side and Senator Kennedy manages that side. If the Senator \nwishes to go on to another matter, I am not sure how the Senator wishes \nto handle this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is not difficult, I think, since I \nhave 40 minutes. I will use my remaining time and ask that my comments \nbe inserted into another part of the Record so it doesn't interfere, \nand then I will be glad to answer any questions of the Senator.\n\n[[Page S15033]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill accommodate the Senator from Virginia. I would like to make some \ncomments with respect to his important remarks while they are fresh in \nthe minds of the listeners. I think it is appropriate that I take a \nlittle time. Then, as far as I am concerned, we will both yield back \nour time and the Senator from Massachusetts can take some time on \nanother matter, if he wishes. Is that helpful?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How long did the Senator plan to speak?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will summarize my comments in about 5 or 6 minutes, at \nthe conclusion of which we could both yield our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator wants to address the \nSenate first, Senator Dayton was yielded 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is under the order. I didn't realize he just walked \nin the Chamber. I am trying to do the best I can to accommodate \neverybody and manage the time efficiently. But I do desire at this \npoint in time an opportunity to reply to my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield the floor for that purpose \nand ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate had a comparison between how \nGeneral Keane and General Clark handled problems within their \nrespective commands. General Clark was the convening authority, and the \ntragedy that occurred to which the Senator referred, and which is the \nsubject of some comments here today, came up through the military \ncommand, was handled by the military courts and the military \nauthorities, and adjudicated. As the convening authority, I think he \ntook some prudent steps to make certain that in no way could he be \naccused of command influence. The tragedy in General Keane's command \nwas tried in the civilian courts, and as such he was not the convening \nauthority. He then had the opportunity to do some things which I \nbelieve General Clark did not.\n  Out of this tragedy, there were lessons learned in the Army. I think \nsome important new policy matters were put into the regulations. \nOtherwise, not all was lost in this tragic situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Army \nInspector General's Report on Fort Campbell at the conclusion of my \nremarks. That is the first section of it that addresses a number of \npoints that are raised by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe from reading this report--not in \nthe words of the Senator from Massachusetts that no one was trying to \nstop these tragic situations--that it was generally a positive command \nclimate. There were some isolated instances of harassment, sexual in \nnature. I concede that is in the Record. But the total quantity of \nthese incidents, in my judgment, was not indicative of a breakdown in \nthe command responsibilities under General Clark.\n  General Clark, as I said, came to the committee on two occasions and \nsubjected himself quite willingly--indeed, under oath; I put him under \noath at the second hearing--and he responded to the cross-examination, \nmuch of which the distinguished colleague from Massachusetts has raised \ntoday.\n  In conclusion, he has an extremely impressive record of military \nservice stretching back to 1970. Much of that has been covered by my \ncolleague from Kentucky.\n  Mind you, Fort Campbell is an installation that can at times host a \ndaily population of 24,000 military personnel and over 200 company-\nsized units.\n  In July of 1999, this brutal murder was committed at Fort Campbell by \nan intoxicated 18-year-old soldier who used frightful force against PFC \nBarry Winchell. This resulted in his death, allegedly while he was \nsleeping. No one underestimates the seriousness of this crime.\n  Senator Levin and I met in May of this year with the parents of \nPrivate First Class Winchell. Like General Clark, we extended our \nsympathy and sorrow for their loss. The committee listened very closely \nto the assertions they made about a lack of appropriate treatment by \nGeneral Clark and shortfalls in discipline and a secure environment at \nFort Campbell during the time their son was stationed there.\n  At the conclusion of the meeting, Senator Levin and I asked Private \nFirst Class Winchell's parents to put the questions and concerns they \nhad raised with us at that meeting in a letter, and we would obtain \nanswers from the Department of Defense--specifically, the Department of \nthe Army--and share those answers with them. That we did. The parents \nsent us a letter and Senator Levin and I forwarded these questions to \nthe Department. In September, the Department responded to questions and \nexpressed continued support for Major General Clark's nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of these matters be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, not only the steps taken by the Armed \nServices Committee, together with my distinguished colleague Senator \nLevin, but indeed by the Department of the Army into other areas \noverall reflect, I think, that our committee carefully looked into this \nmatter and that the Department of the Army was responsive to the \nquestions raised by my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, MG Clark is highly qualified for promotion to the rank \nof lieutenant general assignment as Commander of the Fifth United \nStates Army. He was first nominated for this position in the fall of \n2002. He has appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nexecutive session on two separate occasions, and, on both occasions \nconducted himself with deferrence and respect for the members of the \ncommittee, and with appreciation for the Constitutionally-based advise \nand consent power--and responsibility--of the Senate. Not surprisingly, \nGeneral Clark has the full support of the Chief of Staff of the Army, \nGeneral Schoomaker, and the civilian leadership of the Army for this \npromotion.\n  General Clark has an extremely impressive record of military service \nstretching back to his commissioning in 1970. General Clark's military \nrecord includes combat service in Viet Nam for which he was awarded the \nBronze Star with Combat ``V.'' He has served as a Battalion Commander \nand a Brigade Commander with the renowned ``Screaming Eagles'' of the \n101st Airborne Division. In this capacity, he participated in \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Major General Clark later \nserved as Chief of Staff for the 101st Airborne Division, and from 1998 \nthrough 2000 as Commanding General of the 101st Airborne Division and \nFort Campbell, KY.\n  Fort Campbell is an installation that can, at times, host a daily \npopulation of over 24,000 military personnel and over 200 company sized \nunits. In July 1999, a brutal murder was committed at Fort Campbell by \na drunken, 18-year-old soldier who bludgeoned Private First Class Barry \nWinchell to death in his sleep. This tragic and senseless crime was not \nforeseeable--not foreseeable by PFC Winchell's company commander and \ncertainly not foreseeable by Major General Clark. General Clark capably \nand competently fulfilled his responsibility as General court-Martial \nconvening authority in this murder trial and took steps necessary to \nensure that the perpetrator of this crime and an accomplice were \nbrought to justice. This was accomplished and the soldier who murdered \nPFC Winchell is serving a life sentence.\n\n  Senator Levin and I met in May of this year with the parents of PFC \nWinchell. We, like General Clark, extended our sympathy and sorrow for \ntheir loss. As leaders of the committee, we listened very closely to \nthe assertions they made about a lack of appropriate treatment by \nGeneral Clark, and shortfalls in discipline and a secure environment at \nFort Campbell during the time their son was stationed there.\n  At the conclusion of our meeting, Senator Levin and I asked PFC \nWinchell's parents to put the questions and concerns that they had \nraised with us in a letter, and we would obtain answers from the \ndepartment and share those answer with them. The parents did so, and we \nsent their questions to the department in June.\n\n[[Page S15034]]\n\n  In late September, the department responded to the questions, and \nexpressed continued support for Major General Clark's nomination. The \nArmy undertook to conduct inquiries through the Army Inspector General \nin response to the questions raised by the parents, and, I believe, did \nrespond fully to the issues that were raised.\n  In late September, Senator Levin and I forwarded the Department's \nresponse to PFC Winchell's parents inviting them to respond. They did \nso on October 8th. On October 10, Senator Levin and I forwarded their \nletter to the department together with additional questions from \nSenator Kennedy requesting comment. We received a response from \nsecretary Abell and Acting Secretary Brownlee on October 21st and, \nshortly thereafter, we conducted our second executive session.\n  The committee compiled a very thorough record about all the issues \nraised by Senator Kennedy and others. I will not go into specific \ndetails, but it is important to note that the Army Inspector General \nconducted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the July \n1999 death of PFC Winchell after the court-martial was completed, and \nthe IG found no basis to support accusations of dereliction of duty and \nfailure of leadership by General Clark. To the contrary, the \ninvestigation found a positive command climate at Fort Campbell and \nrefuted the assertions that Major General Clark should have done more \nor could have prevented this tragedy.\n  I am very concerned about ensuring accountability of military \nofficers, and I have insisted at looking very closely at the actions of \nmilitary leaders who are entrusted with command. I am satisfied that \nGeneral Clark did not fail in his command responsibility and is fully \ndeserving of promotion. I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n     Background\n       On 5 July 1999, Private First Class (PFC) Barry Winchell, D \n     Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, Fort \n     Campbell, Kentucky, was murdered by a fellow soldier. \n     Following this incident, and amid claims that PFC Winchell \n     was murdered because he was or was perceived to be a \n     homosexual, allegations arose concerning the command climate \n     at Fort Campbell particularly as it related to the command's \n     enforcement of the Department of Defense (DOD) Homosexual \n     Conduct Policy [hereinafter the Policy]. The Army pledged \n     early on to assess the command climate and investigate the \n     alleged violations of the Policy; however, to avoid \n     interfering in the individual judicial proceedings underway, \n     the Army could not begin that effort until the conclusion of \n     the two courts-martial arising out of PFC Winchell's death.\n       On 10 January 2000, the Secretary of the Army (SA) directed \n     that the Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG) \n     conduct an investigation into the facts and circumstances \n     surrounding the death of PFC Winchell as it related to the \n     Policy (enclosed) [hereinafter referred to as directive]. In \n     addition, the DAIG was tasked to conduct an assessment of the \n     command climate then existing in PFC Winchell's unit prior to \n     his death and an overall assessment of the command climate \n     existing at Fort Campbell prior to PFC Winchell's death, \n     specifically as it related to the Policy. Finally, the DAIG \n     was directed to provide an overall assessment of the \n     Department of the Army's (DA) implementation of the Policy. \n     The Fort Campbell assessment provided the initial data for \n     the Army assessment of the Policy. The Army IG will continue \n     to assess these issues as part of their continuing inspection \n     program.\n     Task Force Composition, Training, and Methodology\n       A Task Force of 27 individuals was established to conduct \n     the investigation and assessment in accordance with the \n     directive. The Task Force was composed of inspectors general \n     (IGs), one legal advisor, and subject matter experts. During \n     early February, the Task Force received training from the \n     subject matter experts in the areas of the Policy itself, \n     Equal Opportunity (EO), interview techniques, and group \n     dynamics. Further, the Task Force conducted mock individual \n     interviews and group sensing sessions in order to validate \n     the assessment strategy. Finally, at the request of the \n     Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN), key leaders of \n     the Task Force met with representatives of the SLDN to \n     identify specific concerns of the organization. The SLDN is a \n     national legal aid organization that assists soldiers \n     affected by the Policy.\n       The scope of the assessment included the following: \n     Interviews with the commanding general, 101st Airborne \n     Division (Air Assault), both assistant division commanders \n     who were occupying those positions in July 1999, and \n     interviews with 47 brigade and battalion-level commanders \n     from both divisional and nondivisional tenant units. \n     In addition, the Task Force conducted 68 sensing sessions \n     composed of soldiers randomly-selected by utilizing the \n     last two digits of the social security number. In these \n     sessions, 568 soldiers were interviewed and 1,385 command \n     climate surveys were administered throughout Fort \n     Campbell. With respect to the sensing sessions, it should \n     be noted that all of these soldiers were assigned to Fort \n     Campbell from the period of April 1999 through February \n     2000. In addition, participants who completed a command \n     climate survey were informed that the responses would be \n     anonymous.\n       In addition to interviews conducted on Fort Campbell, the \n     investigation team conducted on-site interviews at Fort \n     Benning and Fort Leonard Wood, as well as telephonic \n     interviews with soldiers assigned to Korea, Fort Drum, Fort \n     Knox, Fort Jackson and the United States Military Academy. \n     Civilian members of the Fort Campbell community as well as \n     former members of the Army were also interviewed by the \n     investigation team.\n       Finally, Task Force members gathered relevant data through \n     on-site inspections and additional periodic spot checks of \n     unit recreation centers, public use areas, and barracks \n     living areas. Finally, the Task Force secured information by \n     directly observing on-post soldier events to include physical \n     fitness training sessions.\n     History and Background of the Policy\n       On 29 January 1993, the President directed the Secretary of \n     Defense (SecDef) to review DOD policy on homosexuals in the \n     military. On 19 July 1993, the SecDef directed the following: \n     applicants for military service as well as current \n     servicemembers would not be asked nor required to reveal \n     their sexual orientation; sexual orientation would not be a \n     bar to entry into the service or continued service unless \n     manifested by homosexual conduct; and commanders and \n     investigating agencies would not initiate investigation \n     solely to determine a member's sexual orientation. On 30 \n     November 1993, Congress enacted 10 United States Code (USC), \n     Section 654, policy concerning homosexuality in the armed \n     forces.\n\n\n                           Assessment Results\n\n     Finding 1\n       Objective: Examine alleged violations of the DOD Homosexual \n     Conduct Policy during the period preceding PFC Winchell's \n     death.\n       Findings: 1. A preponderance of evidence indicated that two \n     noncommissioned officers (NCOs) in PFC Winchell's chain of \n     command and a fellow private (PVT) inquired into PFC \n     Winchell's sexual orientation. In addition, at least one NCO \n     referred to PFC Winchell as a ``faggot.''\n       2. In spite of this, however, the evidence gathered \n     demonstrated that the chain of command was proactive in \n     terminating the sporadic incidents of derogatory or offensive \n     cadences during unit marches and physical training (PT) \n     formations.\n       Summary: Evidence obtained from Fort Campbell indicated \n     that in late May 1999 PFC Winchell asked an NCO from his \n     unit, D Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, \n     ``What would happen if a guy in the military was gay?'' In \n     responding to that question, the NCO asked PFC Winchell if he \n     was a homosexual. Testimony revealed that the NCO asked the \n     question in an effort to offer assistance to PFC Winchell in \n     getting professional guidance or assistance in addressing the \n     issue.\n       Evidence gathered indicated that an NCO in PFC Winchell's \n     unit referred to PFC Winchell as well as other members of the \n     unit as ``faggots'' in describing those who failed to perform \n     to his standards. On one occasion, the NCO referred to PFC \n     Winchell as a ``faggot'' after PFC Winchell reported to work \n     in what appeared to be an intoxicated state.\n       The preponderance of evidence demonstrated that PFC \n     Winchell's chain of command did not condone demeaning or \n     derogatory cadences made during the conduct of unit PT. In \n     those instances where inappropriate remarks were made, \n     company leaders made on-the-spot corrections.\n     Finding 2\n       Objective: Determine whether the local IG's office \n     responded appropriately to any complaints of violations of \n     the DOD Policy it may have received prior to PFC Winchell's \n     death.\n       Finding: The Fort Campbell IG office properly responded to \n     the only known complaint of a violation of the Policy prior \n     to 5 July 1999 when they followed standard Army IG guidance \n     by recommending PFC Winchell provide his commanders the \n     opportunity to resolve his complaint prior to direct IG \n     intervention with the command.\n       Summary: Immediately after the NCO called PFC Winchell a \n     ``faggot,'' another NCO escorted PFC Winchell to the IG \n     office to file a complaint. Upon being advised that he should \n     provide his commander the first opportunity to address the \n     issue, PFC Winchell was then escorted to his company \n     commander. Evidence obtained indicated that the company \n     commander counseled the NCO regarding his inappropriate \n     remarks.\n     Finding 3\n       Objectives: 1. Conduct an overall assessment of the command \n     climate existing at Fort Campbell prior to 5 July 1999, \n     specifically as it relates to the application and enforcement \n     of the DOD Policy.\n       2. Assess the degree to which PFC Winchell's chain of \n     command understood the application and enforcement of the DOD \n     Policy.\n\n[[Page S15035]]\n\n       3. Conduct sensing sessions with randomly-selected members \n     at Fort Campbell to determine the degree to which members \n     felt they understood the Policy and the degree to which the \n     Policy was being enforced.\n       4. Assess the command climate of D Company, 2nd Battalion, \n     502nd Infantry Regiment before 5 July 1999.\n       Findings: 1. Through sensing sessions, interviews, and \n     surveys across Fort Campbell, it was determined that the \n     command climate at Fort Campbell before 5 July 1999 was a \n     positive environment with exceptions related to medical \n     support, on- and off-post housing, after-duty-hours \n     recreation, and shortages of personnel in authorized grades. \n     Most soldiers indicated satisfaction with their mission, \n     training, and organizational leadership.\n       2. With respect to the Policy, it was clear that the chain \n     of command, from commanding general (CG) through company \n     leaders, responded appropriately to matters with respect to \n     enforcement of the Policy.\n       3. The specific assessment of D Company, 2nd Battalion, \n     502nd Infantry Regiment's command climate prior to 5 July \n     1999 was determined to be poor due primarily to leadership \n     failure of a senior NCO, perceptions pertaining to underage \n     drinking, and other factors beyond the direct control of the \n     company, such as shortages of personnel in authorized grades \n     and quality of life (QOL) issues.\n       Summary: In evaluating the overall command climate at Fort \n     Campbell, personnel were asked to compare the command climate \n     as it existed in February 2000 with the command climate the \n     year prior. Overall, personnel indicated that the command \n     climate was favorable. The majority of personnel questioned \n     believed that the leadership at Fort Campbell was effective \n     and concerned and treated personnel favorably. In addition, \n     the majority of personnel questioned felt that the chain of \n     command responded appropriately to issues presented to them. \n     Finally, personnel believed that the leadership led by \n     example.\n       QOL issues contributed to low morale at Fort Campbell. \n     Specifically, issues relating to the conditions in the \n     barracks, problems associated with medical care at Fort \n     Campbell, and treatment received by soldiers from the \n     civilian employees and individuals in the surrounding \n     civilian communities were the major areas of concern to those \n     questioned.\n       In general, the application and enforcement of the Policy \n     did not appear to be a problem at Fort Campbell. Most leaders \n     took appropriate action in instances where application of the \n     Policy was warranted and appeared to be operating well within \n     the confines of the Policy. Soldiers acknowledged, however, \n     that the joking and bantering that had occurred prior to July \n     1999 on a regular basis could be viewed as harassment. \n     Following training on the Policy and Consideration of Others \n     (COO), soldiers are now more apt to reconsider uttering \n     phrases that would likely be considered harassment.\n       However, the command climate of D Company, 2nd Battalion, \n     502nd Infantry Regiment, in the period prior to PFC \n     Winchell's murder was poor. In addition to the QOL issues \n     identified above, soldiers in PFC Winchell's unit believed \n     that personnel shortages and underage drinking in the \n     barracks to the poor command climate. The most significant \n     factor contributing to the poor command climate, however, was \n     the presence of an abusive NCO in a leadership position in \n     the unit.\n     Finding 4\n       Objective: Review and resolve allegations by Private Second \n     Class (PV2) Javier Torres and others of specific violations \n     of the Policy.\n       Summary of Findings: The preponderance of evidence did not \n     support PV2 Torres' allegation that he was personally \n     harassed at Fort Campbell; however, evidence does support his \n     allegation of routine personal harassment at Fort Benning and \n     occasional personal harassment at Fort Knox. The \n     preponderance of evidence supported PV2 Torres' allegations \n     that during initial entry training (IET) at Fort Benning, one \n     drill sergeant improperly addressed or referred to him as a \n     homosexual, and another PVT provoked a fight with him by \n     routinely taunting him and referring to him as a homosexual. \n     The evidence also supported PV2 Torres' allegation that at \n     Fort Campbell a senior NCO improperly used terms derogatory \n     to homosexuals while trying to motivate male soldiers to \n     perform to standard and two NCOs improperly used terms \n     derogatory to homosexuals while singing cadences during a \n     physical training run. It did not support his allegations \n     that an NCO in his unit at Fort Campbell improperly used \n     anti-homosexual language while conducting training on the \n     Homosexual Conduct Policy, that a soldier at Fort Knox \n     improperly inquired into his sexual orientation, and that an \n     NCO in his unit at Fort Campbell improperly inquired into his \n     sexual orientation.\n       The preponderance of evidence supported allegations that an \n     NCO at Fort Campbell read a joke to soldiers that was \n     demeaning to homosexuals; anti-homosexual graffiti was \n     present on a wall of a latrine in a unit area, a latrine \n     in a public recreation area, and a latrine in a work area \n     at Fort Campbell; and a nongovernmental civilian, not a \n     soldier, sent an e-mail containing anti-homosexual \n     language to a former soldier at Fort Campbell. The \n     preponderance of evidence did not support allegations that \n     anti-homosexual comments made by soldiers at Fort Campbell \n     were the ``norm,'' soldiers made threatening and \n     inappropriate comments during training on the Policy, an \n     e-mail with a sound wave file attached that contained \n     language demeaning to homosexuals was circulated at Fort \n     Campbell, and an NCO's chain of command improperly \n     inquired into his sexual orientation.\n     Finding 5\n       Objectives: 1. Assess the degree to which PFC Winchell's \n     chain of command understood the application and enforcement \n     of the Policy.\n       2. Conduct an overall assessment of the command climate \n     that existed then at Fort Campbell, specifically as it \n     relates to the application, enforcement, and training \n     conducted on the Homosexual Conduct Policy.\n       3. Conduct sensing sessions with randomly-selected military \n     members at Fort Campbell to determine the degree to which \n     members felt they understood the Policy and the degree to \n     which they believed the Policy was being enforced.\n       Finding: There was no sustainment training conducted at \n     Fort Campbell on the Policy before 5 July 1999 because there \n     was no clearly articulated requirement on how often personnel \n     were to be trained and who was to receive the training. The \n     published guidance indicated: ``All officers and enlisted \n     personnel of the Active Army and Reserve Components will \n     receive briefings upon entry and periodically thereafter.'' \n     Institutional training of personnel on the implementation and \n     enforcement of the Policy was ineffective. Most officers, \n     NCOs, and soldiers at Fort Campbell lacked an understanding \n     and working knowledge of the Policy prior to 5 July 1999.\n       Summary: Nearly all soldiers, NCOs, and officers at Fort \n     Campbell had received training on the Policy at some point in \n     their military career. The training that was conducted, \n     however, did not contribute meaningfully to an understanding \n     or working knowledge of the Policy.\n       As a result, most personnel did not demonstrate a clear \n     understanding of their responsibilities under the Policy and \n     the standards contained within the Policy.\n     Finding 6\n       Objective: Assess whether current training materials \n     adequately convey the substance of the Policy.\n       Findings: 1. Currently, commanders, leaders, and soldiers \n     at Fort Campbell do not have a clear understanding of the \n     Policy because training and informational materials do not \n     adequately convey the substance of the Policy.\n       2. Training and informational guidance contain key words \n     (Don't Ask, Don't Tell) that are not defined in doctrine.\n       Summary: Based on interviews with commanders, leaders, and \n     soldiers, the results of the command climate survey, and a \n     review of records and files at Fort Campbell, it was \n     determined that the training provided on the Policy is not \n     clearly written, not tailored to specific audiences based on \n     rank and duty positions, fails to adequately convey the \n     substance of the Policy, and is presented in a format which \n     does not foster open and meaningful discussion on the issues.\n       Informational materials distributed to Army personnel, to \n     include a Hot Topics pullout in Soldiers Magazine and a \n     trifold pamphlet, suffered from the same defects according to \n     personnel. The use of the terms ``Don't Ask'' and ``Don't \n     Tell'' in the informational materials without providing \n     definitions to explain these phrases created a large amount \n     of anxiety and confusion.\n     Finding 7\n       Objective: Provide an overall assessment of the DA's \n     implementation of the DOD Policy by assessing:\n       1. Whether the Policy is being fairly applied within units.\n       2. Whether there are currently any other perceived \n     deficiencies in the Policy which preclude effective training, \n     application, and enforcement of the Policy.\n       Findings: 1. The Policy is being fairly applied at Fort \n     Campbell; however, the Policy with respect to discharges and \n     substantial investigations is not being implemented as \n     intended because commanders perceive an unacceptable risk to \n     the unit and soldier by retaining soldiers who make \n     admissions of homosexuality.\n       2. Commanders have difficulty in balancing their \n     responsibility to maintain morale, unit cohesion, good order, \n     and discipline while enforcing the Policy. They perceive that \n     the current implementing instructions restrain their latitude \n     to conduct inquiries and preclude them from exercising \n     reasonable discretion in initiating inquiries.\n       3. AR 600-20 and subsequent Army guidance and messages \n     regarding the reporting of harassment based on homosexual \n     orientation do not adequately advise soldiers where or how to \n     report harassment, and do not adequately advise commanders \n     and agencies how to process these complaints.\n       Summary: The Task Force determined that the Policy was \n     being fairly applied by commanders at Fort Campbell. The \n     soldiers discharged under Chapter 15 were overall satisfied \n     with their treatment during the process. The Fort Campbell \n     commanders expressed concern in complying with the Policy. \n     They believe it places them in a professional dilemma by \n     requiring them to choose between retention of a soldier who \n     declares a propensity for homosexual conduct and discharge \n     when the truthfulness of his statement of homosexuality is \n     suspect. They are\n\n[[Page S15036]]\n\n     reluctant to conduct inquiries of the truthfulness of an \n     admission because of the perceived risk to both the unit and \n     the individual soldier.\n       Commanders stated to the Task Force that they had \n     difficulty in balancing the enforcement of the Policy and the \n     requirement to maintain morale, unit cohesion, good order, \n     and discipline. Commanders expressed concerns that the Policy \n     precludes them from conducting an inquiry when presented with \n     credible information of behavior that demonstrates a soldier \n     may have a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct. They \n     believe the Policy precludes them from exercising reasonable \n     discretion in determining the necessity to conduct an \n     inquiry.\n       Information gathered by the Task Force determined that \n     guidance on reporting harassment based on sexual orientation \n     by soldiers and investigation into such harassment by leaders \n     is unclear and confusing. Soldiers and leaders expressed \n     frustration with knowing how and to whom to report harassment \n     and how to handle incidents of this type of harassment. They \n     expressed the belief that all harassment should be dealt with \n     uniformly.\n       In summary commanders and leaders at all levels have an \n     inherent responsibility for establishing a command climate \n     that promotes good order and discipline essential to \n     accomplishing the Army's mission. This responsibility \n     includes promoting unit cohesion by identifying and \n     eliminating harassment before it occurs or results in reports \n     of violations of Army Standards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit II\n\n\n                                 Office of the Under Secretary\n\n                                                    of Defense\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2003.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in reference to the \n     nomination of Major General Robert T. Clark, United States \n     Army, for appointment to the grade of lieutenant general and \n     for assignment as Commanding General, Fifth United States \n     Army that the President recently sent to the Senate. The \n     President previously forwarded Major General Clark's \n     nomination to the Senate on September 10, 2002; however, his \n     nomination was not acted upon by the Senate prior to the \n     Senate's sine die adjournment on November 22, 2002.\n       The Secretary of Defense considered reported information \n     concerning Major General Clark. Major General Clark was in \n     command of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and Fort \n     Campbell at the time Private First Class Barry Winchell, a \n     member of the command who was perceived to be homosexual, was \n     murdered in his barracks by another member of the command. \n     The Department of the Army Inspector General conducted an \n     investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the death of Private First Class Winchell and the Inspector \n     General conducted a command climate assessment at Fort \n     Campbell. Neither the investigation nor the command climate \n     assessment determined that Major General Clark was culpable. \n     We previously provided you with a copy of the Department of \n     the Army Inspector General's Report and this incident was \n     addressed in detail at an Executive Session of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee in the 107th Congress.\n       I have attached a copy of the following information for \n     your consideration: chronology of the actions and initiatives \n     taken by the Department of Defense and the Department of the \n     Army immediately following the death of Private First Class \n     Winchell; a detailed chronology of published policies and \n     actions of the dignity and respect for all soldiers directed \n     by Major General Clark while serving as the Commanding \n     General of the 101st Airborne Division and Fort Campbell; and \n     a list of initiatives implemented by Major General Clark with \n     respect to Homosexual Conduct Policy subsequent to the death \n     of Private first Class Winchell.\n       After careful review of all information, the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of the Army continued to support \n     Major General Clark for appointment to the grade of \n     lieutenant general and for assignment as Commanding General, \n     Fifth United States Army. When considered in light of Major \n     General Clark's past performance and future potential, we \n     believe proceeding with the nomination is clearly in the best \n     interest of the Department of the Army and the Department of \n     Defense.\n       The Department appreciates your assistance in facilitating \n     the confirmation of pending nominations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles S. Abell,\n                                                 Principal Deputy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Warner, for all of his courtesies during the \nconsideration of this nominee. I mentioned during my comments that we \nwanted to get additional answers. He has been extremely accommodating \nto those of us who raised the questions, as he always is as the \nchairman of the committee. I thank him for his fairness and ensuring \nthat all of those who had concerns were able to conduct our concerns in \naccordance with the rules. I thank him very much for all of his \ncourtesies.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Bunning I know has a great interest in this. I \nthank him also.\n  I will address the Senate briefly on another matter which is of \nimportance and consequence to the Senate. Then I will yield the time \nbecause I know my colleague wants to address this issue. Then we will \nbe prepared to move to a vote.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes of the 40 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. If you would let me know when 15 \nminutes have been used, I would appreciate it.\n\n\n                     Conference Report on Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, in a very few days we are going to be confronted with \nthe conference report on Medicare. There is no more important issue \nfacing the Congress and no more important issue to senior citizens and \ntheir families. Every senior citizen, every child of senior citizens, \nand every American should understand that this legislation must be \ndefeated or drastically modified.\n  This conference report represents a right-wing agenda to privatize \nMedicare and to force senior citizens into HMOs and private insurance \nplans. The day it is implemented, it will make millions of seniors \nworse off than they are today. It is a cynical attempt to use the \nelderly and the disabled's need for affordable prescription drugs as a \nTrojan horse to destroy the program on which they have relied for 40 \nyears.\n  It is important to understand how we got to this point.\n  First of all, we all understand that Medicare is one of the most \nbeloved programs this Nation has ever enacted. It is depended upon by \nseniors all over this country. It is a program which is relied on and \ndepended upon, and it works. If there is a failure in the Medicare \nProgram, it was not to have included a prescription drug program in the \nlegislation we passed.\n  That really is not what this current conference report is all about. \nThis conference report is going to threaten Medicare in a very \nsignificant and important way--in a way that those of us who believe in \nMedicare should not permit.\n  We started in the Senate with a bipartisan bill to expand the \nprescription drug coverage. We also provided additional choices to \nprivate insurance coverage for senior citizens as the President \nrequested. The bill was not a solution for the problems senior citizens \nface. It only provided about $400 billion between now and 2012 toward \nthe prescription costs that will total $1.8 trillion. But it was a \nstart, a downpayment. It was a fair and balanced compromise that \nprotected Medicare and protected senior citizens. That is why it passed \nby 76 votes. Only 11 Democrats voted no; only 10 Republicans voted no.\n\n  The House took a different course. They passed a bill that was \ndesigned to radically alter Medicare, not for the benefit of the \nelderly. That is why it passed by a slim partisan majority of one vote. \nNow the conference has been hijacked by those who want to radically \nalter Medicare, privatize, to voucherize it, to force seniors into HMOs \nand into private insurance plans.\n  The bill the Senate will consider shortly is not a bill to provide a \nprescription drug benefit. It is a bill to carry out the right wing \nagenda and asks the elderly to swallow unprecedented changes in \nMedicare in return for a limited and inadequate small prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  This conference report is so ill-conceived, not only does it put the \nwhole Medicare Program at risk, it makes 9 million seniors, almost a \nquarter of the Medicare population, worse off than they are today. If \nthis bill passes, the country will want to know: Where was their \nSenator when the Senate debated a bill that left a quarter of all \nseniors with worse drug coverage than before the bill passed? Where was \ntheir Senator when the Senate debated a so-called premium support \ndemonstration that jacked up senior citizens' premiums--senior citizens \nwho live on a fixed income, who have a median income of about $14,000--\nstarting us down the road to the unraveling of Medicare? Where was \ntheir Senator when the Senate debated a bill that stacked the\n\n[[Page S15037]]\n\ndeck against Medicare with a $12 billion slush fund for PPOs and much \nhigher payments for HMOs than standard Medicare? Where was their \nSenator when the bill gave away $6 billion to health savings accounts \nthat could jeopardize whole systems of health insurance?\n  On issue after issue after issue after issue, this report abandons \nthe bipartisan Senate bill and capitulates to the partisan right-wing \nHouse bill. On some issues it is even to the right of what the House \npassed.\n  One of the most important of these destructive changes is a concept \ncalled premium support. It should really be called insurance company \nprofit support or senior citizen coercion support. It replaces the \nstable, reliable, dependable premium that senior citizens pay for \nMedicare today with an unstable, unaffordable premium.\n  Under premium support, the administration's own estimates show the \naverage Medicare premiums will initially jump 25 percent. That is the \nadministration's estimate. Several years ago the estimate was a \nwhopping 47 percent.\n  The truth is, no one really knows how high the Medicare premiums \ncould rise. But rise they will. But we do know this. Over time, the \nincrease will become higher and higher and higher and higher. That is \njust average premiums. Under premium support, how much you pay will \ndepend on where one lives, and the amount could change dramatically \nfrom year to year. In Florida, you will pay $900 in Osceola and $2,000 \nif you live in Dade County. This chart demonstrates the price of \npremium support. This is not my estimate of what the premiums are going \nto be. This is the estimate of the Medicare actuaries. If you live in \nDade County, you will pay $2,050; if you live in Osceola, you will pay \n$1,000, twice as much. Explain that to someone who has a house in Dade \nCounty when they find out their neighbor is paying half of what they \nare paying because of premium support. This is just the beginning.\n  Premium support is a vast social experiment using senior citizens as \nguinea pigs. If it works as the proponents intend, it will raise the \npremiums in Medicare dramatically and force senior citizens to join \nHMOs and PPOs to get prescription drugs. Why would anyone want to make \nthe destructive changes to the Medicare Program that have served senior \ncitizens so well for 40 years? The answer is a radical ideology. They \nsay Medicare is bad. HMOs and PPOs are good.\n  There is no mystery here. We know what this is all about. The \nprincipal supporters of premium support are those people who are \nstrongly opposed to Medicare. Many of our colleagues--our friends, but \nour political adversaries--want to see the Medicare system withdrawn or \ndestroyed. What do they support? Premium support. What has been \naccepted in this conference? Premium support.\n\n  Some of the supporters of this program claim it's just a \ndemonstration--nothing to get excited about. But it's not a \ndemonstration. Under the terms of the demonstration, 7 million \nAmericans could be forced into the program. Half the States have local \nareas where senior citizens could be forced to take part in this \ndemonstration.\n  And that's just today. Tomorrow it will be 10 million senior \ncitizens, or 20 million, or the whole country. People say we can change \nit. Change it? We will have to pass a law to change it. We will have to \ncome to the Senate and the House of Representatives to change it.\n  This program will drain healthy seniors from Medicare and leave \nbehind those who are sick and need help the most and it will send \npremiums for those who remain in traditional Medicare up through the \nroof. People who support this program make no secret what they want to \ndo. They are on record as saying that Medicare is outdated and should \nbe scrapped and seniors should be forced into HMOs. That is the same \nphilosophy the President embraced when he initially proposed to give \nsenior citizens a drug benefit only if they joined an HMO or PPO. \nRemember that? That is what this President wanted in March of this \nyear. You only get the prescription drug program if you left the \nMedicare system and joined. We have carried that view forward with this \nprogram. I respect their opinions, but they should not use a \nprescription drug program as a Trojan horse to foist a bad idea on \nsenior citizens.\n  The second way this program privatizes and voucherizes Medicare is by \nproviding vast subsidies to the private sector at the expense of \nMedicare. Payments to the private sector will be 109 percent of the \npayments to Medicare for the private companies. If we want competition, \ncan someone explain to me why we have to give 109 percent of what we \nare giving to Medicare to the private companies? Who is paying for \nthose billions of dollars? It is the Medicare population. They have \npaid in. They are paying in. They are the ones who will pay the 109 \npercent.\n  I thought competition was supposed to be an even playing field. Not \nin this bill. Medicare is at one level; the HMOs are at 109 percent of \nMedicare. That is what they are getting. Medicare overpays by 16 \npercent because HMO enrollees are healthier. That is according to the \nCMS, the governmental institution that reviews these statistics. They \nfind out seniors in private plans are 16 percent healthier than those \nin traditional Medicare. We ask for a level playing field yet they get \n109 percent of what Medicare receives. And the people they are caring \nfor are a good deal healthier than those in Medicare.\n  It does not stop there. The private plans have an additional $12 \nbillion slush fund in case they are having difficulty. The 109 percent \nis not enough. They have a healthier population. But still, if you need \nsome help, just come my way. We have $12 billion here with which to \nreach out and help you.\n\n  Medicare will pay at least 25 percent more to insurance companies for \nevery senior citizen who joins an HMO and PPO than it would cost to \ncare for the same person in Medicare. That is competition? That is \ncompetition, my friends? That is competition? That is what is in this \nconference report.\n  The Medicare trust fund, which today's retirees paid into and rely \non, will be robbed to lavish billions of dollars on HMOs. That money, \nthat 25 percent additional premium, ought to be invested right back in \nterms of the drug program for our seniors.\n  There is no truer indication of a nation's priorities than the \ninvestments it makes. The legislation the Senate considers today \nsquanders that historic opportunity with reckless disregard for the \nNation's health.\n  No provision in the bill reveals its warped priorities more clearly \nthan the $12 billion slush fund to lure HMOs into Medicare.\n  Let's see if I have the reasoning behind this fund right. The \nsupporters of this legislation are so convinced HMOs can provide health \ncare to senior citizens more efficiently than Medicare that they have \ngiven HMOs a $12 billion payoff so they can compete. If they are so \nefficient, why do they need a handout?\n  I guess the sponsors believe the 9-percent reimbursement bonus HMOs \nalready get is not enough, and that is on top of the 16 percent boost \nHMOs get from serving a healthier population. It is a good thing HMOs \nare so efficient or we might have to bleed Medicare completely dry to \npay for them.\n  I wonder which HMO will be the lucky winner for the $12 billion \nGovernment handout. Will it be United Health Group, which made $1.4 \nbillion last year? Or maybe the $12 billion lottery winner will be \nWellPoint, whose profits last year were $703 million, and whose CEO \nmade $22.4 million. Perhaps the sponsors of this legislation think he \nneeds a handout to make ends meet.\n  Anyone who reads the bill and comes to these provisions setting up \nthis slush fund should be sickened at what they see. I challenge the \nsupporters of this legislation to go to a senior center in their State, \nto go to the coffee shop on Main Street, to go to the churches and \nexplain to the seniors they meet why their Medicare benefits are being \nstinted to give a $12 billion handout to HMOs. Explain to them why, \nwith all the Medicare improvements that could be made with $12 billion, \nthis bill decided the best use of that money is to inflate the profits \nof an HMO industry that is expected to make $6 billion this year.\n  This bill not only undermines Medicare, we find 6 million senior \ncitizens and disabled people on Medicaid--the poorest of the poor--will \nbe worse off. Their out-of-pocket payments will be raised, and their \naccess to drugs could be curtailed.\n\n[[Page S15038]]\n\n  Two to 3 million people with good employer retiree drug coverage will \nlose it, according to CBO estimates. This means almost a quarter of all \nMedicare beneficiaries will be worse off the day this bill passes.\n  This legislation reimposes the asset test, retreats from the positive \nthings in the Senate bill. Not only does this agreement put all the \ndreadful things in that harm senior citizens, it unravels Medicare by \nreimposing the asset test. Three million people who were protected with \nthe Senate bill are cut off in this program.\n  Finally, this conference puts in place an unrestricted program on \nhealth savings accounts, what used to be called medical savings \naccounts. They provide billions of new tax breaks for the healthy and \nthe wealthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed all but 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Worse, they encourage the healthy and wealthy to take \nhigh deductible policies, policies that require you to pay thousands of \ndollars before you get benefits. That is fine for people who can afford \nto put money into a tax-free savings account, but it is not good for \nordinary working people.\n  We all know what is going on here. Not a word in this controversy is \nabout prescription drugs for senior citizens. We have an agreement on \nthat. In the Senate we had a solid bipartisan compromise that would \nhave helped millions of seniors pay for the drugs they so desperately \nneed. It was not full coverage, but it was a good start. That is not \nthe issue here. We could send the bipartisan Senate bill to the White \nHouse this afternoon. President Bush could sign it before supper. But \nRepublicans will not do that. They are holding prescription drug \ncoverage hostage to their plan to destroy Medicare. They could never \npass that plan on its own, so they are adding it to the prescription \ndrug bill. Shame on them.\n  They say they have to destroy Medicare in order to save it. That is \nnonsense. There is nothing wrong with Medicare that Republicans can \nfix.\n  There is still time to do what is right. Let's stand up for senior \ncitizens and for prescription drug coverage of Medicare. Let's stand up \nagainst this conference report and these shameful assaults on Medicare.\n  I will include at this point the organizations opposed to the \nMedicare conference report. Included are the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security; the Alliance for Retired Americans; Families \nUSA; Medicare Rights Center; Center for Medicare Advocacy; Consumers \nUnion, National Senior Citizens Law Center; NETWORK: A Catholic Social \nJustice Lobby; American Public Health Association; the American \nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the American \nFederation of Teachers; NEA; Service Employees International Union; \nAFL-CIO; Older Women's League--there are close to 40 groups here.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think Senator Cornyn is seeking \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I know this is \nthe time that was set aside to talk about the nomination of MG Robert \nClark and his promotion to lieutenant general. I want to talk about \nthat in just a moment.\n  I would say I have been interested in listening to the comments of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts on another topic, on the Medicare \nconference report that will soon come to the floor. I must confess when \nthat bill was first considered by this body, I could not support it. It \nwas always my hope that once it went through the conference committee \nit would be improved. Indeed, from what I know of the bill so far, it \nhas been. But I am so far undecided on how to vote on the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nWhat is the order of business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I can conclude my remarks, then I would \nbe glad to yield for a question in the time that remains.\n  My concern was about some of the comments made or the \ncharacterization made about the bill as being the product of some \nrightwing agenda. I do note in the announcement I heard, along with the \nAmerican people, on Saturday, with the majority leader and Chairman \nChuck Grassley of the Senate Finance Committee seated there, and also \nthe Speaker of the House Denny Hastert, and others, including the \nranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, who is a \nDemocrat, and John Breaux, the Senator from Louisiana, another \nDemocrat, who both have been leaders on Medicare reform, and what was \nannounced was a bipartisan conference committee agreement on \nprinciples.\n\n  I do not know how this debate will ultimately pan out, but I do not \nbelieve the debate is advanced by, frankly, characterizing it as a \nproduct of some conspiracy or captive of some special interest agenda. \nI do know there are a lot of people who have been active on this issue \non both sides of the aisle who support the bill. There are others who \nexpress concerns, and I want to explore those in the coming days in \ndeciding how I might ultimately vote.\n  But, Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about what I thought \nwas the subject of the day and of this hour, which is the promotion of \nMG Robert Clark to lieutenant general.\n  First and foremost, I am well aware of some of the concerns that have \nbeen expressed about Major General Clark. I do not believe these \nconcerns are based on any facts, but perhaps sentiment alone.\n  As we know, as the record reflects, in July 1999, a soldier named PFC \nBarry Winchell in General Clark's division was murdered by a fellow \nsoldier at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It is alleged this young man was \nmurdered because he was perceived to be a homosexual.\n  I am sure I speak for the entire Senate when I say such inhumane acts \ndeserve every condemnation. My heart, and that of others, goes out to \nthe friends and family of Barry Winchell as they mourn his untimely \ndemise.\n  The perpetrators of this heinous crime were, however, punished to the \nfullest extent of the law. As the convening authority for the court-\nmartial,\n\n[[Page S15039]]\n\nMajor General Clark played a key role in ensuring the people who \nsavagely killed Private First Class Winchell were, in fact, brought to \njustice.\n  Unfortunately, there are those who want to unfairly blame major \nGeneral Clark for this tragic death.\n  This is a very serious charge and should not be made lightly. I \ncommend Chairman Warner for his excellent work in making sure that this \nnomination has been carefully considered by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. In fact, the committee spent more than a year looking into \nthis tragic situation so that we could make sure we knew everything \nthat could be known about the facts and circumstances involving Private \nFirst Class Winchell's death and any alleged culpability or \nresponsibility that General Clark might bear for this tragedy.\n  This is what we learned. The Department of the Army inspector general \nconducted a full investigation into the facts and circumstances of the \ndeath of Private First Class Winchell at Major General Clark's request. \nThe inspector general also conducted an overall command climate \nassessment at Fort Campbell which, as Chairman Warner pointed out, \nconsisted of, at the time, about 25,000 soldiers. Neither the \ninvestigation nor the command climate assessment found that Major \nGeneral Clark was in any way responsible for this sad event. The \nrecord, in fact, demonstrates that General Clark conducted himself as a \nconsummate professional, before and after the homicide. He adopted \nenhanced unit level training programs to ensure that Department of \nDefense policy was understood and implemented. And he repeatedly took \npersonal action to communicate the requirements of the proper conduct \nand respect each soldier deserves.\n  The murder of Barry Winchell was indeed a tragedy. But it would be \nwrong to allow the career of a great American soldier to be ended over \nfalse allegations of some vague perceived shortcomings, when it is \nclear that he joins all of us in condemning the despicable actions of \nthe drunken soldier that took Barry Winchell's life.\n  General Clark is more than worthy of promotion to lieutenant general. \nA San Antonio native, General Clark is a graduate of Texas Tech \nUniversity and, like many brave Texans, he chose to serve his country \nin a military career. In fact, 1 out of every 10 men and women in \nuniform today is from the State of Texas, something of which we are \nimmensely proud. What a career General Clark has had, spanning more \nthan three decades on as many continents. Among other decorations, \nGeneral Clark has received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion \nof Merit with four Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze Star for Valor, and \nthe Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster for his service.\n  To my mind, these achievements alone would merit his promotion. His \nrecord demonstrates that he has been a fine officer and, indeed, a \ngreat American patriot.\n  But there is also this: When Major General Clark was only First \nLieutenant Clark, barely a year in uniform, he was serving in Vietnam \nas the first platoon leader of Company A, the Second Battalion of the \n8th Calvary, the 1st Calvary Division. As his men were being extracted \nfrom hostile territory following a ground reconnaissance mission, they \nwere engaged by enemy mortar fire, and the first two rounds caused \nheavy casualties, including Lieutenant Clark. A lesser soldier might \nhave faltered in this situation, but even though he was wounded, \nLieutenant Clark did not forget his foremost duty was to his own men. \nWith total disregard for his personal safety, for his wounds, \nLieutenant Clark put himself in the line of mortar fire again to carry \nwounded members of his company out of harm's way. He bravely moved from \nposition to position, urging his men on until help arrived.\n\n  For his wounds, Lieutenant Clark was awarded the Purple Heart; for \nhis valor, the Bronze Star.\n  General Clark has literally bled for his country. He has put his life \non the line for his men and, yes, for us. He has dedicated himself to \ndefending American freedoms against all enemies. In short, he is a true \nAmerican patriot.\n  There are brave young men and women who today are doing exactly the \nsame thing that General Clark was doing then: fighting for the cause of \nfreedom and democracy in the ongoing war on terror. They are serving a \njust cause with bravery and dedication. I can think of no better leader \nthan Major General Clark to serve as a living example to them, the next \ngeneration of American heroes.\n  I yield back any remaining time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Minnesota is to \nbe recognized next. Is there a time agreement, to clarify my own \nunderstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama controls 29 minutes \nat this point. The minority controls almost 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, 15 of the minority's 20 \nminutes is pledged to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank my colleague from Alabama. I had not intended to \ninterrupt my distinguished colleague from Texas with whom I have \ntraveled to Iraq and other places, but I misunderstood exactly where we \nwere, given the subject matter that was being discussed. I apologize \nfor the interruption. I will focus my remarks on this matter because it \nis one that is deserving of all the attention and concern of the \nMembers of this body, and it is a very difficult matter, one that I \nwish we didn't have to confront in this Chamber and one I wish we \ndidn't have to confront in this country.\n  But we do. We have a general with, generally, a very distinguished \nrecord, who now has been nominated for promotion to a very high office, \ncommanding general of the Fifth Army. I have the greatest respect for \nthe top echelon of our military command, as I have come to watch them, \nwork with them, see their dedication and their professionalism and \ntheir compassion and concern for the men and women under their command. \nI regret having to raise these questions about any one of them.\n  But we have a dead American soldier on the other hand, a young man \nwho lost his life while in uniform, while in the service of his \ncountry. He wasn't murdered in Iraq, as some of our brave soldiers are \nthese days, or in Afghanistan, or somewhere else. He wasn't in a \ntraining accident, as some soldiers from Minnesota have been, in this \ncountry or abroad.\n  He was murdered. He was murdered by his own fellow American soldiers. \nHis crime? His crime was that he was perceived and believed to be gay. \nI use that word ``crime'' rhetorically because I don't believe--I don't \nthink Americans believe--that the sexual preference of an individual is \na crime or should be a crime. It is not a crime in this country, \npunishable by death.\n  That can only happen in a country such as Iraq, or some country with \na vicious totalitarian regime, where if someone is different in any way \nand somebody decides it is wrong, they are not only excluded by society \nor discriminated against, but they are harassed, tortured, or executed. \nBut not in the United States of America.\n  However, it happened in this country at Fort Campbell, KY, in 1999, \nunder General Clark's command. The soldiers who committed that terrible \ncrime have been prosecuted, convicted, and are serving sentences.\n  The military system that allowed that atrocity to occur remains. It \nis a system which permitted a succession of actions--from taunts, \nhumiliations, bullying, all sorts of prejudice, immoral and illegal \nbehavior--to occur and recur. What happened as a consequence? Nothing. \nNothing. Nothing, unfortunately, is what happens most of the time in \nthe Army of this country today.\n  I am very proud of that Army in many respects, but I am not proud of \nan Army, or any other institution in this country, that permits \ndiscrimination against men and women because of their sexual \npreference. It is just that nothing usually happens when young women \nare assaulted and raped at the Air Force Academy--another matter we are \ndealing with on the Armed Services Committee. Their ``crime'' is that \nthey are women.\n\n[[Page S15040]]\n\n  Women have been admitted to the Air Force Academy for 30 years and \nhave been flying side by side in airplanes, and taking all of the \nrisks, and doing as well as their counterparts. But they are being \nassaulted and raped time after time. We have discovered that at the Air \nForce Academy, what has usually happened to the perpetrators of those \ncrimes is very little or nothing.\n  These are impressionable young men and women in our Armed Forces--\nmost of them. They are outstanding young men and women. I have \ninterviewed a number of them. I think all of us have that \nresponsibility. I find, when I have the opportunity to interview young \nmen and women who are seeking admission to or nomination to our \nmilitary academies, that they are really fine young men and women. \nThere is a lot of competition to get in. When I have those interviews, \nwhen I am talking to other young men and women in uniform as I travel \nback and forth, I don't see these kinds of attitudes. I don't see young \nmen and women who are looking at their fellow soldiers with this kind \nof prejudice or are considering these kinds of atrocities.\n  I just visited, in Minnesota over the weekend, a soldier who had one \nside of his arm shredded while serving in the Iraqi theater. He is \nrecovering, thank God. He is a 21-year-old young man. He will recover. \nAnother young Minnesotan lost most of his right leg, but he has great \nspirit and morale and he will live a great life.\n  But I have also visited parents of young men and women who are not \nrecovering, who are not coming home because they paid the ultimate \nprice for their service. I am on the Armed Services Committee, and when \nI look at the reports and the casualty figures of the brave young \nAmericans who are being injured or wounded or maimed or who died in \ncombat, I don't see categories of ``heterosexual'' or ``gay'' or \n``lesbian'' and I don't see ``women'' or ``men.'' I see American \nsoldiers, with the same kind of blood and bodies. All they are asking \nis an equal opportunity to serve their country, to risk their lives in \nthe service of their country--even to die in the service of their \ncountry.\n\n  Amazingly enough, that is what these young women who are going to the \nAir Force Academy, and the young men and women entering the Armed \nForces, who have a same-sex affinity--that is what they want, the same \nopportunity to fight, to be heroic, and even to die for their country.\n  That is what makes it so inexplicable and inexcusable and \nunforgivable when they are discriminated against, when they are treated \nthe way they are, and when they have nowhere to turn.\n  So who is responsible? Who is accountable? Who loses a rank or a \npromotion or a star because a gay soldier was murdered under his \ncommand? General Clark's actions following that atrocity were \nquestionable and, I would say, barely marginal. General Clark's actions \nin many other instances throughout his distinguished career have been \nextraordinary, heroic, and commendable, and I salute him for them. But \nit wasn't only his actions after this atrocity that were called into \nquestion; it was the actions and inaction before this occurred, which \npermitted in this environment of opportunities for repeated \ndiscrimination and harassment--for an NCO who was clearly unfit to be \nresponsible for impressionable young men who, by his own conduct--or \nmisconduct--showed them how not to treat a fellow soldier. That is what \nconcerns me about this today.\n  I expect we will confirm General Clark's promotion. He will go on, \nand I hope he performs with great distinction, as I believe he will, as \na commanding general of the 5th Army. But what is going to happen to \nall the other gay and lesbian soldiers out there? What kind of message \nare we sending to them? What kind of message do we send to the young \nwomen who get raped at the Air Force Academy when they see those who \ncommit the terrible acts being promoted? What happens to a military's \nnetwork of people when those promotions occur untouched by these kinds \nof atrocities, and eventually they are the military command or they are \nthroughout the military command? How are we ever going to change what \nis going on in these situations if no one is held accountable, if there \nis no consequence for not doing what a commander should do--what in \nsome instances they are required by law to do?\n  Regardless, common sense and decency and morality would tell them \nthat anybody responsible for the lives of young people ought to keep \npeople from ganging up or abusing or assaulting or picking on or \nmurdering a fellow human being--not to mention a fellow soldier but a \nfellow American citizen. What happens to all of us when we let that go \non?\n  As I said earlier, I think the U.S. military is outstanding in so \nmany respects. It is that institution where, historically, young men \nand women have been able to come from all over the country, all \ndifferent backgrounds; it is the great opportunity provider. It doesn't \nmatter if your parents don't have any money or if you don't have much \neducation; you can find yourself and become somebody and either serve \nwith great distinction and make it a career or you can come back into \nsociety and do just as well. But you are not going to be that kind of \nperson or that kind of professional or that kind of citizen or leader \nof this country if you are learning that is what happens, and that is \nOK, and those who do it get promoted, and those who are the victims \nsuffer the terrible consequences.\n  That is a terribly destructive message to those individuals, a \nterribly destructive result to our Nation; and if this body means the \nconcerns it expressed here--and I take them at good faith, but if we \nmean that, we are not going to be satisfied, and we should not be, by \ndoing nothing other than promoting this general today.\n  We owe it to those men and women who have suffered, and those who \nhave lost their lives through these atrocities, to take responsibility \nand tell the military, because we are the civilian command, that we are \nnot going to do it; the buck stops here because no one else will, that \nwe are going to insist on an armed forces that reflects, represents, \nand defends the standards of the basic decency the founding principles \nof this country that all men and women are created equal, they are \nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among \nthem are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the right to \ndefend their country and be a patriot and not have somebody attacking \nthem, humiliating them, or murdering them because of who they are.\n\n  That is the responsibility of leadership. That starts at the top, all \nthe way down. It does not come from the bottom because that is where \nthe base level is. It has to come from the top, from the commanders, \nfrom the civilians who are responsible for the system which they \ncommand and for those who are putting their lives, their hopes, their \ndreams, and their careers on the line. We have a lot of work to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nyielding me a few minutes to discuss the nomination of GEN Robert \nClark. I rise in support of the nomination. This is a very sensitive \nissue and it is one that needs to be dealt with in the right way by \nthis body, and I think it has been.\n  The tragic death of PVT Barry Winchell should never have occurred, \nnor should any murder of that sort. The fact is, once it did occur, \nGeneral Clark did everything within his power, first, to see that \njustice was done.\n  During the course of seeing that justice was done, there was a review \nof all of his procedures and regulations that were in place at Fort \nCampbell relative to the circumstances that led up to this unfortunate \ndeath. General Clark was somewhat handicapped by not being able to \nspeak out openly and publicly after the death because he was a \nconvening authority for the court-martial and therefore he could not \nreally come forward and have a whole lot to say about the facts and \ncircumstances leading up to the death of Private Winchell.\n  The fact is that he did make some changes in the procedures. He did \nmake sure other regulations that had been in place prior to this \nunfortunate death\n\n[[Page S15041]]\n\nwere enforced to an even greater degree than at the time this incident \noccurred.\n  It is truly a tragic situation that was of great concern to General \nClark. I have had the opportunity to visit with him on a couple of \ndifferent occasions, and one does not have to talk with him very long \nto see the concern in his eyes and in his heart relative to the death \nof Private Winchell.\n\n  I have also had the opportunity to meet with Private Winchell's \nparents. Again, we expressed to them deep sorrow and that our prayers \ngo out to them. No matter what, we cannot bring their son back. I think \nwe do need to make sure that as we move through this process we review \nwhat was done relative to the facts and circumstances leading up to \nthis terrible murder and the facts and circumstances as they occurred \nafter the death of Private Winchell.\n  As I reviewed this situation with General Clark and as I looked at \nthe IG investigation that he ordered to take place after the death \noccurred and after the court-martial was completed, it is pretty \nobvious that he did everything he could have done to ensure that \njustice was done and that the atmosphere surrounding the troops at Fort \nCampbell was not poisoned and everybody was treated in an equal and \nfair manner.\n  It is very unfortunate that this situation had to occur, but at the \nsame time it is very important that we make sure the procedures of the \nArmy are followed very closely, and they were. It is very important \nthat we make sure the sensitivity directed towards the family has taken \nplace, and I believe it has. It has not been a perfect situation. \nGeneral Clark, just as any officer or any individual in the corporate \nstructure of any company in America, can look back on a situation as \ntragic as this and say that maybe they should have done something a \nlittle bit differently. The fact is, General Clark has always provided \nstrong leadership during his career in the U.S. Army, and I think, once \nagain, he exhibited strong leadership.\n  He did everything within his power to see that justice was done and \nto see that appropriate rules and regulations were put in place where \nthey needed to be and that they were carried out to the highest degree. \nSo I rise in support of GEN Clark, and I hope my colleagues will see \nfit to confirm his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of \nMajor General Robert T. Clark to the rank of Lieutenant General and to \nthe position of Commander, United States Fifth Army.\n  Former President Harry Truman placed a sign on his desk in the Oval \nOffice that read ``The Buck Stops Here.'' As Commander in Chief of the \nUnited States Armed Services, President Truman took full responsibility \nfor every action that took place under his watch, at every rank. He \nnever shifted blame, and he never accepted failure.\n  The same, cannot be said for General Clark.\n  In 1999, while General Clark was the commanding officer at Fort \nCampbell in Kentucky, Private First Class Barry Winchell was bludgeoned \nto death with a baseball bat by a fellow soldier who believed that \nPrivate Winchell was gay.\n  Did General Clark immediately accept responsibility for this terrible \nincident? Did he use his position of authority to stamp out the hateful \nand dangerous climate of anti-gay sentiment on the base?\n  No, he did not. Instead, General Clark claimed that there wasn't \nanything wrong on his base, denying that a vile culture of hate and \nharassment against gays had been pervasive for some time. But his \nsentiments do not jibe with reports from soldiers at the base detailing \nwidespread harassment of soldiers thought to be homosexual and the \nubiquitous presence of anti-gay graffiti.\n  The hazing and harassment that Private Winchell experienced before \nhis murder were so pernicious that he bravely reported these episodes \nto the inspector general. This was a very risky course of action \nbecause it could have led to Private Winchell's discharge under the \n``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy.\n  On his departure from Fort Campbell, General Clark declared, ``There \nis not, nor has there ever been during my time here, a climate of \nhomophobia on post.'' Tell that to Barry Winchell's family.\n  Apparently, the buck did not stop with General Clark. Instead of \naddressing the problem of homophobia at Fort Campbell, General Clark \nignored it. Immediately after Private Winchell's murder, General Clark \nremained silent. He did not condemn anti-gay behavior on his base. He \nrefused to meet with gay rights organizations who simply wanted to \naddress the homophobia prevalent there. Surprisingly, General Clark \nfailed to request the psychological and training services provided by \nthe Army on how to address anti-gay harassment after the murder.\n  General Clark even delayed meeting with Private Winchell's family--\ndespite their repeated entreaties--for almost 4 years after his murder. \nI find this particularly inexplicable and inexcusable.\n  The tragic murder of Private Winchell was not the only problem \noccurring at Fort Campbell. According to an Inspector General review of \nthe base, Fort Campbell suffered from low morale, dilapidated barracks \nin need of repair, inadequate health care, and significant problems \nwith underage drinking.\n  Today, the Senate faces the decision whether to promote General Clark \nto a very high-ranking position in the U.S. military. This position \nrequires proven leadership skills.\n  I do not think that General Clark showed leadership at Fort Campbell, \neither before or after Private Winchell was murdered. He let Private \nWinchell down. He passed the buck.\n  I rise today to say that General Clark's lack of leadership at Fort \nCampbell dissuade me from supporting his promotion. I believe this \npromotion sends the wrong message about what we expect from our \ncommanding officers, especially now in a time of war.\n  I served in the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II. Over \nthe course of my three years of service, I never encountered a superior \nofficer who avoided responsibility for his soldiers or their actions. \nEach and every one of my commanding officers expected and demanded the \nbest from me; their leadership, in turn, inspired me to do my best.\n  I don't think Major General Clark inspires such dedication and \nservice. Therefore, I will vote against this nomination and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of MG Robert \nT. Clark to the rank of lieutenant general. The facts surrounding his \nconduct, prior to and after the murder of PFC Barry Winchell, raise \nquestions about his leadership and judgment that have not been answered \nto my satisfaction.\n  The Inspector General of the Army, while clearing Major General Clark \nof fostering a hostile environment at Fort Campbell, raised serious \nissues about discipline at the base. Furthermore, some of Major General \nClark's actions after Private Winchell's murder raise legitimate \nquestions about his fitness for higher command. In the immediate \naftermath of the murder, for example, a public affairs officer at the \nbase issued a statement describing the murder as a ``physical \naltercation in a post barracks.'' This gross distortion of the facts \nwas not corrected. In fact, Private Winchell had been asleep at the \ntime his murderer struck, goaded on by other soldiers. General Clark \ntook no steps to correct this claim in public, and later defended his \naction as in keeping with his mandate not to prejudice the ongoing \ninvestigation. Regrettably, these actions leave the appearance of a \ngeneral officer who did not want the negative attention that would \nresult from a hate crime under his command.\n  General Officers are rightly held to incredibly high standards of \nconduct, and they should be. The men and women under their command are \nworthy of no less. In this case, Major General Clark appears to have \ncome up short, as evidenced by the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nfailure to pass this nomination unanimously. Instead of clarity, the \nnomination process has left us with lingering concerns\n\n[[Page S15042]]\n\nabout the general's fitness for higher command.\n  Mr. President, I recognize and appreciate Major General Clark's long \nservice in the Armed Forces of our country. But there remain too many \nlegitimate questions about his leadership and judgment stemming from \nhis command of the 101st Airborne at the time of Private Winchell's \nmurder to confirm his nomination to the rank of lieutenant \ngeneral.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to speak today on the nomination \nfor promotion of Major General Robert T. Clark and the broader issue of \nthe Department of Defense's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. The \nunusually lengthy and controversial nomination of General Clark has, \nonce again, brought attention to the failure of the Pentagon's policy \ntowards gay servicemembers. It is high time that we stop this policy of \ncodified discrimination against our brave servicemen and women who \nhappen to be gay.\n  I fear that this policy may have been a contributing factor in the \nJune 5, 1999, brutal murder of PVT Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, KY, \na base commanded by General Clark. I will not reiterate the facts of \nthat case at this time, but I will say that there are strong \nindications that there was a pervasive and hostile anti-gay climate at \nFort Campbell both before and after the tragic murder of Private \nWinchell and that the base leadership, including General Clark, appears \nto have done little, if anything, to address it.\n  Mr. President, the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has failed. It \nfailed to give Private Winchell useful options to combat the harassment \nhe faced during the months prior to his murder. It failed to force \nGeneral Clark to take effective action to eliminate the anti-gay \nclimate at Fort Campbell. And it continues to fail to stop the \ndiscrimination and harassment faced by our brave gay servicemembers.\n  I want to take this opportunity to urge the Pentagon to begin \ninstituting changes to its policy towards gay servicemembers. The \nPentagon should provide, at a minimum, a safe place for gay and lesbian \nservicemembers to report harassment without fear that they will be \nkicked out of the military because of their sexual orientation. This \nmodest step would be one small way to honor the memory of Private \nWinchell and to prevent what happened to him from ever happening again.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the promotion of \nMajor General Robert T. Clark to Lieutenant General in the United \nStates Army, which is pending consideration by the Senate. On October \n23, 2003, the Senate Committee on Armed Services voted to favorably \nreport General Clark's promotion for consideration by the Senate. The \nvote taken was a voice vote. I asked, however, that the record reflect \nthat had there been a recorded vote, I would have voted to oppose this \npromotion.\n  I have deep respect and admiration for our military leaders. I have \noften said that anyone who achieves the rank of a flag or general \nofficer deserves a Ph.D. for the amount of education and training they \nhave successfully completed to attain such distinguished rank. In my \ncapacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the co-\nchair of the Senate Army Caucus, I have had the privilege of working \nwith many of our Nation's most respected military leaders.\n  This has been a difficult decision for me. General Clark's promotion \nhas been pending consideration before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for 14 months. Military promotions are usually very simple to \nconsider, and are rarely troublesome or controversial. I normally do \nnot hear from my constituency about a military promotion. In this case, \nhowever, I was contacted by a number of my constituents asking me to \noppose General Clark's promotion, primarily for his actions as \nCommanding General of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY, \nduring a difficult time when PFC Barry Winchell was murdered. For this \nreason, I made sure that I had the opportunity to review as much \nmaterial as possible pertaining to General Clark's career as well as \nthe facts surrounding the incident that led to Private First Class \nWinchell's death.\n  In March 2003, I joined some of my colleagues in writing a letter to \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to request information regarding the specific \nactions General Clark took to eliminate the climate of anti-gay \nharassment that existed at Fort Campbell prior to Private First Class \nWinchell's death; statements General Clark made regarding antigay \nharassment to officers, soldiers, and the public; the policies he \npromulgated addressing this issue; other steps he took to prevent \nfurther acts of violence and harassment; how he handled the Winchell \ncase in comparison to other serious crimes occurring during his \ncommand; and his response, as well as the response of those around him, \nto requests by Private First Class Winchell's family to meet with him. \nI reviewed the information provided and participated in an executive \nsession held on October 23, 2003, where General Clark was available for \nquestions.\n  After reviewing all of the information and listening to General \nClark's testimony, I decided that I could not support his promotion to \nLieutenant General. General Clark's professional record reflects many \ndistinguished accomplishments as a military officer. However, I remain \nconcerned about his lack of what I believe to be leadership qualities \nthat are necessary for today's military leaders.\n  I remain disturbed by General Clark's continued reliance on lack of \nknowledge regarding misconduct and antigay harassment on post as a \nrationale for his lack of action. General Clark had been in command of \nthe 101st Airborne Division for 17 months prior to Private First Class \nWinchell's death. While I understand a commanding general is not \nresponsible for the individual actions of his soldiers, I firmly \nbelieve that a commanding general sets the tone on an installation and \ncan influence what his soldiers believe will be considered \n``acceptable'' behavior. I was disturbed to learn of repeated instances \nof underage drinking and harassment, and of the assessment, \nparticularly of those soldiers in Private First Class Winchell's unit, \nof the command climate prior to Private First Class Winchell's death.\n  I am also disturbed by General Clark's refusal to take responsibility \nfor the incident. During his tenure as Chief of Staff of the Army, \nGeneral Eric Shinseki took responsibility for what happened to Private \nFirst Class Winchell. This reflects official Army policy that \ncommanders at all levels are accountable for everything their command \ndoes or fails to do. As a leader, I believe General Clark should have \ntaken responsibility or expressed accountability for the circumstances \nthat led to this Private First Class Winchell's death.\n  I believe his failure to initiate a meeting with Private First Class \nWinchell's family reflects poor leadership on his part. His position as \nconvening authority did not prevent him from meeting with the parents \nof a soldier murdered on an installation over which he had command and \nresponsibility.\n  Again, General Clark's record reflects that he has led a \ndistinguished military career. However, I do not believe his actions as \nthe Commanding General of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, \nKY, warrant his promotion to lieutenant general.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this has been a very difficult nomination \nfor the Armed Services Committee. We worked very hard for over a year \nto ensure that we developed all of the relevant facts so we could make \nan informed decision. In fact, this nomination was first sent to the \nCongress in the last session and then was resubmitted in this session.\n  It is totally appropriate that we took this time to address Major \nGeneral Clark's nomination because PFC Barry Winchell, a soldier \nserving in Major General Clark's command at Fort Campbell, was brutally \nmurdered by another soldier on July 5, 1999.\n  Fort Campbell is a large fort, perhaps 25,000 soldiers and 46,000 \nfamily members. We were interested in what the command climate was in \nMajor General Clark's command, particularly as it related to his \ncommand's implementation of the Department's Homosexual Conduct Policy. \nWe also wanted to see how Major General Clark responded after the \nmurder.\n\n[[Page S15043]]\n\n  Major General Clark asked the Army Inspector General to conduct an \ninvestigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the murder. \nThe Inspector General conducted this investigation and also conducted \nan assessment of the command climate at Fort Campbell before the \nmurder. Neither the investigation nor the command climate assessment \nfound fault with Major General Clark's actions.\n  We met with Private Winchell's family. We met with Major General \nClark on a number of occasions. We met with other Army officials. We \nmet with organizations and individuals who expressed an interest in \nthis nomination. So under Senator Warner's leadership, I believe our \ncommittee has given full consideration to the nomination of Major \nGeneral Clark and the events which have to be described as tragic when \nconsidering that nomination.\n  Every one of us, every human being who has knowledge of this \nincident, is appalled by the brutal murder of a soldier sleeping in his \nbarracks. So we first wanted to look at, again, the incident and the \ncommand climate prior to the incident. We reviewed the Inspector \nGeneral's report that stated that the chain of command, from commanding \ngeneral through company leaders, responded appropriately to matters \nwith respect to the enforcement of the Department of Defense Homosexual \nConduct Policy.\n  One of the most difficult issues had to do with the statement of \nPrivate Winchell's family that they requested a personal meeting with \nMajor General Clark and they did not receive a personal meeting with \nhim.\n  I think the fact they made that request and it was not complied with \nwas troubling to all of us. As we dug into it, we heard from Major \nGeneral Clark on this issue. He looked us in the eye and said he never \nreceived such a request. That is not to say the request was not made. \nIt is to say that I think most of us believed Major General Clark when \nhe said that request was never forwarded to him. What happened to that \nrequest we do not know, and perhaps nobody ever will know.\n  Major General Clark wrote a letter to the family. It was a heartfelt \nletter. It was a personal letter about the death of their son. It was \nreally a comment that he added in that letter, which was so personal \nand so heartfelt, that I think persuaded many of us that he was honest \nwhen he stated that there is no way he would not respond to a family \nrequest to meet with him.\n  As others have mentioned, he did have a special responsibility, as \nthe General Court-Martial Convening Authority, to ensure that justice \nwas done and to make sure nothing he would say would in any way create \nerror in that trial.\n  The murderer, PVT Calvin Glover, was convicted of premeditated murder \nby the court-martial, which was convened by Major General Clark. He was \nsentenced to life imprisonment and, of course, a dishonorable discharge \nfrom the Army.\n  Another soldier was convicted of obstruction of justice and making a \nfalse official statement and was sentenced to 12\\1/2\\ years confinement \nand a dishonorable discharge.\n  To the extent that justice can ever be done following a brutal murder \nof this kind, justice was done in this case. It was done under the \nleadership of the convening authority, Major General Clark himself.\n  In the end, looking at all the information that is available to us, I \nhave concluded that we should confirm this nomination and that it would \nbe appropriate, at the same time, however, for us to take note of the \nevents relative to this nomination, that surround it, the length of \ntime this nomination has been pending, all of the inquiries and \ninvestigations and reports which have been requested, and hope all of \nthis together will lead to a different environment and a different \nclimate in the unit at issue here.\n  I ask for 1 additional minute, if I may, from the majority side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator can use that from the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  When we put all this together, the hope, I think of all of us, is \nthat the kind of climate that apparently existed in that one unit, not \nknown to Major General Clark--because the Inspector General found no \nevidence that he knew of any anti-gay climate in any of the units, much \nless that one. There was in one unit some anti-gay rhetoric which was \nimmediately responded to by the captain in charge of that unit. As a \nmatter of fact, the captain counseled the noncommissioned officer and \nput an immediate end to the anti-gay rhetoric. But that was not known \nto General Clark.\n  For all these reasons, I think it is appropriate we now confirm this \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin for his work on \nthis issue, and Senator Warner's efforts as the Chairman. Senator Levin \nand Senator Warner have discussed this issue in great detail. Senator \nWarner made clear he was going to take it seriously, that there would \nbe ample opportunity to evaluate any questions that arose from these \nterrible circumstances, and that the facts would come out in committee \nand could be presented forthwith. That was done. We heard all of the \ninformation that was available. I would note it is time, now, to move \nforward.\n  General Clark's nomination has been blocked for over a year now. He \nis a tremendously fine soldier. He is just not the one responsible \nhere. I also should note that I do not think it is correct, as some \nhave indicated, to say people who fail to adhere to DOD policy get \npromoted. General Clark acted aggressively against the climate and the \nactions that resulted in this terrible murder.\n  In July of 1999, PVT Barry Winchell was a member of the 502nd \nInfantry Regiment. He was murdered in his bed as a result of a brutal \nassault by another private, Calvin Glover. Before his death, Winchell \nhad been perceived as gay by Private Glover, and Winchell had \ncomplained about harassment in his company to superiors.\n  I should note that there was evidence that a platoon sergeant had \nmade insensitive comments about gays, but there was not evidence of \ncommand responsibility in any way.\n  In December of 1999, after General Clark convened a court-martial and \na trial was conducted, Private Glover was convicted of first-degree \npremeditated murder and was given life without parole. The individual \nwho was Private Glover's buddy, who obstructed the investigation to \nsome degree, was given 12 years in jail, without parole. He is serving \nthat time.\n\n  I know the Chair has served as a lawyer and clerk to Federal judges. \nGeneral Clark was the convening authority for a general court-martial. \nHe was the superior commander on a base with 25,000 people. We don't \nhold mayors responsible for crimes committed in cities of 25,000 \npeople. In fact, one of the highest crime rates in America is among \nyoung males. So, what we have in this base is 25,000 of the kind of \npeople who, statistically, tend to get in more fights, more crimes, and \ncommit more murders than anyone else. That is my experience as a \nprosecutor. I think it is indisputable that that is so.\n  So it is therefore not possible for a commander of a 25,000 member \nfacility or military base, to guarantee there are not going to be \nfights and even murders every now and then. Heaven help us, that they \noccur, and the climate ought to be set in a way that minimizes that. \nBut we cannot hold every commander responsible for this, any more than \nwe could hold a mayor responsible for a crime in a city.\n  But what I wish to emphasize is that the general took a number of \ndirect and dramatic actions to indicate, without question, his \nrevulsion with this murder. He clearly stated his expectation that \neverybody at Fort Campbell would be treated with respect, and that \nviolence of this kind is unacceptable. He was quite strong on that \npoint.\n  However, he was unfairly criticized for his actions following Private \nWinchell's death. The criticism was unfair because in the military he \nis the convening authority of the courts-martial. He is required, by \nthe Uniformed Code of Military Justice to appoint the members of the \ncourts-martial, and he has a duty to remain objective. He has to be \ncareful that he does not conduct himself in a way that prejudices the \nofficers he appointed to try the case.\n\n[[Page S15044]]\n\n  I served as a JAG officer for several years in the Army Reserve. I \nknow a commanding officer has to be careful because the defense lawyers \nwho defend soldiers charged with crimes can raise, as a defense to the \ntrial, that the commander had prejudiced the trial by suggesting the \ndefendant was guilty before he had a trial.\n  General Clark testified at his confirmation hearing in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that he was in regular contact with his staff \njudge advocate, his lawyer, advising him what he could say, and what he \ncould not say.\n  Some say he should have been more open, he should have been more \ncondemning of this act, he should have been more aggressive. It is \nclear that he was acting under the legal direction of his staff judge \nadvocate. In fact, his staff judge advocate was talking to the staff \njudge advocate in Washington, for the Department of Defense. They \nexhausted every means possible to ensure they conducted themselves \nproperly. They sought to ensure that the trial was fairly conducted, \nand that if a conviction was obtained, as it was obtained, that the \nverdict would be upheld. It was.\n  I just would want to say this is not so easy, as some would suggest, \nfor him to be really aggressive in making comments about this while a \ntrial is ongoing.\n  Complaints were certainly made about his conduct afterwards. General \nClark, who, if you met him, you would understand, is a man of great \nintegrity, great decency, who wants to do the right thing, said: Look, \nI haven't done anything wrong. I believe I have conducted myself \nproperly. But I am personally requesting that the inspector general \ninvestigate my conduct and my actions. I want him to come in here and \ninvestigate this situation to see if I have done anything wrong.\n\n  Of course, the IG did investigate. An IG team conducted a thorough \ninvestigation into the command climate at Fort Campbell. This \ninvestigation of the command climate found that Major General Clark was \nnot culpable of any dereliction or failure of leadership, as has been \nalleged by the Service Members Legal Defense Network--SLDN--which is an \nadvocacy group that works to protect and ensure that homosexual \nsoldiers are treated fairly in the military, as they have every right \nto be treated. They have a right to insist that they be treated fairly.\n  It is important that people know about this crime. I know it is \nimportant that people understand how civilization sometimes is fragile \nand people lose discipline and do things they should never ever do.\n  To highlight the problem that occurred at Fort Campbell, and to take \naction by an advocacy group--or by the military or any decent people, \nor for the Senate to take action in order to ensure that these kinds of \nthings don't happen in future--there is no illegitimacy in that.\n  One of the things that has troubled me in recent years in this Senate \nis that we feed on information that is sometimes provided by people who \nhave an agenda. As a result of that, sometimes people are unfairly \ntreated. Everybody deserves fair treatment. This private who was \nmurdered did not deserve what happened to him. I also believe General \nClark does not deserve some of the charges that have been made against \nhim.\n  A few other points; This group claims that Major General Clark failed \nto follow Federal law. There is no proof of that. There is no proof \nthat he failed to provide a safe environment for soldiers--in fact, \nthat claim has been rejected. They claim that he failed to exhibit \nleadership necessary for further promotion. After the inspector \ngeneral's reviews were done, that proved not to be so.\n  The allegations were that Major General Clark had allowed \n``significant levels of antigay harassment under [his] command,'' and \nthat it allowed a command climate in which ``antigay harassment \nflourished''; it was just not true. The Army IG found sporadic \nincidents of the use of derogatory or offensive cadence calls used \nduring marching. These problems which were quickly corrected and \nstopped as soon as they were discovered. It was clearly established \nthat anti-homosexual comments were not the norm at Fort Campbell.\n  There were allegations that there was anti-gay graffiti in the public \nareas around Fort Campbell. The Army inspector general found one \nlatrine at a unit level and one in a public recreation center at Fort \nCampbell which had anti-gay comments on them. This was clearly not a \ncommon thing on the base. I suspect you would find these comments in \nsome of the public bathrooms in cities and gas stations around America. \nIt is wrong, but I don't think that should be something the general \nwould be found to be responsible for. There is simply no way that he \ncan protect against each and every one of those incidents.\n  It was suggested that he took no action to deal with this problem. I \nhave one document dated November 30, 1999--not long after the incident \nthat occurred--in which General Clark wrote his command. He sent it to \neveryone basically on the base.\n\n       Distribution A, Subject: Respect for all soldiers.\n       Paragraph 1: The soldiers in the Army today are the best we \n     have ever had.\n\n  I certainly agree with that.\n\n       They are volunteers who merit our respect and they deserve \n     to be treated with dignity in a climate of safety and \n     security.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We can and will do more to ensure that our soldiers are \n     treated with dignity and respect. I accordingly direct that:\n       All soldiers be briefed on the Department of Defense \n     homosexual conduct policy upon their formal in-processing at \n     Fort Campbell. When they come to the base.\n       They are to be instructed on this policy of treating people \n     fairly and with respect. As an interim measure, every soldier \n     at Fort Campbell will receive the briefing.\n\n  In addition, he goes on to note:\n\n       This instruction will also include the contents of the 25 \n     October 1999 memorandum from the commanding general . . .\n\n  And another memorandum--both of which reiterate the roles and \nresponsibilities of commanders regarding investigations of threats \nagainst or harassment of soldiers on the basis of alleged \nhomosexuality;\n\n       Subparagraph (c): All leaders will vigorously police the \n     contents of run and march cadences.\n\n  They have always been a little bit risque over the years. But the \ngeneral took aggressive action here.\n\n       They will monitor the march and run cadences to ensure that \n     they are positive and devoid of profanity or phrases \n     demeaning to others.\n       Subparagraph (d): All leaders will vigorously police the \n     content of training briefings, classes, lectures, and all \n     other instructions to ensure that they are devoid of \n     profanity or phrases demeaning to others.\n       Subparagraph (3) Respect for others is an Army value and a \n     cornerstone of the discipline and esprit de corps and all \n     soldiers will be treated with dignity and respect. \n     Accordingly, I expect all Department of Defense, Department \n     of Army and Fort Campbell directives, policies and \n     regulations to be enforced by our leaders and adhered to by \n     our soldiers.\n       Robert C. Clark, General.\n\n  This is a superb soldier who served his country well in Vietnam. He \nwas awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. He was wounded in \ncombat and refused to be evacuated until he got others out of the line \nof fire.\n  He commanded the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division, that \ngreat division, during Operation Desert Storm, the last Gulf War. His \nproven leadership is clear.\n  In the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College ``Story of the \nThird Army in Desert Storm'' by Richard Swain, published in 1994, he \ntalks about how General Clark's brigade moved rapidly to cut off the \nretreat of the Iraqi soldiers, facing tremendously bad weather. It was \nso bad that motorcycle troops were mired down, but he moved \nsuccessfully anyway and seized the objective before other units were \nable to.\n  He is a proven commander in combat. He is a proven commander in the \npeacetime Army. He has taken strong action to see that this kind of \nactivity never happens again.\n  I am proud of him. I am also proud to note that he obtained his \nmaster's degree at Auburn University, one of America's great \nuniversities. I had occasion to meet him and to see him testify at \nhearings. I thought he did a superb job. There was little doubt of his \nsincerity in this matter and his capability to be a great general \nofficer.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S15045]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Senator \nSessions, for really putting into perspective a lot of the things that \nhave been said on the floor, allegations from the past but also with \nrespect for this man who is a true hero, an American hero.\n  I rise to support his elevation to the second highest rank in the \nU.S. Army as Commander of U.S. Army at Fort Sam Houston.\n  On October 3, 1971, this young man, Robert E. Clark, first platoon \nleader of Company A, 2nd Battalion, 8th Calvary of the 1st Calvary \nDivision, became an American hero.\n  It was approximately 10:30 a.m. in Bin Tuy Province of the Republic \nof Vietnam. Company A was completing a reconnaissance mission. As they \nwere being extracted, the men came under heavy fire. The first two \nenemy mortar rounds struck hard and inflicted heavy causalities, \nincluding wounding First Lieutenant Clark. At that time, at great risk \nto his own personal safety, and ignoring or at least putting aside his \nown wounds, First Lieutenant Clark ran forward into enemy fire to carry \nhis fellow wounded soldiers back to cover.\n  Throughout the battle he pressed on, moving from position to position \nto direct his men to lay down a constant stream of smoke in order to \nmark their position for the helicopters flying overhead. The record \nclearly shows First Lieutenant Clark's heroic action ensured the \nsuccess of Company A's mission. For his bravery in combat and service \nin Vietnam, First Lieutenant Clark received a Purple Heart. He received \ntwo Bronze Stars, one for valor and one for service.\n  In a letter of recommendation on behalf of Robert Clark, the company \ncommander wrote:\n\n       [First Lt Clark's] display of personal bravery and devotion \n     to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the \n     military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, his \n     unit, and the United States Army.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nletter of recommendation which lays out these events.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On 3 October 1971, first Lieutenant Robert T. Clark, First \n     Platoon Leader Of Company (A), 2d Battalion (Airmobile), 8th \n     Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division, distinguished himself by \n     heroic action while on ground combat operations against a \n     hostile enemy force in Binh Tuy Province, Republic of \n     Vietnam. At approximately 1030 hours Company (A) were being \n     extracted after completing a ground reconnaissance mission, \n     when they were engaged by an undetermined size enemy force, \n     receiving enemy mortar fire. The first two mortar rounds that \n     impacted took a heavy toll of friendly casualties including \n     1LT Clark. Although wounded 1LT Clark with total disregard \n     for his own personal safety and his wounds exposed himself to \n     enemy mortar fire as he moved forward and assist in carrying \n     the other wounded members under cover. 1LT Clark continued to \n     expose himself as he moved from position to position \n     directing his men to lay down a constant screen of smoke \n     marking their position to Gunships giving them fire support. \n     1LT Clark's heroic action and aggressiveness, enabled the \n     mission to be a complete success. Resulting in one (1) enemy \n     soldier killed. His display of personal bravery and devotion \n     to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the \n     military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, his \n     unit, and the United States Army.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. In a career spanning over 30 years, Robert T. Clark has \nconsistently displayed that uncommon courage and leadership he showed \non the battlefield in Vietnam. He has earned the admiration of all who \nknow him, both in and outside of military life.\n  GEN John Wickham, former Chief of Staff of the Army, says General \nClark is unequivocally ``one of the most ethical, moral, people-\noriented and charismatic leaders I have ever known.''\n  GEN John Keane, whom the senior Senator from Massachusetts so \nlavishly praised earlier, calls General Clark ``a man of great \ncharacter. He's a great moral force and a very compassionate person. \nSimply stated, he's one of the Army's very best leaders.'' Those are \nthe words of GEN John Keane.\n  It is my honor to rise today and support this nomination of this \noutstanding soldier. General Clark has earned numerous awards for his \nextraordinary service, including four awards of the Legion of Merit, \nthree Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart medal, four meritorious service \nmedals, the Air Medal, the Air Commendation Medal, and numerous \ncampaign service medals for service in Vietnam as well as Saudi Arabia.\n  He has earned the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Army Staff \nIdentification Badge, the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, and the \nAir Assault Badge.\n  During the gulf war, then Colonel Clark commanded the 3rd Brigade of \nthe 101st Airborne. Under his leadership, the 3rd Brigade conducted one \nof the longest and largest airborne assaults in military history. More \nthan 2,000 men, 50 transport vehicles, artillery, and tons of fuel and \nammunition were air lifted at that time 50 miles into Iraq. Land \nvehicles took another 2,000 troops deep into the Iraqi territory. All \nof this was accomplished in 72 hours without a single American \ncasualty. Only two Iraqi soldiers were killed and 22 wounded.\n  With characteristic modesty, General Clark explained the brigade's \ntruly remarkable success by saying, ``We're the first guys who ask them \nto lay down their weapons, and they did. It just took a little \nconvincing.''\n  General Clark earned a Bronze Star for his command of the historic \nmission.\n  In 1998, General Clark was elevated to command the 101st Airborne \nDivision at Fort Campbell, which, as most know, is situated on the \nborder of Tennessee and Kentucky. Indeed, Fort Campbell can be \ndescribed as a small to midsize city comprised of about 50,000 soldiers \nand civilians. There are homes, schools, a fire department. It is a \ncomplex and diverse place. During his 2-year tenure there--and I had \nthe opportunity to meet with General Clark there on several occasions--\nGeneral Clark's reputation for fairness and compassion extended way \nbeyond the base, well into the surrounding community.\n  In February of 2000, the Clarksville City Council unanimously passed \na resolution praising General Clark for his ``high standards of \nleadership, professionalism, and integrity.''\n  The Montgomery County Board of Commissioners passed a similar \nresolution declaring:\n\n       General Clark's reputation in the local communities is \n     highly acknowledged as one of the brightest, caring, and \n     respected division commanders that the Army has sent to our \n     local community.\n\n  Indeed, General Clark is one of the finest men in uniform today. He \ncurrently serves as the acting commander of the 5th U.S. Army at Fort \nSam Houston. I should mention, as an aside, that General Clark \nrequested the assignment so that he could take care of his wife who \nsuffers from a chronic illness.\n  General Clark's peers call him ``a soldier's soldier.'' He descends \nfrom two generations of Clark men who have served the Army with \ndedication and honor.\n  And thus, as I began a few minutes ago, I close by saying, and I do \ncall him a true hero. I strongly support his elevation to the second \nhighest rank in the U.S. Army.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JAMES MANCHIN--WEST VIRGINIAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on November 3, the State of West Virginia \nlost one of its most enduring and most colorful political figures, A. \nJames Manchin.\n  A. James Manchin was born in Farmington, WV, on April 7, 1927. He had \na deep love for West Virginia and its people, and that deep love showed \neverywhere he went, in every office he held, in everything he did, and \nwith every person he met.\n  With his booming voice, his flamboyant oratory, and his wonderful \nsense of humor, A. James was an undeniable presence. I find it \ndifficult to imagine traveling around the State of West Virginia and \nspeaking before a crowd without seeing my friend Jimmy Manchin standing \nthere somewhere in the crowd, lifting his hat into the air--by the way, \nhe wore big hats--and shouting out a greeting to me.\n  With his political skills and his tenacious determination to make \nWest Virginia a better place in which to live\n\n[[Page S15047]]\n\nand work and raise families, Jimmy Manchin won a place in the hearts \nand minds of people throughout West Virginia. He found a way to touch \nthe hearts of all whom he met. Everybody loved him, even his political \nopponents. He was a man and a public servant who cared deeply for \nothers and they, in turn, cared a lot for Jimmy Manchin.\n\n  I first met Jimmy Manchin in 1949. That was in my second term in the \nWest Virginia House of Delegates. Jimmy had been elected to the house \nof delegates and was being sworn in that year, 1949. So I first met \nJimmy Manchin in 1949, as he and I wove our political careers, when \nboth of us served there in the house of delegates. After that, he \npursued and held a multitude of political offices.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy named Jimmy Manchin as West Virginia State \ndirector of the Farmers Home Administration.\n  In 1972, he was appointed State director of the Rehabilitation \nEnvironmental Action Program, REAP, where he was placed in charge of \ncleaning up and restoring the natural beauty of our State's magnificent \nrolling green hills and beautiful valleys, which he loved so dearly. \nHis campaign to restore our State's beauty was fueled by his \npersonality and fashioned by his talent for poetic oratory. As part of \nhis REAP campaign, Jimmy called on all West Virginians to ``purge our \nproud peaks of these jumbled jungles of junkery.'' That was pure A. \nJames Manchin politicking. He understood the theatrical part of \npolitics better than most politicians of this era and, as a \nconsequence, his incredibly successful work for REAP earned him a \nnational ``Keep America Beautiful'' award.\n  In 1976, he was elected secretary of state, and in 1984, he was \nelected State treasurer.\n  In 1998, he again won a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates, \na half century after his first election to that body.\n  His political career, which spanned 55 years, earned him numerous \nawards, honors, and recognitions. In 1974, for example, Salem College \nnamed him ``Mr. West Virginia,'' while, just this year, the West \nVirginia Italian Heritage Festival named him ``Italian American of the \nYear.''\n  He was an outspoken booster and promoter of West Virginia, a genuine \npublic servant who will be sorely missed by the people of West \nVirginia.\n  The Bible says: ``In my Father's house are many mansions.'' Well, \nJimmy had a way of using this beautiful verbiage from the King James \nBible and, before huge audiences he would quote that. ``In my Father's \nhouse are many mansions.'' On November 3, our Father brought home one \nmore. My friend, A. James Manchin.\n  Mr. President, my wife Erma and I offer our most heartfelt \ncondolences to Jimmy Manchin's wife Stella and their children, Patricia \nLee, Mark Anthony, and Rosanna.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15047-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15047-S15051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT IN MEDICARE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I rise today to offer a few thoughts on the Medicare \nprescription drug conference report that will soon be brought before \nthe Senate. As I look back on the 10 years I have served in the \nCongress and I think about probably one of the most important issues we \nhave dealt with, it has been looking toward trying to provide a \ncomponent to Medicare that, had we seen or known the importance of \nprescription drugs when Medicare was designed, we would have included.\n  As we move forward in the discussion and the debate on the pending \nlegislation or the conference report that is being formalized right \nnow, I hope we will not lose sight of our original objective; that is, \nto do no harm to a program that has been incredible in this country. It \nhas kept seniors out of poverty. It has provided insurance for health \ncare in our senior community when private industry would not come to \nthe table to provide insurance and health benefits for our aging \npopulation.\n  I hope we will keep our focus on doing no harm to a program that has \ndone so much for the well-being of the elderly of this country, that we \nwill look to the ways we can improve it and, more importantly, provide \na prescription drug piece that is actually going to enhance our ability \nto keep down the costs of health care, providing health care to the \nelderly in this country, and improving the quality of life which, after \nall, is, has been, and should be our main objective.\n  First, I thank our chairman on the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, along with their \nstaffs, for their tireless effort in bringing this package together \nthus far, both in the committee when we marked up the bill and we \nworked hard to bring about a good, bipartisan measure we felt did \nprovide reforms and improvements to Medicare but did no harm to the \nbasis of a program that has provided so much to so many in this \ncountry.\n  The chairman and the ranking member have really bent over backwards \nto do all they could to keep this conference together and to keep a \npackage together that was going to be beneficial for the elderly in \nthis country. I know the negotiations at times have been contentious, \nbut I am sure my colleagues join me in expressing our heartfelt \ngratitude for their leadership and patience on this critically \nimportant issue to all elderly Americans and to all American families \nbecause, as many of us know, it is not just the elderly who are going \nto be affected by this program; it is those of us who have aging \nparents and grandparents. It is those of us who ourselves in years to \ncome will be a part of that aging community. It is not just the elderly \nof today, it is the elderly of tomorrow and the young of today who feel \nso involved and think it is such a critical issue to provide that \nquality of care for our patients and for our seniors.\n  It is with that that I urge the conferees to keep working and to \nremain committed to the bipartisan principles contained in the \nlegislation we passed in the Senate last summer, that we poured over \nand really gave heartfelt consideration and debate to bringing about a \nprogram that would enhance Medicare and again would do no harm to \na program that has done so much.\n\n  The bill we passed in the Senate gives all Medicare beneficiaries, no \nmatter where they live, access to a Medicare drug benefit. For those of \nus who come from rural States, we find ourselves oftentimes at the low \nend of the totem pole. We find ourselves in a predicament where our \nseniors tend to be certainly living in more challenging demographic \nareas, where their needs and their concerns are more difficult to meet. \nWe find our seniors tend to be more low income. It is critical we do \nnot put a face on this bill that makes one demographic or one \ngeographic area of this country more important than the other.\n  Most importantly, our Senate bill preserves the traditional Medicare \nProgram as a viable option for seniors by ensuring there is a level \nplaying field between the private sector and Medicare. As many of us \nknow, the private sector can participate in Medicare today. They choose \nnot to. Why? Because we have, over the years, crafted and improved a \nMedicare Program that is most efficient. The fact is, it is difficult \nfor them to compete, to come in and to provide the same services, the \nsame programs in a cost-effective way where they can actually make \nmoney.\n  Again, we want to do no harm in a program we have begun now to mold \nand shape in a way that is so productive to the seniors and is cost-\neffective for our Government.\n  I believe it is important we be honest with our Nation's seniors, \nwith the taxpayers of this country, and with ourselves, so everyone \nunderstands what is in this bill, both good and bad, what have we \naccomplished in this conference report and what have we not, so we can \nhonestly call this conference report what it is. After all, this is \nmore than just a prescription drug package. It includes a wide range of \nother provisions that will affect health care for seniors.\n  Over the last several months, I have consulted with Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus on this bill. They have\n\n[[Page S15048]]\n\nbeen very kind and gracious with their time in listening to me as I \noffered my own advice and feedback on the contents of what was \nmaterializing as a conference report. Today I would like to take this \nopportunity to present some of the questions I have asked of them in \nthese recent weeks, because this is not the bill I would have produced. \nAs we look at this conference report, it is not the bill the Senate \nproduced or that Senators would like to have before us, but it may be \nthe best we are going to be able to get in this Congress under the \nleadership we have, both in the White House, in the administration, as \nwell as in the House and in the Senate.\n  If that is the case, do we hold hostage some seniors because we do \nnot have a perfect bill? We are going to have to weigh that out in the \ncourse of the next 6 to 7 days as we go through the motions of bringing \nthat conference to a close and looking at what is actually going to be \nin that conference package.\n  I would like to make it very clear I asked these questions as someone \nwho wants very much to support a prescription drug package. It is \nsomething I can see clearly as a tool that can aid this country, not \nonly in the quality of care and the quality of life our seniors need \nand deserve in this Nation. The advancement of what pharmaceutical \ndrugs and prescription drugs can do in making the aging loved ones in \nour families have a better quality of life is so apparent. It is such a \ncritical part of what we must do.\n  We also have to know there are other things that are in this package. \nThe questions so many of us have asked in looking for what we want to \nsee happen--as I said, I want very much to support a prescription drug \npackage. I have worked hard on this in the 10 years I have been in \nCongress. I see the importance of it. We want to be able to move \nforward. It is an issue I have championed throughout the years in my \ncareer in Congress. It is why I have worked hard to secure a seat on \nthe Senate Finance Committee so I could have more influence on the \nshape of the final bill.\n  In fact, this bill contains several strong provisions which I shall \naddress shortly, but I also think it is so important we be honest with \nourselves in terms of what we are actually going to be dealing with.\n  Furthermore, I asked these questions on behalf of my constituents in \nArkansas, along with the millions of other seniors in this Nation who \nwill be affected by this legislation and who have been waiting so \npatiently for us to at least begin this process. They deserve to know \nabout all of the components of this bill and how it will affect them, \nwherever they may live in this great country. Like us, they want to \nknow this package will make Medicare stronger for the future, not \nweaker. We have not worked these some 40-plus years to now take a step \nin the wrong direction to weaken Medicare. We want to know even if this \nmay not be the end-all, be-all package for Medicare, at least it is the \nbeginning, the first step in looking at how we can strengthen Medicare, \nboth through providing a prescription drug component in a way that \nreaches every senior in this country in a fair and equitable way, as \nwell as looking at the ways we can reform and reinforce Medicare \nthrough coordinated care, through multiple-disease diagnosis and \nphysician programs, where our physicians can look and see the multiple \ndiseases our elderly are dealing with and deal with them in a \ncomprehensive way. My first question concerns the premium support \nmodel, of which we have heard an awful lot. Premium support carries a \nlot of different visions that people have put on it. The model I would \nlike to question is the one which the conferees want to add as a \ndemonstration project. I would like to ask the conferees to explain to \nme and to the American people: How would this premium support policy \nmake Medicare stronger? That is our question. I am not coming to the \nfloor with a preconceived idea. I really want to know, and I think the \nAmerican people want to know how it is going to make Medicare stronger.\n\n  My concern is that the premium support would force our traditional \nMedicare Program to compete with private insurance plans in an arena \nwhere the rules greatly favor the private plan. That is not true \ncompetition. That is asking a program that we have built over these \nmany years to compete with a plan out there that might be able to \nprovide something in a more cost-effective way. But we don't know \nbecause we have too many subsidies going there.\n  The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services said this model would \nlead to wide variations in premium rates for Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in different parts of the country and even, perhaps, within the \nsame State. This could be devastating for seniors in Arkansas, \nespecially in our rural areas. And Arkansas is not the only State that \nis concerned with a lot of rural areas. Why should a senior living in \nthe rural delta of Arkansas pay a higher premium than a senior living \nin Little Rock, for the same benefit? That is the question I am asking \nour conferees. Seniors have paid into Medicare all their lives and they \ndeserve to pay the same premium no matter where they live. Premium \nsupport would end this uniformity that has always existed in Medicare.\n  The CMS Office of Actuary also determined that premium support would \nsignificantly increase premiums for traditional Medicare. Healthier \nseniors would leave the traditional program for private plans, thus \nincreasing the cost for traditional Medicare. This would mostly impact \nseniors in our rural areas where private plans are not likely to go, \nand where seniors are less healthy. Why are they not likely to go \nthere? They are not there now. They have come in; they tried it; they \nleft because it is not profitable for them. Without substantial \nsubsidies, they are not going to come there again.\n  As to using this as a demonstration, we pretty much had a \ndemonstration out in rural America to see what is going to happen. It \nis simply unfair to punish these seniors with a premium increase that \nestimates say could surpass 25 percent. The privatization advocates say \nit is only a demonstration of premium support and there are numerous \nexceptions to the policy. That just simply makes me wonder: If the \npolicy is so great, why make all of these exceptions?\n  I urge the conferees to take a serious look at this controversial \nproposal. Look at the ways we can make it much more clear, much more \nbeneficial, and certainly much more economical to the American \ntaxpayer, as well as providing the uniform benefit, across the country, \nto all seniors who deserve it equally.\n  It is clear to me that its inclusion is based on privatization \nideology alone rather than sound evidence that it saves money or \nimproves the program for seniors. There are way too many studies that \nindicate the other way. I encourage these conferees, when we have a \nonce-in-a-lifetime chance to be able to do something productive, make \nsure we are not wasting our time and energy and efforts, and most \nimportantly our resources, on demonstration programs that we know \nbecause of past experience are not going to be profitable for anybody \nif we use our resources that way. Why drain those precious resources \nfrom the drug benefit for all on a demonstration that would affect only \na few?\n\n  The premium support demonstration could destabilize the Medicare \nProgram for all seniors, and it certainly has the possibility of \nthreatening the integrity of Medicare for seniors in Arkansas and \naround the Nation. The Senate bill we passed, with a great bipartisan \nmargin, did not include this provision, and it was a strong bipartisan \nbill.\n  My second question is, Why does the final agreement not retain the \nSenate's more generous low-income assistance provisions? I am \nenormously grateful because I know Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus \nworked very hard on the low-income assistance, and it is a good piece \nof this bill, so much better than what happened on the House side. So \nmany of us who come from States with a large percentage of low-income \nseniors are very grateful.\n  The conferees, however, apparently decided to lower the income \neligibility level from the 160 percent of poverty to 150 percent of \npoverty, and to subject all low-income seniors to somewhat humiliating \nasset tests.\n  When we talk about 150 percent of poverty around here, people just \nassume that everybody knows what that is. But most people don't. Most \npeople don't know that 150 percent of poverty,\n\n[[Page S15049]]\n\nwhich is what we are talking about to be the high end of low-income \nseniors, is only an annual income, for a couple, of $18,000--$18,000 \nfor seniors to live on as a couple. For singles, it would be $13,470.\n  One hundred-fifty percent of poverty is what we are talking about as \nbeing the high end of low-income seniors, in terms of support for these \nlow-income individuals. I don't know about you, but that is a tough \nannual income to live on as a senior when you are talking about all the \ndifferent expenses they have.\n  This would help 3 million fewer people. Going from 160 percent of \npoverty to 150 percent of poverty would help 3 million fewer people \nwith their copays than the Senate bill. So I urge the conferees to \nallow Medicaid to wrap around the cost-sharing requirements in the \nMedicare bill and allow them to pay for prescription drugs, not on the \nprivate plans formulary. This is another component that is going to be \nvery advantageous to our low-income seniors.\n  This low-income assistance is of special importance to our Nation's \nolder women. Those of us, as women in the Senate, recognize how the \naging population is disproportionately reflected in the number of \nwomen. I have watched my own mother, as a caregiver, taking care of my \nfather until his death last year, and watched how she put the stresses \nand strains on her own health care needs, as well as her own finances, \nto find herself now in the aging population category, more dependent on \nprograms than she has ever been before. So, disproportionately, when we \ntalk about our low-income seniors and their needs, there is a \ndisproportionate amount of those individuals who are women.\n  Medicare seniors are disproportionately women and they are \ndisproportionately poor, and will be far better served by the Senate's \nlow-income provisions on which we worked so hard to come to a \nbipartisan agreement.\n  I am concerned that private drug-only plans may not provide the \nstability or the predictability that seniors want and need. The \ninsurance companies have told me they don't want to offer a \nprescription-drug-only plan. The Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services has said such a plan doesn't exist in \nnature.\n  Quite frankly, I believe we have proven that through the Medicare-\nMedicaid veterans programs the Government can do it in a much more \ncost-effective manner. But the point is, we are trying to create \nsomething that has not existed in nature, and really, quite frankly, \nthose who are going to be there to create it don't want to do it.\n  I urge the conferees to take a good look at what we are providing \nthere. That is why I am glad the Senate contains a Medicare-guaranteed \ndrug plan, or safety net, called a fallback.\n  I urge the conferees again to retain the fallback and ensure that a \ncontract is made available for at least 3 years. But the concern to \ncome, if you are a senior out there in rural America and you choose to \nstay with Medicare fee for service, you have to go to one of these \ndrug-only plans. There has to be two in your region, but one of those \ntwo could be a PPO, which means you have to shift your traditional fee \nfor service into an overall PPO in order to qualify for that drug plan \nor you can go with one of those two plans. If one of them should leave, \nyou have the option of going to the Government fallback. If one of \nthose plans or another plan comes back next year, you immediately have \nto go out of the Government plan and go back into one or the other of \nthe private plans.\n  Seniors are going to find from year to year those changes in their \npremiums, their deductibility, their formularies. They are going to \nfind the list of physicians changing. It is really critical.\n  I urge our conferees to ensure the fallback is available for seniors \nas an option, even if the private insurers decide to test whether they \nwant to offer a benefit in a community. Seniors should not have to have \nfallback plans, especially if the new private plan is significantly \nmore expensive for them and it is more restrictive.\n  My third question is with regard to consistency and reliability in \nthe Medicare Program. Based on what we know about the details of this \nagreement--we still have a lot of time ahead of us to be able to read \nand digest what has actually been negotiated out and put down on \npaper--it appears that the drug plans will vary throughout the country, \nmeaning that seniors in Arkansas may have different premiums, cost \nsharing, and formularies than seniors in other States and in other \nparts of the country.\n  Even worse, these plans can change their premiums, cost sharing, and \nformularies for other years.\n  My question is, How does it strengthen Medicare to make the program \nless consistent and less reliable for our seniors?\n  If what we are trying to do is strengthen Medicare with a drug \nbenefit and in the reforms we are trying to make, how does it \nstrengthen that program if we make it more confusing for our seniors, \nif we make it less consistent and we make their choices less reliable?\n  I urge the conferees to make the prescription drug benefit less \nvolatile for seniors. If there is anything I know about the seniors in \nmy life, it is the confusion they see right now or which they may have \nto address in a package such as this. It is devastating to them. It \ngives them a sense of distrust. That is the last thing we want for our \nloved ones and those for whom we are working so hard to provide quality \nof life. This includes limiting variations in the amount seniors have \nto pay in premiums to only $10 above the national average, no matter \nwhere they live.\n\n  I, for one, think we should give seniors, most of whom live on fixed \nincomes, some assurance that their premiums will not vary or increase \nunreasonably.\n  I urge the conferees to ensure that those seniors who have employer-\nsponsored retiree coverage be able to retain it. It is pure and simple. \nWe urge the conferees to ensure that the conference report preserve a \nlevel playing field between traditional Medicare and private insurance \nplans.\n  I am concerned--and have been--that the proposed agreement unfairly \ntips the deck against Medicare through the $12 billion stabilization \nfund that the Secretary of Health and Human Services can use to \nencourage private plans to participate in areas where they don't want \nto go. If they wanted to go, they would be there now. But we are going \nto use $12 billion to try to stabilize these plans to go into areas \nwhere they haven't wanted to go and where they aren't currently \npracticing.\n  The Senate bill, which we worked on in a bipartisan way, by contrast, \nprovided billions of dollars for private plans to be able to help them \nin terms of incentives to come into these more difficult areas.\n  We also have $6 billion in there for Medicare enhancement and \nimprovements in the traditional Medicare Program that all beneficiaries \ncan use--not just those who happen to live in an area where private \nplans decide to go.\n  The conference agreement would allow private plans to be paid at a \nmuch higher rate than traditional Medicare with no enhancement added \nfor beneficiaries.\n  I urge the conferees to consider this policy carefully. We want to \nmake sure the traditional fee for service and the traditional Medicare \nthat is there has the enhancement and the ability to improve itself so \nit can reach all of the seniors in this country, even those in the \nrural areas of my State and the State of the Presiding Officer and \nothers who have multitudes of rural areas where seniors need health \ncare.\n  I wish the drug bill did not have a coverage gap or a donut. I am \nconcerned about those seniors who will hit that gap in coverage and \nhave to continue to pay their premiums.\n  During debate on S. 1, I and many other Senators voted to allow \nemployer-sponsored retiree health plan contributions to fill this gap. \nI also voted to eliminate the coverage gap altogether, and I voted to \nprevent seniors from paying premiums when they are in the coverage gap.\n  Unfortunately, all of these amendments were defeated, but it doesn't \nmean we can't still address some of these concerns. It doesn't mean our \nconferees can't work together and come up with some provision that can \nhelp to assist us in making sure some of these gaps, some of these \nholes that have been left are closed for the benefit of the seniors of \nthis country.\n  I also voted for an amendment to try to contain the skyrocketing \ncosts of\n\n[[Page S15050]]\n\nprescription drugs. Every one of us in this Chamber knows that in the \nnext 20 years or less we are going to almost double the number of \nseniors putting demands on the Medicare Program. We are going to go \nfrom 41 million seniors to over 70 million seniors in this country. It \ndoesn't matter what kind of program we put together if we don't look at \ntrying to have some kind of handle on the escalation in costs for \nwhatever program we have. If we almost double our number of seniors who \nare putting pressure on this program, we are not going to be able to \nafford it. It is critical that we look at ways we can make more \nefficient the use of the dollars that we have.\n\n  One measure I supported which passed seeks to increase access to more \naffordable and equally effective generic drugs--something on which I \nthink most of us could agree.\n  I also voted for an amendment which failed to help consumers better \ncompare the cost effectiveness of prescription drugs.\n  Finally, I also voted for a successful amendment to allow wholesalers \nand pharmacists to import prescription drugs from Canada which will \nprovide substantial savings to consumers while ensuring their safety.\n  These are just some of those components where we in the Senate made \ncorrections and improvements to the bill, some of which were accepted, \nsome of which were not, but most of which I hope, as a conference, they \nwill look at, because the bill we are trying to produce out of this \nconference should be a bill that will enhance a program that has done \nso much for all seniors and all Americans.\n  I urge our conferees to try to retain some of those positions that we \ntook in the Senate; the provisions that we passed.\n  I look forward to hopefully seeing us complete some of those things \nthat I think will make the bill a better bill. I know reaching this \npoint has been a long and difficult process.\n  I compliment my Senate colleagues for fighting to include several \ngood provisions that are contained in this bill. This agreement \ncontains a comprehensive rural package that significantly decreases or \neliminates the disparity of Medicare payments between rural health care \nproviders. I was very involved in working with the chairman, Members, \nand others to move some of those provisions forward and certainly \nmaking sure that health care was available to seniors and to all people \nin rural areas.\n  I can't tell how necessary these provisions are to rural hospitals \nand physicians and ambulance providers, home health providers and rural \nhealth clinics in Arkansas and elsewhere across the country.\n  It is my hope that the conference agreement will also contain the \nSenate policy for Medicaid low-DSG States. I am glad the physicians \nwon't receive a cut in payment but a small update as in this conference \nreport.\n  I encourage my colleagues to include a physician's demonstration on \nchronic care management that I helped to author in the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  If there is anything we know, it is that our seniors are having \nmultiple chronic illnesses which they are having to deal with. If we \ndon't look at how we manage the chronic care multiple diseases they are \ndealing with, we will never get the economic efficiency out of Medicare \nthat we could.\n\n  Many of my constituents have said when they finally have gotten a \ncoordination for their elderly loved one, it is unbelievable. They were \nseeing five different doctors in five different places who were not \ntalking to one another. They did not have a nutritionist or someone \nconsulting on depression. When they got that coordination of care, they \nbetter understood all of the chronic illnesses their loved one was \ngoing through, not to mention getting more efficiency out of the \ndollars they were spending in Medicare. That individual, that loved \none, that elderly person was getting the quality of care they deserve \nin a more cost-effective way. They were able to manage all of those \nthings in a way that was making the quality of care the best it could \nbe.\n  One of the demonstrations should take place in a State that has a \ndepartment of geriatrics with a rural outreach site. Rural areas are \none of the most difficult areas to serve our elderly. Unless we have \nthe knowledge of how we can coordinate the care for individuals in \nrural America, we will never see the efficiency we need. It is critical \nwe have this demonstration so we can determine the healthy outcomes \nthat result when a geriatrician is paid appropriately for caring for a \npatient with multiple chronic conditions.\n  I am also pleased the drug bill will include coverage for insulin \nsyringes and that there is a new benefit providing screening for \ndiabetes. Roughly 40 percent of the senior population with diabetes, or \n1.8 million seniors, uses syringes every day to inject insulin to \ncontrol their diabetes. Without coverage, the syringe purchases, which \ncould be especially expensive for seniors on fixed incomes, would not \ncount toward cost-sharing and yearly out-of-pocket expenses. The new \ndiabetes screening benefit will help with the fact that approximately \none-third of the 7 million seniors with diabetes, or 2.3 million \npeople, are undiagnosed. They simply do not know they have this very \nserious condition with complications that include heart disease, \nstroke, vision loss and blindness, amputation, and kidney disease.\n  I understand there is also a provision to temporarily waive the late-\nenrollment penalty for military retirees and their spouses who sign up \nfor Medicare Part B and to permit year-round enrollments so retirees \ncan access the new benefits immediately.\n  It is important in seeking to strengthen Medicare we reflect on the \nprogram's origins and mission. Medicare provides health care for a \nspecial population of Americans: millions of seniors, individuals with \ndisabilities, and people with kidney failure, those who are uninsurable \nin the private marketplace. Over 50 percent of them were uninsurable in \nthe private marketplace when Medicare was started. Congress created \nMedicare in the first place because private insurance plans were \nfailing to provide affordable health-care coverage for this high-risk \npopulation. Therefore, we should proceed cautiously when making major \nchanges to the traditional Medicare Program.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, over 400,000 people rely on Medicare \nfor their health insurance. Without it, they likely would be among the \nranks of the uninsured. This is why I want to ensure if this bill \npasses it is built upon policies that will make Medicare stronger and \nmore reliable for all of its beneficiaries, that we know as we move \nforward there is no possible way we could do everything we needed to do \nin this bill. This is not the bill I would have written, but I was not \nin charge. I also do not want to see a missed opportunity for being \nable to move the ball down the field, to do something for which seniors \nin this country have been waiting patiently.\n\n  Some of my colleagues will argue, don't worry, it does not take \neffect until 2006. Some of these things do not happen until 2010. There \nwill be so many elections between now and then; you do not have to \nworry. We will change it and fix it and it will have a new appearance \nby the time we get there. I hope if that is what we are hanging our hat \non, we can be sincere as these conferees come out with a plan that will \nleave intact the purpose of Medicare originally: to provide for those \nwho were the uninsurable, the elderly, the loved ones for every one of \nus in this body, to make sure when the marketplace would not provide \nfor them, there would be an honest standard benefit so they could get \nthe quality of care, regardless of where they live in this country, \nthat they are due for the great things they have done for our country.\n  I look forward to reading the legislative language in the coming days \nto determine my ultimate support for this bill. I hope our conferees \nare not finished. I hope they continue to look at the ways this bill \ncan be improved. Our work is never done in this Senate, whether we pass \na bill into law and look toward 2006 or 2010 or whenever may be that we \nthink some of the unreasonable things in here we can shut our eyes to \nand move forward with, but that we can make the changes now and we can \ncreate a bill that is the best we can do, knowing it is not perfect but \nthat it will move us forward to provide a critical prescription drugs \ncomponent in the 21st century to a program we started many years ago \nthat has meant so much to so many.\n\n[[Page S15051]]\n\n  Ultimately, I must weigh whether the benefit contained in this bill \nto provide prescription drugs is better than no benefit at all. I hope \nthat is not the case. I hope the case will be we have done everything \nwe possibly could, looking at the bipartisan package the Senate passed, \nand how hard we worked to get there to make this final product the best \nit can be for some of the most special people in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

WILSON\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I come to the floor under the privilege \nto speak about a situation that occurred in Idaho that brought great \nsadness to me and to some of my staff.\n  In 1974, when I was elected to the State legislature, prior to that \nlegislative session convening, I traveled to the north end of my State \nfor the North Idaho Chamber Tour which goes on every 2 years for Idaho \nlegislators. It was at that time I met the chairman of the North Idaho \nChamber, a fellow by the name of Pete Wilson, who was a leader in his \ncommunity of Bonners Ferry, who was well known across north Idaho as an \nattorney who gave so much of his time to his community and to the \ncitizens of that area.\n  Little did I know years later when I ran for Congress, Pete Wilson \nwould become one of my strong supporters. Pete became a friend down \nthrough the years. Just a few years after I got here, a young woman \ncame to my office to seek employment, a young lady by the name of \nBrooke Roberts, who happened to be Pete Wilson's niece. Brooke Roberts \nis now my head of legislative affairs and my chief counsel and \nassistant manager of my office. Not only has Brooke played a tremendous \nrole in my political life, but her uncle, Pete Wilson, has played a \ntremendous role. I say now, sadly, in the Senate, has played. Last \nFriday night or early Saturday morning, Pete Wilson and his son Kip \nwere killed by asphyxiation believed to be carbon monoxide poisoning. \nHis wife Rhoda and another son who was there visiting because of Pete's \nillness at age 78 are still recuperating from a near-death experience \nof carbon monoxide poisoning.\n  My sympathies go out to Rhoda and to Duff, to Tim and to Neal, the \nremaining sons of this wonderful family. Idaho has lost an icon. Idaho \nhas lost one of those kinds of citizens who gives and gives and gives \nmore, not for himself but for the community he was a leader in, for the \nState he loved so well, for Boundary County, where he sought his \nprofessional life, where he raised his family, and where he made a mark \non Idaho. Pete Wilson will be long remembered as a citizen of our State \nwho gave.\n  He has always been in my political life, not just as someone who \nsupported me but someone who advised me. Uncle Pete would pick up the \nphone and call and say: Larry, you're wrong about this issue. You ought \nto do it this way or you ought to do it that way. And usually he was \nright. I took his advice because he was so well grounded in the \ncommunity he served.\n\n  He served as president of the chamber, served as a lawyer who in many \nways gave time and time again to the charities and to the communities \nof that marvelous community of Bonners Ferry and Boundary County.\n  Pete Wilson will be missed. Pete Wilson will be long remembered. It \nwas a tragic accident that took him and his son, nearly took another \nson, and his wife.\n  To their family, I must say, on behalf of Suzanne and myself, we are \nso saddened by this situation, but we want Idaho to know Pete Wilson \nwill be remembered as someone who made our country work, someone who \nnever wanted to aspire beyond being just that strong community leader \nwho associated himself communitywide and statewide to make for his \nfamily and for his friends a better place to live.\n  Pete Wilson of Bonners Ferry, ID, of Boundary County, ID, made north \nIdaho a better place because he was there as a marvelous leader of that \ncommunity. Pete will be long remembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I want to speak in morning business, \nbut I would be pleased to yield, with unanimous consent, to my friend \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I feel like I am part of New Jersey. The \nSenator from New Jersey is--I don't want to hurt his reputation--my \nclosest ally in the Senate.

It is one of \nour claims to fame. We literally lap upon New Jersey's shore. But I \nthank him. I will be very brief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15051-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15051-S15052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate French \nPresident Jacques Chirac for having taken resolute steps to stop \nattacks on Jewish sites in France and, more broadly, to address some of \nthe causes of anti-Semitism among Muslim youths in that country.\n  As you know, Madam President, France has a large Muslim minority \npopulation. In the past, I have been strongly critical of President \nChirac, the French, and other Europeans for not having been \nsufficiently attentive to the cancer of anti-Semitism that still exists \nin Europe, and in the United States to some extent.\n  Some have ignored the insidious way criticism of some Israeli \npolicies has been conflated into pure anti-Semitism. Others have shied \naway from meeting the problem head on because of fears of provoking \nmore violence in Europe. Still others have refrained from speaking out \nfor fear of alienating domestic electoral constituencies.\n  Whatever their motives, until recently, precious few European leaders \nhave demonstrated very much leadership with regard to combatting anti-\nSemitism, which is on the rise.\n  Last Saturday, a Jewish school near Paris was destroyed by an arson \nattack. Two days later, President Chirac convened a meeting attended by \nPrime Minister Raffarin and other top officials to react to this latest \noutrage. The result of the meeting, as reported in the New York Times, \nwas a package of measures including beefed-up policing and prosecution \nof anti-Semitic violence, and also an earmark of nearly $8 billion \nworth of investment in urban renewal to clean up neighborhoods that \nbreed Islamic fundamentalism.\n  President Chirac was quoted as saying: ``Anti-Semitism is contrary to \nall the values of France,'' and that Jewish Frenchmen and Frenchwomen \nare at home in France just as are all other groups.\n  Last month, the Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on \nanti-Semitism in Europe, which revealed the shocking extent of the \nproblem. Recent public opinion polls in Europe have confirmed our \nhearing's testimony.\n  One of the most important weapons in the fight against anti-Semitism \nis political leadership. Or as Justice Holmes said: The best \ndisinfectant is the light of day. The best disinfectant is light, and \nshedding light on the anti-Semitism in Europe, and criticizing it, can \nonly be done effectively by Europe's political leadership.\n  France's measures are, to be sure, only a beginning of a long \nstruggle to eradicate this disease from the European body politic. I \nhave been critical in the past when European leaders have not \nresponded. Now President Chirac should be complimented for having had \nthe courage to forcefully show the way. He deserves credit, and I hope \nit is the beginning of a process.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Biden pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 82 and S. Con. Res. 83 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank my friend from New Jersey.

Other than the war in Iraq, I suppose the subject we \nhear most about is jobs. We are worried, as are our constituents, about \nthe future. How do we keep good-paying jobs? We are aware that in this \ncountry of not very many people, compared to the rest of the world, we \nhave about 25 percent of all the money in the world. We are a fortunate \ncountry.\n  How do we, as the country grows, and as we worry about global \ncompetition--especially about how China develops--keep our good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs? How do we keep our standard of living? We have \nstruggled through that for a long time. We have worried about it for a \nlong time.\n  After World War II, we helped Europe get back on its feet through the \nMarshall plan and basically provided direct competition there, as the \npeople making lower wages began to make some of the things we made. We \nstruggled with Japan, worrying about whether the Japanese, in the \n1980s, might take us over economically. But that didn't happen. We were \nable to keep our standard of living. We have watched Africa, the former \nSoviet Union, and other parts of the world grow and develop, even \nthough people there were making much lower wages than Americans. We \nhave been able to keep our standard of living.\n  I want to talk today about one major reason why we have been able to \nkeep that standard of living and why there is a lesson for us for the \nfuture there. I want to talk about our investments in the physical \nsciences, about our investments in science and technology.\n  Last week Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham released an exciting 20-\nyear plan for the future of scientific facilities in our country. This \nplan provides for an exciting future for science that will \nrevolutionize science and our society. The plan includes participation \nin international collaborations to make fusion power a reality. It \nstrengthens our scientific computing capabilities to develop advanced \nmethodologies ranging from modeling chemical reactions to predictions \nof weather and climate change. It includes facilities to develop and \ncharacterize proteins for microbial research on a grand scale. These \nare just a few of the facilities that are included in Secretary \nAbraham's visionary plan.\n  This ambitious plan serves as a reminder that since World War II, \naccording to the National Academy of Sciences, half of our job growth \ncan be attributed to our investments in science and technology. This \nshould also remind us, especially in this era of global competition, \nthat future investments in science will be even more important. To \ncreate more good-paying jobs for Americans, I therefore recommend \nCongress and the administration do for the physical sciences what it \nhas done in the last few years for the health and life sciences: double \nthe Department of Energy's Office of Science funding, from the current \n$3.3 billion to more than $6 billion per year within the next 5 years.\n  Our investments in science and technology have continued to create a \nremarkable legacy of innovation. U.S. patent rates exceed most other \nindustrialized countries, a direct result of historically strong \nresearch and development investments and technological leadership. For \nexample, in 1986, the United States had more than double the number of \npatents than the rest of the world, with nearly 80,000 patents granted. \nIn 1999, the number of patents granted in the United States was over \n160,000, while those in the rest of the world were less than 80,000. \nThere were 160,000 in our country, 80,000 patents in the rest of the \nworld. These patents, these innovations, led to new technologies and \nnew jobs. Nearly 5.3 million new firms were launched between 1990 and \n1998 that were mainly high-technology companies. Not all of them \nsucceeded. But these new firms accounted for one-third of the 10 \nmillion new jobs created between 1990 and 1997.\n\n  However, last fall, the President's Council of Advisers on Science \nand Technology reported funding for research and development is \nbecoming dangerously imbalanced. They recommended the funding levels \nfor the physical sciences and engineering be improved and that funding \nlevels be brought to parity with the life sciences. To correct this \ntrend, we should increase the authorizations for a variety of \nscientific and technological endeavors at the DOE. The Department of \nEnergy, through its Office of Science, is the largest supporter of \nphysical science and engineering research and supports many of the \nfederally funded research and development centers in our country. These \ncenters are considered by many to be the crown jewels of the R \nenterprise in the Nation. These centers and our great research \nuniversities create the technology of the future that leads to the jobs \nof tomorrow.\n  Sometimes I think we take for granted these research universities and \nour great laboratories the Department of Energy runs. We not only have \nmore of the great research universities in the world in our country, we \nhave almost all of them. Nowhere in the world has national \nlaboratories, such as Oak Ridge in my State, or Los Alamos, or more \nthan a dozen others across our country. No other country in the world \nhas the number of federally funded research institutions such as our \nlaboratories that are operated by the Department of Energy, and the \ngreat research universities of America, which are funded to a great \nextent by Federal funding.\n  The Nation must have balanced investment to maintain the overall \nhealth of science and technology research. Recent funding increases in \nthe National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation \ncannot compensate for the declines in funding at Federal agencies, such \nas the Department of Energy. Many of the advances in the health \nsciences could not have been realized without past investments in the \nphysical sciences. Much of the basic work in the physical sciences, on \nwhich all other sciences, even the\n\n[[Page S15053]]\n\nbiological sciences, are based, is supported by the Department of \nEnergy. Harold Varmus, Nobel Laureate and former director of the NIH, \nsummed up very nicely the unique relationship between the medical and \nphysical sciences in an editorial in the Washington Post.\n  He stated in that editorial:\n\n       Medical science can visualize the inner workings of the \n     body. . . . These techniques are the workhorses of medical \n     diagnosis. And not a single one of them could have been \n     developed without the contributions of scientists, such as \n     mathematicians, physicists, and chemists supported by the \n     agencies currently at risk.\n\n  Although this statement was made 3 years ago, it is still true today \nfor the Department of Energy Office of Science.\n  The fundamental work in high energy and nuclear physics has led to a \nrevolution in medicine. Our quality of life has been greatly improved \nwith the advent of nuclear medicine. As President Bush recently \nacknowledged, one of every three hospital patients benefits from \nnuclear medicine. None of this would have been possible without the \nfundamental research of physicists in the last century and today, \nphysicists who have been supported in large part by the Department of \nEnergy and its predecessors.\n  Advances in magnetic resonance imaging--we call it MRIs in everyday \nlanguage--could not have been possible without the development of \nsuperconductors. Small electron linear accelerators are used in \nhospitals every day to treat cancer patients. Yet this would not have \nbeen possible without our investments in science.\n  Likewise, the development of laser and optics technology has led to a \nrevolution in medical procedures. Surgeries, such as gall bladder \nremoval, that were once invasive and required weeks of recovery, can \nnow be performed with a minimal incision and require minimal recovery \ntime. None of this would have been possible without the basic research \nperformed by scientists at our research universities and National \nLaboratories funded by our Federal investments in science and \ntechnology.\n  We are advancing even further than once imagined, thanks to these \ninvestments in science. The Department of Energy is leading the way in \ndeveloping materials for creating the artificial retina. The \ndevelopment of an artificial retina requires new and innovative \nmaterials, research, and nanoscale fabrication techniques that are on \nthe forefront of science.\n  Preliminary models of the artificial retina have enabled patients to \nsee for the first time. I saw some of that research being done at Oak \nRidge. Although these patients did not regain full sight, this is just \nthe beginning. This research caused three patients to see for the first \ntime. With advancements in materials and fabrication techniques, sight \nmay eventually be returned to those who cannot see. This is truly \namazing. We are just at the edge of what science can do.\n  The physical science and engineering will also play a major role in \nadvancing technology for homeland security. The development of \ndetection systems for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear \nweapons will require investments in science and technology. Crisis \nresponse technologies and analyses will also be dependent on science \nand engineering. The daunting challenges of developing countermeasures \nfor chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons will be \naddressed in large part by the development and application of our \nscientific capabilities. Our Nation has no choice. We must invest \nheavily in physical sciences and engineering to stay competitive in \nthese fields. Our competitiveness is greatly impacted by the number of \ngraduate students entering these fields.\n  A definite correlation exists between the number of graduate students \nenrolled in science and engineering and the funding levels for these \nfields. The funding levels for the medical sciences have increased more \nthan 20 percent over the past decade, and graduate student enrollment \nhas increased more than 40 percent. However, there were 20 percent \nfewer graduate students in physics and 9 percent fewer in chemistry in \n2000 than in 1993 while the mathematical sciences had 19 percent fewer \ngraduate students. These trends cannot be allowed to continue.\n  Science and technology are an integral part of our everyday lives. To \nsustain our Nation's technical and scientific leadership, we must \nsupport increased authorizations for our science programs. The Energy \nbill reported out of conference will help put our Nation on the path to \nsustained economic growth. But the Energy bill is not just investing in \nscience; it is investing in jobs.\n\n  The quality of our lives and the prosperity of our Nation will be \ngreatly enhanced and made better if we agree over the next 5 years to \ndo for the physical sciences what we have done for the health \nsciences--double our spending--according to the visionary plan that the \nSecretary of Energy laid out for the next 20 years.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

He is one of our senior citizens who has his \nbirthday today. When this animated character burst on the scene, it \nchanged our country. That change was bound to happen because of his \nappeal to the young and the old. He has changed the way we communicate. \nHe has changed the way we travel.\n  He is just a little fellow, but size has meant nothing to this \nanimated character. He has always held that it is not the size of the \ndog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog.\n  He has changed our attitude on how we solve our problems and most \ntimes taught us to laugh at ourselves and lighten up on ourselves. He \nhas entered our lives and he has changed us all, from the young to the \nold.\n  Today is the birthday of Mickey Mouse. It is also shared by our good \nfriend, the President pro tempore now in the chair, Chairman Stevens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15053-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15053-S15054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Chief \nWarrant Officer Two Scott A. Saboe, a resident of Willow Lake, SD, who \ndied on November 15, 2003, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe, a member of A Company, 4th \nBattalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, was based \nout of Fort Campbell, KY. He was among 17 soldiers killed when two Army \nBlack Hawk helicopters collided midair in the northern Iraq city of \nMosul.\n  Answering America's call to the military, Chief Warrant Officer Two \nSaboe had planned a military career since attending high school at \nWillow Lake, SD. A member of the football, basketball, and track teams, \nfriends remember him as a serious and committed person. Chief Warrant \nOfficer Two Saboe's former coach and teacher Bill Stobbs said that ``he \ndied doing what he loved, and he was a dedicated soldier.'' His \nchildhood friend, Darin Michalski, knew that ``he was giving his all \nand believing in what he was doing.''\n  For all of Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe's commitment to public \nservice, nothing was more important than his family. The 33-year-old \nleaves behind his wife Franceska and 6-year-old son, Dustin, as well as \nhis sister Ann Remington, who is stationed at Walter Reed Medical \nCenter in Bethesda, MD. He also leaves behind his father, Arlo Saboe, a \ndecorated Vietnam war veteran, in addition to his proud, extended \nfamily and countless friends.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe served our country and, as a hero, \ndied fighting for it. He served as a model example of the loyalty and \ndedication in the preservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers of \nmy family as well as the rest of the country's are with his family \nduring this time of mourning. Our thoughts continue to be with all \nthose families with children, spouses, and loved ones serving overseas.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe led a full life, committed to his \nfamily, his Nation, and his community. It is his incredible dedication \nto helping others that will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is \na far better place because of Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe's life, \nand, while his family, friends, and\n\n[[Page S15054]]\n\nNation will miss him very much, the best way to honor his life is to \nemulate his commitment to service and community. In the words of \nMichalski, ``Most of us go through our whole lives and don't really \naccomplish anything. And some of us only live to be 33, and we're \nheroes.''\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfamily of Chief Warrant Officer Two Saboe. I know that he will always \nbe missed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Private First Class Sheldon R. \nHawk Eagle, a former resident of Eagle Butte, SD, who died on November \n15, 2003, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Pfc. Hawk Eagle, a member of the 1st Battalion, 320th Field \nArtillery, 101st Airborne Division, was based out of Fort Campbell, KY. \nHe was among 17 soldiers killed when two Army Black Hawk helicopters \ncollided mid-air in the northern Iraq city of Mosul.\n  Answering America's call to the military, Pfc. Hawk Eagle enlisted in \nthe Army during a visit to his sister in Grand Forks, ND. An enrolled \nmember of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, his Lakota name was Wanbli \nOhitika, meaning Brave Eagle. A descendant of Crazy Horse, military \nduty was essentially a family duty in his home. His family, from his \ngrandfather to his uncle to his father, all served their country in the \narmed forces.\n  News of his death spread rapidly through Indian Country, but not \nfaster than on the Cheyenne River Reservation where he was raised by \nhis aunt and uncle, Harvey and Bernadine Hawk Eagle, after his parents \npassed away. Emanuel Red Bear, a spiritual leader in the community, \nremembers Pfc. Hawk Eagle as ``a role model in his quiet way. He was a \nmodern-day warrior.'' His sister, Frankie Hawk Eagle remembers that, \n``His goals were important to him, and his whole persona was full of \nlife. He was well-respected in the Armed Forces and believed that \neverything he did was for his family, his Native people and for the \nmost, his country. He was Pfc. R. Hawk Eagle, a United States Army \nSoldier.''\n  Pfc. Hawk Eagle served our country and, as a hero, died fighting for \nit. Native Americans have a great history of serving in the Armed \nForces and fighting and dying to protect this country, including the \n``Code Talkers'' of World War II. Pfc. Hawk Eagle served as a \ncontemporary example of that loyalty and dedication to the preservation \nof freedom. The thoughts and prayers of my family as well as the rest \nof the country's are with his family during this time of mourning. Our \nthoughts continue to be with all those families with children, spouses, \nand loved ones serving overseas.\n  Pfc. Hawk Eagle led a full life, committed to his family, his Nation, \nand his community. It is his incredible dedication to helping others \nthat will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a far better \nplace because of his life, and, while his family, friends, and Nation \nwill miss him very much, the best way to honor his life is to emulate \nhis commitment to service and community.\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfamily of Private First Class Sheldon Hawk Eagle. I know that he will \nalways be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15054-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On January 23, 2003, Luis Collazo was attacked and beaten by a man \nwho asked him for a smoke as he walked to his car from a bar and a \npizza establishment in Palm Springs, CA. The attack came after the \nsuspect made an antigay slur to Collazo, said Palm Springs police \nDetective Mark Melanson. Fortunately, Collazzo was quickly released \nfrom the hospital after being treated for facial bruises.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15054-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, a few moments ago I read an article that \nappeared in The State newspaper of Columbia, SC: ``Misled and \nUndermanned: the Truth on Iraq.'' It was prepared by my dear friend and \ncolleague, Ernest F. Hollings, the senior Senator of South Carolina.\n  His words reminded me of sad moments--reminded me of a divided \nAmerica--and reminded me of the pain we all experienced. I do hope my \ncolleagues will set aside a few moments to read and reflect on these \nthoughts of my dear friend from South Carolina.\n  I do not believe that Senator Hollings wrote this article with any \nother motive than to share his candid observations as someone who was \nthere and who understands well the situation currently before us. His \nwords are thought-provoking, and deserve the attention of all of our \ncolleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hollings' article be printed in \nthe Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Misled and Undermanned: The Truth on Iraq\n\n                    (By Senator Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       The majority leader of the Senate, Mike Mansfield, quietly \n     opposed the war in Vietnam for years. He had a practice of \n     writing memos in opposition to the war to Presidents Johnson \n     and Nixon while publicly supporting the war on the floor of \n     the Senate. But finally, when Cambodia was invaded under \n     President Nixon, he snapped.\n       Going on television, he said Vietnam was a mistake from the \n     get-go. The next day he received a letter from an admirer who \n     had just lost her son. She said: ``I just buried my son to \n     come home and watch you say that the Vietnam War was a \n     mistake from the beginning. Why didn't you speak out \n     sooner?''\n       I came to the Senate in 1966, and if Mansfield, an expert \n     on the Far East, had spoken out at that time, we might have \n     saved 50,000 lives. I have reached my ``Cambodian moment.''\n       In August and September of 2002, President Bush, Vice \n     President Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Condoleeza \n     Rice and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld all cautioned that \n     Saddam was reconstituting a nuclear program. On September 8, \n     the vice president said that we ``know with absolute \n     certainty'' that this was what Saddam was about; then on \n     October 7, President Bush went further, saying, ``Facing \n     clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof--\n     the smoking gun--that could come in the form of a mushroom \n     cloud.'' Four days later, I voted for the Iraq resolution.\n       I was misled. Saddam was not reconstituting a nuclear \n     program, and is no way was he connected to 9/11. There were \n     no terrorists in Baghdad, no weapons of mass destruction, and \n     Saddam was no threat to our national security. Iraq was not a \n     part of the war on terrorism.\n       Now we have another Vietnam. Just as President Johnson \n     misled us in Vietnam, President Bush has misled us into Iraq. \n     As in Vietnam, they have not met us in the streets hailing \n     democracy. Thousands of miles away, we are once again \n     ``fighting for the hearts and minds.'' Again, we are trying \n     to build and destroy. Again, we are bogged down in a \n     guerrilla war. Again, we are not allowing our troops to fight \n     and win--we do not have enough troops. Again, we can't get \n     in, can't get out. Again, instead of Vietnamizing Vietnam, we \n     are trying to Iraqify Iraq. And already, with Rumsfeld's \n     memo, we have the Pentagon papers.\n       Once more we are blaming intelligence. It's not bad \n     intelligence; it's because we refuse to listen to good \n     intelligence, like that from General Brent Scowcroft. We had \n     plenty of warnings.\n       Iraq was under sanctions. We were overflying the north and \n     the south; and you can bet your boots Israel knew whether or \n     not Saddam had nuclear systems. Its survival depends on \n     knowing. Iraq was no more a part of the war on terrorism than \n     North Korea.\n       If the troops are to fight, there are too few. If they are \n     to die, there are too many. My goal is to stop the killing \n     and injuring of our GI's. To support the troops, we need more \n     troops--at least 100,000 more. Get in, clean\n\n[[Page S15055]]\n\n     out Baghdad and the Sunni triangle. Get law and order. Then \n     get a constitution and victory. But since General Eric \n     Shinseki said we need ``several hundred thousand troops,'' \n     Secretary Rumsfeld is determined not to send troops, but to \n     argue structure. ``Operation Meatgrinder'' continues.\n       Apparently, the game plan is to give 200,000 hungry Iraqis \n     a uniform, a square meal, and then announce we have security \n     and leave. We'll end up with exactly what Secretary Rumsfeld \n     said we wouldn't have--a Shiite democracy, or another Iran. \n     And, of course, a lot more terrorism.\n       For the first time in history, this administration, this \n     Congress, will not pay for the war. And for the Guardsmen we \n     are sending this time, Washington hopes they don't get killed \n     so that they can hurry back and be given the bill. We are not \n     going to pay for it; we need a tax cut.\n       We should have listened to former President ``Papa'' Bush, \n     who wrote in A World transformed, ``we should not march into \n     Baghdad . . . turning the whole Arab world against us .  . . \n     assigning young soldiers . . . to fight in what would be an \n     unwinnable urban guerrilla war.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15055-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE TOM OSBORNE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nmy friend and colleague from Nebraska, Congressman Tom Osborne, on his \ndedicated work for mentoring programs that has earned him a place in \nthe Hall of Fame for Caring Americans.\n  Congressman Osborne has been awarded this honor by the Caring \nInstitute for his commitment and understanding of the positive \ninfluence that mentors can have on a child's life. In 1991, while he \nwas still head coach of the Nebraska football team and I was the \nGovernor of Nebraska, Tom Osborne and his wife Nancy started a program \ncalled TeamMates. This program paired middle school students with \nuniversity football players to give young people someone who could talk \nwith them, help them set goals, and reinforce basic skills, attitudes, \nand other lessons of life. The program was a success and it soon \nexpanded statewide.\n  Tom Osborne, the football coach, became Congressman Tom Osborne in \n2000, the same year I joined the Senate, and it has been a pleasure to \nwork with him on several mentoring projects. His Mentoring for Success \nAct authorized $50 million in new competitive grant awards to local \nschool districts and community based organizations to fund mentoring \ninitiatives. He also led the way in designating January ``National \nMentoring Month.'' He continues to work to fund these valuable \nprograms.\n  I am glad to see that the Caring Institute has chosen to honor \nCongressman Osborne's efforts to make mentoring a priority in the \nUnited States. The environment in which many kids today are raised \nlooks nothing like the one in which I grew up. Today, close to 50 \npercent of all children are raised in single-parent households. In most \ncases, single parents work long hours; their energy and resources are \nstretched thin. In other cases, even two parent families cannot \nprovide--for various reasons--the support a child needs. Congressman \nOsborne's Mentoring for Success Act is for these kids. It can make a \nbig difference for so many young people and it can change these kids' \nlives and brighten their future.\n  It is appropriate that Congressman Osborne receive this award just \nbefore Thanksgiving because his programs have given so many young \npeople a friend and a brighter future to be thankful for. \nCongratulations to Congressman Osborne and thank you for your \ncontinuing commitment to mentoring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15055-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          WORLD YOUTH ALLIANCE\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, at a time when the global \ncommunity's attention is focused on rebuilding Iraq and the relations \nthat states have to one another, I would like to commend the World \nYouth Alliance, which offers itself as a way forward to address some of \nthe critical questions with which we are faced.\n  Working with over 1 million young people from over 100 countries \naround the world, these young people have had a constant presence at \nthe United Nations and other international institutions for the last 4 \nyears. Their membership consists of young people of diverse faiths--\nChristian, Jewish, Muslim, and other--and young people of no faith. \nTheir binding commitment is to work for the promotion of the dignity of \nthe person at the international level and in each of their countries \nand communities around the world.\n  The World Youth Alliance understands that building sustainable, free \nand just societies can only be accomplished when the human person is \nrecognized and placed at the center of all policy, programs, and \nculture. In doing this, they are reaching out to each other and to the \nworld to impact the policy and culture that is being created around \nthem.\n  The dignity of the person, according to the World Youth Alliance, is \nintrinsic and inviolable. The dignity of the person is the basis for \nall human rights. In this, they place themselves directly in the heart \nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the great human \nrights history that has particularly grown after the tragedy of World \nWar II.\n  The World Youth Alliance recognizes that each individual, no matter \nhow vulnerable, must be protected by the state. Otherwise, the state \nfinds itself in the terrifying position of deciding the worth of a \nhuman being and objectifying the human person. At such a point, the \nfreedom and justice of the state are called into question. The World \nYouth Alliance then reminds the global community that the person can \nnever be seen as the problem, but must be recognized at all times with \nhaving the dignity and rights which the person possesses by simple \nright of being. This global coalition understands that to protect each \nhuman person and to build sustainable and free societies, this dignity \nmust be extended to each member of the human family, unconditionally, \nfrom the moment of conception until natural death.\n  In the last 4 years, this coalition of young people has had \nextraordinary success. Their membership continues to grow. They have \nparticipated at major United Nations conferences. They have spoken to \nthe General Assembly and to individual states, and they have helped to \ndetermine the outcomes of documents and resolutions.\n  This group of young people has trained over 10,000 young people on \nthe importance of the international institutions and the relationship \nthat these institutions have on their lives. They have initiated \nprojects together: projects to build community centers in Nigeria for \nyoung people who are struggling to build up their communities and \ncombat HIV/AIDS; projects to educate and rebuild schools in Tanzania, \nSouth Africa and Mexico; projects with street children in Latin \nAmerica; projects with art and beauty to reawaken the transcendent \namong all of their generation and ours.\n  Most recently the World Youth Alliance has worked with a coalition of \nstates at the United Nations, including the United States, on the draft \ndiscussions to prepare for an international treaty on human cloning. At \nthe first discussion on cloning, the United States quoted from the \nWorld Youth Alliance in their statement to the General Assembly. \nRecognizing a shared commitment to protecting the dignity of each and \nevery person, the statement read: ``[this resolution] also responds to \na call by over one million youth from all continents. They are members \nof the World Youth Alliance, who believe that only a total, \ncomprehensive ban on human cloning would protect and respect the \ndignity of all human beings. They respectfully asked the Ad Hoc \nCommittee to work towards a complete ban. To the youth, the future \nworld leaders, we hope that the Sixth Committee will be able to say--we \nheard you!''\n  As the World Youth Alliance continues to grow and expand their work \nin Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe, let us wish them the same \nkind of continued growth and success. Their work to train young people \nto engage at the international level, connecting a generation together \nin the promotion of the dignity of the person and human rights, is \nprecisely what the world needs. I look forward to seeing many of them \nas the future world leaders, a role in which they have already found \nthemselves, demonstrating remarkable integrity, vision and capability. \nOur work will be well served when it inspires this kind of response and \ncommitment from the world's youth.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15056-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S15056]]\n            RECOGNITION OF DR. G. TIMOTHY KAVEL'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Dr. \nG. Timothy Kavel upon his retirement as vice president of Delaware \nTechnical & Community College and Campus Director of the Jack F. Owens \nCampus in Georgetown, DE, serving all of Sussex County. His leadership \nover the years has won him the respect of faculty and students alike, \nalong with the gratitude of our entire State. He has been, and remains, \na trusted friend.\n  Delaware Technical and Community College was created in 1966 when the \nDelaware General Assembly approved House Bill 529. The Southern Campus, \nnear Georgetown, opened in September 1967 with 367 enrolled students. \nThe name was changed to the Jack F. Owens Campus in May, 1995. Today, \nthe college has four campuses, the Owens Campus, the Terry Campus in \nDover, and two northern locations, in Stanton and Wilmington. In 1999, \nDelaware Technical and Community College was named the Community \nCollege of the Year by the National Alliance of Business.\n  In his position as vice president, Tim has contributed to the overall \npolicymaking, planning and development of the college system. As \ndirector of the Owens Campus, he assumed the responsibility of the \ntotal campus operation on a day-to-day basis. During his time at \nDelaware Technical and Community College, he has made many improvements \nto the campus, student and faculty life and school programs. The \ncollege houses the Carter Partnership Center, where several other \npostsecondary institutions, including the University of Delaware, \nWilmington College and Delaware State University, utilize the \nclassrooms for their own bachelor's, master's and doctorate classes.\n  Another of Tim's major contributions to the Owens Campus has been \nimproving the campus. He has helped expand and beautify the physical \nplan of the college. Through Tim's leadership, the new Student Services \nCenter was built to be a consolidated services center for students. It \nhouses various service facilities, including a dining hall, meeting \nplaces for student activities, financial aid offices, and counselors' \noffices. This center is a fitting tribute to Tim's focus on students.\n  Tim has also aided in upgrading and renovating various buildings on \nthe Owens campus, including the Jason Technology Center, which is \ncurrently undergoing a complete refurbishment. This center, considered \nthe birthplace of Delaware Technical and Community College, was built \nin the 1940s. It originally was a high school for Black students, and \nlater became the start of the Community College. Tim made a case for \nthe need of a new classroom facility, and after 8 years of \nconstruction, the final wing of this building will be completed by the \nend of this fiscal year. The new, state-of-the-art center houses new \nclassrooms, science labs and a computer lab. This renovation serves as \na testament to Tim's commitment to bring the college into the \ninformation age.\n  Tim also has a passion for maintaining the grounds of the campus. He \nhas helped raised private funds for the enhancement of the grounds, a \nnew entrance to the college, and outdoor furniture. His passion for \nkeeping the campus clean has spread to faculty and students alike. \nCampus pride is so abundant that students and faculty will pick up \ntrash voluntarily off the ground in an effort to keep the campus clean.\n  Tim's 38 years of experience as an educator includes teaching at both \nsecondary and postsecondary school levels, counseling, fund raising, \npersonnel and a wide variety of management activities.

Mr. President, it is my honor and pleasure to \nrecognize Dr. Carole A Gavin, recipient of the 2003 New Jersey \nProfessor of the Year Award. This award, which is sponsored by the \nCouncil for Advancement and Support of Education and the Carnegie \nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching, acknowledges outstanding \nprofessors for their excellence in teaching and their commitment to \nstudents.\n  Dr. Gavin has been a professor of English as a Second Language, ESL, \nand French at Burlington County College since 1971. She has worked \ntirelessly to develop supportive infrastructures in which her students \ncan learn and thrive. As a professor of ESL and the ESL program \ncoordinator, Dr. Gavin uses innovative strategies to engage her \nstudents and help them reach their full potential. For example, the TNT \nTutoring Team is an idea that Dr. Gavin developed to match her ESL \nstudents with retired professionals from an adult living community. \nExposure to the English language is just the beginning of the program. \nThrough writing journals and discussions of current issues, the \nstudents gain a cross-generational perspective that enhances their \ncultural experience. The education the students gain is not one that \ncan be found in any classroom or textbook--the interactions between the \nsenior citizens and the students offer knowledge that will not only \nhelp students succeed in passing a test but succeed in life.\n  Dr. Gavin is also the principal faculty advisor of the Phi Theta \nKappa Honor Society. In order to strengthen the resources available to \nher students, Dr. Gavin assembled 17 new and current faculty members to \njoin her in mentoring the students. Her efforts have succeeded in \nenriching the programs available to the members of Phi Theta Kappa by \noffering a diverse group of advisors who bring knowledge and experience \nfrom a variety of disciplines. Again, Dr. Gavin's creative ideas have \npositively impacted the lives of her students.\n  Along with the 2003 New Jersey Professor of the Year award, Dr. Gavin \nhas been the recipient of several honors including the Lindbach \nFoundation Award for Teaching Excellence, South Jersey Literacy Award \nfor ESL Program Teaching and various grants, including a Presidential \ngrant to work with Fort Dix Kosovar refugees.\n  In a Nation where higher education is vital to an individual's \nsuccess, I applaud the hard work, energy, and expertise of our Nation's \nprofessors. Dr. Carole Gavin's successful career as a teacher, mentor \nand innovator is an inspiration to us all and I am proud to acknowledge \nher as New Jersey's Professor of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15056-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15056-S15057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TECHLINK--MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I commend TechLink, a \ntechnology transfer center at Montana State University, for its \noutstanding achievements. TechLink has been highly successful at \nhelping both the Department\n\n[[Page S15057]]\n\nof Defense and NASA to develop, transfer, and commercialize new \ntechnology in partnership with industry.\n  Congress first appropriated funds in 1996 to establish TechLink as a \npilot program. Since then, this program has exceeded all expectations. \nTechLink has established more than 250 partnerships between Federal \nlaboratories and the private sector, including technology licensing \nagreements, cooperative R agreements, and contracts to small \nbusinesses for new technology development. These partnerships involve \nmore than 50 different Federal research centers--including over 40 \nDepartment of Defense labs and all 10 NASA centers. TechLink has played \na key role in linking the high-tech sector in the Northwestern United \nStates with Federal laboratories nationwide. It has assisted more than \n150 companies throughout the Northwest.\n  Beginning this last October, TechLink became a permanent part of the \nDepartment of Defense's technology transfer, transition, and \nacquisition activities. It is the only Department of Defense-wide \ntechnology transfer center serving the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nvarious defense agencies. TechLink accounts for approximately one-\nfourth of all Department of Defense technology licensing agreements \nnationwide. It is playing a key role in transitioning innovative \ntechnology from Department of Defense labs and the private sector into \ncommercial products that not only support our Nation's military and \nhomeland security, but also contribute to national economic \ncompetitiveness and prosperity.\n  TechLink provides an outstanding return on investment. Partnerships \nthat TechLink has established with industry are returning revenues and \nin-kind contributions to Department of Defense labs worth more than \nthree times the Federal funds expended to support TechLink's \nactivities.\n  As a result of its many innovations and achievements, the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce recently recognized TechLink as one of 10 \n``exemplary models'' nationwide of Federal technology transfer. I am \nproud to have played a key role in establishing TechLink, and wish this \ncenter the best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15057-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             2003 NATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING STRATEGY--PM 57\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 29(a) of the Money Laundering and Financial \nCrimes Strategy Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-310; 31 U.S.C. 5341(a)(2)), \nenclosed is the 2003 National Money Laundering Strategy, prepared by my \nAdministration.\n                                                      George W.

This House urges the United States Congress to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to the New Jersey Army National \n     Guard to procure 464 High Mobility Multi-Purpose Vehicles to \n     meet its authorized strength; continue the replacement of its \n     helicopter fleet with UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters; \n     accelerate the procurement of AH-64 Apache Helicopters; \n     replace the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier with Bradley \n     Fighting Vehicles, and provide the armor division with \n     deployable M1A1 tanks.\n       3. This House requests the United States Congress to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to the New Jersey Air National \n     Guard for the procurement of new Block 50/52/plus aircraft \n     and for the upgrading of KC-135E refueling airframes.\n       4. This House further calls upon the United States Congress \n     to establish and fully fund a Civil Support team in the State \n     of New Jersey and to provide more and better protective \n     clothing for team members and body armor for counter \n     terrorism missions and to\n\n[[Page S15059]]\n\n     appropriate capital construction funds for critical military \n     construction projects, including the construction of a \n     dedicated site for the arming and dearming of F-16 aircraft \n     at the Atlantic City Air Base, the construction of the \n     Consolidated Logistics and Training Facility at the Lakehurst \n     Naval Engineering Station; and security enhancements at the \n     McGuire Air Force Base.\n       5.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to differential salary \n     reimbursement for activated Reserve and National Guard \n     members; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 283\n\n       Whereas, since September 11, 2001, tens of thousands of \n     National Guard and Reserve members have been activated in the \n     war against terrorism and in the conflict with Iraq; and\n       Whereas, to alleviate financial hardship for their \n     activated employees, many states, counties and municipalities \n     have generously opted to pay activated Reserve and National \n     Guard members the difference between their regular salary and \n     their military pay; and\n       Whereas, however, in these difficult economic times, many \n     states, counties and municipalities are themselves suffering \n     substantial budget deficits; and\n       Whereas, such a differential pay policy is helpful in \n     recruiting and retaining Reserve and National Guard members; \n     and\n       Whereas, given the crucial role Reserve and National Guard \n     forces play in this nation's security, it is incumbent upon \n     the federal government to assist state and local government \n     employers in their efforts to alleviate hardship on these \n     soldiers, sailors and aviators when they are activated: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House calls upon the President and Congress of the \n     United States to pass and enact legislation reimbursing \n     state, county and municipal governments for differential \n     salary payments made to members of Reserve and National Guard \n     units activated in response to the September 11, 2001 \n     terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to traffic \n     stoppages at railroad crossings; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 134\n\n       Whereas, local communities have long tried to address the \n     issue of minimizing traffic stoppages caused by trains \n     traveling within their municipal borders. Slow trains moving \n     through a community bring traffic to a standstill. Even \n     worse, trains may sometimes stop completely, bringing an \n     entire city to a halt and backing up road traffic for blocks \n     in all directions. Commuters, shoppers, and even emergency \n     vehicles can be trapped on the one side of a railroad track, \n     unable to reach the other side for long periods of time; and\n       Whereas, the State Legislature provided local governments \n     with the means to regulate the length of time that trains may \n     permissibly halt vehicle traffic. The authority to levy fines \n     on train companies that block traffic for too long held the \n     promise of compelling railroad companies to work with local \n     governments to minimize the disruption to lives and commerce \n     that had become routine. Unfortunately, the courts have \n     struck down this state law, arguing that only the federal \n     government may regulate the speed and length of trains \n     operating in the interstate commerce; and\n       Whereas, with local and state options to resolve this local \n     problem foreclosed, it is imperative that the United States \n     Congress exercise its authority to compel a reasonable \n     solution at the federal level. Without Congressional \n     attention, railroad companies will continue to ignore the \n     concerns of local governments, businesses, and citizens who \n     must cope with unreasonable traffic stoppages: Now, therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved by the senate,  That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to address the issue of traffic stoppages at \n     railroad crossings; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the United States Senate Majority \n     Leader, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-320. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to providing financial assistance to \n     commercial airline companies; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 331\n\n       Whereas, airline companies of this nation were required by \n     the Federal Government to suspend operations for four days, \n     September 11 through 14, 2001, for reasons of national \n     security; and\n       Whereas, the aggregate estimates of daily lost revenues \n     suffered by these companies during that four-day period range \n     from $250 million to $500 million; and\n       Whereas, in the days since flights have been able to \n     resume, cancellation of reservations has ranged between 20% \n     and 40%, resulting in additional lost revenues to these \n     companies, canceled flights and huge layoffs estimated at \n     more than 100,000 employees; and\n       Whereas, US Airways, a major airline company in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has announced that layoffs of \n     approximately 20,000 of its employees have become necessary; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the Pittsburgh region alone approximately \n     11,700 residents are employees of US Airways; and\n       Whereas, financially necessitated layoffs of airline \n     employees in the numbers projected will have a profound \n     impact on the national and State economies and on national \n     security and should be prevented; and\n       Whereas, the health of the airline industry impacts so \n     directly on our economic health and our national security \n     that Federal and State financial assistance is desirable and \n     imperative: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to pass and the President of the United States \n     to enact legislation to provide the necessary financial \n     resources to commercial airline companies headquartered in \n     the United States and their employees and traded on a \n     national stock exchange; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this Legislature and our Governor likewise \n     promptly pass and enact a financial package to provide \n     assistance to those national airline companies who do \n     business in the Commonwealth; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to members of the \n     Pennsylvania delegation of Congress, to the Governor of \n     Pennsylvania and to the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     of Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-321. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to funding for \n     home heating assistance; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 162\n\n       Whereas, for a variety of reasons, natural gas prices have \n     risen significantly over the past year. These reasons include \n     increasing demand for natural gas and declining production in \n     both the United States and Canada. While this increase in \n     cost has already exacted a toll in many areas of our national \n     economy, the full impact has yet to be felt. This winter, \n     when seasonal demand reaches its peak, costs are expected to \n     strike a terrible blow to people who have had difficulties \n     paying their home heating bills even before the recent \n     increase in prices; and\n       Whereas, for many years, utilities and their customers have \n     supplemented governmental programs through various heating \n     assistance initiatives. However, public and private programs \n     offering help to low-income families trying to heat their \n     residences are already stretched thin. This winter's \n     situation is expected to bring a crisis to many people, \n     including the low-income seniors who will almost surely face \n     difficult choices; and\n       Whereas, with summer prices of natural gas at near record \n     highs, Michigan's Public Service Commission has warned that \n     homeowners could expect increases of $30 a month or more if \n     the winter is severely cold. Gas companies in Michigan and \n     across the country are urging their customers to take steps \n     to prepare for the winter's costs, including weatherization \n     and budgeting. Another key part of dealing with this problem \n     will be for\n\n[[Page S15060]]\n\n     Congress to significantly increase funding available to help \n     state programs for low-income residents; and\n       Whereas, there are discussions under way in Congress over \n     proposals to address this issue, including increasing the \n     authorization funding level for the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program to at least $3 billion. Clearly, such \n     actions to bring home heating help are in order: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to increase funding \n     available for home heating assistance to cope with the rise \n     in natural gas costs expected this winter; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of President of the United States, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-322.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to out-of-state \n     solid waste; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, in 1992, the United States Supreme Court, in Fort \n     Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan Department of Natural \n     Resources, ruled that states could not regulate or ban the \n     importation of solid waste because only Congress has the \n     authority to regulate interstate commerce. Since that time, \n     Michigan has become the dumping ground for increasing amounts \n     of solid waste from outside of our state and, with large \n     amounts of trash from Canada, from outside the country; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has become one of the largest recipients \n     of improved solid waste in the country. Approximately 15 \n     percent of all trash dumped in landfills in Michigan now \n     originates elsewhere. The amounts have increased \n     significantly in the past several years, and recent reports \n     of a major contract with Ontario and of the closing of the \n     nation's largest landfill in New York seem to indicate this \n     situation will only become a bigger issue in the future; and\n       Whereas, several measures have been considered in Congress \n     to address the issue of extending authority to states to \n     regulate or ban out-of-state solid waste, including H.R. \n     1730; and\n       Whereas, accepting unlimited volumes of trash outside our \n     state is a serious long-term commitment. Long after the money \n     from the contract has been spent, there is a threat to the \n     environment and an obligation to monitor sites to protect \n     water and health. Clearly, any state accepting these long-\n     term risks should be able to regulate what comes across state \n     lines for disposal: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to give states the \n     authority to ban out-of-state solid waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 324. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to foreign \n     municipal solid waste; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, Michigan has long been frustrated in efforts to \n     regulate solid waste imported into our state. Our state is \n     especially concerned about waste that is brought here from \n     Ontario. Our citizens feel strongly that our environment \n     should not be placed at additional risk from municipal solid \n     waste and other materials that are generated elsewhere and \n     transported here for disposal; and\n       Whereas, the volume of waste that comes into Michigan each \n     year represents a significant portion of all trash handled \n     here. As much as 20 percent of all solid waste in Michigan is \n     from out of state, and the amount has increased significantly \n     in recent years; and\n       Whereas, Congress has authority for regulating the \n     transportation and disposal of solid waste between states and \n     nations by virtue of the United States Constitution's \n     interstate commerce clause. To protect the health, safety, \n     and welfare of our environment and citizens, Congress must \n     take action to provide states with the express means to \n     regulate or prohibit the importation of trash. Congress has \n     before it now a bill that would provide the appropriate \n     authority to the states. Under H.R. 382, which has been \n     introduced by Michigan's Congressman Rogers, states could \n     prohibit or impose certain limitations on the receipt of \n     foreign municipal solid waste; and\n       Whereas, Congress is also considering H.R. 411, which would \n     direct the Administrator of the EPA to carry out duties under \n     the agreement with Canada on the transboundary movement of \n     hazardous waste; and\n       Whereas, hazardous waste and solid waste transported \n     between Canada and the United States are provided for in the \n     Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government \n     of the United States Concerning the Transboundary Movement of \n     Hazardous Waste. It has been reported, however, that the \n     notification requirements and procedures set forth in the \n     agreement have not been followed. It is most disturbing to \n     think that the protections provided in the agreement between \n     our nations are not working. The people of this state have \n     every right to know that all prudent measures are being \n     enforced to protect our citizens and environment: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to authorize states to \n     prohibit or restrict foreign municipal solid waste and to \n     urge the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure full \n     compliance with the Agreement Between the Government of \n     Canada and the Government of the United States Concerning the \n     Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-325.

In some cases, the mining, \n     collection, and processing of virgin materials can lead to \n     degradation of our natural resources; and\n       Whereas, Michigan's recycling rates are significantly below \n     average when compared to the region or national averages; and\n       Whereas, Michigan residents have chosen to spend \n     considerable time and resources on diverting certain waste \n     streams from solid waste disposal facilities such as beverage \n     containers, yard waste, used oil, and scrap tires; and\n       Whereas, efforts to encourage people to recycle are \n     undermined when residents do not see a link between their \n     efforts to recycle materials and the extension of the usable \n     life of area disposal facilities; and\n       Whereas, solid waste management is most effective when done \n     on a local level where program implementation is conducted: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That is the sense of this \n     legislative body that local units of governments need to be \n     empowered to have greater control over solid waste management \n     decisions; that the county level is the optimal planning unit \n     of government due to the multi-jurisdictional nature of solid \n     waste disposal facilities; that the state of Michigan should \n     play a larger role in ensuring that products that Michigan \n     residents have decided to divert from solid waste disposal \n     facilities are not allowed in our facilities from other \n     jurisdictions; and that the state of Michigan should support \n     local units of governments in their efforts to provide \n     alternative disposal mechanisms for those items banned from \n     our solid waste disposal facilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to extend to the states more \n     authority for the management of solid waste; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15060-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INHOFE, from the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, without amendment:\n       S. 616.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain lands and facilities of the Provo River Project; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nauthorizing the title transfer of certain features of the Provo River \nProject, UT, from the Bureau of Reclamation to non-Federal ownership. \nThis title transfer will provide many benefits, both directly and \nindirectly, for both the local government and the Federal Government, \nincluding economic, environmental, recreational, and safety benefits.\n  The facilities to be transferred are the Provo Reservoir Canal and \nassociated lands and structures, the Salt Lake Aqueduct and associated \nlands and structures, and a 3.79 acre parcel of land in Pleasant Grove, \nUT. The Provo Reservoir Canal is a large, open, mostly unlined, 21.5 \nmile long canal that was constructed by the United States in the 1940s. \nThe water transported through the Provo Reservoir Canal is used \nprincipally for municipal and industrial purposes. The Salt Lake \nAqueduct is a 41.7 mile long, 69 inch diameter pipe, constructed by the \nUnited States and completed in 1951. The Provo River Water Users \nAssociation recently constructed a $2 million office and shop complex \non the Pleasant Grove property, without the use of Federal funds.\n  Title transfer will facilitate the use of tax-exempt bond financing \nand low-interest loan financing for needed improvements. Currently, \nthere is no Reclamation program for rehabilitating aging Reclamation \nfacilities. Federal ownership of the facilities to be improved prevents \nlow interest loans by others. On the Federal level, the transfer would \neliminate the demands on limited Reclamation resources for the \nadministration of the Salt Lake Aqueduct and the Provo Reservoir Canal.\n  It is anticipated that following title transfer, needed improvements \nwould be made. For example, the Provo Reservoir Canal will be enclosed \nto provide for the conservation of water, improved water quality and \nsecurity, the construction of a public trail system on top of the \ncanal, and to eliminate the hazards of an open unlined canal in an \nurban environment. The critical importance of eliminating the safety \nhazard of an open canal in an urban setting was recently reinforced by \nthe tragic death of two young men who unfortunately were lured by the \nthrill of attempting a swim through the canal to the other end. The \nenclosure of the canal would eliminate this safety risk and hopefully \nprevent any others from making a similar mistake.\n  The transfer has significant local support, including Utah County, \nSalt Lake County, Sandy City, Salt Lake City, Lindon City, Draper, \nPleasant Grove City, Orem City and American Fork City.\n  I look forward to working with the Metropolitan Water District of \nSalt Lake and Sandy, the Provo River Water Users Association, and all \ninterested parties to make this title transfer a success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1879. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend provisions relating to mammography quality standards; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Mammography \nQuality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2003. I am pleased to be \njoined in introducing this bill by Senator Ensign and\n\n[[Page S15063]]\n\nour bipartisan cosponsors. This important bipartisan bill is about \nsaving lives. That's what the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) \ndoes. Accurate mammograms detect breast cancer early, so women can get \ntreatment and be survivors.\n  Mammography is not perfect, but it is the best screening tool we have \nnow. I authored MQSA over ten years ago to improve the quality of \nmammograms so that they are safe and accurate. Before MQSA became law, \nthere was an uneven and conflicting patchwork of standards for \nmammography in this country. There were no national quality standards \nfor personnel or equipment. Image quality of mammograms and patient \nexposure to radiation levels varied widely. The quality of mammography \nequipment was poor. Physicians and technologists were poorly trained. \nInspections were lacking.\n  MQSA set federal safety and quality assurance standards for \nmammography facilities for: personnel, including doctors who interpret \nmammograms; equipment; and operating procedures. By creating national \nstandards, Congress helped make mammograms a more reliable tool for \ndetecting breast cancer. In 1998, Congress improved MQSA by giving \ninformation on test results directly to the women being tested, so no \nwoman falls through the cracks because she never learns about a \nsuspicious finding on her mammogram. Now it is time to renew MQSA and \nlay the foundation to strengthen it even further.\n  The bill that I am introducing with Senator Ensign today is a \nbipartisan agreement to extent MQSA for two years while making two \nadditional changes to certificates that facilities are required to have \nto perform mammograms. First, the bill allows the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to issue a temporary renewal certificate for up to \n45 days to a facility seeking reaccreditation, if the accreditation \nbody has issued an accreditation extension and other criteria are met. \nThis will help ensure that a facility is not forced to close its doors \nto women seeking mammograms, while it is completing its reaccreditation \nand the quality of mammography is not compromised.\n\n  Second, the bill allows the Secretary, at the request of an \naccreditation body, to issue a limited provisional certificate to a \nfacility to enable a facility to conduct examinations for educational \npurposes while an onsite visit from an accreditation body is in \nprogress. This certificate would only be valid during the time the site \nvisit team from the accreditation body is physically in the facility \nand would not be valid longer than 72 hours.\n  The two year reauthorization of MQSA is important. It will give \nCongress an opportunity to consider in the next reauthorization expert \nrecommendations from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) study and a General \nAccounting Office (GAO) report on several issues related to MQSA. I \nhave been working with the Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee to get these studies going since \nI included them in the Senate fiscal year 2004 Labor/HHS Appropriations \nbill. The HELP Committee also heard testimony in support of a two year \nreauthorization at the HELP Committee's April hearing on MQSA.\n  As I talked to advocacy groups about ways to improve MQSA, the need \nto improve the skills of doctors reading mammograms was brought to my \nattention. One study found that a woman has a 50 percent chance of \ngetting a ``false positive'' reading from her mammogram over 10 years. \nI'm gravely concerned about reports that doctors miss about 15 percent \nof breast cancers on mammograms. I was also disturbed by a New York \nTimes investigation last year. It found that some radiologists were \nmissing alarming numbers of breast cancers because they lacked the \nexperience or training they needed for the difficult task of \ninterpreting the X-ray. These are reasons why I requested the hearing \nthat the HELP Committee held in April on this issue. While I am \ndisappointed that the HELP Committee was not able to reach agreement \nthis year on a continuing medical education provision to address this \nissue, I look forward to Congress reexamining this issue once the IOM \nand GAO studies are completed.\n  The IOM and GAO will look at several important issues such as: ways \nto improve physicians' interpretation of mammograms; possible changes \nto MQSA regulatory requirements; ways to ensure the recruitment and \nretention of sufficient numbers of adequately trained personnel to \nprovide quality mammography; how data currently collected under MQSA \ncould be better used; and factors that led to the closing of \nmammography facilities since 2001. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in Congress to examine the recommendations from these \nstudies in 2005 and to consider further improvements to MQSA in its \nnext reauthorization.\n  The HELP Committee will mark up this bill tomorrow. This legislation \nis supported by groups including the American Cancer Society, the Susan \nG. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the national Alliance of Breast \nCancer Organizations, and the American College of Radiology \nAssociation. I strongly urge Committee passage and swift Senate passage \nof the bill later this week. I hope that the House will also \nexpeditiously pass this bill. There are an estimated 212,600 new cases \nof breast cancer and an estimated 40,200 breast cancer deaths in the \nUnited States this year. Early detection and treatment are essential to \nreducing breast cancer deaths. Congress should pass this bill this year \nto reauthorize MQSA and extend this valuable program that helps save \nthe lives of women and men with breast cancer. I ask unanimous consent \nthat letters of support be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                                      American Cancer Society,\n\n                                                November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the American Cancer \n     Society and its more than 28 million supporters, I would like \n     to thank you, along with Senator Ensign, for your continued \n     leadership in sponsoring the ``Mammography Quality Standards \n     Act of 2003.'' As the largest national, community-based \n     organization dedicated to eliminating the incidence and \n     burden of cancer and improving cancer care, the Society \n     strongly supports the reauthorization of the Mammography \n     Quality standards Act of 1992 (MQSA) in the remaining days of \n     this session.\n       In addition, we believe a two year reauthorization is \n     appropriate at this time, as we continue to examine methods \n     for mammography quality improvement. Currently, funding has \n     been included in the LHHS Appropriation bill for the \n     Institute of Medicine and General Accounting Office to study \n     and recommend concrete improvement to MQSA. When the results \n     of these studies are released, we look forward to again \n     working with the Congress to further improve MQSA and ensure \n     that women's access to high quality mammography continues.\n       The American Cancer Society, along with other professional \n     societies and advocacy groups, was actively involved in the \n     development of the 1992 MQSA law and its reauthorization in \n     1997, in an effort to further reduce deaths and disability \n     from breast cancer. Mammography screening has led to earlier \n     detection of breast cancer when it is in its most treatable \n     stages, thereby providing a greater chance for life-saving \n     treatments and a greater range of treatment options. \n     Increasing utilization of mammography has been a major factor \n     in the reduction of breast cancer deaths in the U.S. over the \n     last decade. Based upon ongoing scientific evidence and \n     improvements in technology, high-quality mammography \n     continues to be the best available tool for the early \n     detection of breast cancer. Therefore, the Society is honored \n     to again lend our support to Congress in its commitment to \n     ensure that women have access to high-quality mammograms.\n       The Society would like to commend you again for your \n     leadership on this critical public health issue, and we look \n     forward to continuing to work closely with you and the other \n     cosponsors to ensure the enactment of this important \n     legislation this year. If you or your staff have any \n     questions, please contact Kelly Green Kahn, Manager of \n     Federal Government Relations (202-661-5718).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Daniel E. Smith,\n              National Vice President, Federal & State Government \n                                                        Relations.\n                                                 Wendy K.D. Selig,\n     Vice President, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The Susan G. Komen Breast\n\n\n                                            Cancer Foundation,\n\n                                                November 17, 2003.\n     Re: Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2003\n\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \n     Foundation supports your introduction of the Mammography \n     Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2003, and we \n     appreciate your leadership in ensuring patient access to \n     quality breast health and breast cancer care.\n\n[[Page S15064]]\n\n       Thanks to more than 75,000 volunteers dedicated to the \n     fight against breast cancer, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \n     Foundation is a unique grassroots network with more than 100 \n     Affiliates nationwide and internationally. Since its \n     inception in 1982, Komen has raised nearly $600 million in \n     furtherance of its mission--to eradicate breast cancer as a \n     life-threatening disease by advancing research, education, \n     screening and treatment. Komen dedicates millions of dollars \n     annually towards scientific and community outreach projects. \n     The Komen Foundation Research Program has awarded more than \n     850 grants, totaling more than $110 million for breast cancer \n     research. In addition, Komen Affiliates have funded hundreds \n     of non-duplicative, community-based breast health education \n     and breast cancer screening and treatment projects for the \n     medically underserved.\n       Early detection of breast cancer saves lives. Mammography \n     screening remains the gold standard in the early detection of \n     breast cancer. In the past decade, breast cancer mortality \n     rates have declined in the United States. This is due, in \n     large measure, to early detection and timely treatment. The \n     MQSA establishes a national standard of mammography care. \n     Since enactment of the MQSA, women throughout the country \n     have gained further confidence in their mammograms, as well \n     as in those individuals and facilities that provide services \n     as part of screening for breast cancer.\n       The Komen Foundation wishes to lend our continued support \n     to the efforts of you and your colleagues to ensure enactment \n     of the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act, and \n     we applaud your efforts in advancing an issue of utmost \n     importance.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                      Susan Braun,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         NABCO  , National Alliance of Breast Cancer \n           Organizations,\n                                  New York, NY, November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the millions of women, \n     families, professionals and providers served by the education \n     and information programs of the National Alliance of Breast \n     Cancer Organizations (NABCO), I am writing to express support \n     of 2003 legislation to reauthorize the Mammography Quality \n     Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA). We thank you and your Senate \n     co-sponsors for advancing this legislation.\n       Since our organization's founding in 1986, NABCO has been a \n     visible proponent of high-quality early detection of breast \n     cancer. We have worked with Congressional leaders on measures \n     to educate women about good breast health, and on provisions \n     to improve screening coverage and reimbursement, and to \n     eliminate barriers to early diagnosis. Without question, \n     early detection followed by prompt, state-of-the-art care \n     offers women the best chance for successful treatment, and \n     high-quality, regular mammograms are the best available tool \n     to detect breast cancer at its earliest, treatable stages.\n       The MQSA system of certification, inspection and \n     accreditation established basic standards that have improved \n     the quality of mammography in the United States. After \n     working with Congress to craft this legislation, it was my \n     honor to serve as a consumer representative on the FDA's \n     initial MQSA Advisory Committee. Since 1992, breast cancer \n     survival has improved markedly--in large part because more \n     women have taken advantage of regular, high-quality screening \n     mammograms, available nationwide. The current reauthorization \n     provisions will further strengthen this system.\n       However, new approaches are needed to continue to improve \n     the quality and efficiency of this test, reflect technology \n     innovations, disseminate outcomes, and attract dedicated \n     professionals to the breast imaging field. We hope that you \n     will seek NABCO's ongoing help to identify ways that MQSA can \n     better serve facilities, medical professionals and consumers. \n     We commend you and your staff for your recognition that high \n     quality, accessible mammography is vital to making progress \n     in the fight against breast cancer. With your support, we can \n     offer women confidence that if they have breast cancer, it is \n     likely to be detected, and that mammography and imaging \n     services in the U.S. will continue to improve in quality.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Amy S. Langer,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American College of Radiology,\n\n                                    Reston, VA, November 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the 30,000 physician \n     and physicist members of the American College of Radiology \n     Association (ACRa), I would like to offer the College's full \n     support for your introduction of legislation to reauthorize \n     the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA).\n       Since enactment of MQSA in 1992, women in the United States \n     have gained confidence in the providers of their mammograms, \n     through the knowledge that mammography facilities were being \n     certified in accordance with federal standards. The \n     successful collaboration of radiologists, mammography \n     facility operators, federal and state regulators and consumer \n     groups has produced significant improvements in the quality \n     of mammograms nationwide. With the impending passage of this \n     legislation, Congress and ACRa continue this legacy.\n       The technical corrections contained in this legislation \n     will make sure that mammography facilities will not be closed \n     due to administrative ``Catch 22's.'' Had these problems not \n     been addressed, access by thousands of women seeking timely \n     breast cancer detection and treatment may have been \n     threatened. Furthermore, the Committee's willingness to work \n     with the breast cancer community and consider incorporating \n     the results of pending studies into the next reauthorization \n     is truly appreciated and has the potential of improving the \n     act even more.\n       The College looks forward to working with you and other \n     interested parties to enact this legislation and thanks you \n     for your leadership as we continue to improve the quality of \n     mammography services throughout the country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  E. Stephen Amis,\n                                   Chairman, Board of Chancellors.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, the \nMammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2003. The purpose \nof this legislation is to reauthorize the Mammography Quality Standards \nAct in order to maintain access to high quality mammography services \nfor every woman in America.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among \nAmerican women. An estimated 211,300 new cases of invasive breast \ncancer are expected to occur among women in the United States in 2003. \nIn my home State of Nevada alone, 1,400 new cases of breast cancer will \nbe diagnosed in women, and an estimated 300 women in Nevada will die of \nbreast cancer next year.\n  The MQSA was originally passed in 1992 to ensure that all women have \naccess to quality mammography for the detection of breast cancer in its \nearliest, most treatable stages. Congress re-authorized MQSA in 1998, \nextending the program through 2002. Although MQSA was scheduled for \nreauthorization last Congress, we unfortunately failed to act.\n  The MQSA has had a positive impact on mammography quality. FDA \ninspection data continues to show overall facility compliance with the \nnational standards to ensure the quality of x-ray images. Currently, \nover 98 percent of all mammography facilities pass the phantom image \ntest during their facility inspection. MQSA remains as essential tool \nfor early detection and for combating mortality associated with breast \ncancer.\n  The legislation I introduce today would reauthorize MQSA for 2 years, \nsignifying Congress' commitment to extending the life of this important \nprogram. Reauthorizing the act for a shorter amount of time than \npreviously done will allow Congress the time it needs to examine some \nserious issues facing the long-term effectiveness of the act while \nstill maintaining vital quality standards in the interim.\n  In addition, this legislation would permit the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to issue two additional and \ntemporary certificates that will allow facilities who offer mammography \nservices to continue to provide uninterrupted care while they go \nthrough the process of reaccredidation. This is important as we \nencourage more and more women to seek screening services each year.\n  With these significant changes, MQSA, I believe, will be more \neffective than ever. While we are improving the act with this bill, we \nneed to tread carefully as we look to make further changes. \nMammography, like every health discipline, is an imperfect science. On \naverage, radiologists estimate that somewhere around 75 percent of \ncancer can be found through mammography. Thus, until the technology \nimproves, the quality of the reading is limited.\n\n  We have to remember that in the medical field, human error is \nunavoidable. Most doctors practicing today are excellent at what they \ndo, and placing additional regulations on them, especially in an \nalready highly-regulated subspecialty, can often times do more harm \nthan good. Congress needs to be increasingly vigilant in making sure \nthat practices below acceptable standards are eliminated. To that end, \none of the real benefits of MQSA is its required medical audit \nprocedure which mandates that each FDA-approved facility has a system \nfor following up on mammograms that reveal problems. In\n\n[[Page S15065]]\n\nother words, each facility performs a self-check on itself, helping to \nensure quality care is being given.\n  The impact of medical liability on the radiological profession has \nbeen immense, leading to a shortage of quality doctors. As bad as it \nhas been for the profession itself, the adverse effect it has had on \npatient access to care is intolerable. In places across the country, \nwomen are having to wait weeks, even months, to get a mammography \nscreening. In a speech this February in Florida, the president of the \nAmerican Medical Association stated that in a recent survey of Palm \nBeach, Miami Dade and Broward Counties, 7 of the 29 radiologists said \nthey had stopped reading mammograms--and 8 others are considering that \npossibility. In addition, Orlando Regional Hospital reports that the \naverage wait time for women seeking mammography rose from 20 days in \n2000--to 150 days in 2002. The cause of all this is that many \nradiologists can't find or afford the necessary liability insurance.\n  The bottom line is that at a time when the medical liability crisis \nis hitting the industry harder than ever, the last thing the Federal \nGovernment should be doing is creating more avenues for abusive \nlawsuits. That is why Congress must balance the need to find ways to \nimprove the quality and delivery of women's health, while at the same \ntime preserving a positive and equitable medical environment for well-\nintentioned professionals to practice.\n  The MQSA has been an important program in increasing the quality of \nmammography services for women. I thank Senator Mikulski and HELP \nCommittee Chairman Gregg for all of their hard work on this issue, and \nI look forward to seeing this legislation through to passage by the \nSenate and ultimately signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Allen, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1880. A bill to establish the Special Blue Ribbon Commission on \nChesapeake Bay Nutrient Pollution Control Financing; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish a special Blue Ribbon Commission on Chesapeake Bay Nutrient \nPollution Control Financing. Joining me in sponsoring this measure are \nmy colleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, Allen and Santorum.\n  On Tuesday, November 11, 2003, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation released \nits sixth annual State of the Bay report. The report is headlined ``The \nBay's Health Remains Dangerously Out of Balance and Is Getting Worse.'' \nIndeed, this summer the Chesapeake Bay's so-called ``dead zone''--the \narea of oxygen-and life-depleted waters--extended more than 100 miles \ndown the Bay, the largest area ever recorded. Scientists observed \nextensive algal blooms and watermen reported pulling up nets of dead \nfish and crab ``jubilees''--a rare phenomenon of crabs fleeing the \nwater for air. The cause of the pollution of the Chesapeake Bay is \nclear: high levels of nitrogen coming from sewage treatment plants, air \ndeposition, runoff from farmlands, and stormwater runoff from urban and \nsuburban areas. The water pollution caused by high levels of nutrients, \nparticularly nitrogen, continues despite two decades of efforts from \nall the jurisdictions in the watershed, Maryland, Virginia, \nPennsylvania and the District of Columbia, to address it.\n  Scientists, State and Federal agencies and citizen advocates know \nwhat must be done to address the excessive nutrients which pollute the \nBay's water. The 304 major sewage treatment plants in the watershed \nmust be upgraded to reduce the nutrients coming into the Bay. Farmers \nmust be given the best technology and resources to keep excess \nfertilizer and sediments out of the Bay. Air deposition must be \nreduced. And new financing mechanisms must be developed to help local \ngovernments control stormwater runoff.\n  Earlier this year, a Chesapeake Bay Commission report entitled The \nCost of a Clean Bay, found a $9.4 billion gap in the resources needed \nto reduce nutrients and sediments in the Bay to levels sufficient to \nremove the estuary from the Environmental Protection Agency's list of \nimpaired waters. While $9.4 billion seems like an enormous sum, we \nshould remember that the health of Chesapeake Bay is vital not only to \nthe more than 15 million people who live in the watershed, but to the \nNation. It is one of our Nation's and the world's greatest natural \nresources covering 64,000 square miles within six States. It is a \nworld-class fishery that still produces a significant portion of the \nfinfish and shellfish catch in the United States. It provides vital \nhabitat for living resources, including more than 3600 species of \nplants, fish and animals. It is a major resting area for migratory \nwaterfowls and birds along the Atlantic including many endangered and \nthreatened species. It is also a one-of-a-kind recreational asset \nenjoyed by millions of people, a major commercial waterway and shipping \ncenter for much of the eastern United States, and provides jobs for \nthousands of people. In short, the Chesapeake Bay is a magnificent, \nmultifaceted resource worthy of the highest levels of protection and \nrestoration.\n  On November 3, 2003, I was joined by the six Senators and 16 Members \nof the House of Representatives from the Chesapeake Bay watershed \nStates, in a bipartisan letter to President Bush urging him to commit \n$1 billion to restoring the Bay's water quality. We pointed out to the \nPresident that, with a matching State funding requirement and proper \ntargeting, these funds would provide a tremendous boost to the efforts \nto reduce nutrient pollution in the Bay and that this investment would \npay big dividends in restoring the ecological and economic health or \nour nation's greatest estuary. We realize that this request is but a \nfirst step to bring to bear the necessary resources to accomplish the \nnutrient reduction.\n  The legislation which we are offering today represents the next step \nin the effort to close the $9.4 billion gap and help assure that the \neffort to reduce nutrient pollution in Chesapeake Bay will be focused \nproperly and funded adequately for the long term. It directs the \nAdministrator of EPA to establish a special Blue Ribbon Commission on \nChesapeake Bay Nutrient Pollution Control Financing to oversee \ndevelopment of a comprehensive implementation plan to address the \nfunding needs and/or regulatory requirements for reducing nutrient \npollution loads in Chesapeake Bay sufficient to comply with Clean Water \nAct standards by the year 2010. The Commission is charged to address \nthe appropriate responsibilities of the Federal, State and local \ngovernments in financing sewage treatment plant upgrades, agricultural \nand other nonpoint source runoff controls, and urban stormwater \nmanagement. It is also directed to address the opportunities for \nenhancing the role of the private sector in financial support for \nnutrient reduction either directly or through public/private \npartnerships.\n  The Commission will have a vital role to play in Chesapeake Bay \nrestoration. Through the work of the Chesapeake Bay Program and its \npartners, our scientific and technical understanding of what needs to \nbe done to reduce excess nutrients going into the Bay serves as a model \nfor the Nation. Yet these practices cannot be implemented without \nsufficient funding, and current estimates suggest that a doubling of \nnutrient reduction efforts to date will be required. The Commission is \ncritically needed to explore responsibilities, opportunities and \nmechanisms for generating the financial backing needed to restore the \nChesapeake Bay. Let me add that the economics of nutrient reduction is \nan issue faced by many regions of the country. Many of the \nrecommendations of this Commission regarding the financing of sewage \ntreatment plant upgrades, agricultural nutrient reduction practices, \nand stormwater and air pollution control could be transferred to for \nuse elsewhere around the Nation.\n  It is our expectation that, in carrying out its functions, the \nCommission will draw upon the expertise of other Federal agencies, \nincluding the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and NOAA as well as State and local governments, academia \nand the private and non-profit sector and establish a multidisciplinary \nadvisory panel to assist the Commission in preparing its report and \nrecommendations. Valuable work is now being carried out by the \nChesapeake Bay Program in a great number of areas including nutrient \nreduction,\n\n[[Page S15066]]\n\noyster restoration, submerged aquatic vegetation, and environmental \neducation to mention a few and it is not intended that the Commission \nbe in any way a substitute for the Bay Program. Rather it is to support \nthe work of the Bay Program by dissecting financial responsibilities \ninto component parts--Federal, State, local and private and by \naddressing the funding and/or regulatory requirements of the work to be \ndone to end the Bay's water pollution from too much nutrient loading.\n  Establishment of the special Blue Ribbon Commission on Chesapeake Bay \nNutrient Pollution Control Financing will serve to kick start the \ncritical work which must now be done to restore the Chesapeake Bay. It \nis supported by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay \nCommission as evidenced by their letters. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe two letters be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                 Annapolis, MD, November 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     SH-309 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Chesapeake Bay Commission to commend you on your efforts to \n     direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish \n     a special blue ribbon Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Pollution \n     Control Commission. The Commission would examine how best to \n     finance reductions in nutrient pollution sufficient to comply \n     with Clean Water Act standards by the year 2010. It is the \n     logical next step in our efforts to restore the nation's \n     crown jewel estuary, the Chesapeake Bay.\n       Earlier this year, our members issued a report entitled The \n     Cost of a Clean Bay. The report found a $9.4 billion gap in \n     the resources needed to reduce nutrients and sediments \n     sufficient to remove the Bay from the EPA list of impaired \n     waters. While $9.4 billion seems like an enormous sum, we \n     should remember that the health of Chesapeake Bay is vital \n     not only to the more than 15 million people who live in the \n     watershed, but to the nation. It is the world's largest, most \n     productive estuary, with a worth estimated at nearly $1.2 \n     trillion. The Bay restoration leads the world in devising new \n     and innovative solutions to reduce nutrient and sediment \n     pollution. If the Bay restoration fails, it speaks volumes \n     for the fate of most water quality restoration projects, \n     world-wide.\n       At this point, the partners in the Chesapeake Bay \n     Restoration Program have a well fleshed-out game plan. The \n     leaders know what needs to be done and have, for the most \n     part, implemented policies that will support these efforts. \n     The stumbling block is the lack of available funding or, in \n     the absence of money, the identification of viable regulatory \n     alternatives that can provide equitable solutions.\n       On November 3, 2003, you joined your colleagues in the Bay \n     watershed in a bipartisan letter to President Bush urging him \n     to commit $1 billion to restoring the Bay's water quality. \n     You pointed out that, with a matching State funding \n     requirement and proper targeting, these funds would provide a \n     tremendous boost to the efforts to reduce nutrient pollution \n     in the Bay and that this investment would pay big dividends \n     in restoring the ecological and economic health of our \n     nation's greatest estuary. We offer our strong support on \n     this request. Furthermore, we believe that the blue ribbon \n     panel is its perfect complement.\n       Your effort represents the next--and critical--step in the \n     effort to close the $9.4 billion gap, ensuring that the \n     nutrient reduction goals will be reached. We applaud you in \n     your efforts and offer our assistance to you as you pursue \n     the best next step for the Bay restoration effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ann Pesiri Swanson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Chesapeake Bay Foundation\n\n                                 Annapolis, MD, November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We wish to express our support and \n     enthusiasm for your effort to establish a special Blue Ribbon \n     Commission on financing the control of nutrient pollution in \n     Chesapeake Bay. Your continued leadership on behalf of the \n     Chesapeake is most appreciated.\n       As you know, this summer the Chesapeake Bay experienced one \n     of the worst ``dead zones'' in history. Fish kills, beach \n     closings, and algae blooms were commonplace. Over the past \n     twenty years, the monitoring stations of the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program have revealed little to no change in key water \n     quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, clarity, and \n     algae concentration. The fundamental challenge remains \n     controlling nitrogen and phosphorus pollution to the \n     Chesapeake and its tributaries.\n       Over the past several years, a number of different reports \n     have documented the financial needs of meeting the goals of \n     the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. These reports conclude that \n     water pollution control, in particular, will require the most \n     significant financial investments. Key water pollution \n     control needs include sewage treatment, municipal storm \n     water, and agricultural runoff.\n       Your effort to establish a Blue Ribbon Commission \n     appropriately focuses on the biggest financial challenges \n     confronting the Chesapeake Bay. It includes a diverse \n     membership, and it engages the signatories to the Chesapeake \n     Bay Agreement in developing specific recommendations to meet \n     the needs of the Bay. Importantly, your effort acknowledges \n     that regulatory mechanisms can be used to internalize \n     pollution control costs to minimize burdens on the region's \n     taxpayers.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Foundation believes that a financial \n     commission is a timely and appropriate response to a number \n     of the difficult challenges confronting the region's policy \n     makers. We are very supportive of your effort, and we welcome \n     the opportunity to work with you to implement your ideas.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of the \n     Chesapeake Bay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William C. Baker,\n                                                        President.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1882. A bill to require that certain notifications occur whenever \na query to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \nreveals that a person listed in the Violent Gang and Terrorist \nOrganization File is attempting to purchase a firearm, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce some legislation I \nconsider an emergency because it overrides a misguided policy that \nthreatens our homeland security and exposes our Nation to more \nvulnerable terrorist attacks.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is called the Terrorist \nApprehension Act, and it is cosponsored by Senators Schumer, Feinstein, \nCorzine, and Reed of Rhode Island.\n  This bill directs the administration to do all it can to apprehend \npotential terrorists within our borders. Sometimes they do things that \ndefy common sense and are simply hard to believe. This is one of the \nmost outrageous disclosures yet.\n  We have found out if someone on a terrorist watch list--someone who \nis a potential threat to communities across the country--goes ahead, \nbuys a weapon, applies for a permit to buy a gun, and that information \nis logged into the gun background check system, the Attorney General \nhas ordered the gun background check system not alert or even be \nallowed to share critical information with law enforcement concerning \nthe whereabouts of the terrorist--not to give it to the FBI or the ATF \nor any of the law enforcement agencies.\n  I have to say, this is a mind-boggling policy. We could have a \nnationwide lookout for a known terrorist within our borders, but if he \nobtained a weapon, got a permit approved, the Justice Department's \ncurrent policy is to refuse to reveal any data that might be available \nfor law enforcement officials.\n  It works this way: The subject is on a terrorist watch list. This is \na formal thing. The person who is listed on a terrorist watch list--\nlook out, this guy is bad news, and we do not want him to roam \nfreely. He can go ahead and buy a gun under the rapid response network \nfor a gun permit. The background check is done. Then it goes into a \ncrime database, including the terrorist watch list. The FBI terrorist \ntask force cannot get the information by virtue of this policy because \nby directive, the Attorney General has said this information should be \nprotected. To me, the protection our citizens need overrides that of \nthese people who are unwelcome to begin with. But nevertheless, once \nthey are on the terrorist watch list, we don't want to give them a lot \nof courtesy, especially to buy a weapon.\n\n  In combatting terrorism, Attorney General Ashcroft has shown little \nconcern for core civil rights. That all changes when it comes to gun \nrights. The Attorney General seems more interested in protecting the \nrights of terrorists to obtain guns than the protection of our \ncitizens.\n  I know many gun support groups have said: Listen, the terrorists \nwouldn't buy a firearm on the legal market anyway. But evidence points \nto something otherwise.\n\n[[Page S15067]]\n\n  An investigation by my staff revealed that since September 11, in \nsomewhere between 13 instances and possibly as many as 21 times--and \nthe reason for the disparity is the information comes from two \ndifferent places, but it is at least 13 times and possibly as many as \n21--a person on the terrorist watch list has attempted to or \nsuccessfully purchased firearms. Imagine. The madness is that the \nperson gets the firearm and the information is cut off here instead of \nbeing available to the FBI and other law enforcement people.\n  In addition, the terrorists know that our gun laws are weak. Found in \nthe ruins of a terrorist training camp that was destroyed by U.S. \nmissiles in Kabul, Afghanistan was a book called ``How Can I Train \nMyself For Jihad.'' The book discusses the ease with which weapons can \nbe purchased in the United States in order to engage in terrorism.\n  The guns that terrorists have access to in our country can be \ndevastating, such as the 50-caliber assault weapon which would take \ndown a helicopter, as we may have seen. This is according to the \nCongressional Research Service. That weapon can penetrate 6 inches of \nsteel plating and has a range of a mile. One has to ask: Why is it \navailable at all on the civilian market?\n  On this issue of terrorist access to weapons, it is peculiar, at \nleast, to know that Attorney General Ashcroft's position is at odds \nwith the Department of Homeland Security. During his confirmation \nearlier this year, Secretary Tom Ridge acknowledged to me in a question \npublicly that the link between access to guns and terrorism is a \ndangerous one.\n  Under oath at another hearing, the general counsel of the Department \nof Homeland Security told me it was his belief that someone on the \nterrorist watch list should not even be permitted to purchase guns.\n  Not only does the Attorney General think it is OK to allow these guns \nto be purchased by terrorists, but he thinks it should be done \nsecretly, without law enforcement's knowledge. That has to change. We \nhope the Attorney General will reverse course immediately. \nUnfortunately, I doubt he even comprehends the anomaly this generates.\n  This is why it is critical that the Senate pass this emergency \nlegislation before we leave for the year. If we don't, we will put our \nconstituents at risk unnecessarily. My legislation is simple and to the \npoint. It says, if a terrorist buys a gun, law enforcement must be \nnotified right away. We would like to prevent them from getting the \ngun, but the law, as it is for now, is the FBI, the local police, and \nthe regional terrorist task force must be told the time and the place \nof purchase.\n  I introduce this bill today and hope that we can pass it as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 1883. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngreater access for residents of frontier areas to the healthcare \nservices provided by community health centers; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould increase the likelihood that citizens who live on the American \nfrontier and in other sparsely populated areas will have access to \naffordable healthcare in their communities.\n  Since my election to the Senate in 1996, one of my goals has been to \neducate folks in Washington about what life is like in the West.\n  Obviously there are rural areas along the East and West Coasts and in \nthe Midwest. But people who live in these places are always surprised \nwhen they travel for the first time to places like my home State of \nWyoming. They are amazed at just how rural Wyoming is.\n  Well, Wyoming is more than rural. Most Wyomingites live in the \nremaining stretches of the American frontier. Now, that's not to say \nthat there aren't plenty of sparsely populated areas elsewhere, even in \ncoastal States. There are many places outside the West that share the \ncharacteristics of the frontier. But almost all of Wyoming is sparsely \npopulated. In fact, more people live in the 68 square miles of the \nDistrict of Columbia than live in the 98,000 square miles of Wyoming.\n  People who live on the frontier and other sparsely populated areas \nface some unique challenges, and one of those challenges is access to \naffordable healthcare. People who live in frontier areas are more \nlikely to lack health insurance than other rural and urban citizens. \nAlso, frontier areas generally do not have population centers that can \nsupport the full range of healthcare services available in most urban \nand some rural areas.\n  One of the proven ways of improving healthcare in medically \nunderserved areas is through the establishment of federally qualified \ncommunity health centers, or CHCs. Community health centers are not-\nfor-profit providers of health care to the working poor, the uninsured, \nand other vulnerable populations. These safety-net providers served ten \nmillion people across America in 2001.\n  Community health centers deliver preventive and primary care to \npatients regardless of their ability to pay. Almost half of the \npatients treated at community health centers have no insurance coverage \nat all. Community health centers set their charges according to income, \nand they do not collect any fees from their poorest clients.\n  President Bush has proposed major increases in funding for the \nestablishment and expansion of community health centers, and Congress \nhas begun to provide that funding. Senators across the political \nspectrum agree that community health centers play an important role in \nproviding health services to the uninsured and underinsured in many \nmedically underserved areas. We all agree that we ought to encourage \nthe development of more sites where those in need but without means can \nget proper care.\n  Unfortunately, many frontier areas do not have community health \ncenters. Wyoming, for example, only has one CHC, located in Casper. \nThat center just opened a satellite clinic in Riverton, a town of 9,300 \npeople almost 125 miles away, so now we have two sites.\n  The Federal Government keeps statistics on the degree of ``health \ncenter penetration into the unserved.'' In other words, we keep track \nof what percentage of those who need access to affordable healthcare \ncan get adequate service through community health centers.\n  In Wyoming, only 7.9 percent of the unserved had reasonable access to \ncommunity health center services, based on 2001 data. Lest you think \nthis is just a Wyoming problem, Mr. President, let me share some \npercentages from other states: Alabama: 15.9 percent; Georgia: 8.9 \npercent; Indiana: 10.1 percent; Kansas: 10.4 percent; Louisiana: 4.3 \npercent; Maryland: 15.8 percent; Nebraska: 5.3 percent; Nevada: 7.8 \npercent; North Carolina: 11.1 percent; Oklahoma: 7.8 percent; Texas: \n9.0 percent; and Virginia: 12.2 percent.\n  Why are these access figures so low? It's not because communities \naren't interested in helping their less fortunate neighbors. It's \nbecause many communities on the frontier and in other sparsely \npopulated areas can't even apply for community health center funding.\n  Why can't they apply? Well, believe it or not, the Federal Government \ndoesn't consider many isolated communities to be located in ``medically \nunderserved areas.'' And a community has to be designated as being a \n``medically underserved area'' before one can even apply for CHC \nfunding.\n  The barrier for frontier communities lies in the index that the \nFederal Government uses to determine ``medical underservice.'' That \nindex looks at four factors: the percentage of people over 65 years of \nage, and the ratio of primary-care physicians per 1,000 people.\n  Using these four factors, the agency has calculated that only four \nWyoming's 23 counties qualify to be ``medically underserved areas.'' I \nfind this interesting, since Wyoming ranks 46th out of the 50 State in \nterms of physician-to-population ratio.\n\n  I have an idea about the source of this contradiction. When I went to \naccounting school, one of the things I learned about was a concept \ncalled ``statistical validity.'' What I learned was that the \nstatistical validity of a sample is a function of sample size: in other \nwords, the larger the sample, the more accurate the results associated \nwith the sample.\n  Well, as you can imagine, sparsely populated states like Wyoming \noffer\n\n[[Page S15068]]\n\nless statistically valid samples than other states. Many of our \ncounties score very well on factors like infant mortality. Take Western \nCounty, for instance. Weston County has a very low infant mortality \nrate--in fact, their rate in 2002 was zero. But there were only 59 \nbirths in Weston County. Now I'm happy to see that statistic, but it \nreally hurts Weston County's score on the agency index.\n  Even looking at 5 years of data in sparsely populated counties \ndoesn't provide a statistically valid sample. From 1994 to 1998, Weston \nCounty's infant mortality rate was 8.5 per 1000 births, slightly above \nthe national average. From 1995 to 1999, Weston County's rate jumped to \n14.7 percent--nearly twice the national average.\n  Why did the infant mortality rate jump so dramatically in Weston \nCounty? The only difference was that in 1999, two of the 60 babies born \nin the county died soon after birth.\n  When two deaths have such a dramatic impact on the infant mortality \nrate, it's because the sample size simply isn't large enough to provide \na valid result. Slight variations in small samples can result in huge \ndifferences when translated into statistical data. And in my opinion, \nwe shouldn't be making decisions based on statistics that aren't valid \nindicators of the healthcare status of a community.\n  I am concerned that the Federal definition of ``medically underserved \nareas'' does not recognize the unique nature and needs of people who \nlive in the sparsely populated areas of our country. This makes me \nconcerned that frontier communities are going to miss out on a great \nopportunity to participate in our national expansion of community \nhealth centers.\n  That's why I'm joining today with my distinguished colleagues \nSenators Bingaman, Thomas, and Craig to introduce the Frontier \nHealthcare Access Act. We believe that people who live on the frontier \nand in other sparsely populated areas ought to have a fair shot at \ncompeting for federal support as we grow the community health center \nprogram.\n  Our bill would automatically deem ``frontier areas'' to be eligible \nfor Federal funding for the development and expansion of community \nhealth centers.\n  The bill would require no new funding--it would simply designate \nfrontier communities as special populations eligible for federal CHC \nsupport. Nor would the bill create a new preference for frontier \nareas--it would simply allow frontier communities into the competition \nfor funding. The bill would end the application of a statistical \nformula that doesn't provide a valid assessment of need in sparsely \npopulated areas--but it would still require frontier communities to \ncompete with other communities to receive federal CHC support.\n  The Frontier Healthcare Access Act also would direct the Federal \nGovernment to create a new definition of ``frontier area.'' The bill \nwould require that the new definition go beyond the traditional \npopulation-density approach to include important factors like distance \nin miles and travel time in minutes to the nearest significant \nhealthcare service area or market. This is important, because defining \nfrontier solely by population overlooks some important considerations.\n  For example, in some large counties, the presence of a city in one \ncorner skews population density and overshadows the existence of many \nlarge frontier areas. Furthermore, a key component to frontier life is \ndistance. Even areas with population density as high as 20 people per \nsquare mile should be considered frontier if the community is located \nfar from the closest significant service center or market.\n  The National Rural Health Association and the Western Governors \nAssociation have already endorsed a definition using the factors \nproposed by the Frontier Healthcare Access Act. If the federal \ngovernment adopts a similar definition, it would ensure eligibility for \ncommunity health center development and expansion for about ten million \ncitizens who live in more than 800 counties located in 38 states--not \njust the frontier West.\n  Mr. President, people in hundreds of cities and towns across the \ncountry have access to affordable healthcare services through community \nhealth centers. People who live in sparsely populated areas ought to \nhave a fair opportunity to create the same sort of access.\n  The Frontier Healthcare Access Act would create this opportunity for \npeople who live in isolated communities across our great country. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in making this opportunity \npossible for our citizens who live in every part of our remaining \nAmerican frontier--whether the buffalo still roam there or not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Frontier Healthcare Access \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) People who live in frontier areas are medically \n     underserved and face unique challenges in accessing \n     affordable healthcare.\n       (2) People who live in frontier areas are more likely to \n     lack health insurance than other rural and urban citizens.\n       (3) Frontier areas generally do not have population centers \n     that can support the full range of healthcare services \n     available in most urban and some rural areas.\n       (4) Community health centers play an important role in \n     providing health services to many medically underserved areas \n     and populations.\n       (5) Many frontier areas do not have community health \n     centers.\n       (6) Many frontier areas cannot currently qualify for \n     community health centers because the Federal definition of \n     medically underserved areas or populations does not \n     appropriately or effectively recognize the unique nature and \n     needs of frontier areas and those who live in them.\n       (7) Any definition of frontier areas for purposes of \n     eligibility for Federal or State healthcare programs should \n     look beyond simple measures of population density to consider \n     such factors as the distance from and travel time to the \n     nearest significant healthcare service center or market.\n       (8) President George W. Bush has made the development of \n     new community health centers a priority of his \n     administration.\n       (9) People who live in frontier areas should be included \n     explicitly in this expansion of the community health center \n     program.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     greater access for residents of frontier areas to the \n     healthcare services provided by community health centers.\n\n     SEC. 3. FRONTIER COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS.\n\n       Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     254b) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``and residents of \n     public housing'' and inserting ``residents of public housing, \n     and residents of frontier areas'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (j), (n), (o), (p), (q), \n     (r), (s), (q), and (s) as subsections (k), (l), (m), (n), \n     (o), (p), (q), (r), and (s), respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (i), the following:\n       ``(j) Residents of Frontier Areas.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may award grants for the \n     purposes described in subsections (c), (e), and (f) for the \n     planning and delivery of services to areas identified under \n     paragraph (3)(B).\n       ``(2) Supplement not supplant.--A grant awarded under this \n     subsection shall be expended to supplement, and not supplant, \n     the expenditures of the health center and the value of in-\n     kind contributions for the delivery of services to the \n     population described in paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) Definition.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In this subsection, the term `frontier \n     area' means a county or a rational area identified by the \n     Secretary in consultation with appropriate State offices of \n     rural health.\n       ``(B) Regulations.--The Secretary shall through regulations \n     develop a definition to identify frontier areas and shall \n     designate residents of such areas as medically underserved \n     for purposes of this section.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act and the Small \nBusiness Act of 1958 to establish the National Office for the \nDevelopment of Small Manufacturers, to increase the level of assistance \navailable for small manufacturers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce three bills to address the growing needs of small \nmanufacturers, to stimulate the manufacturing sector of our economy, \nand to put back to work the millions of American workers in the \nmanufacturing sector that have lost their jobs in the past 3 years. The \nthree comprehensive bills are: the Manufacturing Assistance, \nDevelopment and Education (MADE) in America Act, the Enhance Domestic \nManufacturing and Worker Assistance Act, and the Manufacturing Jobs \nProduction Act.\n  It's no secret that during the past 3 years, manufacturing employment \nin the United States has declined from 17.3 million to 14.6 million \njobs. This loss of manufacturing jobs represents a loss of more than \none in every seven such jobs. Over the past 3 years, the United States \nhas lost an average of 80,000 manufacturing jobs a month. The States \nthat rely the most on their manufacturing sector have suffered the most \nduring the past 3 years. Indiana has lost 67,000 manufacturing jobs, \nCalifornia--297,000, Ohio--152,000, Illinois--126,000, Michigan--\n127,000, Pennsylvania--133,000, South Carolina--55,200, and North \nCarolina--145,300. Even in my home State of Massachusetts, we have lost \napproximately 80,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001.\n  The loss of manufacturing jobs is of great concern because the \nmanufacturing sector is more important than any other sector in \nsupporting overall economic growth, technological innovation, and a \nhigh standard of living for Americans. Over the past 10 years, \nmanufacturers have performed nearly 60 percent of research and \ndevelopment in the United States and have paid over one-third of all \ncorporate tax payments to State and local governments.\n  Further, replacing manufacturing jobs with service sector jobs will \nnot help stabilize the American economy. According to a University of \nMichigan study, 6.5 spin-off jobs are created as a result of every new \njob created in manufacturing. Service sector jobs simply cannot \ngenerate that type of economic activity. The benefits of manufacturing \ncan also be found in national salary averages. In 2001, salaries and \nbenefits averaged $54,000 in the manufacturing sector, while the \naverage salary and benefits package in the private sector overall was \nonly $45,600.\n  In 1955, manufacturing jobs were 30.5 percent of all U.S. employment, \ntoday they make up just 14 percent. The manufacturing decline has been \nmarked by a relocation of factories abroad along with reduced exports \nand increased imports of manufactured goods. Both large and small \ncompanies have been affected and a continued shrinking of the \nmanufacturing base may shift the manufacturing innovation process to \nother global centers and most certainly result in a decline in U.S. \nliving standards.\n  As a member of the Finance and Commerce committees and ranking member \nof the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nbeen fighting for the creation of new manufacturing jobs during debate \nover the President's tax cuts, and I will continue to do so in the \nmonths ahead. President Bush has done nothing to address the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs, and many communities across the country are \nsuffering because of it, as more and more plants close and more and \nmore jobs move overseas. This administration is indifferent to these \nchanges, and the pain being felt in million of American households, and \nthat's unacceptable.\n  In fact, indifferent may be too kind a word. The Bush administration \nhas been downright cruel to working Americans, pursuing billions of tax \ncuts for the most well-off in our society as their only economic \npolicy, while millions of hard-working Americans have lost their jobs \nand will be left with the bill from this administration's reckless \nfiscal policies. In fact, you could argue that the manufacturing jobs \npicture is actually worse than the hard numbers tell us. While many \nestimates show that 2.5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since \nPresident Bush took office, in previous postwar recoveries, \nmanufacturing employment had recovered by this point in the business \ncycle and risen by more than 5 percent. Under the Bush presidency, \nmanufacturing employment has continued to deteriorate steadily, falling \nso far by 8 percent. Morgan Stanley's respected economists tell us that \nthe difference represents 2.1 million additional manufacturing jobs. \nMore supply-side, trickle-down, ideologically driven tax cuts are not \ngoing to turn this around. Congress needs to take action and pass some \npolicies that are meaningful to people, and will actually create jobs, \nand soon.\n  The President and his followers insist that his tax cuts are starting \nto work, basing their claims on a couple of months where the overall \njob creation numbers were positive. But the truth is that the meager \njob gains of the last three months have done little to lift most parts \nof the economy because nearly 80 percent of those small gains have come \nin just three sectors: government, temporary staffing, and education \nand health services. Manufacturing is not yet on the mend, and people \nwho are finding new jobs are finding jobs at lower pay. We need to take \naction.\n  Small-business owners have made it clear to me, to Congress, and to \nthe administration what actions are needed to reinvigorate the \nmanufacturing sector. Unlike the Bush administration, which has ignored \nthese requests for help, Congress must have the courage to make the \ntough decisions and not simply pander to wealthy Americans and giant \ncorporations with unbalanced tax cuts. The Nation's gross domestic \nproduct may be temporarily up, but manufacturing jobs are still way \ndown. To get those jobs back, and to continue competing on the \ninternational stage, our manufacturers, particularly our small \nmanufacturers, need adequate representation and leadership at all \nlevels of government, here and abroad. They need a well-educated, \nhighly skilled, productive labor force; Federal contracting and \nsubcontracting opportunities; greater access to capital; foreign patent \nprotection; trade adjustment, global marketing, and entrepreneurial \ndevelopment assistance; and responsible, targeted tax credits. This \nlegislation addresses those needs, while the President's tax cuts \ncontinue to undercut them.\n  Mr. President, we often receive complaints that the Federal and State \nsmall business programs duplicate, rather than complement, each other. \nWhile the SBA has stated that it has sufficient systems and programs in \nplace to address the concerns of manufacturers, statistics on small \nmanufacturers, as well as the business owners themselves, prove \notherwise. Many state that accessing these programs is often confusing \nand difficult because they are fragmented, spread out and not tailored \nto bridge gaps found between State and Federal assistance programs. To \naddress these problems, my bill will create the National Office for the \nDevelopment of Small Manufacturers at the Small Business \nAdministration, led by an associate administrator. This new office will \nbe responsible for coordinating and strengthening existing programs, as \nwell as establishing new SBA programs to address the needs of small \nmanufacturers and to promote programs throughout the Federal Government \nthat assist small- and medium-size manufacturers. While the President \nhas established a ``new'' manufacturing czar at the Department of \nCommerce, this action is seen as lateral movement and does nothing to \nassist those manufacturers that are suffering the most, the Nation's \nsmall business manufacturers.\n\n  Once established, the National Office for the Development of Small \nManufacturers will be responsible for implementing a Manufacturing \nCorps through block grants to each State that will address the skilled \nworker crisis in this country by promoting technical education \npertinent to the manufacturing sector. First, the Manufacturing Corps \nwould help current manufacturing workers improve their\n\n[[Page S15070]]\n\nskill set and advance their technical abilities. Each State's grant \nwould ultimately provide small manufacturers with more highly skilled \nworkers--something that the industry has posed as a global competitive \ndisadvantage--and allow the unemployed and those in declining \nindustries to make the pivotal move back to work or to other \nmanufacturing sectors, respectively.\n  Second, the Manufacturing Corps would help small manufacturers fill \ntheir skilled labor needs by encouraging college and university \nstudents studying engineering, computers, and other high-tech fields to \nwork in the small manufacturing sector by offering to repay a portion \nof their student loans if they do so for a specified period of time. \nSimilar to incentives for students going into the nonprofit or \ngovernment work, the government would repay the loans of those who \ncommit to working for a small manufacturer for 4 years following \ngraduation if their annual employment compensation does not exceed \n$60,000.\n  Third, the Manufacturing Corps would establish a vocational and \ntechnology training for students at the high school level to prepare \nstudents who are not planning to attend college directly after \ngraduation to enter the manufacturing sector. As in woodshop or auto \nshop courses, high school students will learn the technical skills to \nbecome effective, skilled manufacturing employees, such as machinists \nor metal workers. Additionally, schools providing such assistance would \npartner with community manufacturers to address their skilled worker \nneeds and to provide employment opportunities for students after \ngraduation.\n  Another duty charged to the National Office for the Development of \nSmall Manufacturers is to create a government-wide ``One Stop Small \nManufacturing Shop'' for small manufacturers. This online web portal \nwill serve as the single point of contact for information on \nentrepreneurial development assistance, access to capital, specific \noutreach programs, contracting opportunities, and R projects. We \nalready have successful programs that can be used as a prototype for \nthe web page such as the National Industrial Manufacturing Assistance \nProgram's Web site at the Office of Industrial Technologies at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  The greatest challenge to small businesses, as with all businesses, \nis the ability to obtain contracts. The BusinessLINC program within the \nSBA has been proven, since its inception, to successfully match small \nbusinesses with potential clients. The teaming model has created \nthousands of jobs and millions of dollars in contracts. The \nBusinessLINC-M program will also team small businesses with non-\ngovernmental organizations that can have a direct impact on their \nbottom-line through contracting or mentoring. There is a great \npotential for the BusinessLINC-M program to match suppliers with \ndistributors, offer contracting and subcontracting opportunities, which \ndirectly benefits the local economy while allowing access to vendors in \nthe distributors' backyards. The National Office for the Development of \nSmall Manufacturers will create a similar program to foster symbiotic \npartnerships between small and large businesses to spur contracting \nopportunities. This BusinessLINC-M program would instead match up small \nmanufacturers with larger firms that could utilize their products, \ncreating subcontracting opportunities and a stronger supply chain.\n\n  Finally, the National Office for the Development of Small \nManufacturers will develop a manufacturing mentor-protege program to \nfocus on improving the management practices, domestic and foreign \nmarketing abilities, efficiency, and product development of small \nmanufacturers by pairing them with larger, more experienced \nmanufacturers that would provide such guidance.\n  One of the first things we can do to help small manufacturers is to \ntailor the SBA's loan and venture capital programs so that they offer \nsmall manufacturers affordable, long-term financing in amounts that are \ntruly appropriate for them. This legislation will assist small \nbusinesses with fixed-asset costs, working capital, loan dollars to \nhelp them export what they have produced in the United States, and \nventure capital investments to spur expansion and growth.\n  To provide that capital, we have increased the loan amounts available \nto small manufacturers, increased venture leverage, and allowed \nrefinancing of certain existing business debt. The maximum 504 loan, \nfor equipment and property, will be raised from $1 million to $4 \nmillion, the maximum microloan will be raised from $35,000 to $50,000, \nand the gross loan amount for 7(a) working capital loans will increase \nfrom $1 million to $4 million for small manufacturers.\n  Investors should be encouraged to devote more of their money to the \nfastest growing small manufacturers. The SBIC program can provide that \nventure capital money. Under this bill, if SBICs invest 50 percent in \nsmall manufacturers, then a single fund can leverage $150 million \ninstead of $115 million and a manager with several SBICs can leverage \n$185 million from the SBA. The legislation also restores and increases \nfunding to establish additional New Markets Venture Capital firms and \nincreases the SBA's leverage against private funds raised in the New \nMarkets Venture Capital program from 150 percent to 200 percent so \nthese venture capital firms can invest more in small manufacturers.\n  For growing small businesses using the loans from the 504 program to \nbuy new equipment or buildings, we raise the limit for lenders so that \nthey must create or retain one job for every $100,000 loaned to \nmanufacturers. This is in place of the $35,000 that is currently in \nplace. For non-manufacturers, it will be raised to $50,000. For \nmanufacturers, the costs of retaining jobs are higher, and we want \nthese jobs to be good living wages and not the $3 per hour or lower \nthat exists in some countries.\n  After a natural disaster, the already slumping manufacturing industry \nfaces an even greater challenge in returning business to normal and \naffording the costs of repair. Recognizing that they face these \nproblems, the MADE in America Act changes several provisions to the \nSBA's disaster loan program. It increases the maximum loan size from \n$1.5 million to $5 million; allows small manufacturers to consolidate \ndebt by refinancing not just existing disaster loans but any \noutstanding business loan; waives the principal and interest payments \nfor 6 months; authorizes the administration to waive unreasonable size \nlimitations; and prohibits the SBA from selling all disaster loans to \nother creditors. Disaster loans, at the most, have an interest rate of \n4 percent and terms of up to 30 years. This low rate and long term \nkeeps manufacturers' payments down as well as their debt, particularly \nwhen they refinance their more expensive business loans.\n\n  To help small manufacturers and small R firms, we need to reduce \ntrade barriers, so that they are able to sell their products and \ntechnologies in other countries. Small-business owners commonly cited \nthe expense required to secure foreign patent protection as a \nsignificant barrier to their ability to operate in international \nmarkets. Part of encouraging the spread of their innovations into other \ncountries is decreasing their vulnerability to big foreign corporations \nthat can take their ideas when they try to sell their products around \nthe world. Our small businesses need patent protection. However, the \ncosts associated with filing such patents are often prohibitively \nexpensive.\n  For example, Mr. Clifford Hoyt, who is vice president and chief \ntechnology officer of Cambridge Research and Instrumentation, testified \non June 21, 2001, as part of the Committee's hearing on reauthorization \nof the STTR program that cost of ``patent protection in Europe is \n$20,000.'' Information from the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation's meeting shows that the costs of foreign patents range \nfrom $7,200 in Canada to $27,200 in Japan. Those costs include fees for \nfiling, examination, translation and attorneys.\n  With this legislation, to address the intellectual property problem \nfor small exporters, I propose enacting a variation of a bill I \nintroduced 2 years ago. The MADE in America Act would establish a self-\nsustaining grant fund to help small manufacturers and R firms pay for \nthe cost associated with foreign patent protection. Each company would \nbe limited to one grant and, in order to be eligible for the\n\n[[Page S15071]]\n\ngrant, it must have already filed for patent protection in the United \nStates. Both of these provisions are designed to ensure, to the extent \npossible, that companies apply for assistance for their most promising \ntechnology and therefore are in the best position to return money to \nthe grant fund when their patented technology becomes profitable. By \ngiving the companies only one shot at a grant to protect and make money \nfrom their technologies, it forces them to select the one most likely \nto succeed and have sales. At the same time, requiring companies to \nhave already filed for patent protection in the United States prior to \nseeking a foreign patent grant is a gauge of the company's confidence \nin the commercial potential of its technology.\n  Ultimately, the goal is to create a self-sustaining grant fund. To do \nso, in return for the grants, each recipient would be obligated to pay \n5 percent of its related export sales or licensing fees to the fund, to \nbe known as the ``Small Business Foreign Patent Protection Grant \nFund.'' To maintain a reasonable incentive for the small businesses, \nthe total amount recipients would be required to pay would be capped at \nfour times the amount of the grant, which for a $25,000 grant would be \n$100,000.\n  When I first introduced this bill a couple of years ago, the grants \nwere limited to companies that participate in the SBA's SBIR and STTR \nprograms. However, this bill opens the grant funding to all small \nfirms, while reserving 50 percent of the money for SBIR and STTR firms \nthrough the first three quarters to each year. Intellectual property \nprotection is critical to these small firms that have a great product \nor invention, and keeping these innovations in the hands of American \nfirms is important to the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, today I am also introducing the Enhance Domestic \nManufacturing and Worker Assistance Act. America's manufacturing \ndecline and the associated loss of good, stable manufacturing jobs has \nbeen marked by a relocation of factories abroad along with reduced \nexports and increased imports of manufactured goods. This legislation \nwill respond to the manufacturing crisis in two ways. The proposal \nrecognizes the harmful impact that trade has on small manufacturers and \nprovides assistance to those workers, companies and communities that \nhave suffered through Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. The \nproposal also provides critical assistance to U.S. domestic \nmanufacturers to ensure that they adjust to the global economy and \nremain competitive in the 21st century.\n\n  First of all, for those workers, businesses and communities that have \nbeen harmed by trade, my bill assists them by reauthorizing our Trade \nAdjustment Assistance programs for workers and business firms. The bill \nincludes elements of an innovative program to assist similarly situated \ncommunities. Recognizing that entire communities experience economic \ndisplacement, this proposal will assist harmed communities in exploring \nnew avenues of economic development and job creation. Combined, these \nprograms will assist hundreds of mostly small- and medium-sized \nmanufacturing and agricultural companies that experience loss of jobs \nand sales due to import competition and other adverse consequences of \ntrade. For example, TAA for workers provides income support, job search \nand worker relation assistance for affected workers.\n  Next, my legislation will enhance two programs that have proven \neffective in assisting domestic manufacturing firms. For example, the \nbill will strengthen the very effective Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership program. This program assists struggling small- and medium-\nsize manufacturers to modernize, increase productivity, cut waste, \nachieve higher profits, and compete in the demanding global market. \nWith increased funding, the MEP program can expand its program reach \nand decrease the fees paid by small manufacturers to access the \nassistance. It is exactly this type of program that will make American \nmanufacturers competitive again, allowing them to maintain existing \njobs and create additional high-skilled and high-paying jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  In addition, my legislation increases funding for the Advanced \nTechnology Partnership program. This very important program fosters \npublic-private partnerships to accelerate the development of innovative \ntechnologies and bridges the gap between the research lab and the \nmarket place. The program has been very effective in accelerating the \ndevelopment of innovative technologies that promise significant \ncommercial payoffs and widespread benefits for the Nation. \nUnfortunately, the Bush administration has sought to eliminate this \nprogram, at a time when technological change is faster than ever before \nand small manufacturers must be technologically competitive.\n  Strengthening the MEP and ATP programs will go a long way in \nassisting small domestic manufacturers as they attempt to regain market \nshare lost to international competition and recover from the resulting \ndevastating job losses.\n  Finally, this bill will also create an ``Office of Small Business'' \nwithin the Office of the United States Trade Representative that will \nfocus on the issues affecting small- and medium-size manufacturers as \nthey relate to our international trade policy. This proposal is very \nsimilar to a proposal that I offered with Senator Olympia Snowe in the \n107th Congress. Small manufacturers are directly impacted by our trade \npolicies--often adversely--yet they do not have a seat at the table and \nlack the ability to effectively express their concerns. The \nestablishment of this office will ensure that issues important to small \nmanufacturers are taken into consideration as our Nation's trade policy \nis carried out in the future and will assist small businesses in export \npromotion and trade compliance.\n\n  The final piece of my legislation plan to enhance U.S. manufacturing \nis my bill titled the ``Manufacturing Job Production Act.'' The bill \nhas four components, all of which are fiscally responsible. None of \nthem will by themselves completely make up for the jobs lost during \nthis administration, but they will each do their part in stimulating \nnew job creation and new investment in manufacturing firms.\n  The first component of my plan is a Temporary Manufacturing Job \nCreation Tax Credit. It is a similar proposal to one I introduced \nearlier this year, when we were debating the President's third major \ntax cut in 3 years. My idea is straightforward: Any domestic \nmanufacturer would receive an income tax credit based on a percentage \nof the net increase in taxable Social Security payroll linked to new \nmanufacturing/production jobs, comparing total applicable payroll for \none year to the previous year, adjusted for inflation. The credit would \napply only to domestic production/manufacturing jobs created in 2004 \nand 2005, and it would include jobs created in U.S. territories, and \nthose created by foreign-owned companies in the United States or its \nterritories.\n  Unlike many of the administration's tax cuts, which carry huge costs \nat the vague promise of a positive economic result, my idea is outcome-\nbased because it only costs money if it actually works. Plus, it has a \nbuilt-in safety valve to prevent abuse, because it prevents firms from \nreceiving tax credits if they create new manufacturing jobs while \nsimultaneously laying off other workers, and it stops companies from \ntilting the benefits to high-salary workers because these salaries are \nalready above the Social Security payroll tax cap. By comparing payroll \ntaxes paid over a whole year, it also provides an incentive for firms \nto hire new workers and keep them on payroll and makes the calculation \nsimple for businesses. It also provides an employment stimulus for U.S. \ncompanies with subsidiaries or manufacturing facilities on U.S. \npossessions, such as Puerto Rico.\n  My proposal would be in place for 2 years, and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates that it would cost less than $4 billion. Surely we \ncould pass this proposal and offset its modest cost by finally closing \nsome of the Enron tax loopholes or passing the corporate inversion \nproposals that have previously passed this body unanimously, only to be \nopposed by the House. I think the percentage of Americans that would \nsupport that tradeoff would be upwards of 80 percent. Paying for this \nproposal by closing tax loopholes for wealthy corporation makes perfect \nsense. It will help our economy grow and help slow the flow of \nmanufacturing jobs overseas.\n\n[[Page S15072]]\n\n  The second element of may plan expands upon a capital gains provision \nthat I have included in other legislation. Section 4 of S. 842, my \nsmall business tax stimulus bill, provides that there shall be no \ncapital gains tax applied to new equity investments in small businesses \nwith gross sales under $100 million, if the investments are held for at \nleast 4 years. The zero capital gains tax applies to businesses \ninvolved in certain ``critical technologies'' as well as specialized \nSmall Business Investment Companies, or SSBICs. For the Manufacturing \nJob Production Act, this capital gains proposal is expanded to include \nnew equity investments in small manufacturing firms. Such a proposal \nshould generate new investments in manufacturing, particularly small \nmanufacturing companies that have been so damaged by recent economic \ntrends. And like the job creation credit, it only costs significant \nmoney if it has the desired effect. That factor alone makes it far \npreferable to the Republican ``throw it and see if it sticks'' tax cut \nstrategy.\n\n  The third part of my manufacturing plan is a revised BRIDGE Act, \ndesigned to give a little extra boost to small manufacturers. The \nBRIDGE Act stands for Business Retained Income During Growth and \nExpansion. It will help ensure that rapidly expanding, entrepreneurial \nbusinesses have access to the capital they need to continue creating \njobs and stimulating the economy.\n  Each year, the United States economy generates 600,000 to 800,000 new \nbusinesses. Most new business start small and stay small--but some \nevolve into fast-growth companies with the capacity to propel the \neconomy forward. These fast-growing companies create the most new jobs, \nyet access to financing--particularly in the current economic \nenvironment, but also when the economy is strong--presents a pivotal \nchallenge to them. A typical startup may open its doors with a \ncombination of personal savings, credit card borrowing, and family \nlending. Once a business has grown past a certain size--say, when sales \nreach $10 million or more--the company is better able to attract \nexternal financing at a reasonable cost. However, there are many \ncompanies in a middle range, including many small manufacturers, which \ndesperately need additional financing in the range of $250,000 to $1 \nmillion. These companies face a severe credit crunch that limits their \ngrowth and the number of new jobs they can create.\n  I believe that if congress does anything to assist small \nmanufacturers, it should take steps to ease the credit crunch for those \nclimbing the economic ladder from small- to medium-size enterprise, \nthereby generating new ones. The BRIDGE Act addresses this financing \ngap. As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have been the leading voice for this idea in the \nSenate, and it is something worth trying. Like my other proposals for \ntax relief for small manufacturers, it only generates cost to taxpayers \nif it actually works.\n  The BRIDGE Act is simple. It would allow a fast-growing business with \nless than $10 million in sales to temporarily defer up to $250,000 of \nits Federal income tax liability, but only if the money is reinvested \nin the company. The 2-year deferral would be repayable wit interest \nover a 4-year period. For small manufacturers, the maximum tax deferral \nwould be $400,000, and the payback period would be extended to a \nmaximum of 6 years. Thus, the act will free up new investment capital \nfor growing companies by allowing them to use a portion of their \nFederal tax liability for self-financing. Its revenue cost is minimal--\nin fact, if the program is implemented temporarily, as in my bill, it \nactually raises a small amount in the 10-year budget window--since the \ndeferred taxes are paid back with interest.\n  The fourth and final component of my tax relief plan for small \nmanufacturers is to make permanent the increase in Section 179 small \nbusiness expensing that was passed earlier this year as part of the \nPresident's third tax cut. However, this increase is set to expire at \nthe end of 2005. While the recent increase does not help the smallest \nof small businesses, it can be helpful to small manufacturers who \npurchase more expensive equipment. It is one element of the various \nBush tax cuts that deserves to be made permanent. My proposal would \npermanently increase the annual expensing limit to $100,000.\n  Mr. President, we may not have all the answers here in the Congress. \nSome of these trends in manufacturing employment have taken a long time \nto develop, and we won't be able to turn them around overnight. But at \nleast we shouldn't ignore the changes and act as if more tax cuts will \nsolve the problem. My manufacturing tax plan contains four reasonable, \nresponsible components--and most will cost money only if they are \nactually effective. It's time for this administration to get its head \nout of the sand and start proposing job-creating strategies that will \nactually work.\n  Mr. President, nearly 3 million Americans, all across this Nation, \nhave lost their jobs since 2000. We need to act now, with a \ncomprehensive strategy that not only incorporates tax cuts but also \nincludes real job training, business development, capital access, and \nlevels the playing field for U.S. manufacturers. I believe this \nlegislation addresses many of the concerns of the small business \ncommunity and will take a significant step towards reversing the \ncurrent trend of economic decline and job loss in the manufacturing \nsector.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the MADE in America Act, the \nEnhance Domestic Manufacturing and Worker Assistance Act, and the \nManufacturing Jobs Production Act be printed in the Record, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to support these bills.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to half Saudi support for institutions that fund, \ntrain, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism, \nand to secure full Saudi cooperation in the investigation of terrorist \nincidents; to the committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill and a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2003\n\n       Cosponsors: Schumer, Lindsey Graham, Wyden, Collins, Bob \n     Graham, Bayh.\n\n\n                                Content\n\n       Sanctions. Unless the President makes a certification that \n     Saudi Arabia is making a\n\n[[Page S15080]]\n\n     maximum effort to fight terrorism (details below), he shall \n     take the following actions:\n       Prohibit export to Saudi Arabia of any defense articles or \n     services listed on the Arms Export Control Act. Prohibit \n     export to Saudi Arabia of any items listed on the Commerce \n     Control List (these are materials that have both economic and \n     military uses). Restrict travel of Saudi diplomats to a 25-\n     radius of the city in which their offices are located (would \n     apply to the Saudi Embassy in DC, the Saudi UN mission in New \n     York, and the Saudi Consulates in Houston and Los Angeles).\n       Presidential Certification. The President is not required \n     to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia if he certifies that \n     Saudi Arabia is:\n       Fully cooperating with the United States in investigating \n     and preventing terrorist attacks; Has permanently closed all \n     Saudi-based terror organizations; Has ended any funding or \n     other support by the Government of Saudi Arabia for any \n     offshore terror organizations.\n       Presidential Waiver. Even it he has not made the \n     certification, the President may waive the application of the \n     sanctions if he determines that it is in the national \n     security interest of the United States to do so.\n\n\n                              Definitions\n\n       Offshore Terror Organizations are defined as ``charities, \n     schools, and any other organization or institution outside of \n     Saudi Arabia that train, incite, encourage, or in any other \n     way aid and abet terrorism anywhere in the world.'' Thus a \n     religious school or madrassah that incites its students to \n     terror would be defined as a terrorist organization for \n     purposes of this bill.\n       Saudi-Based Terror Organizations are the same types of \n     organizations located within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n                                S. 1888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia Accountability \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) \n     mandates that all states ``refrain from providing any form of \n     support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved \n     in terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary steps to prevent \n     the commission of terrorist acts'', and ``deny safe haven to \n     those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts''.\n       (2) The Council on Foreign Relations concluded in an \n     October 2002 report on terrorist financing that ``[f]or \n     years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have \n     been the most important source of funds for al-Qaeda, and for \n     years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this \n     problem''.\n       (3) The Middle East Media Research Institute concluded in a \n     July 3, 2003, report on Saudi support for Palestinian \n     terrorists that ``for decades, the royal family of the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been the main financial supporter \n     of Palestinian groups fighting Israel''. The report notes \n     specifically that Saudi-sponsored organizations have funneled \n     over $4,000,000,000 to finance the Palestinian intifada that \n     began in September 2000.\n       (4) Much of this Saudi money has been directed to Hamas and \n     to the families of suicide bombers, directly funding and \n     rewarding suicide bombers. In December 2000, former \n     Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas wrote to the Saudis \n     to complain about their support for Hamas.\n       (5) The New York Times, citing United States and Israeli \n     sources, reported on September 17, 2003, that at least 50 \n     percent of the current operating budget of Hamas comes from \n     ``people in Saudi Arabia''.\n       (6) Many Saudi-funded religious institutions and the \n     literature they distribute teach a message of hate and \n     intolerance that provides an ideological basis for anti-\n     Western terrorism. The effects of these teachings are \n     evidenced by the fact that Osama bin Laden himself and 15 of \n     the 19 September 11th hijackers were Saudi citizens.\n       (7) After the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing \n     complex at Dahran, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 United \n     States Air Force personnel and wounded approximately 400 \n     people, the Government of Saudi Arabia refused to allow \n     United States officials to question individuals held in \n     detention by the Saudis in connection with the attack.\n       (8) During an October 2002 hearing on financing of \n     terrorism before the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate, the Undersecretary for Enforcement of the Department \n     of the Treasury testified that the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     had taken only ``baby steps'' toward stemming the financing \n     of terrorist activities.\n       (9) During a July 2003 hearing on terrorism before the \n     Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security \n     of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, David \n     Aufhauser, General Counsel of the Treasury Department, stated \n     that Saudi Arabia is, in many cases, the ``epicenter'' of \n     financing for terrorism.\n       (10) A joint committee of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives issued a \n     report on July 24, 2003, that quotes various United States \n     Government personnel who complained that the Saudis refused \n     to cooperate in the investigation of Osama bin Laden and his \n     network both before and after the September 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attacks.\n       (11) There are indications that, since the May 12, 2003, \n     suicide bombings in Riyadh, the Government of Saudi Arabia is \n     making a more serious effort to combat terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is imperative that the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     immediately and unconditionally--\n       (A) provide complete, unrestricted, and unobstructed \n     cooperation to the United States, including the unsolicited \n     sharing of relevant intelligence in a consistent and timely \n     fashion, in the investigation of groups and individuals that \n     are suspected of financing, supporting, plotting, or \n     committing an act of terror against United States citizens \n     anywhere in the world, including within the Kingdom of Saudi \n     Arabia;\n       (B) permanently close all charities, schools, or other \n     organizations or institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \n     that fund, train, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid \n     and abet terrorism anywhere in the world (hereafter in this \n     Act referred to as ``Saudi-based terror organizations''), \n     including by means of providing support for the families of \n     individuals who have committed acts of terrorism;\n       (C) end funding or other support by the Government of Saudi \n     Arabia for charities, schools, and any other organizations or \n     institutions outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that train, \n     incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism \n     anywhere in the world (hereafter in this Act referred to as \n     ``offshore terror organizations''), including by means of \n     providing support for the families of individuals who have \n     committed acts of terrorism; and\n       (D) block all funding from private Saudi citizens and \n     entities to any Saudi-based terror organization or offshore \n     terrorism organization; and\n       (2) the President, in deciding whether to make the \n     certification under section 4, should judge whether the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia has continued and sufficiently \n     expanded the efforts to combat terrorism that it redoubled \n     after the May 12, 2003, bombing in Riyadh.\n\n     SEC. 4. SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Restrictions on Exports and Diplomatic Travel.--Unless \n     the President makes the certification described in subsection \n     (c), the President shall take the following actions:\n       (1) Prohibit the export to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and \n     prohibit the issuance of a license for the export to the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, of--\n       (A) any defense articles or defense services on the United \n     States Munitions List under section 38 of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) for which special export \n     controls are warranted under such Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et \n     seq.); and\n       (B) any item identified on the Commerce Control List \n     maintained under part 774 of title 15, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (2) Restrict travel of Saudi diplomats assigned to \n     Washington, District of Columbia, New York, New York, the \n     Saudi Consulate General in Houston, or the Saudi Consulate in \n     Los Angeles to a 25-mile radius of Washington, District of \n     Columbia, New York, New York, the Saudi Consulate General in \n     Houston, or the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles, respectively.\n       (b) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     subsection (a) if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national security interest \n     of the United States to do so; and\n       (2) submits to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report that contains the reasons for such determination.\n       (c) Certification.--The President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a certification of any \n     determination made by the President after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act that the Government of Saudi Arabia--\n       (1) is fully cooperating with the United States in \n     investigating and preventing terrorist attacks;\n       (2) has permanently closed all Saudi-based terror \n     organizations;\n       (3) has ended any funding or other support by the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia for any offshore terror \n     organization; and\n       (4) has exercised maximum efforts to block all funding from \n     private Saudi citizens and entities to offshore terrorist \n     organizations.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Report.--Not later than 6 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 12 months \n     thereafter until the President makes the certification \n     described in section 4(c), the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on the progress made by the Government of Saudi Arabia toward \n     meeting the conditions described in paragraphs (1) through \n     (4) of section 4(c).\n       (b) Form.--The report submitted under subsection (a) shall \n     be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Res. 267\n\n       Whereas 2004 is the 50th anniversary of the successful \n     nationwide trial of the injectable killed polio vaccine that \n     included ``polio pioneer'' children;\n       Whereas the injectable polio vaccines eliminated naturally \n     occurring polio cases in the United States but have not yet \n     eliminated polio in other parts of the world;\n       Whereas as few as 57 percent of American children receive \n     all doses of necessary vaccines during childhood, including \n     the polio vaccine;\n       Whereas the success of the polio vaccines has caused people \n     to forget the 1,630,000 Americans born before the development \n     of the vaccines who had polio during the epidemics in the \n     middle of the 20th century;\n       Whereas at least 70 percent of paralytic polio survivors, \n     and 40 percent of nonparalytic polio survivors, are \n     developing post-polio sequelae, which are unexpected and \n     often disabling symptoms that occur up to 35 years after the \n     poliovirus attack, including overwhelming fatigue, muscle \n     weakness, muscle and joint pain, sleep disorders, heightened \n     sensitivity to anesthesia, cold pain, and difficulty \n     swallowing and breathing;\n       Whereas 2004 is the 130th anniversary of the diagnosis of \n     the first case of post-polio sequelae and the 20th \n     anniversary of the creation of the International Post-Polio \n     Task Force;\n       Whereas research and clinical work by members of the \n     International Post-Polio Task Force have discovered that \n     post-polio sequelae can be treated, and even prevented, if \n     polio survivors are taught to conserve energy and use \n     assistive devices to stop damaging and killing the reduced \n     number of overworked, polio virus-damaged neurons in the \n     spinal cord and brain that survived the polio attack;\n       Whereas many medical professionals, and polio survivors, do \n     not know of the existence of post-polio sequelae, or of the \n     available treatments; and\n       Whereas the mission of the International Post-Polio Task \n     Force includes educating medical professionals and the \n     20,000,000 polio survivors in the world about post-polio \n     sequelae through the international post-polio letter \n     campaign, television public service announcements provided by \n     the Columbia Broadcasting System and the National \n     Broadcasting System Company, and a continuing plot about \n     polio and post-polio sequelae on the National Broadcasting \n     Company television series ``American Dreams'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need for every American child to be \n     vaccinated against polio;\n       (2) recognizes the 1,630,000 Americans who survived polio, \n     their new battle with post-polio sequelae, and the need for \n     education and appropriate medical care;\n       (3) requests that every State proclaim 2004 as ``The Year \n     of Polio Awareness'' to promote vaccination and post-polio \n     sequelae education and treatment; and\n       (4) requests that the President convene a White House Polio \n     Awareness Summit, with members of the International Post-\n     Polio Task Force and all appropriate departments and \n     agencies, to take immediate action to educate--\n       (A) the people of the United States about the need for \n     polio vaccination; and\n       (B) the polio survivors and the medical professionals in \n     the United States about the cause and treatment of post-polio \n     sequelae.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now turn to another subject; that is, a \nresolution to designate the year 2004 as the Year of Polio Awareness.\n  During the 1940s and the early 1950s, between 30,000 and 50,000 cases \nof polio were recorded annually in the United States, causing \nwidespread fear and panic.\n  I recall as a youngster a public swimming pool in Wichita, KS, in \nwhich there was a total scare, wondering if going to the swimming pool \nwould cause polio.\n  The polio virus damages nerves that control muscles which results in \nmuscle weakness. In severe illness, the person could lose the ability \nto move both arms and legs, may be unable to breathe without help and \nthey may die.\n  Of course, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the personal \nsymbol for the incapacitation of someone with polio, although it was \nonly physical. He was a magnificent President and a great leader of the \nUnited States during the Depression and World War II. A great physical \ntoll was taken on President Roosevelt.\n  The year 2004 will mark the 50th anniversary of the successful \nnationwide trial to administer the injectable polio vaccine to \nchildren. The invention of injectable polio vaccines eliminated \nnaturally occurring polio cases in the United States.\n  However, as few as 57 percent of American children currently receive \nthe full dose of vaccines, including the polio vaccination. The need \nfor continued diligence to protect this country's youth from polio is \ncritical. Unfortunately, those who were stricken with polio before \nvaccines were developed have not received the proper help they need.\n  The year 2004 will also mark the 130th anniversary of the first \ndiagnosed case of post-polio sequelae. Post-polio sequelae is a \ncondition that may develop several decades after a person has had \npolio. It affects the muscles and nerves, causing weakness, fatigue, \npain, and other symptoms.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation to halt Saudi Arabia's support for institutions that fund, \ntrain, incite, encourage, or in any other way aid and abet terrorism, \nand to secure full Saudi cooperation in the investigation of terrorist \nincidents. I offer this bill on behalf of Senator Collins, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator Wyden, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and Senator Bayh.\n  The activities of al-Qaida have shaken the world. They certainly \nshook the United States on September 11, 2001. Evidence has come to \nlight that there has been enormous financing of al-Qaida, Hamas, and \nother organizations by the Saudis.\n  Hearings have been held by a number of committees, including the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee presided over by the distinguished \nSenator who is presiding this evening, Ms. Collins. We made a detailed \nexamination, in a hearing in which I participated along with Chairman \nCollins, to inquire into what the Saudis had done and to find details \nof Saudi backing of so-called charitable organizations, recognizing \nthat those charitable organizations were, in large part, a front; that \nperhaps there was some charitable activity but a tremendous amount of \nfunding went to terrorist activities.\n  The Saudis are a very wealthy nation. They are reported to have \ncontributed as much as $4 billion to Hamas over the course of the \nlatest intifada.\n  We have worked through the Governmental Affairs Committee, and also \nthe Judiciary Committee on which I serve, to establish a basic point \nthat anybody who contributes to an organization knowing it to be a \nterrorist organization is really an accessory before the fact to \nmurder, and that when people contribute to Hamas knowing Hamas engages \nin suicide bombing, they are accessories to murder.\n  The Terrorist Prosecution Act, which I wrote back in 1986, authorizes \nprosecutions in Federal court of anyone who assaults, maims, or murders \nan American citizen anywhere in the world.\n  Many United States citizens have been murdered while visiting in \nIsrael, and I have talked to Attorney General Rubenstein of Israel and \nAttorney General Ashcroft of the United States, trying to work out \narrangements to bring those terrorists to the United States for trial \nwhere we have the potential to impose the death penalty.\n  We have been very lenient with the Saudis, in my judgment, over the \nyears, really out of deference to the importance of Saudi oil. It is \nreally an open scandal that we have not taken action to secure some \nindependence from our reliance on Saudi oil.\n  In 1996, Khobar Towers was the scene of an attack by terrorists. I \nchaired the Intelligence Committee that year, during the 104th \nCongress. I made a trip to Khobar Towers and inspected what went on. A \ncar bomb came very close, there was an enormous blast, and 19 airmen \nwere killed and about 400 injured.\n  In that situation, the Saudis would not allow Federal investigators \nto talk to the suspects. I personally met with Crown Prince Abdullah of \nSaudi Arabia and asked him to allow our investigators--the FBI--to talk \nto those suspects. Crown Prince Abdullah said the United States should \nnot meddle in Saudi internal affairs.\n  It was hardly a Saudi internal affair when 400 airmen were wounded \nand 19 airmen were killed.\n  Notwithstanding the efforts of FBI Director Louis Freeh, who made \nseveral personal trips there, and my efforts in talking to Crown Prince\n\n[[Page S15082]]\n\nAbdullah, they refused to allow the United States to have its \nrepresentatives talk to those suspects.\n  Later indictments were issued. Iran was a named co-conspirator in the \nFederal indictment.\n  While there has not been proof, the background circumstances lend \nsome consideration to the thought that those who were involved in \nKhobar Towers may well have been involved in September 11.\n  We recently passed the Syria Accountability Act. I believe in the \noverall scheme of operations in the Mideast that the Saudis are a much \ngreater threat to U.S. interests, and there ought to be a very firm \napproach as to how we deal with the Saudis.\n  The bill which I am introducing today has detailed recitation of the \nfindings by organizations which have studied the record of the Saudis. \nThe United Nations Security Council resolution mandates that all states \nrefrain from providing any foreign support, active or passive, to \npeople involved in terrorist acts.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations concluded in an October 2002 report \non terrorist finances:\n\n       For years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia \n     have been the most important source of funds for al-Qaida, \n     and, for years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye.\n\n  The Middle East Media Institute concluded in their July 3, 2003, \nreport again characterizing the Saudis' activities as supporting \nterrorists.\n  The New York Times cited sources reported on April 17, 2003, that at \nleast 50 percent of the current operating budget of Hamas comes from \nthe people of Saudi Arabia.\n  This resolution would call on the Government of the United States to \nprohibit the export to Saudi Arabia of any defense articles or services \nlisted in the Arms Exports Control Act and prohibit import to Saudi \nArabia of any items within the Commerce Control List and to restrict \ntravel of Saudi diplomats appropriately.\n  The President's certification would be present to relieve these \nsanctions under specified circumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15082-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 268--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                 DEATHS OF 19 CITIZENS OF ITALY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. McCain, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Santorum, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nChambliss, Mr. Allen, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reed, Mr. Burns, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Leahy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Baucus) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \ncentenary celebration of Ralph Bunche's birth\n  Ralph Bunche was an extraordinary man whose success was a definitive \naccomplishment in the history of America.\n  His grandmother was born into slavery.\n  His father was a barber in a shop for whites only.\n  His mother was a musician.\n  When his mother and father died his grandmother took him to \nCalifornia where her influence and the perspective she gave him on life \nand liberty shaped his future and, to some extent, the history of the \nNation.\n  He was a brilliant man, a musician, debater, athlete, a summa cum \nlaude student and valedictorian. A loving husband to Ruth and father of \nJoan, Jane and Ralph Jr.\n  He went to Harvard, taught at Howard University and earned his \ndoctorate comparing French rule in Togoland and Dahomey.\n  And when the civil rights movement came he spoke out loudly and his \nmessage was clear: ``Segregation and democracy are incompatible,'' he \nsaid. ``Racial prejudice is an unreasoned phenomenon without scientific \nbasis in biology or anthropology.''\n  But Ralph Bunche did not want to be remembered for his race. He \nwanted to be remembered for his accomplishments and his competence, for \nhis dedication to service and his commitment to the recognition of the \nfundamental rights of men and women to live in harmony and peace.\n  He came from a generation of Americans who believed that it was wrong \nto recognize a man for the color of his skin, that we should, instead, \nrecognize men and women for the power of their ideas and the \ncontribution they make to the community.\n\n[[Page S15083]]\n\n  Ralph Bunche did not want to be remembered as the first African \nAmerican who was the first to graduate from University of California at \nLos Angeles as valedictorian or the first to graduate from Harvard with \na Ph.D. in government and international relations, or the first to \nbecome Chief U.N. Mediator.\n  Least of all, the first to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He wished to be \nremembered simply as an American who answered his country's call of \nduty.\n  That is not a shortcoming . . . It is not a slight to any man or \nwoman of color in our society . . . it is, however, a statement of \nhope, the hope I grew up with, that we can one day be a society that \njudges us not for our differences but for our accomplishments and the \nfact that we, as human beings, made a difference.\n  Ralph Bunche was one of those human beings who made a difference and \nleft an extraordinary legacy.\n  By tailoring the language in the 11th and 12th Chapters of the U.N. \nCharter, Bunche made it possible for the United Nations to recognize \nthe peaceful self-determination of those being exploited by \ncolonialism, and through sheer force of will he recovered from an \nassassination attempt which killed 4 of his colleagues to negotiate an \narmistice agreement ending the first Arab-Israeli war.\n  With an eye for the future he presided over the conference which \nfinalized the statues for the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  And in response to an international crisis he established the \nfoundations for the first international peacekeeping operation in \nEgypt.\n  This legacy is manifest in his dedication to the United Nations, and \nto the cause of peace for which we will always remember him.\n  His words were perhaps prophetic when he said: ``If today we speak of \npeace, we also speak of the United Nations, for in this era peace and \nthe United Nations, have become inseparable. If the United Nations \ncannot ensure peace there will be none.\n  ``If war should come it will be only because the United Nations has \nfailed.\n  ``But the United Nations need not fail.\n  ``Surely every man of reason must work and pray to the end that it \nwill not fail.''\n  Those are not popular words today but they are truthful words, a \nheartfelt notion from a man whose life and work centered on a way to \nbring people--all people--together to solve problems.\n  In concluding his Nobel Lecture, he said: ``There will be no security \nin our world, no release from agonizing tension, no genuine progress, \nno enduring peace, until, in Shelley's fine words, reasons voice, loud \nas the voice of nature, shall have waked the nations.' ''\n  Today we honor this visionary man of peace as an accomplished \nscholar, a distinguished diplomat, a tireless campaigner for the civil \nrights of all people in every nation, and as one of the 20th centuries \nforemost figures and a role model for every young man and woman, black \nor white, Christian, Muslim, or Jew.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the life and \nwork of Ralph Bunche by passing this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15083-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15083-S15084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 83--PROMOTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A \n               DEMOCRACY CAUCUS WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 83\n\n       Whereas a survey conducted by Freedom House in 2003, \n     entitled ``Freedom in the World'', found that of the 192 \n     governments of nations of the world, 121 (or 63 percent) of \n     such governments have an electoral democracy form of \n     government;\n       Whereas, the Community of Democracies, an association of \n     democratic nations committed to promoting democratic \n     principles and practices, held its First Ministerial \n     Conference in Warsaw, Poland, in June 2000;\n       Whereas, in a speech at that Conference, Kofi Annan, the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that ``when \n     the United Nations can truly call itself a community of \n     democracies, the [United Nations] Charter's noble ideals of \n     protecting human rights and promoting `social progress in \n     larger freedoms' will have been brought much closer'', that \n     ``democratically governed states rarely if ever make war on \n     one another'', and that ``in this era of intra-state wars, is \n     the fact that democratic governance--by protecting \n     minorities, encouraging pluralism, and upholding the rule of \n     law--can channel internal dissent peacefully, and thus help \n     avert civil wars'';\n       Whereas a report by an Independent Task Force cosponsored \n     by the Council on Foreign Relations and Freedom House in \n     2002, entitled ``Enhancing U.S. Leadership at the United \n     Nations'', concluded that ``the United States is frequently \n     outmaneuvered and outmatched at the [United Nations]'' \n     because the 115 members of the nonaligned movement \n     ``cooperate on substantive and procedural votes, binding the \n     organization's many democratic nations to the objectives and \n     blocking tactics of its remaining tyrannies'';\n       Whereas, at the First Ministerial Conference of the \n     Community of Democracies, the representatives of the \n     participating governments agreed to ``collaborate on \n     democracy-related issues in existing international and \n     regional institutions, forming coalitions and caucuses to \n     support resolutions and other international activities aimed \n     at the promotion of democratic governance''; and\n       Whereas that agreement was reaffirmed at the Second \n     Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in \n     Seoul, Korea, in November 2002: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE DEMOCRACY CAUCUS.\n\n       Participation in the democracy caucus referred to in \n     section 1 should be limited to countries that--\n       (1) are qualified to participate in the Community of \n     Democracies, an association of democratic nations committed \n     to promoting democratic principles and practices; and\n       (2) have demonstrated a commitment--\n       (A) to the core democratic principles and practices set out \n     in the Final Warsaw Declaration of the Community of \n     Democracies, adopted at Warsaw June 27, 2000; and\n       (B) to the democratic principles set forth in--\n       (i) the United Nations Charter;\n       (ii) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and\n       (iii) the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights.\n\n     SEC. 4. ANNUAL MEETING.\n\n       The members of the democracy caucus referred to in section \n     1 should hold a ministerial-level meeting at least once each \n     year to coordinate policies and positions of the caucus.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to support a United Nations \nDemocracy Caucus to address questions that underlie a countless number \nof our foreign policy decisions, particularly in today's climate:\n  How can the United States be more effective in advancing our foreign \npolicy priorities?\n  How can we be more active in collaborating with our allies on issues \nof common concern?\n  How can we be more productive in promoting the values upon which this \nnation was founded and getting our message across to those around the \nworld who look to us for leadership?\n  Three years ago, in Warsaw, Poland, the United States took a step to \naddress these questions when it became one of eight convening countries \nof the ``Community of Democracies,'' a network of representatives of \nover 100 nations that meets every 2 years to promote the advancement of \nglobal democracy and human rights.\n\n[[Page S15084]]\n\n  Two years later, in Seoul, Korea, many of these countries reaffirmed \ntheir commitment to collaborating with one another and agreed to work \ntogether in existing international and regional organizations.\n  Hence, the idea of establishing a ``democracy caucus'' within the \nUnited Nations began to take form.\n  The idea is simply this: democratic nations share common values, and \nshould work together at the United Nations to promote those values.\n  A simple notion that, in my view, makes extraordinary sense.\n  What has happened in the last several years is that support for the \nestablishment of a democracy caucus in the United Nations has begun to \ntake root among foreign policy experts in the United States.\n  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has endorsed the idea, \nas has Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  In addition, it has been endorsed by a broad-based coalition of \norganizations and advocacy groups like Freedom House, Human Rights \nWatch, the American Jewish Committee, the American Bar Association and \nthe Council for Community of Democracies.\n  In recent months, even senior Bush administration officials have \nexpressed interest in the establishment of a democracy caucus--\nrecognizing that the United States would be more effective if we were \nto work together and organize with other like-minded countries.\n  Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, Kim \nHolmes, recently deemed a U.N. democracy caucus as ``an idea whose time \nhas arrived''.\n  Working together with like-minded nations is a logical and practical \nway to conduct foreign policy. We build coalitions in the Senate. We \nbuild coalitions in Congress. And it makes sense to build coalitions in \nthe United Nations, not only for the sake of forging common positions \non issues of mutual concern, but also to provide a counterbalance to \nother coalitions that are well organized in the United Nations, but do \nnot necessarily share our goals.\n  The 115-member nonaligned movement (NAM) is an example. Last year, an \nIndependent Task Force co-sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations \nand Freedom House argued that ``the United States is frequently \noutmaneuvered and outmatched at the UN'' because the cooperative work \nof the NAM ``binds the organization's many democratic nations to the \nobjectives and blocking tactics of its remaining tyrannies.''\n  A democracy caucus would give us a new and potentially effective tool \nwithin the United Nations to counter coalitions that act in a manner \ninimical to our interests.\n  So today I am submitting a resolution promoting the establishment of \na democracy caucus within the United Nations.\n  The resolution is straightforward: it expresses the support of this \nCongress for a U.N. democracy caucus and outlines the vision that I, \nand others, have of what such a caucus would do, and how it would go \nabout doing it.\n  The general idea is that a democracy caucus would convene at the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and other U.N. \nbodies on a regular basis.\n  Members of the democracy caucus would work together to forge common \npositions to bolster democracy and democratic principles, advance human \nrights, and fight terrorism.\n  Furthermore, this bill also talks about who will join a democracy \ncaucus.\n  We need to establish a criteria for which countries would be \nconsidered democracies, and which would not. Fortunately, we are not \nstarting from scratch.\n  The Community of Democracies forum has established such criteria by \ndrawing on major principles of international law and international \nstandards set forth in the U.N. Charter, the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights.\n  Drawing up this criteria was a collaborative process during the First \nMinisterial of the community of Democracies, and the guidelines have \nbeen effective in laying the foundation and advancing the goals of the \nforum.\n  Therefore, this legislation models the U.N. democracy caucus' \neligibility criteria on that already established by and for the \nCommunity of Democracies.\n  I envision that the U.N. democracy caucus would advocate that states \nthat are deemed to be gross violators of human rights, sponsors of \nterrorist activities, or subjects of United Nations sanctions, not be \nelected to leadership positions in the United Nations General Assembly \nor other United Nations bodies.\n  This issue has received, and deservedly so, much attention this \nyear--particularly after Libya was elected to serve as chair of the \nCommission of Human Rights.\n  In my view, the credibility of U.N. institutions is undermined when \nthe members of its bodies--and particularly those in leadership \npositions--fall into this camp of bad actors.\n  According to the Freedom House 2003 survey, of the world's 192 \ngovernments, 63 percent of them have an electoral democracy form of \ngovernment.\n  Furthermore, in the 2002 meeting of the Community of Democracies in \nSeoul, 118 nations were invited to participate, based upon their \ncommitment to shred democratic values.\n  These numbers tell us that a democracy caucus within the U.N. would \nhave a strong base from which to begin its work; it could be robust \nfrom its inauguration.\n  At the First Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies \nin Warsaw, Poland, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said, ``When the \nUnited Nations can truly call itself a community of democracies, the \ncharter's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting `social \nprogress in larger freedoms' will have been brought much closer.''\n  In that spirit, I submit a resolution in support of the establishment \nof a U.N. democracy caucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15084-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2199.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2754, the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The text of the Conference Report is printed in the proceedings of \nthe House in the Record of November 7, 2003.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I bring to the floor the Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations conference report for fiscal year \n2004, approved by the conference committee last week.\n  My ranking member, Senator Reid, and I have worked very hard this \nyear to put together a fair conference report under extremely difficult \ncircumstances.\n  For fiscal year 2004, the allocation to the conference committee was \n$27.3 billion, an amount that is only $381.8 million over the \nPresident's request. This situation posed a daunting challenge to the \nconference, both in terms of funding and philosophy.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the President's request dramatically \ncut water projects well below the current year level. In fact, the \nPresident's request was $530 million below the current year level for \nwater projects, and we received an increased allocation smaller than \nwhat we considered the total need of our conference report.\n  Thus, the increased allocation, along with other funding adjustments, \nwas\n\n[[Page S15089]]\n\nspread generally as follows: An additional $377 million to corps water \nprojects; an additional $70 million to Bureau of Reclamation water \nprojects; an additional $70 million to the independent regional \ncommissions, which were badly cut in the request, like the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, Denali Regional Commission, and Delta Regional \nCommission; and we held the Department of Energy at basically the \nPresident's request level with adjustments to areas where the \nconference felt the program growth was too rapid, relative to other \nagencies under our jurisdiction.\n  I believe, and I think Senator Reid would agree with me, that this \nwas the fairest way to distribute the very limited resources available \nto the Committee.\n  I will now highlight a few of the key areas of the conference report.\n  The conference report provides $4.57 billion for the Army Corps of \nEngineers, that is $377 million above the President's request, but $120 \nmillion below the current year level. We have included limited new \nconstruction projects and have focused our resources on restoring the \ncuts to existing construction projects.\n  For the Bureau of Reclamation and related activities, the conference \nreport provides $990 million, which is $70 million above the \nPresident's request, and $15 million above the current year level.\n  For nuclear weapons activities of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, the conference report provides $6.27 billion, \nwhich is $105 million over the President's request, and $360 million \nover the current year level. The budget increases are consistent with a \nmajor Defense Department initiative to restore our nuclear weapons \ncomplex.\n  For nuclear non proliferation activities, the conference report \nprovides $1.37 billion, which is the same as the President's request \nand $12 million above the current year level. The conference continues \nits leadership role on countering nuclear terrorism. This budget \nrequest, coupled with the $148 million added in last year's \nsupplemental, gives a strong boost to these highly important programs.\n  For environmental clean-up of Department of Energy sites, the \nconference report provides $7.6 billion, which is $62 million below the \nPresident's request and $238 million above the current year level. For \nthe first time in many years, the conference was not required to add \nhuge additional amounts to maintain clean-up budgets around the \ncountry.\n  For the Yucca Mountain project, the Senate conference report provides \n$580 million, which is $11 million below the President's request and \nfunding for this project, as many of my colleagues know, it was a major \npoint of contention in the conference with the House. This is a very \nimportant matter to many members of the Senate, each for various \nreasons.\n  For renewable energy R, the conference report provides $460 \nmillion, which is $40 million above the President's request and $40 \nmillion above the current year level. The conference report fully funds \nthe President's new hydrogen technology initiative.\n  For nuclear energy R, the conference report provides $413 million, \nwhich is $136 million above the President's request and $147 million \nover the comparable current year level. The members know that this is a \ngreat priority of mine, as we continue to make investments that I \nbelieve will eventually result in the construction of new commercial \npower reactors in the United States.\n  For basic science research at DOE, the conference report provides \n$3.47 billion, which is $150 million above the President's request and \n$180 million above the current year level.\n  This conference report provides $55 million for the Denali \nCommission, $66 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission, and $5 \nmillion for the Delta Regional Authority, an increase of $3 million \nover the President's request.\n  This conference report also provides a total budget of $619 million \nfor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the same as the budget request \nand an increase of $41 million over the current year level.\n  Given the overall constraints, we worked hard but were unfortunately \nlimited to accommodating only the highest priority requests of Members \nwherever possible. This was a difficult conference, it I can honestly \nsay, it was truly a conference of compromise, one which I can assure my \ncolleagues was hard fought. In the end, I think what emerged was a \nconference report which reflected the priorities of both Houses.\n  Finally, my colleagues should be fully aware that the conference \nreport I filed includes a provision regarding the Middle Rio Grande \nRiver in New Mexico. The provision does two things. First it prohibits \nthe use of outer-basin water for endangered species purposes. Secondly, \nit establishes how the Endangered Species Act will be complied with for \nthis river and the affected fish. This is a very important provision \nthat has the bipartisan support in the New Mexico delegation and at the \nstate level. Let me restate, so there is no confusion, both Governor \nRichardson and Senator Bingaman, my colleague, fully support the \nlanguage on the silvery minnow that's contained in this conference \nreport.\n  I thank my ranking member and good friend, Senator Reid. This was one \nof the toughest conferences he and I have been in together, but through \nit all, I will tell my colleagues that Senator Reid supported me every \nstep of the way, and I thank him for that.\n  Also, I would like to thank his excellent staff, Drew Willison, Roger \nCockrell and Nancy Olkewicz, for all the effort put forth in getting \nthis conference report put together, without their close cooperation, \nthis conference report would not have been possible.\n  I would also like to thank my former staff, Clay Sell, for all the \nwork he did on this bill early in the year until his departure for the \nWhite House. I thank Erin McHale of my staff for all of her hard work.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it takes just a few seconds to do this, but \nthis is the culmination of weeks and weeks of work. I want to spread on \nthe Record the affection I have for the chairman of the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee, Senator Pete Domenici. This has been a very tough \nprocess this year. But for his advocacy in protecting the Senate's \nposition, this bill would not be in the position it is. I, again, want \nthe Record spread with the partnership that he and I have on this \nlegislation. This is legislation that is very good for the country.\n  By and large, I am pleased with the bill that the conferees have \nproduced.\n  As conferees we are tasked with reconciling House and Senate bills \nthat were written with very different visions and very different world \nviews.\n  Reconciling them has not been easy, nor has it been accomplished \nwithout a great deal of pain on both sides.\n  As these things usually are, this final bill is a product of hard \nfought compromise and, often, splitting the difference between \ncompeting views. The result is a bill with much for both sides to like \nand much for both sides to dislike.\n  As Senate conferees, Chairman Domenici and I were faced with trying \nto work out the differences between our bill, a fairly typical Senate \nEnergy and Water bill, and a House bill that was far different than the \nones produced in recent years by the other body.\n  Chairman Hobson placed a far higher priority on Yucca Mountain than \nhis predecessors ever did and he added nearly $175 more than the \nPresident asked for to the project. At the same time, he placed a far \nlower emphasis on activities requested by the President within our \nNation's nuclear weapons complex, cutting nearly $300 million from the \nprogram, including nearly $200 million from the nuclear weapons \nlaboratories in New Mexico. As most of you know, Chairman Domenici has \na passing interest in the health and well-being of those labs.\n  Obviously, none of this was done with any personal malice, but these \nhonest differences of opinion sure made for a lively conference.\n  The final bill contains $27.3 billion in funding for the Department \nof Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, \nand several other important agencies. The final bill exceeds the \nPresident's request by $381 million and the FY 03 total by $1.13 \nbillion.\n  The engine that drives the Energy and Water bill is funding for the \nCorps of Engineers. Each year Chairman\n\n[[Page S15090]]\n\nDomenici and I receive literally thousands of requests for water \nprojects in all fifty States. We work hard to accommodate as many of \nthem as possible each year.\n  I am pleased to report that total funding for the Corps of Engineers \nis nearly $4.6 billion--a total that is $375 million above an utterly \ninsufficient request from the Administration. I wish we were able to do \nmore, but, I feel we were able to keep many very important projects \nmoving forward this year and have been able to begin some new ones.\n  Total funding for the Bureau of Reclamation is set at $986 million, a \ntotal that is $64 million above the President's request and $15 million \nabove the current year. As a Western Senator I had hoped this would be \nthe year that we got the Bureau up to $1 billion, but we came up just \nshort. However, I am very pleased that we are pushing the Bureau's \nbudget in the right direction.\n  The conferees were able to provide total funding of $22 billion for \nthe Department of Energy. The Senate was able to convince the House to \nrestore most of the nearly $300 million in cuts to DOE programs, but we \nare still nearly $120 million below the President's request. We are, \nhowever, $1.2 billion above the current year. The overall increase has \nallowed the conferees to provide solid funding for the Office of \nScience, renewable energy projects, and the very important \nenvironmental management clean-up projects nationwide.\n  As most of you know, Senator Domenici is a fierce defender of two \nnuclear weapons labs in his home State, two institutions that do world \nclass research and have helped to keep our Nation safe and secure for \nover 50 years. The House cut nearly $200 million from the President's \nbudget request for Los Alamos and Sandia, a move that would have had \nvery negative ramifications for our Nation's science-based stockpile \nstewardship program. I am pleased to report that we were able to \nrestore most of these ill-advised cuts. The people of New Mexico are \nvery lucky to have a Senator as skilled and determined as Pete Domenici \nworking for them.\n  Frankly, given the battle we were in with the House this year over \nour bill, I am glad he was also fighting for me and the other 98 \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I am very grateful to Chairman Domenici and his new clerk, Tammy \nPerrin, for being so dogged in their defense of the Senate position on \nso many issues. I have worked with his previous clerks, Alex Flint and \nClay Sell, and have found them both to be outstanding. In Tammy, he has \nfound another terrific clerk.\n  As always, thanks to Drew Willison, Roger Cockrell, and Nancy \nOlkewicz of my subcommittee staff. I appreciate everything they do for \nme and all of the Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the conference \nreport be adopted and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Nanotechnology \n     Research and Development Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \n     (collectively, ``nanotechnology''), in which matter is \n     manipulated at the atomic level (i.e., atom-by- atom or \n     molecule-by-molecule) in order to build materials, machines, \n     and devices with novel properties or functions, are leading \n     to unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities \n     that will benefit society by changing the way many things are \n     designed and made.\n       [(2) Long-term nanoscale research and development leading \n     to potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and \n     manufacturing, electronics, medicine and healthcare, \n     environment, energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, \n     information technology, and national security could be as \n     significant as the combined influences of microelectronics, \n     biotechnology, and information technology on the 20th \n     century. Nanotechnology could lead to things such as--\n       [(A) new generations of electronics where the entire \n     collection of the Library of Congress is stored on devices \n     the size of a sugar cube;\n       [(B) manufacturing that requires less material, pollutes \n     less, and is embedded with sophisticated sensors that will \n     internally detect signs of weakness and automatically respond \n     by releasing chemicals that will prevent damage;\n\n[[Page S15091]]\n\n       [(C) prosthetic and medical implants whose surfaces are \n     molecularly designed to interact with the cells of the body;\n       [(D) materials with an unprecedented combination of \n     strength, toughness, and lightness that will enable land, \n     sea, air, and space vehicles to become lighter and more fuel \n     efficient;\n       [(E) selective membranes that can fish out specific toxic \n     or valuable particles from industrial waste or that can \n     inexpensively desalinate sea water; and\n       [(F) tiny robotic spacecraft that will cost less, consume \n     very little power, adapt to unexpected environments, change \n     its capabilities as needed, and be completely autonomous.\n       [(3) Long-term, high-risk research is necessary to create \n     breakthroughs in technology. Such research requires \n     government funding since the benefits are too distant or \n     uncertain for industry alone to support. Current Federal \n     investments in nanotechnology research and development are \n     not grounded in any specifically authorized statutory \n     foundation. As a result, there is a risk that future funding \n     for long-term, innovative research will be tentative and \n     subject to instability which could threaten to hinder future \n     United States technological and economic growth.\n       [(4) The Federal government can play an important role in \n     the development of nanotechnology, as this science is still \n     in its infancy, and it will take many years of sustained \n     investment for this field to achieve maturity.\n       [(5) Many foreign countries, companies and scientists \n     believe that nanotechnology will be the leading technology of \n     the 21st century and are investing heavily into its research. \n     According to a study of international nanotechnology research \n     efforts sponsored by the National Science and Technology \n     Council, the United States is at risk of falling behind its \n     international competitors, including Japan, South Korea, and \n     Europe if it fails to sustain broad based funding in \n     nanotechnology. The United States cannot afford to fall \n     behind our competitors if we want to maintain our economic \n     strength.\n       [(6) Advances in nanotechnology stemming from Federal \n     investments in fundamental research and subsequent private \n     sector development likely will create technologies that \n     support the work and improve the efficiency of the Federal \n     government, and contribute significantly to the efforts of \n     the government's mission agencies.\n       [(7) According to various estimates, including those of the \n     National Science Foundation, the market for nanotech products \n     and services in the United States alone could reach over $1 \n     trillion later this century.\n       [(8) Nanotechnology will evolve from modern advances in \n     chemical, physical, biological, engineering, medical, and \n     materials research, and will contribute to cross-disciplinary \n     training of the 21st century science and technology \n     workforce.\n       [(9) Mastering nanotechnology will require a unique skill \n     set for scientists and engineers that combine chemistry, \n     physics, material science, and information science. Funding \n     in these critical areas has been flat for many years and as a \n     result fewer young people are electing to go into these areas \n     in graduate schools throughout the United States. This will \n     have to reverse if we hope to develop the next generation of \n     skilled workers with multi-disciplinary perspectives \n     necessary for the development of nanotechnology.\n       [(10) Research on nanotechnology creates unprecedented \n     capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment and will \n     give rise to a host of novel social, ethical, philosophical, \n     and legal issues. To appropriately address these issues will \n     require wide reflection and guidance that are responsive to \n     the realities of the science, as well as additional research \n     to predict, understand, and alleviate anticipated problems.\n       [(11) Nanotechnology will provide structures to enable the \n     revolutionary concept of quantum computing, which uses \n     quantum mechanical properties to do calculation. Quantum \n     computing permits a small number of atoms to potentially \n     store and process enormous amounts of information. Just 300 \n     interacting atoms in a quantum computer could store as much \n     information as a classical electronic computer that uses all \n     the particles in the universe, and today's complex encryption \n     algorithms, which would take today's best super computer 20 \n     billion years, could be cracked in 30 minutes.\n       [(12) The Executive Branch has previously established a \n     National Nanotechnology Initiative to coordinate Federal \n     nanotechnology research and development programs. This \n     initiative has contributed significantly to the development \n     of nanotechnology. Authorizing legislation can serve to \n     establish new technology goals and research directions, \n     improve agency coordination and oversight mechanisms, help \n     ensure optimal returns to investment, and simplify reporting, \n     budgeting, and planning processes for the Executive Branch \n     and the Congress.\n       [(13) The private sector technology innovations that grow \n     from fundamental nanotechnology research are dependent on a \n     haphazard, expensive, and generally inefficient technology \n     transition path. Strategies for accelerating the transition \n     of fundamental knowledge and innovations in commercial \n     products or to support mission agencies should be explored, \n     developed, and when appropriate, executed.\n       [(14) Existing data on the societal, ethical, educational, \n     legal, and workforce implications and issues related to \n     nanotechnology are lacking. To help decision-makers and \n     affected parties better anticipate issues likely to arise \n     with the onset and maturation of nanotechnology, research and \n     studies on these issues must be conducted and disseminated.\n       [(15) Many States and regions have begun nanotechnology \n     programs. These programs have developed expertise, \n     particularly with regard to providing infrastructure and \n     preparing the nanotechnology workforce. The Federal \n     nanotechnology program should leverage these existing State \n     and local institutions to best provide a coordinated and \n     comprehensive nanotechnology research portfolio.\n       [(16) In ``Small Wonders, Endless Frontiers'' the National \n     Academy of Sciences' National Research Council recommends \n     increased investment in nanotechnology, particularly at the \n     intersection of nanotechnology and biology. Such investments \n     will allow significant advancements in biotechnology and \n     medicine.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Allen, Wyden, Hollings, and Stevens in sponsoring this \nsubstitute amendment to S. 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology \nResearch and Development Act. I commend Senators Allen and Wyden for \ntheir leadership on this important legislation, and also thank Senators \nStevens, Lott, and Sununu and Chairman Boehlert and Ranking Member Hall \nof the House Science Committee, for their work on this issue.\n  Nanotechnology is a truly revolutionary field of science. Scientists \nhave been able to develop materials and systems with dramatic new \nproperties by manipulating structures and systems at the scale of \n10-9 meters, or 1/100,000 the width of a human hair. This \nbasic research has the potential to benefit virtually every sector of \nour economy, including biotechnology, telecommunications, national \nsecurity, manufacturing, and computers. Some experts have projected \nthat sales of products based on nanotechnology will reach $1 trillion \nby 2015. Many of our international economic competitors have begun to \nfocus on this field. For example, the European Union budgeted $1.2 \nbillion for nanotechnology research in 2003 and 2004.\n  This bill is designated to highlight the United States' interest and \nefforts in this emerging technology. The bill would authorize a \ncoordinated research program across the Federal Government through a \nNational Nanotechnology Program. In addition, it would authorize \nfunding for nanotechnology research at the National Science Foundation, \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Energy, \nand the Environmental Protection Agency from fiscal year 2005 through \nfiscal year 2008. I think that this multiyear authorization is \nimportant, because it signals to the Federal agencies, the States, and \nprivate industry our commitment to this important cutting-edge \nresearch.\n  In addition, it is important to point out that the legislation deals \nwith more than just basic research. The bill includes provisions that \nwill ensure that social, ethical, environmental, educational, legal, \nand workforce issues will be analyzed, including the creation of a new \ncenter on a merit-reviewed, competitive basis to study these issues. \nThe bill also would establish a program at NIST to conduct basic \nresearch on metrology and other issues relating to nanotechnology-based \nmanufacturing. In addition, the bill would authorize the Secretary of \nCommerce, or his designee, to establish a clearinghouse of information \nfor issues relating to nanotechnology commercialization. It is \nimportant that the private sector has access to this basic research in \nnanotechnology, so that United States can attain a competitive edge in \nthis new field.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor S. 189, the 21st \nCentury Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. With this \nlegislation, the Senate recognizes the emerging field of nanotechnology \nand its importance to the United States economy. I thank my colleagues \nfor their efforts. I particularly thank Senator Wyden for his \nleadership and maturity in guiding this bill to the floor. There were \nseveral times when this bill was going to be derailed and each time \nSenator Wyden stepped in to get us back on track.\n  Nanotechnology has been described as the next Industrial Revolution \nthat will drastically alter the way products are manufactured. Yet we \nare not alone as other countries are competing to push the boundaries \nof this technical frontier. Countries such as Japan and the European \nUnion are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars on \nnanotechnology research. The United States cannot afford to fall behind \nif we want to maintain our economic strength. This legislation is one \nstep towards ensuring America's leadership and economic competitiveness \nin nanotechnology.\n  This legislation is an affirmation that the United States will \ncontinue to play a leading role in the development of nanotechnology. \nIt authorizes $784 million for fiscal year 2005 for five Federal \nagencies involved in nanotechnology research. Although other agencies \nwere not included in this bill, I am hopeful that they will contribute \nto the National Nanotechnology Program. The legislation provides \ninteragency coordination to the Federal Government's nanotechnology \nresearch and development efforts. The establishment of a National \nNanotechnology Coordination Office will infuse an organized, \nstructured, and collaborative approach to this research. The \nlegislation also calls for the development of a strategic plan that \nwill provide a roadmap for the country's research and development \nfuture.\n  Nanotechnology is a new frontier and we want to ensure that it is \ndeveloped\n\n[[Page S15097]]\n\nresponsibly. That is why I pushed for the creation of the American \nNanotechnology Preparedness Center. This Center is charged with \nensuring that societal, ethical, and environmental concerns surrounding \nnanotechnology are properly addressed as research progresses. This is \nvital as we see more and more of nanotechnology in everyday life, we \nneed to assure citizens that this new technology is safe and non-\nthreatening.\n  In addition to the American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center, this \nlegislation also establishes a Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. The \nNational Academies of Sciences recommended an Advisory Panel in its \nreview of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. I am proud to support \nits creation in this legislation. I think that it is vital that the \nPresident receive advice from dedicated experts directly involved in \nthis field, from the scientists and researchers who are at the \nforefront of this technology, rather than from advisors who are \nappointed to serve other technical advisory roles.\n  One of this country's main strengths is our ability to innovate. \nNanotechnology will be the next test as to whether we can continue to \nmove forward. There remains a tremendous amount of basic research that \nneeds to be undertaken in order to fully understand the science behind \nit all. This is exactly the role that Federal Government should play: \nto promote scientific knowledge that will benefit our society and our \neconomic competitiveness. This bill does exactly that and I am proud to \nsupport it.\n  I thank the House Science Committee for their cooperation. I also \nthank the other cosponsors, particularly Senators Lieberman and Clinton \nas well as Senators Allen, McCain, Stevens, Mikulski, Landrieu, Levin, \nBayh, Cantwell, Corzine, Hutchinson, Kerry, Lautenberg, Baucus, \nRockefeller, Alexander, and Warner for their support. In particular, I \nwould also like to thank the staff who put this bill together. In \naddition to my staff, we enjoyed the hard work of Ruchi Bhowmik with \nSenator Wyden, Liz Connell with Senator Stevens, Ken La Sala with the \nSenate Commerce Committee, Frank Cavaliere with Senator Allen, Mike \nO'Reilly with Senator Sununu, and Michael Yentzen with Senator Lott.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a substitute text \nfor S. 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development \nAct. I thank Commerce Committee Chairman McCain, Ranking Member \nHollings, and my colleagues Senators Allen, Clinton and Lieberman for \ntheir tremendous bipartisan assistance and cooperation. With this bill, \nwe pave the way for greater discoveries and applications in an area \nthat will soon become a major economic driver for this country.\n  The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act will \nprovide a smart, accelerated, and organized approach to nanotechnology \nresearch, development, and education. This legislation will marshal \nAmerica's nanotechnology efforts that are spread out across the State \nand Federal levels into one driving force. This bill will develop much \nneeded strategic interagency cooperation and coordination through a \nNational Nanotechnology Program. A National Nanotechnology Advisory \nPanel will advise the President on nanotechnology matters and the \nAmerican Nanotechnology Preparedness Center will evaluate important \nworkforce and ethical issues to ensure that societal and citizen \nconcerns about nanotechnology are addressed now--at the outset of this \nscience--and will support, not hinder, the development of this \nimportant science.\n  As I have said before, nanotechnology has the potential to change \nAmerica on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer \nrevolution. Nanoparticles and nanodevices will become the building \nblocks of our health care, agriculture, manufacturing, environmental \ncleanup, and even national security. By getting behind nanotechnology \nnow with organized, goal-oriented support, the Federal Government will \nplay a pivotal role in keeping the United States at the forefront of \nthis discipline.\n  It is estimated that nanotechnology will become a trillion-dollar \nindustry over the next 10 years. With the Nation's unemployment still \nhigh and real economic recovery still out of reach, nanotechnology \nholds the promise of new trade and jobs needed to jump start the \neconomy. As the nanotechnology industry grows, the ranks of skilled \nworkers needed to discover and apply its capabilities must grow too. In \nthe nanotechnology revolution, areas of high unemployment could become \nmagnets for domestic production, engineering and research for \nnanotechnology applications. I am determined that the United States \nwill mine the opportunities of nanotechnology and this legislation will \nensure that the United States takes full advantage of the opportunities \nnanotechnology presents.\n  Our Nation's current National Nanotechnology Initiative is a step in \nthe right direction. This nation has already committed substantial \nfunds to nanotechnology research and development in the coming years. \nBut funding is not enough. There must be careful planning to make sure \nthat money is used for sound science over the long-term. That is the \nreason for the substitute amendment to S. 189 I introduce today. The \nstrategic planning it prescribes will ensure that scientists get the \nsupport they need to realize nanotechnology's greatest potential.\n  With this bill, Congress is challenging the government to accept new \nresponsibilities in promoting and developing nanotechnology. Again, I \nthank the House Science Committee and House Science Chairman Boehlert \nfor their cooperation and I thank the other cosponsors, Senators \nAlexander, Warner, Mikulski, Landrieu, Levin, Bayh, Cantwell, Corzine, \nHutchison, Kerry, Lautenberg, Baucus, and Rockefeller, for their \nvaluable assistance. I am also pleased to report that this amendment \nhas the support of nanotechnology industry members, such as the Nano \nBusiness Alliance. This amended version is the work of bipartisan and \nbi-cameral cooperation and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto get this to the President's desk.\n\n\n                       Inclusion of Biotechnology\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to clarify the legislative intent of \nS. 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. \nIn reviewing the section of the substitute text dealing with the \npurpose and definitions of fundamental research in nanotechnology that \nour bill references, I believe that they are not intended to limit \nresearch and development to the physical sciences and are intended to \ninclude a wide variety of research, including the biotechnology-\nnanotechnology interface. Senator Stevens, is that your reading of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the Senator from Oregon. It is our \nintention to include research into the biotechnology-nanotechnology \ninterface. We did not mention specific areas or research because we did \nnot intend to be overly restrictive.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would just like to take a moment to clarify some of the \ntypes of nanotechnology applications that are possible through the \nresearch involving biotechnology at the nano-level, which are \nencompassed by this legislation These examples include applications \nranging from industrial manufacturing to advances in medicine to \nbreakthroughs in defense against bioterrorism.\n  For instance, biotechnology is spurring the development of proteins \nthat will be capable of manufacturing biological structures on the \nnano-scale. This technology will allow the development of nano-\nelectronics such as micro-transistors and silicon chips. In the area of \nphotonics there is potential for developing new micro-optical switches \nand optical micro-processing platforms.\n  Researchers recently discovered a first of its kind carbon-silicon \ncompound in freshwater diatoms. This discovery promises to open the \ndoor to understanding the molecular process of biosilicification, or \nthe ways plants and animals build natural structures. This \nunderstanding may lead to applications ranging from low cost synthesis \nof advanced biomaterials to new treatments for osteoporosis.\n  These are only a few examples of advances made through the interface \nbetween biotechnology and nanotechnology. I just want to confirm this \nlegislation should help facilitate\n\n[[Page S15098]]\n\nthe synergy between the biological sciences and material sciences.\n  Mr. STEVENS. These examples are exactly the type of research that we \nhave intended to cover in this legislation. Beyond industrial \napplications there are many health care applications of nano-\nbiotechnology.\n  I am particularly excited about the potential for nanotechnology in \nthe area of systems biology and molecular imaging. Systems biology \nanalyzes all of the elements in a system, rather than an individual \ncell, gene or protein. By applying nanotechnology to systems biology \nand using molecular imaging, it will be possible to achieve ultra-rapid \ndiagnostic results by analyzing on a molecular level the signatures of \nthousands of genes and proteins. Moreover, the systems approach in \ncombination with nanotechnology will speed up and greatly reduce the \ncost of discovering new drugs. This will lead to the advancement of \npredictive medicine generating revolutions in the diagnosis, treatment \nand prevention of disease.\n  Given nanotechnology's tremendous potential in health care, I want to \nencourage the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be proactive \nparticipants in the nanotechnology revolution. Although a specific \nauthorization of appropriations for NIH is not included in this bill at \nthe request of our House colleagues, it is expected that NIH will be an \nactive participant in the National Nanotechnology Program.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for \nclarification of this matter and I wholeheartedly agree with him \nregarding the potential benefits of nanotechnology in the field of \nhealth care.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this legislation is the product of many, \nmany hours of debate and discussion. I appreciate the commitment of the \nChairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the sponsors of \nthe bill, Senators Wyden and Allen, to try to address my concerns and \naccommodate my views on this bill. I appreciate the indulgence of the \nRanking Member, Senator Hollings, for his understanding and assistance \non this bill. Through persistence and thoughtful consideration by a \nhandful of interested Members in both bodies, an agreement was reached \non a legislative package that has brought us to this stage of the \nprocess. While I still have significant reservations, I am willing to \nallow the bill to proceed forward.\n  Nanotechnology is a burgeoning field of inquiry that has captured the \ninterest of many of our nation's brightest scientific minds. While the \nconcepts behind the study of nanotechnology are not necessarily new, \nrecent successes have highlighted its enormous potential. If early \nexperiences are an indication of things to come, nanotechnology has the \ncapability to dramatically change our approach to a wide range of \ncomplex scientific problems. By understanding materials and compounds \nat the molecular or atomic level, scientists can develop techniques to \nimprove the properties of everything from medicines to metals; machines \nto microchips.\n  S. 189 is meant to complement, rather than restrain, the work that \nthe Bush administration is already doing on the issue of \nnanotechnology. This administration is deeply committed to expending \nthe resources and conducting research on critical areas of \nnanotechnology and nanoscale science and engineering. The \nadministration's ``National Nanotechnology Initiative'' is on track to \ncommit almost $900 million in FY 2004 for nanotechnology research \nwithin appropriate Federal agencies. In addition, the administration \nhas already established a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office \nto facilitate and coordinate the muli-agency effort. It is essential \nthat S. 189 not infringe on the good work already being done by the \nadministration on this issue or on the near- or mid-term plans for \nfurther work in this area.\n  Despite this progress, I have several concerns about the underlying \ntext of the managers' amendment, and for that matter, the original \nversion of S. 189. I firmly believe that oversight is an important \nfunction of the Senate, and an important part of that oversight is to \nensure that Federal funds are spent appropriately. However the \nManagers' Amendment creates redundant reporting requirements for \nvarious agencies within the Administration. By my count, the bill \nincludes annual, biennial and triennial reporting obligations by the \nNational Science and Technology Council, the National Nanotechnology \nAdvisory Panel, and the National Academy of Sciences, respectively. \nThese reports have a number of overlapping components that will result \nin the checking and rechecking of similar questions and issues. It is \nimportant to note that Congressional studies and reporting requirements \nimpose very significant costs on the reporting agencies, thereby \ndraining funds from the very projects and research we are trying to \nfund.\n  S. 189 also authorizes the establishment of several interdisciplinary \nand specialized research centers on nanotechnology. The language of the \nbill requires that the process for establishing these centers be on a \nmerit-reviewed and competitive basis. Let me serve notice to those \ninvolved in the establishment of these centers: I will work to ensure \nthat any center established pursuant to this bill be placed at the most \nappropriate setting possible. I know this sentiment is shared by the \nChairman of the Commerce Committee and other Members of the Senate, and \nI look forward to working with them to ensure that the principles of \nmerit-review and competitive basis are upheld.\n\n  Finally, let me mention that there are concerns expressed by \nindividuals within the academic and scientific communities and by \ngeneral citizens that research and development of nanotechnology could \npossibly spiral out of control leading to the harmful impacts on \nhumans. Some people have expressed concern that nanotechnology will \nlead to a super-race of humans or a situation where nano-machines \nattack or even dominate human beings. Others argue that there are \nuncertainties about the impact of nanotechnologies on important aspects \nof our daily lives, including our society, environment, ethics, \neducational systems, legal structure or workforce. While I do not \ndismiss the possible negative ramifications of the study and \nrealization of nanotechnology, I believe those possible dangers are \nremote and avoidable. Almost all scientific research or new technology \ncan be used for mischievous purposes. Moreover, there are potential \nimplications by the use of nanotechnology that should be examined as \npart of research projects and development stages of nanotechnology. \nHowever, the emphasis that S. 189 provides to these issues is more than \nI would have considered necessary. We cannot and should not fear the \ntechnological future; we should pay it proper respect and plan for it \naccordingly.\n  In closing, it is my understanding that the product of today's Senate \nwork on this bill will likely be taken up and passed by the House and \nsent to the President for his consideration. I look forward to the \nmultiple advances that will occur from the statutory framework provided \nunder this bill. Our action today will signal to the research community \nthe importance and significance we place on this field of study, and \nthis will spur further investment by the private sector and hopefully \nlead to the technological breakthrough that will ignite further \ninnovation and economic growth.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the emerging field of nanotechnology \nconstitutes an opportunity for the U.S. to claim global leadership in a \nnew frontier in science and technology that has the potential to \ntransform every aspect of our lives. By manipulating matter at a \nmolecular scale, nanotechnology will allow us to develop new materials \nand devices that have unique properties currently beyond the realm of \nconventional technology. Nanotechnology is what scientists and \ntechnologists often call an enabling technology--a tool that opens the \ndoor to new possibilities constrained only by physics and the limits of \nour imaginations. This field has the great potential to affect our \neconomy and quality of life since it has such broad prospective \napplications in so many different areas including medicine, \nelectronics, energy, telecommunications, computing, and manufacturing. \nIt has been estimated that the impact of nanotechnology on existing and \nnew manufacturing will be in the trillions of dollars. In addition to \ncreating new job opportunities, this exciting new initiative has the \npotential\n\n[[Page S15099]]\n\nto provide novel therapeutic treatments and a fundamental understanding \nof diseases including cancer. For example, research in building \ninnovative tools to study biology at the nanometer scale will unlock \nmysteries and shed light on the vast number of biological processes. \nThe new authorizing legislation the Senate is passing today, which I am \npleased to have played a role in, should be an important step in this \neffort.\n  Yet, despite the enormous potential that nanotechnology offers, it is \nnot an area in which we have assumed uncontested leadership. From an \ninternational perspective, the United States faces the danger of \nfalling behind its Asian and European counterparts in supporting the \npace of nanotechnological advancement. While our Nation certainly \npossesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing \nthis technology, it is also clear that a long-term focus and sustained \ncommitment, as well as new collaboration between Government, academia, \nand industry, will be needed to ensure our place at the head of the \nnext wave of innovation.\n  In recognition of the need to support ongoing nanotechnology efforts \nand to spur new ones, I was pleased to join Senator Ron Wyden in \ncosponsoring the original ``21st Century Nanotechnology Research and \nDevelopment Act'' last year, which was reintroduced this year S. 189. \nMy staff worked with the Commerce Committee on the initial drafting of \nthis bill, and I was able to assist in including parallel legislation \nin last year's defense authorization P.L. 107-314, section 246 to help \nassure that Department of Defense research and development in \nnanotechnology works in concert with the civilian agencies covered by \nthis bill. Much of the original Senate bill is retained in this final \nlegislation. The revised S. 189 legislation we act on today, which we \nanticipate will also soon be approved by the House, will build on the \nefforts of the National Nanotechnology Initiative NNI, which was \nstarted under President Clinton and has received continued support \nunder President Bush, to establish a comprehensive, intelligently \ncoordinated program for addressing the full spectrum of challenges \nconfronting a successful national science and technology effort, \nincluding those related to funding, coordination, infrastructure \ndevelopment, technology transition, and social issues.\n\n  The time is now ripe to elevate the U.S. nanotechnology effort beyond \nthe level of an Executive Branch initiative. Funding for nanotechnology \nwill soon reach $1 billion a year, and the NNI currently attempts to \ncoordinate programs across a wide range of Federal agencies and \ndepartments. This level of funding and the major coordination \nchallenges that arise with so many diverse participants require having \na program that is based in statute, provided with greater support and \ncoordination mechanisms, afforded a higher profile, and subjected to \nconstructive Congressional oversight and support.\n  The final legislation closely tracks many of the recommendations of \nthe National Research Council, NRC, which completed a thorough review \nof the NNI in 2002. The NRC report commended the leadership and multi-\nagency involvement of the NNI, and its recommendations included the \nestablishment of an independent advisory panel. As the field of \nnanotechnology covers a wide variety of disciplines including \nengineering, physics, chemistry and life sciences, guidance is needed \nfrom a panel composed of experts from each of the disciplines. A \ncomprehensive perspective is necessary for helping to set the \ndirections and goals of the national program, including advice on the \nfocus of research that should be conducted in the academia sector, as \nwell as assistance in the transition of technology from academic into \nthe private sector that will ensure the competitiveness of U.S. \nindustry. Although members of the Presidents Council of Advisors on \nScience and Technology, PCAST, which the President is likely to select \nas the advisory body under section 4 in the final bill, are highly \naccomplished and esteemed, they are not necessarily steeped in the \nfield of nanotechnology. Therefore, our expectation is that PCAST will \nset up its own nanotechnology panel composed of experts from both \nacademia and industry representing the key nanotechnology disciplines. \nThis independent panel should work in coordination with the National \nScience and Technology Council and the new Program Office, particularly \nacross stove piped agency boundaries to better assure a fully \nintegrated, crosscutting, interdisciplinary research effort. Otherwise, \nthe promise of this research will not be realized.\n  To ensure that the United States takes the lead in this new and \npromising field of science and technology, we must provide for the \norganization and guidance necessary to foster interaction between \nGovernment, academia, and industry, so as to maximize the potential \nbenefits of nanotechnology to our economy. This legislation provides a \nstrong foundation and comprehensive framework that elicits \ncontributions from all three sectors of our society in pushing \nnanotechnology research and development to the next level. I hope that \nwe may all work together in a bipartisan fashion on implementing this \nbill to set the stage for U.S. economic growth over the next century.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as an original co-sponsor of S. 189, the \n21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, I am \ndelighted that the Senate is acting on this important legislation. I \nwant to thank my Senate colleagues, particularly Senator Hollings and \nSenator Wyden. Senator Hollings' leadership on the Senate Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee was essential in winning the \npassage of this legislation, which has so much promise for New Yorkers \nand Americans generally. Senator Wyden has helped to shepherd this \nlegislation through the Senate with his customary vision, determination \nand skill.\n  In ten or twenty years, we may well view this legislation as one of \nthe most important bills passed by the 108th Congress. The bill \nprovides multi-year authorization for increased Federal research and \ndevelopment investment in nanotechnology. Experts believe that \nnanotechnology could have an impact on our economy and society as \nsignificant as the impact of the steam engine, electricity, the \nInternet, and the computer chip. Researchers and high-tech start-ups \nhave already identified many potential benefits and applications of \nnanotechnology in health, energy and the environment, information and \ncommunications technology, advanced materials, manufacturing, and \nnational security. It is possible that nanotechnology could lead to \nsolar energy that is competitive with fossil fuels. Medical researchers \nare already working on using nanotechnology to develop tools for the \ndiagnosis and therapy of cancer.\n  In addition to funding research in nanoscale science and engineering, \nthe legislation also supports exploration of the ethical and social \ndimensions of nanotechnology. I want to underline the importance of \nthis component of the legislation. These provisions are intended to \nhelp ensure that we use this information to make intelligent decisions \nabout the benefits and risks of this powerful new technology. We have a \nresponsibility to ensure that appropriate safeguards are placed on the \nexploration of nanoscience and technology and that Congress exercises \neffective oversight of this process. I will work hard with my \ncolleagues to ensure that Congress does its part.\n  I am proud to say that New York is playing a leading role in the \ndevelopment of nanotechnology, and is already seeing concrete benefits \nfrom the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Three of the six \nuniversity-based centers of nanotechnology funded by the National \nScience Foundation in 2001 are located at New York's world-class \nresearch centers at Cornell University, Columbia University and \nRennselaer Polytechnic Institute. Long Island's Brookhaven National \nLaboratory is the future home of the Center for Functional \nNanomaterials, supported by the Department of Energy. The State of New \nYork and International SEMATECH and its member companies are planning \nto provide approximately $400 million in support to create a next-\ngeneration computer chip research and development facility at the \nUniversity at Albany-SUNY. All of these investments are creating the \nfoundations for future economic growth and the creation of high-tech, \nhigh-wage jobs, including in upstate New York.\n\n[[Page S15100]]\n\n  The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act shows \nwhat this Nation is capable of when we come together and set aside \npartisan differences. The National Nanotechnology Initiative was \nlaunched by President Clinton in January 2000, and has continued to \nenjoy bipartisan support from President Bush and members of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to pay attention to nanotechnology \nafter this legislation is passed. In many respects, this legislation is \nonly the first step. As President Clinton noted when unveiling the \nNational Nanotechnology Initiative, realizing the full promise of this \ntechnology may take twenty years of sustained investment. America's \nlead in this critical technology is by no means assured. Moreover, this \nlegislation will not result in an extra dime being devoted to \nnanotechnology research, unless the legislation is followed by \nsteadfast support for federal research and development in the budget \nand appropriations process.\n  I hope that the Administration and the Congress look for ways to \nbuild on and strengthen the current initiative. I believe that there \nare many such opportunities. The National Institutes of Health have \ntargeted a relatively modest amount of funding for the NNI, despite the \nbroad range of nanotechnology applications for health and biology. In \naddition, I hope we can increase the Environmental Protection Agency's \nbudget for nanotechnology because it has a role to play in a variety of \nsettings, including pollution prevention. We should also explore ways \nto respond to calls for the development of clean sources of energy \nusing nanotechnology.\n  This legislation is a bold step in the direction of creating a \nbrighter and more prosperous future for all Americans. In the years \nahead, I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to ensure the full development of this important \ninitiative.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of S. 189, \nthe 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. I \nappreciate Senator Wyden's leadership on this issue and the cooperation \nof him and the other sponsors of this legislation in responding to a \nnumber of concerns I had with the original bill, and in particular with \nthe provisions of the bill authorizing programs at the U.S. Department \nof Energy. In the last Congress, I introduced legislation on this \ntopic, S. 90, which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. That bill provided authorizations for nanotechnology \nprograms in the Department of Energy which are now incorporated, in a \nstreamlined form, in this bill. This is a good bill for our country's \nhigh technology future, and I urge that it be passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make the following parliamentary inquiry: \nThis bill, which deals with nanotechnology programs across the Federal \nGovernment, was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation. It is not true the Senate procedures provide for a case \nin which a future bill amending a particular public law might be \nreferred to a different committee than the one originally assigned the \npublic law, if that future bill consisted of amendments to parts of the \npublic law that were in the jurisdiction of the different committee; is \nthat true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Allen-\nWyden amendment at the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table en bloc, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2202) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments''.)\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 189), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Nanotechnology \n     Research and Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

We \nunderstand we will have to work Saturday, Sunday, and hopefully we will \nfinish then; otherwise, we will go Monday and Tuesday. Everyone has \nbeen told that is what we are going to do. Even though there is a \nlittle grumbling, everyone has accepted the fact that is what we are \ngoing to have to do.\n  I hope everyone understands the decision made by the leadership--we \nneed to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard--but we have to \nhave cooperation to get this very difficult session completed. We have \nsome very important issues--the Energy bill, Medicare--and I hope \neveryone understands the time is limited.\n  As I say, we have signed on to the program, and we are willing to \nwork until we finish the business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the statement made \nby the assistant Democratic leader. What he is referring to will be \nambitious in the sense we are asking both sides of the aisle to work \ntogether to address a number of pieces of legislation that are very \nimportant to this body and very important to the American people.\n  We have agreed we will be here over the course of this week and, if \nnecessary, into the weekend so that we can complete the bills before \nus. One of the reasons we are here at this hour of the evening is that \nI was hopeful we could proceed with the Energy bill. For a number of \nreasons, we will wait and start that early in the morning after morning \nbusiness.\n  The leaders on both sides of the aisle have been in touch over the \ncourse of the day, and both are determined to proceed in an orderly \nway, a collaborative way to address the issues that will be coming \nbefore us over the next several days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/18/senate-section/article/S15103-7", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
