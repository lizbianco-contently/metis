Mr. President, is the Senator from North Dakota granting \nhimself time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is 30 minutes granted to each side, \nas I understand it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until 10:45 is equally divided.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me grant myself such time as I may \nconsume. Then I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was simply making the point that this is a resolution \nof disapproval. It is rarely used in the Senate. I think this is only \nthe second time it has been used. But this is a critically important \nissue. We will have a number of speakers describing why this resolution \nof disapproval has been brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for the \nresolution that would disapprove the FCC ruling of June 2. In 1996, we \npassed the Telecommunications Act which said Congress should work \ntoward deregulating the media. We charged the FCC with ensuring the \nprotection of competition, diversity, and localism.\n  I think the rule that came out does the opposite. It does not protect \nthe localism and the diversity, particularly in the newspaper and \ntelevision markets. We must turn back the entire rule, even if we agree \nwith part of it, in order to tell the FCC to go back and start again.\n\n  I think the FCC could come up with another rule which would have some \nof the components of its June 2 rule, along with taking out parts that \nmany of us believe actually will hurt localism.\n  There are 100 Senators in this body. Probably each one has a \ndifferent view of what would be best in the media. Overall, I think it \nis important for us to be more cautious rather than less cautious, \nbecause what can happen if you lower the number of voices in the media, \nand companies make investments based on the rules at the time, is \nlater, down the road, if you determine that, in fact, we have lowered \nthe number of voices in the media--and it is to the detriment of the \nconsuming public--then I don't think you should penalize the companies \nthat made decisions based on the rules at the time.\n  I think stability in regulations is a good business principle. I \nthink if you look at the particular part of the rule that deals with \nnewspaper/television cross-ownership, you have the worst part of the \ndecision and the one that concerns me the most. And we have examples \nbecause three companies were grandfathered when the rules were made on \ncross-ownership. So we have seen what can happen in a local market when \na company is allowed to own the only newspaper in town plus the major \ntelevision station in town, and then perhaps even radio.\n  I believe radio is pretty diversified. I do not think we have a \nproblem with the number of voices in radio. My concern is ownership of \nthe only newspaper in a market plus a major television station in the \nmarket. And we have examples of that.\n  In Dallas, we have one company that owns the only newspaper in town \nplus the largest ABC television affiliate, which has the largest market \nshare of viewers for all editions of the news.\n  In Atlanta, we have one company that has the only newspaper in town \nthat is a regular newspaper. It also owns the major television station \nin town, one of the Nation's top performing ABC affiliates, and it also \nhappens to own 25 percent of the radio market. So I think that is a \npretty alarming amount of concentration.\n  Maybe they do a good job. But what we are talking about is not \nAtlanta. We are not talking about Dallas. They do good jobs in many \nrespects. What we are talking about is other cities and allowing this \nkind of concentration to pop up all over the country--the only \nnewspaper in town plus the major television station.\n  In the FCC's own poll, it showed that 74 percent of the people in a \ncommunity get their local news from a combination of television and \nnewspaper--74 percent. If you have one company owning the newspaper and \nthe major television station, you have a concentration that could be \nunhealthy. If it is unhealthy, it will be too late to go back and \nretrofit because these companies will make these investments based on \nthe rules of the time.\n  We should proceed with caution. I think we should overturn this rule, \nask the FCC to go back to the drawing board and take more testimony. \nThey had one hearing--one hearing--before they came out with this rule. \nTwo of the members of the Commission were so concerned that they went \nout across the country and had hearings of their own. But even though \nthere was a lot of testimony, it does not appear that the FCC took that \ntestimony into account when they made this rule of June 2. In fact, \nthose two members voted the other way.\n  They had heard the people speak, and they were concerned about this \nkind of concentration.\n  So whether you agree in part with the FCC or not at all, I hope you \nwill support the turning back of the rule so that we will give the FCC \na chance to go back to the drawing board, hear what Congress says, \nhopefully hear more from the public, and come out with rules \nparticularly in the area of newspaper/television cross-ownership that I \nthink should continue the ban.\n  Congress passed the law in 1996, giving the responsibility to the \nFCC. Some people say: Well, why is Congress getting involved? Well, it \nis Congress's responsibility to get involved with regulators when the \nregulators do not implement the law that Congress passed when they were \ngiven the responsibility to do just that. It would be an abdication of \nour responsibility if a majority of Congress disagreed with part of the \nruling that we would not take control of the decision. We are the \nelected representatives. The FCC is an appointed body to which we have \ndelegated responsibility to make rules. If we do not agree with the \nentire rule, it is our responsibility to act, and that is why the \nCongressional Review Act was passed.\n  I want to talk for a minute about what this is not. I was amazed, \nbecause I think very highly of the Wall Street Journal in most \nrespects--in almost every respect--but they had an editorial last \nFriday that said if we turn back the rule on cross-ownership of \nnewspapers and television, somehow this is going to bring back a review \nof the fairness doctrine.\n  I do not support the fairness doctrine. I think radio is quite \ndiversified. I think the voices that are coming into radio are very \nhealthy. I think talk radio has given voice to the silent majority. The \nlast thing this has anything to do with is the fairness doctrine, and \nyet my friend Rush Limbaugh and the Wall Street Journal somehow tied \nthe fairness doctrine to a newspaper/television cross-ownership issue.\n  Letting one entity own the only newspaper in town and the major \ntelevision station in town is lowering the number of voices in the \nmedia, not increasing the number. So while some people are more \nconcerned about the 35 to 45 percent, I am focused on the newspaper/\ntelevision ownership that I think affects our country.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will close by saying that when we are talking about \nlowering the number of voices in the media, we should proceed with \ncaution. Voting for this resolution of review says to the FCC: You went \ntoo far in some respects--not every respect. We may disagree on the \nareas, but you need to listen more to Congress and to the people who \nhave spoken.\n  I hope people will vote yes, and I hope the FCC will be responsive.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator speaking for or against?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am speaking for.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think appropriately at this point, \nSenator McCain in opposition will yield time and then I will be happy \nto yield time to the Senator from Wisconsin at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time does the Senator from Louisiana wish?\n  Mr. BREAUX. A couple minutes--3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I will just make a couple of comments in opposition to \nthe resolution because I think the resolution is sort of a broad-brush \napproach that takes down everything the FCC has recommended, things \nthat make sense that are good and also things about which some people \nmay have questions. It really is a resolution that assumes, in my \nopinion, that if things are small, they are necessarily good; if things \nare big, they are necessarily bad.\n  I think particularly as this is clearly spelled out with regard to \npart of the FCC's rule that deals with the question of television \nownership, the rule from the FCC basically allowed the television \nstations to move up to a 45-percent-of-viewer cap before they would be\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\nprohibited from owning additional television stations.\n  It seems to me that if you look at media concentration now, you have \n1,721 television stations in the United States and the networks only \nown a very small percentage of those stations. If you consider the \npeople who watch the stations, you will find also that the viewership \nof these network-owned stations, indeed, is very small.\n  It is not as if a couple of networks have all the viewers and are \ntherefore monopolizing what people see and there is no diversity. That \nis simply not the fact at all. If you look at Viacom, which owns CBS, \nin prime time viewing, they have about 3.4 percent--3.4 percent of the \ntotal TV households. News Corp, which owns Fox, has about 3.1 percent. \nGeneral Electric, which owns NBC, has 2.8 percent. And Disney, which \nhas ABC stations, has about 1.5 percent of the total TV households \nwatching their network programming in prime time.\n  The problem with the argument that the cap is somehow going to change \nthings and make a concentration of ownership of what people see makes \nno sense whatsoever, because the way it is currently measured, stations \nthat are in large television markets are assumed to have everybody in \nthe market watching their stations.\n  A station that is owned by the network that happens to have a station \nin Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, New York, or Chicago probably exceeds a \ncap of 35 percent of the potential viewing audience, but in reality \nthey may have only a very small number of people in those cities \nactually watching them.\n  So the standard of measurement that we use is totally illogical. It \nwould be like saying an automobile dealer in New York has 6 percent of \nthe total sales in the United States because New York is about 6 \npercent of the market. That would be fine if the automobile dealer sold \nevery car that is bought in New York, but that is not the case. There \nare probably literally thousands of other competitors in that market.\n  The same thing is true in the television market. As an example, an \nABC station in Los Angeles does not have everybody in the Los Angeles \nmarket watching their station. There are probably 200 to 300 additional \nstations that a viewer can watch in the evenings and look at a diverse \nrange of programs that happen to be available.\n  So the argument that because a station happens to have a tower in a \nlarge city it has all the viewers in that city is illogical at best and \nmisleading in fact.\n  Another point is when we look at the amount of diversity that \nnetworks give, obviously the studies have shown they, in fact, offer \nfar more local programming than nonnetwork-owned stations. Those facts \nare clear. They are indisputable.\n  I think what we do in saying we are going to throw out what the FCC \nhas done makes no sense. The network-owned stations, in fact, show \nabout 37 percent more local news than locally owned stations do. So I \nargue that this resolution be voted down.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of S.J. Res. 17, \nthe bipartisan resolution of disapproval which would overturn the \nFederal Communications Commission's new rules on broadcast media \nownership. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure \nbecause I believe the FCC has acted in gross disregard of its mandate, \nof good public policy, and of the will of the American people.\n  When the public became aware that the Federal Communications \nCommission was considering new rules on media consolidation earlier \nthis year, the explosion of concern was immediate, heartfelt, and \nunprecedented. Close to three-quarters of a million people registered \ntheir views with the FCC before it issued its decision, more than for \nany proceeding in its history. Public opinion was almost unanimous in \nopposition to further relaxation of media ownership restrictions.\n  So how did the FCC respond to this clear statement of the will of the \npeople? With the back of its hand. Only one official public hearing was \nheld. This was more than carelessness or bureaucratic inertia. This was \nsimple disdain for the public in whose interest the FCC by statute is \nrequired to act.\n  Among the many letters I have received on this issue was one from \nNicholas Dzubay, a Republican alderman on the city council of Barron, \nWI. Alderman Dzubay said his area's radio stations were suffocating \nunder the control of a single corporation. He hopes we will not allow \ntelevision and other broadcast media in his area to be monopolized in \nthe same way.\n  I was also particularly struck by a letter from the Reverend Robert \nStiefvater, the Vocations Director for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. He \nwrote:\n\n       I find it very difficult to get news into our local market \n     here in Southeastern Wisconsin. The FCC's June 2 decision to \n     radically weaken the remaining ownership rules will \n     unacceptably harm my ability, the Archdiocese's and its \n     community's ability to receive and distribute local \n     independent programming.\n\n  If any of us doubts the dangers of the road down which the FCC wants \nto send us, the story of American radio stands as a powerful warning. \nUnprecedented consolidation followed the Telecommunications Act of \n1996, but the real story is told over the airwaves. Radio does not \nsound like it used to. Like most of us in the Senate, I travel a lot, \nand wherever I go, radio stations sound more and more alike. Why? \nBecause they are no longer programmed by local DJs but by executives at \ncorporate headquarters hundreds of miles away.\n\n  As we begin to examine the issue of file-sharing, and look for ways \nto protect copyright owners and artists from infringement of the \ncopyrights on works they struggled to create, we should keep in mind \nthat there used to be a time when American young people heard new music \non the radio, when they explored the variety of musical styles and \ngenres by flipping channels. DJs used to make a name for themselves by \nplaying new artists, or taking changes on records other DJs had \noverlooked. New local programmers do not have the freedom to deviate \nfrom the corporate playlist, and young people are turning off their \nradios and booting up file-sharing programs like Kazaa.\n  The homogenization of American radio is a grim predictor of the \nconsequences of deregulation. If allowed to stand, the FCC rules will \nravage the independence and character of other forms of media, from \ntelevision to newspapers, the way radio has already been ravaged. This \nresolution is our chance to say no.\n  If this resolution of disapproval passes, I hope the FCC will finally \nunderstand how seriously we in Congress feel about this issue. I hope \nthe FCC gets the message. They did not just make an honest mistake. \nThey did not just misinterpret a complicated or ambiguous statute. They \nheaded off in entirely the wrong direction. They ignored the will of \nthe American people. That is why I will support this resolution, and I \nurge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the resolution \nthat we have before us today. I will make a few points that are being \noverlooked in this debate. First, when the original ideas for this cap \non percentage of media ownership were put into place, they were put \ninto place because of the principle that we did not want a small group \nof people owning our airwaves to the point where they would be able to \ncontrol thought, whether it is political thought or any other kinds of \nthought, in the United States. So when these were put into place, we \nhad basically three networks.\n  When I was growing up, there virtually was no cable and everybody had \nover-the-air broadcast television. We had the three stations, and \nwhatever were on those three stations is what one watched. We were \nlucky to have one or two, maybe three, radio stations, especially if we \nwere not in a major media market.\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\n  The reality of today is that we not only have the over-the-air \nbroadcast with the three networks, we also have Fox, UPN, and others, \nbut we have systems whereby the vast majority of the homes in America \ncan either get cable or some kind of a direct satellite TV system that \nhas hundreds of stations which provide news, which provide \nentertainment, which provide all kinds of information.\n  In media markets, for instance, where I live in Las Vegas, NV, \nsomeone cannot turn the dial without getting a new radio station, both \nAM and FM. The choices are incredible. Other types of information we \nhave coming into our household today include the Internet. Anybody can \nset up Web sites or news information-sharing sources. That is becoming \na larger part of how people get their information.\n  Other than the major media outlets, there is the Drudge Report and \nother places on the Internet where people are getting information. The \npoint is that there are so many more places for information to be had \ntoday than when these rules at 25-percent caps were initially put into \nplace.\n  The other major point I make is that what we are talking about is \npotential viewership. Right now, the cap is set at 35 percent. It wants \nto be raised to 45 percent. I believe the FCC tinkered a little bit \naround the edges. This is not the tidal wave of change that people are \ntalking about. This is a minor change in that it is potential \nviewership, it is how many homes can be reached. It is not how many \npeople are watching a station at any one time. It is how much potential \nreach can one have into the home?\n  So we are not only saying it does not matter how many choices one \nhas, it only matters how many homes can somebody potentially reach. It \ndoes not matter if somebody reaches 100 percent of the homes, as long \nas they have plenty of other choices. We should be making sure there \nare plenty of choices. When people choose which station they watch, \nthey should be free to choose whatever stations they want.\n  We have also heard mention in this debate about cross-ownership with \nnewspapers. One of the big complaints I hear about localism is that a \nlot of the TV stations today do not cover local politics. We know when \nthere is cross-ownership there are more resources, especially in \nsmaller media markets where necessarily TV stations or the newspapers \ndo not have the kind of resources to put good reporters on the beat and \nthey do not cover as much local politics. When there is cross-\nownership, we see 50 percent more local news and public affairs \nprogramming, and an important thing is that local politics is covered. \nThis is one of the big gripes I had in my last few campaigns, that the \nlocal TV stations--whether they are owned inside the State or outside \nthe State, it was the same thing--didn't cover local politics enough.\n\n  I happen to be a Republican. In Las Vegas, NV, these two entities I \nam going to talk about lean more to the left. There is a TV station in \ncross-ownership with one of the newspapers in Las Vegas and, since they \nhave been in existence, the coverage of local politics, not only by \nthem but also by their competitors, has increased dramatically. I think \nthat is good. That is more localism. There is cross-ownership there, \nbut that is localism.\n  I think the precautions the FCC has put into place on cross-\nownership, where you have to have a certain number of TV stations \nwithin a market if there is only one major newspaper, are the right \nkind of precautions to put in.\n  The point is, are we giving people choice? Where they choose to view \nis up to them. We should not be in the business of regulating what they \nwatch, what they read, and who owns those, if we have enough choices in \nan area. I actually believe the FCC could have gone farther than they \nwent. This is a very conservative move they have made today. If we are \nstarting to be in the business of regulating how many people you can \nattract to your television stations, then we are starting to regulate \nwhether you are getting too popular. That seems to be wrongheaded, in \nmy opinion.\n  It seems to be right that if you have a couple of gas stations in an \narea, as long as you have choice among the gas stations, that is the \nimportant aspect. You don't want a monopoly saying this is the only gas \nstation to which you can go. If we have 200 different gas stations, it \ndoesn't matter whether Exxon reaches 100 percent of the cities in the \nUnited States. If there are 200 different gas stations in each one of \nthe markets around the country, who cares? Because there would be \ncompetition to make sure Exxon is keeping its gas at the right price; \notherwise, they would not be able to compete.\n  That is the same thing we have here. It really doesn't matter, in my \nopinion, whether ABC or NBC covers the entire United States. If there \nare 200 active choices just on television to be able to choose from, \nthen let people choose where they are going to watch based on their \nremote control or based on how they flip channels. That seems to be the \nright kind of choices America should be all about.\n  We are in this fear. There are some on the right and there are some \non the left who are afraid that either liberals or the conservatives \nare going to control too much of the media and control too much thought \nin one regard. Whichever side of the political spectrum people may have \nhad a bad personal experience because in their area maybe the liberals \ncontrolled it or in another area maybe the conservatives controlled it. \nPeople complain about Fox News today; people complain about talk radio; \nyou hear conservatives complaining about the major TV networks and all \nthat. But as long as people have the choices of where they view, the \nmarket will determine where they get their information based on people \nchoosing which stations they choose to watch.\n  That seems to me to be the American way. Let there be plenty of \nchoices out there. Let freedom ring, basically, and then Americans will \nchoose what the percentage of viewership is based on the choices they \nmake.\n  In this Senator's opinion, this resolution before us today would go \nthe exact opposite way of that we should be going. We should be \nliberalizing these rules so broadcast stations have a chance to \ncompete. We are watching daily the quality of programming in our \nbroadcast television go down because it is incredibly expensive to \nproduce those shows today. So we are seeing more shows like \n``Survivor,'' with these people on reality television shows that \nfrankly don't cost a lot of money to produce because you don't have to \npay the big actors. We want to reverse that trend, go the other way, \nand the way to do that is to liberalize the ownership rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, like many Americans, I was disappointed \nby the Federal Communications Commission's recent order on media \nownership. As my colleagues know, on June 2 the FCC voted to relax the \nrules on media ownership. That order could reduce local news coverage \nand could hinder the diversity of views presented in the news media.\n  I rise in support of the bipartisan resolution offered by Senators \nDorgan and Lott to invalidate the FCC's media ownership order. Passage \nof this resolution will help ensure that the marketplace of ideas is \nnot dominated by a few corporate conglomerates at the expense of our \ncitizens and our democracy.\n  Since its founding, our Nation has always recognized the importance \nof a free press in helping citizens make informed decisions on critical \npublic issues. Over the past few years, we have seen massive mergers \ntake place in many industries, but Americans recognize that the news \nmedia are different. They don't just produce a product to make a \nprofit. They also provide a vital public service that could be \nundermined if just a few mega-corporations control what we can read, \nsee and hear. That is why the FCC's order has provoked such a large \npublic backlash.\n  By a 3-2 vote, the FCC made two major changes. First, it lifted a \nrestriction that prevents mergers between newspaper and television \nstations in the same market. This is known as the cross-ownership rule. \nUntil now, that restriction has ensured that one company does not \ncontrol both newspaper\n\n[[Page S11505]]\n\nand television coverage in an area. That helps ensure that consumers \nhave access to diverse sources of information.\n  By eliminating this cross-ownership rule, however, consumers could \nend up with fewer voices and perspectives on the public airwaves and in \nthe newspaper. The number one television station in a market could be \nowned by the dominant newspaper or even the only newspaper in that same \nmarket. We are not talking about something that could happen in just \none or two cities. This could happen all over the country. Down the \nroad, the order could encourage just a handful of powerful corporations \nto own nearly every media outlet. That could hinder diverse and \nalternative viewpoints. It could also mean fewer reporters and \nresources for covering local and community events.\n  The newspaper market is already much less diverse than it was 25 \nyears ago. Since 1975, two-thirds of independent newspaper owners have \ndisappeared. The FCC's first order sets the stage for a further \nreduction in independent newspaper ownership.\n  The FCC's second order would allow broadcast networks to own more \nstations across the country. Currently, one broadcast network cannot \nown stations that reach more than 35 percent of the public. The FCC \njust raised that limit to 45 percent. This order threatens to reduce \nthe amount of local news coverage available to citizens. Just look at \nwhat has happened in the radio industry. National radio networks have \ngobbled up local stations. Many have consolidated their news operations \nto the detriment of local consumers. Getting rid of local news coverage \nis not good for our local communities and their residents. This change \ncould be especially troubling in rural areas.\n  I have been working on this issue for several months, and I believe \nwe have reached a critical juncture that calls for Senate action.\n  On April 9, nearly 2 months before the ruling, I sent a letter to FCC \nChairman Michael Powell along with 14 other U.S. Senators from both \npolitical parties. We asked the FCC to let the Congress and the public \nreview and comment on the proposed changes before they were enacted.\n  When the order came out in June, I expressed my concerns.\n  A couple of weeks ago in the Appropriations Committee, I echoed the \ncomments of Senators Dorgan and Hutchison on the need to either fix or \neliminate this order through action on the Senate floor, and that is \nwhy I'm here today in support of this resolution.\n  The rule was scheduled to take effect on September 4, but was \npostponed when the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary \nstay. This stay could be lifted if the FCC meets the court's \nrequirements, so the Senate needs to act quickly.\n  One option before the Senate is to pass a law invalidating the FCC's \norder. Unfortunately, that approach would still leave the door open for \nthe FCC to simply rewrite the rule and do an ``end run'' around \nCongress. A better way to invalidate the rule is to use the \nCongressional Review Act, CRA. It would stop the rule and would also \nprevent the FCC from re-imposing it later under a different name.\n  In the Appropriations Committee, we included a provision that would \nlower the media cap back to 35 percent. That mirrored a similar \nprovision in the House's Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nAppropriations bill. We must finish the job today by using the CRA to \ninvalidate the whole rule.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of Americans get their news from local TV \nand newspapers. We cannot allow a handful of corporations to dictate \nwhat all Americans can see, hear, and read as they make decisions on \ncritical public issues. I urge my colleagues to vote for diverse media \nownership by supporting this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Alaska such time \nas he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I oppose this resolution which would \ndisapprove all of the FCC's recent rulings on media ownership. I oppose \nit for several reasons.\n  In the first place, the court of appeals has stayed this resolution, \nand it is reviewing its contents. I do not think it is appropriate for \nthe Senate to pass such a resolution when there already exists \nlegislation that addresses the most contentious media ownership issues.\n  As one of the original sponsors of the legislation that is on the \ncalendar already, I urge the Senate to take up that bill and not \napprove this resolution. My legislation, S. 1046, has the support of a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\n  I do not support this attempt to unravel everything that the FCC did \nregarding the media ownership rules. For the most part, I think the \nCommission did a good job on the media ownership issues, absent one \nissue regarding 35 percent.\n  My main concern all along was to keep the national ownership cap at \nthe 35 percent level, and that was the primary focus of the bill that I \nintroduced. In fact, that bill already passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  My bill prohibits ownership of TV broadcast stations if the ownership \nexceeds 35 percent of the national TV audience. It maintains the status \nquo for the cap and closely tracks what Congress originally intended in \nthe Telecom Act.\n  There were several amendments that were added to my bill in the \nCommerce Committee which addressed other parts of the rules. One was \noffered by my colleague from North Dakota. That amendment undid the \nCommission's decision to lift the cross-ownership ban.\n  I didn't agree with his original amendment because I thought that the \nFCC's decision to lift the cross-ownership ban was prudent. I was \nconcerned that the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota didn't \ncontemplate situations in small markets where cross-ownership between \nnewspapers and TV stations is necessary. Therefore, in committee I \nadded language to his amendment which allows for a waiver procedure in \nsmall markets.\n  This pending resolution, however, does not contemplate the small \nmarkets at all in the context of cross-ownership. This concerns me and \nshould certainly concern others as well, especially those who represent \nsmall markets.\n  Last week the Third Circuit issued an order staying the FCC media \nownership rules, pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding \nbefore that court. Therefore, this Third Circuit stay has creates \nstatus quo allowing the stake holders to fully brief and argue their \nsides.\n  Finally, the issue that has received the most support and attention \nfrom my colleagues and from diverse interest groups is the 35 percent \ncap issue. That issue has been addressed by both the House in the CJS \nappropriations bill and by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the \nCJS bill.\n  Therefore, with all of these various tracks already in play, I don't \nthink it is wise to open another can of worms on the same issues. It is \nnot productive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \nstatement on the matter before us.\n  Mr. President, the Senate faces a critical decision today--whether \nnew media ownership rules proposed by the FCC truly serve the public \ninterest. They do not, and we should pass this resolution of \ndisapproval and force the FCC to rework them.\n  On June 2, 2003, the Federal Communications Commission adopted new \nbroadcast media ownership rules that would allow greater concentration \nof ownership of U.S. broadcast television stations, both at the \nnational and local levels. At the national level, a single owner could \nown stations capable of reaching up to 45 percent of the national \naudience--up from 35 percent--under the new rules. A single entity \ncould reach up to twice that percentage of the national audience if he \nor she owned UHF stations. In most markets, duopolies ownership of two \nstations in the same market would be allowed, and triopolies would be \nallowed in the largest markets.\n  The new rules would also allow cross-ownership of broadcast \ntelevision stations and major newspapers in all but the smallest of \nmedia markets as well as greater cross-ownership of television\n\n[[Page S11506]]\n\nand radio stations. The rules would theoretically allow one owner to \nreach 90 percent of national TV audience and, in a large market, own \nthree television stations, eight radio stations, the only daily \nnewspaper, and the cable company.\n  The public overwhelmingly opposes these new rules. In fact, a recent \nCNN poll found that 96 percent of Americans believe there is already \ntoo much media concentration--that ownership of too many media outlets \nis already under the control of too few corporations.\n  Why should Congress care? For several reasons.\n  Congress has repeatedly mandated, most recently in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, that the FCC serve the public interest \nby promoting competition, diversity of viewpoints, and localism. These \nrules fail on all counts.\n  First, competition. Remember that there are a limited number of \nbroadcast licenses available. Ted Turner, who bought one station and \nturned it into a media giant, addressed the rules' potential effect on \ncompetition. Turner wrote in an op-ed that if he had been faced with \nthe FCC's new rules, he never could have started his own media company: \n``If a young media entrepreneur were trying to get started today under \nthese proposed rules, he or she wouldn't be able to buy a UHF station, \nas I did. They're all bought up,'' he wrote.\n  Turner added that even if that young entrepreneur could buy a UHF \nstation, he or she wouldn't have access to the programming and \ndistribution needed, as both are largely controlled by the major media \ncompanies. ``Today both (programming and distribution) are owned by \nconglomerates that keep the best for themselves and leave the worst for \nyou if they sell anything to you at all. It's hard to compete when your \nsuppliers are owned by your competitors,'' he said.\n  Second, independence and diversity of viewpoints. Many argue there \nare an infinite number of media outlets today, especially given the \nhuge growth in cable channels and internet addresses. But the vast \nmajority of Americans get their news and information from television \nnews and/or their local newspaper. And realize that none of the cable \nnews channels have anywhere near the viewership of the broadcast media, \nand that most of the major cable and internet news outlets are \naffiliated with the print and broadcast media that are already \ncontrolled in large part by just a handful of companies. Diversity of \nviewpoints is already in jeopardy, and the new rules would only \nexacerbate the situation.\n  Third, localism. If many of those so-called diverse viewpoints are \nactually controlled by a handful of companies, then one can see that \nlocalism, too, is in trouble. The loss of localism in radio is well \nknown, sometimes with dangerous consequences like the famous Minot, ND \ncase that Senator Dorgan has talked about. In fact, the lack of \nlocalism in radio is so undeniable that even the FCC has agreed to \naddress it in the one aspect of the proposed rules that makes sense.\n  But localism in television is also at risk local entertainment \nchoices as well as news. James Goodman of Capital Broadcasting in North \nCarolina explained it well in his testimony before the Commerce \nCommittee. He owns Fox and CBS stations in Raleigh. Out of respect for \nhis local audience's sensibilities, he has refused to carry either \nnetwork's ``reality TV'' shows, including ``Temptation Island,'' \n``Cupid,'' ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire,'' and ``Married by \nAmerica.'' His actions have met with intense resistance from the \nnetworks, and he has expressed his grave concern that if the networks' \nability to own more and more of the broadcast outlets goes unchecked, \nlocal stations and communities won't have any ability to choose their \nown programming. They will be forced to air the network fare, even when \nit is offensive to local viewers.\n  Finally, and most important, there is an even more basic threat posed \nby these new rules: It is a threat to democracy itself. The integrity \nof our democracy depends on an informed electorate. Again, the vast \nmajority of Americans get their news and information from \ntelevision and/or their local newspaper. If we allow the limited \nbroadcast spectrum to be controlled by a handful of companies, how can \nwe maintain the free marketplace of ideas?\n\n  Those in the print media rightfully chafe at the prospect of \ngovernment restrictions. Anyone in America has the right to print their \nideas. But when we talk of broadcast media, we are talking about public \nairwaves, and that is a different matter altogether. Again, space on \nthe spectrum is limited, and so are broadcast licenses. And the FCC was \ncreated to regulate them in the public interest--not to rubber-stamp \nthe industry's wish list.\n  Not only are the new rules a threat to democracy, but the process by \nwhich they were approved is a threat to democracy.\n  In response to pressure from the Democratic appointees to the \nCommission, FCC Chairman Michael Powell called only one official field \nhearing. Field hearings are intended to solicit input from the general \npublic from across the country to overcome the ``inside the Beltway'' \nvirus that often infects policies born in Washington, DC. Chairman \nPowell's ``field'' hearing was held 90 miles from Washington, and much \nof his invited testimony came from industry representatives, many of \nwhom, in fact, live and work inside the Beltway.\n  It appears the Chairman thought a pro-industry decision would sail \nthrough with minimal attention. After all, other than paid lobbyists, \nhow many people have the time to follow the details of an FCC decision-\nmaking process? But a funny thing happened on the way to the vote. As \nsoon as people outside the Beltway did learn what the FCC was planning \nto do, they protested, and they protested in large numbers.\n  Of the 2 million individuals who commented on the FCC's proposed \nrules, 99 percent opposed them. Ninety-nine percent. Of the first \n10,000 comments that were sampled separately, there were only 57 \ncomments in favor of the rules, and only 11 of those 57 were from \npeople with no vested interest in the rules changes.\n  Those margins are essentially unheard of in American politics. Near \nunanimity. But in the halls of the FCC, that overwhelmingly negative \ninput was essentially ignored. The votes of the American people didn't \ncount. Only three votes counted--the votes of three commissioners who \ndecided that they knew better than 99 percent of the people who \ncommented on the rules.\n  The FCC's hasty process also effectively blocked public comment on \nmany issues. Allowing for public comment isn't just the right thing to \ndo. It generally leads to a better product. The FCC has an expert \nstaff. But mistakes can and do happen. And an agency as determined to \nact quickly as the FCC was on this matter is more likely to make \nmistakes.\n  One such apparent mistake affects my state of South Dakota and would \nclassify Sioux Falls as having more television stations than Detroit. \nIt does so by counting five public broadcast stations as separate \nstations even though they broadcast the same signal. As a result, Sioux \nFalls is considered to have 11 stations instead of 7. And Sioux Falls, \nthe 112th-largest market by population, is counted as having more \nstations than Detroit, the 10th-largest market.\n  Some commercial broadcasters own multiple stations that broadcast \nidentical signals. FCC rules appropriately treat them as one station. \nBut the exemption applies only to commercial stations, not public \ntelevision stations. FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein, a South \nDakota native, identified the error and encouraged his colleagues to \ncorrect it, but the Commission has not done so.\n  The consequences of such an error are real. Because the new rules \nconsider Sioux Falls to have 11 stations instead of 7, the city is \nplaced in a category without any cross-ownership restrictions. That \nwould allow the newspaper to acquire two television stations instead of \none, and own twice as many radio stations as would be permitted if \nSioux Falls were properly classified. Fortunately, I don't see any rush \nfor that to happen. But who knows what a future owner of the Sioux \nFalls Argus Leader or one of the Sioux Falls television stations might \nwish to do? This is just the kind of mistake that could have been \navoided if the FCC had employed the more deliberative, inclusive \nprocess that so many of us advocated.\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\n  Let's review the mission of the Federal Communications Commission, as \nstated repeatedly by the Commission and by acts of Congress: to serve \nthe public interest by promoting competition, diversity of viewpoints, \nand localism. The public interest--that phrase should be italicized in \nthis debate.\n  As we define the public interest, the public--the people who receive \nthe radio and TV news and programming that beams across the airwaves \ntheir taxes paid for--has a right to be heard. Public comment, input, \nand involvement in our democratic processes is not a box to be checked \nbefore the petitions, call, e-mails, and letters are thrown in the \ntrash and disregarded. It is a basic tenet of our social contract and \nthe principle that underlies our form of government. Of the people, by \nthe people, for the people.\n  I am all for ensuring the rights of the minority. Indeed, I feel \nstrongly about our civic responsibility to ensure that a reactionary or \npowerful majority does not trample on the rights of those in our \nsociety whose voices are not as easily heard or fully represented. In \nfact, that's one key reason I oppose the substance of these rules--I \nfear the voices of those who may have quite valuable things to say, but \nlack the means to gobble up TV and radio stations, will not be heard.\n\n  But in this case we don't have a powerful majority trampling on the \nrights of the vulnerable. We have three people--with an obvious push \nfrom the current administration--trampling on the rights of the \nmajority. To add insult to injury, they are telling the majority--the \nAmerican people--that they are doing this in their interest. Of course, \nthe interests being served are those of the handful of large media \ncompanies that already control a huge percentage of America's major \nmedia outlets.\n  Let me be clear: I don't blame the media companies for advocating for \ntheir own interests. They have every right to fight for their \ninterests. I do blame the Chairman of the FCC and the other \ncommissioners who voted for these rules for failing to give the rest of \nthe country the consideration they deserved in this debate.\n  The Congressional Review Act was intended for exactly this kind of \nsituation. A Federal agency has turned a deaf ear to the very public it \nwas intended to serve. It is appropriate to send them back to the \ndrawing board, especially if that is the only option available to us.\n  The Commerce Committee actually reported a bill that deals with the \nissues individually, and I would be happy to debate that bill. But it \nhas been made clear to us that the majority has no intention of \nbringing the Commerce Committee bill to the floor, and we have no \nability to force it to the floor before these rules take effect.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one final point. This isn't a partisan \nissue. The Republican supporters of this resolution of disapproval \ninclude Republican Party stalwarts like Trent Lott and Kay Bailey \nHutchison. It is not a liberal versus conservative issue, either.\n  The list of well-recognized people and organizations who oppose all \nor part of the FCC's media ownership rules is one of the strangest list \nof strange bedfellows you will ever hear. Opponents include Walter \nCronkite, William Safire, the National Rifle Association, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the National Organization for Women, \nSenator Jesse Helms, the National Council of Churches, MoveOn, the \nParents Television Council, former Universal Studios Chairman and CEO \nBarry Diller, Mort Zuckerman, and many, many more. That sampling of the \nlist gives you a sense of how broad and deep the opposition to these \nFCC rules is.\n  We should respect that overwhelming opposition and vote accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nremaining on both sides, and at what time will the vote take place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 39 seconds on your side \nand 15 minutes 45 seconds on the other side. The vote will occur around \n11 o'clock.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Dorgan for his \nremarkable leadership on this most important matter.\n  Drastic times require drastic measures. That is why I stand with my \ncolleagues today in support of this resolution which will help and \nsafeguard one of our most precious possessions--the right of free and \ndiverse exchange of opinions.\n  The decision that has been made by the FCC will no doubt pave the way \nfor even greater concentration of media ownership in the hands of a \nselect few and deprive the public of the diversity of viewpoints that I \nhappen to believe is so essential to democracy and objective reporting \nin America.\n  The FCC's June vote on media ownership ultimately, as I said in the \ncommittee, is truly the ``deregulatory'' express out of the station. \nNow we are on track toward even greater ownership concentration and \nunfettered consolidation.\n  Some have said that with exponentially more media outlets than ever \nbefore, we should have nothing to fear. While more mouths speaking is \ngood, having more mouthpieces guarantees neither diversity of opinion \nnor information. The point is the amalgamation of control in media \noutlets. We cannot ignore the fact that diversity of discourse in \nAmerica is an essential underpinning.\n  When it comes to changes allowing media mergers in over 150 markets \nrepresenting 98 percent of the American population, and when reports \nshow that 5 companies or fewer control about 60 percent of television \nhouseholds in just the next few years, we should all be very concerned.\n  I know some have said the process and the outcome of the FCC media \nownership, as we heard from the FCC Commissioners before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, were preordained by the statutes and by the courts. \nThe courts did not prescribe what the limits should be. Neither did \nthey set a date certain. Rather, what they said was that whatever the \nlimits are, there needs to be a solid factual record demonstrating that \nthey are in the public interest.\n  How does one determine what is in the public interest? It is \naggressively seeking the input of all stakeholders--not just simply \nnotifying the public, notifying the Congress, and that simple \ndisclosure is, in and of itself, sufficient. Absolutely not--not in \nthis unprecedented realm of issues.\n  When we look at the record, what we find is that the FCC only held \none public hearing. The committee urged them to conduct a series of \npublic hearings across the country. But they only held one public \nhearing. Even with one public hearing, the FCC received an \nunprecedented amount of input from the public when it came to this \nissue. Even though they did not have the opportunity to participate in \npublic hearings, they sent more than 700,000 e-mails, letters, and \ncalls from across the country.\n  This is unprecedented in the history of the FCC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to S.J. Res. 17. I had the opportunity \nto make a full statement last week. In my time as chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, no issue has erupted so rapidly and evoked \nsuch passion from the public as media consolidation. These are \ncritically important decisions.\n  If we could have a little straight talk this morning, if the Senate \npasses this resolution, there is no objective observer that believes \nthe House will act accordingly. Now, the Senator from North Dakota may \nthink it is important to have this Senate on record, and I don't \ndisagree with that at all. Any prospects of it becoming a reality is \nminimal, at best. We should all recognize that.\n  Second, all kinds of allegations have crept in about various \nmotivations on both sides of this issue. Some have been accused of \nwanting to return to the fairness doctrine. Some are saying it is \nbecause of ideological bias, dislike of talk radio, or dislike of the \nNew\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\nYork Times acquiring more cable companies and media. I don't accept any \nof those arguments from both the right and left. There is legitimate \nbasis for concern about continued consolidation of the media. This is \nnot the appropriate vehicle for addressing that in 4 hours of debate \nand a blanket repudiation of regulations, some of which have been good, \nin my view, because they have reined in, at least to some degree, the \ncontinued consolidation in the most egregious and most incredible media \nconsolidation, and that is radio in America today.\n  We have legislation passed through the Commerce Committee, S. 1046, \nwhich after being composed, marked up, amended, and debated in the \nCommerce Committee is on the calendar and ready for floor \nconsideration. If we are serious about addressing this issue, we should \ndo it by calling up from the calendar for debate and amendment S. 1046 \nand we can explore the myriad and complex aspects of this issue.\n  For example, the Appropriations Committee has now added, I am told, \nto their bill the 45-percent cap being rolled back to 35 percent. \nAccording to BusinessWeek magazine, the 45-percent cap has become a \nrallying symbol, but the regulations that would truly reorder America's \nmedia landscape and affect local communities have flown under the \nradar. These allow companies to snap up not only two to three local TV \nstations in a market but also a newspaper and up to eight radio \nstations.\n  If the courts and Congress are worried about the dangers of media \nconsolidation, they will have to resist calling it a day after \ndispensing with the network cap and go after the rules with real bite. \nAs it now stands, TV's big networks will be losers among media outlets, \nthanks mostly to vociferous lobbying by independent TV affiliates. With \nstrong ties to lawmakers who depend on them for campaign coverage, the \naffiliates have succeeded in getting a House vote against the 45 \npercent and will likely see a rerun of that episode when the Senate \nvotes by October.\n  With Fox and CBS already each owning stations that cover about 40 \npercent of the Nation's audience, going up another 5 percent is not \ngoing to make a dramatic difference. In contrast, opening the \nfloodgates to allow local behemoths to combine newspapers, TV, and \nradio stations under one roof would change media ownership in towns and \ncities, concentrating it in the hands of a few. Even in midsized cities \nsuch as San Antonio, for instance, one company might own the leading \nnewspaper, two TV stations, eight radio stations, and several cable \nchannels.\n  What we are doing is interesting but if we are going to address this \nissue in a serious fashion, and there is reason for concern, we ought \nto do it in a fashion far different from this.\n  I point out that the CRA precludes an agency adopting similar rules \nwithout substantive congressional legislation. In other words, the FCC \nwould be prevented, if this is passed, from acting on any rules \nregarding media consolidation. Almost all Members of this body have \nsome degree of concern at least about some aspect of it.\n  I hope all of our colleagues had the opportunity to see the Wall \nStreet Journal article on September 15 entitled: Show of Strength: How \nMedia Giants Are Reassembling The Old Oligopoly; Mix of Broadcast and \nCable Proves Lucrative in Making Deals.\n  Viacom and its big media peers have been snapping up cable channels \nbecause they are one of the few entertainment outlets generating strong \nrevenue growth these days. More broadly, the media giants have \ndiscovered that owning both broadcast and cable outlets provides \npowerful new leverage over advertisers and cable- and satellite-TV \noperators. The golaiths are using this advantage to wring better fees \nout of the operators that carry their channels and are pressuring those \noperators into carrying new and untried channels. They're also finding \nways to coordinate promotions across their different holdings.\n  Entertainment giants such as Viacom, NBC parent General Electric Co. \nand Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, now reach more than 50 percent of \nthe prime-time TV audience through their combined broadcast and cable \noutlets. The total rises to 80 percent if you include the parents of \nnewer networks--such as New Corp.'s Fox and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s WB--\nand NBC's pending acquisition of Vivendi Universal SA's cable assets, \nestimates Tom Wolzein, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\n  The big media companies are quietly re-creating the ``old programming \noligopoly'' of the pre-cable era, notes Mr. Wolzein, a former executive \nat NBC. Of the top 25 cable channels, 20 are now owned by one of the \nbig five media companies.\n  The idea of owning broadcast networks as well as cable channels is \n``comfortable for people like ourselves,'' says Bob Wright, chairman of \nNBC, which two weeks ago signed a preliminary agreement to acquire \nVivendi Universal's USA and Sci-Fi cable channels, along with the \nUniversal film studio, bolstering a stable of cable channels that \nincludes Bravo, MSNBC and CNBC. ``There has been so much \nconsolidation'' among the distributors that ``unless you are equally \nbig . . . you risk a situation where you can be marginalized,'' says \nViacom President Karmazin.\n  Viacom president Karmazin is a man, who, by the way, I happen to \nadmire enormously.\n  I am not blaming any of these people, executives or organizations, \nfor seeking to gain as much market share as they can. But the reason I \nrefer to this Wall Street Journal article is this is a complex set of \nissues. When we are talking about cable consolidation, cable rates, all \nof the other.\n  Since 1990, almost half of the top 50 cable channels have changed \nhands. Among the big deals: Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ESPN's \nparent, Capital Cites/ABC, and Time Warner's $6.7 billion purchase of \nCNN parent Turner Broadcasting, both negotiated in the summer of 1995. \nIn 2001, Disney bought the Family Channel from News Corp. for $5.2 \nbillion.\n  Last year, NBC bought Bravo for $1.3 billion. CBS, owner of The \nNashville Network--now Spike TV--and Country Music Television, itself \nwas gobbled up in 2000 by MTV's longtime parent, Viacom. Viacom has \nsince added channels such as BET and Comedy Central.\n  Mr. Karmazin recently boasted to investors that the company's \nbroadcast and cable outlets reach 26 percent of the Nation's viewers in \nprime time, a significantly bigger share than any other company. Having \nsuch a big market share is ``real important for lots of reasons, in \nterms of dealing with advertisers and our cable partners,'' he told \ninvestors.\n  There is something going on here that deserves investigation, not \njust a simple CRA vote and then move on. At the hearing before the \nCommerce Committee, all five FCC Commissioners agreed--all five, for \none of the first times I have ever heard the FCC Commissioners agree to \nanything--the consolidation of radio that occurred in local markets has \nbeen excessive. While it received little credit amid the outcry against \nthe regulations, the FCC attempted to address this problem by \ndescribing new market definitions designed to tighten the limits on \nlogical radio ownership.\n  The resolution would have the perverse consequences of eliminating \nthese efforts and prohibiting the FCC from adopting similar measures in \nthe future, a move that surely will be applauded in the corporate \noffices of large radio station groups that hope to perpetuate their \nability to benefit from existing loopholes.\n  Likewise, this resolution could have grave unintended consequences \nfor other media ownership rules the Commission decided to leave \nunchanged.\n  For example, the FCC retained its limit on the number of local radio \nstations one entity may own and retained its rule prohibiting one \nentity from owning two of the four largest television networks. The \ndecision to retain these rules will also be rejected if the resolution \nis enacted. If the FCC were to read this statute, as many have, as \nlimiting its permissible actions in biennial review proceeding to \nexclusively deregulatory changes to its rules, the FCC may have no \nchoice but to raise the number of stations that one entity is permitted \nto own in a local market or eliminate the dual rhetoric network rule. \nThis cannot be the outcome intended by the sponsors of this resolution, \nthough it is one that could conceivably result.\n  Finally, the use of the CRA in the present case will create a \nregulatory\n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\nvoid likely to be filled only by uncertainty about the status of the \nFCC's media ownership rules. As a result, all of the rules, even those \nthat the proponents of the resolution favor, may be vulnerable to court \naction. The absence of an affirmative congressional directive will cast \nconsiderable doubt on the FCC's ability to enforce its previous rules \ngiven that one of the FCC's previous attempts to retain the rules was \nfound by the DC Circuit to be arbitrary and capricious. Another was \nfound not to have justified that the rules are necessary in the public \ninterest. In both cases, the DC Circuit remanded the rules to the FCC \nand directed the agency to either articulate a justification for \nretaining the rules or modify them. The lack of an enforceable FCC \norder will leave these court orders unanswered, risking additional \ncourt action that relaxes the rules even further or even invalidates \nthem entirely.\n  My point is that we have a very complex set of issues to address. I \nbelieve there is reason for concern about media consolidation, as the \nSenator from North Dakota has fairly overused the comment that there \nare many voices and one ventriloquist. At the same time this action \nwould invalidate both good and bad, this action would make many believe \nthat we have resolved the issue and moved on.\n  On the calendar is S. 1046, a bill that was properly considered and \nreported out by the Commerce Committee. That is the way we should be \naddressing this issue so that this issue can be fully ventilated and \nfully understood.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I oppose the Dorgan Resolution, S. 17, which \nwould block the entire Federal Communications Commission's ruling \nrevising the rules on media ownership.\n  Since the FCC issued this ruling on June 2, 2003, a multitude of \ninterest groups have proclaimed that this decision represents a serious \nblow to democracy in America as we know it. To say that this claim is a \ngross exaggeration is a huge understatement.\n  While I do not agree with every element of the FCC ruling, I must \nadmit that I believe it would be short sighted to block the ruling \nentirely. I also think that every stakeholder who is concerned about \nthis ruling should look at the facts that prompted the FCC to make this \nruling. Furthermore, I believe it is imperative that one examine the \nactual facts in the ruling in order to dispel some of the myths that \nhave surfaced with regard to it.\n  In its ruling, the FCC incrementally increased the national TV \nownership limit from 35 percent to 45 percent. What this says is that \none company can own TV stations reaching no more than 45 percent of \nU.S. TV households. It does not mean that one company can own up to 45 \npercent of all TV stations across the country. In addition, the ruling \ndoes not even say that a company can own stations whose programs reach \n45 percent of the viewing public or market share.\n  For example, Newscorps, Fox, the second largest owner of stations \ncurrently owns 37 or 2.8 percent of the 1,340 commercial stations \nacross the country. Under the new 45 percent cap set forth in the FCC \nruling, Newscorps would be able to acquire, at best, another five \nstations nationwide. In light of this information and in light of the \ncourt mandates, the FCC action on this issue hardly represents a \nmassive increase.\n  The FCC promulgated this increase in response to several court \ndecisions striking down specific limits on the number of broadcast \nentities that one company may own. Since 1998, the FCC has lost five \nout of five cases that challenged its previous media ownership rules. \nAccording to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 ``carries with it a presumption in \nfavor of repealing or modifying the ownership rules (Fox v. FCC).''\n  In the Fox v. FCC decision, which was handed down in February 2002, \nthe court ruled that the FCC's action--on broadcast ownership limits--\nwas ``arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law'' because ``it \nfailed to give an adequate reason for its decision'' to keep the 35 \npercent cap. In the same case, the court ruled that the commission \n``provided no analysis on the state of competition in the television \nindustry to justify its decision to retain the national cap.'' The \ncourt in its remanding decision ordered the FCC to rethink its rules on \nmedia ownership.\n  Another aspect of the FCC ruling involved the modification of the \nFCC's rules relating to newspaper/broadcast cross ownership and radio-\ntelevision cross ownership. In its ruling, the FCC replaced these rules \nwith a new set of cross media limits. It is important to understand \nthat the FCC did not totally repeal the 28-year-old newspaper/broadcast \nownership ban in all markets; it simply modified its rule with newer \nbroadcast/cross ownership regulations to reflect the changing \ncircumstances of today's diverse media marketplace.\n  Under the new FCC rules, in small markets with three or fewer TV \nstations the ban will continue to be enforced. In mid-sized markets, \nwith 4 to 8 TV stations, limited cross ownership is allowed. In diverse \nand competitive markets with 9 or more TV stations, the ban is lifted \nentirely.\n  This is the major decision in the FCC ruling that I support, and it \nis the main reason that I cannot support the Dorgan resolution. Simply \nput, the previous rule supporting the cross ownership ban is outdated \ngiven the current diversity and multiple sources of news information in \ntoday's media marketplace.\n  When the broadcast/newspaper cross ownership provisions were adopted \nin 1975, the three television networks of the time held more than 90 \npercent of the viewing audience and only 17 percent of households \nsubscribed to cable TV. However, due to the technological revolution of \nthe past two decades, there has been a significant increase in the \nnumber of news and information sources with the widespread availability \nof cable TV, satellite and the internet as well as substantial increase \nin the number of radio and TV stations, magazines, and free weekly \nnewspapers.\n  Yet, despite the availability of these new media sources, many groups \nare still objecting to this modest change in media cross ownership. \nThey feel that this modification will drastically reduce the quality \nnews and diversity of voices in the media. I believe there is strong \nevidence to refute this claim.\n  Unlike other ownership rules, the FCC has actual historical data on \nwhat the effect of relaxing this ban will have on the media market. \nThat is because there are already 49 media cross ownership entities \nthat were grandfathered prior to the implementation of this ban in \n1975. Some of these cross ownership entities are in major markets such \nas New York, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Milwaukee.\n  All of these existing cross ownership entities have had practically \nno adverse impact on competition. In the past 23 years, there has been \nno major court case, FCC, FTC, or Department of Justice, DOJ, action \nobjecting to any of these grandfathered cross ownership media entities. \nFurthermore, the FCC informs me that no entity has ever challenged a \nlicense renewal of a TV station owned by a newspaper in the last 25 \nyears. Two recent studies, one by the FCC and one by the Project for \nExcellence in Journalism, also found that co-owned newspaper/broadcast \ncombinations provide higher quality and more news and informational \nprogramming than other broadcast stations.\n  In light of this evidence, I feel that the FCC's ruling on newspaper/\nbroadcast cross ownership needs to be preserved, and therefore, I \noppose the Dorgan resolution.\n  As stated previously, I do not agree with every aspect of the FCC \nruling. I do not support the new method by which the FCC will utilize \nto define a local radio market. This new definition has resulted in \nmany companies that own multiple radio stations exceeding the new \nstation caps. While the FCC did grandfather all existing combinations \nto ensure that these radio companies would not be forced to divest \nstations that they legally acquired, it imposed harsh restrictions on \nthe transferability or resale of these newly non-compliant radio \nstation clusters.\n  Under the new market definition, those radio clusters that no longer \ncomply with local radio market limits may only be sold intact to small \nbusinesses. If a ``small business buyer'' cannot be found, a cluster \nowner must break up his or her cluster and sell the stations \nindividually. I believe that this strict resale provision unfairly \npenalizes certain radio broadcasters, who\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nacquired their stations in good faith under the previous ownership \nframework.\n  By narrowing the eligible market of buyers, this resale provision \nwould prevent a radio cluster seller from receiving fair-market value \non his or her investment. If most companies are prohibited from bidding \non a cluster, the prices offered in these transactions will be \nconsiderably smaller than otherwise.\n  I also believe this resale provision will only make bigger radio \nconglomerates stronger because it will result in the immediate breakup \nof clusters that directly compete with these conglomerates.\n  I intend to petition the FCC for reconsideration of these new local \nradio rules set forth in the FCC order. However, I do not believe that \nthe entire FCC order should be disapproved, and that is why I oppose \nthe Dorgan resolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, drastic times require drastic measures and \nthat's why I stand with my colleagues today in support of S.J. Res. 17, \ndisapproving the FCC's June 2 vote to relax, and in some cases \neliminate, the rules that safeguard one of our Nation's most precious \npossessions, the right of free and diverse exchange of opinion. This \ndecision will pave the way for even greater concentration of media \nownership in the hands of a select few and deprive the public to the \ndiversity of viewpoints that are so important to democracy and \nobjective reporting in this country.\n  In response to the FCC's action, Senator Dorgan and I along with \nseven other colleagues sponsored S.J. Res. 17. This resolution would \nsimply declare the FCC's June 2 rules on media ownership without force \nor effect and would leave in place the media ownership rules that \nexisted prior to the Commission's decision.\n  With the FCC's June vote on media ownership, the ``deregulatory \nexpress'' is out of the station--and we are now on track toward even \ngreater ownership concentration and unfettered consolidation. Now, some \nhave said that, with exponentially more media outlets than ever before, \nwe should have nothing to fear. But while more mouths speaking is good, \nhaving more mouthpieces guarantees neither diversity of information nor \nopinion. The point is the amalgamation of control in media outlets and \nits impact on content--especially with the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans receiving their news from television and newspapers.\n  We cannot ignore that diversity of discourse in America is an \nessential underpinning of our society and our democracy. So when it \ncomes to changes allowing media mergers in over 150 markets \nrepresenting 98 percent of the American population--and when reports \nshow that five companies or fewer could control about 60 percent of \ntelevision households in just the next few years--we should all be very \nconcerned.\n  I know that some have said, well, the process and the outcome of the \nFCC's media ownership review were essentially preordained by statute \nand the courts. But the courts never proscribed what the limits should \nbe. Neither did they set a date certain by which the FCC must have \nconcluded its process. What the court did say is that, whatever the \nlimits are, there needs to be a solid factual record demonstrating they \nare in the public interest.\n  And what is the best way to determine public interest? It's to go \nabove and beyond in notifying and providing full disclosure to the \npublic and Congress, and aggressively soliciting input from all \nstakeholders--so the public can be confident the best possible decision \nhas been reached. The FCC failed to do this. With more than 700,000 \nindividuals and groups weighing in against the FCC's rule change, the \nCommission held only one public hearing on the subject of media \nownership, I can't help but think there must be a better way.\n  Let me speak to the FCC's modification of the cross ownership ban, \none of the more devastating changes made by the Commission on June 2. \nMany of us represent States that have communities with only one \nnewspaper, under the new rules the FCC would allow that single \nremaining paper to be purchased by the dominant television broadcaster \nin the area. In the context of other FCC rules, the agency recognized \nthat it is bad for local competition to allow 2 of the top 4 broadcast \noutlets to be consolidated, but in this context, the FCC is allowing \nthe top TV station to buy the top newspaper in almost every media \nmarket in the country. Newspapers are one of the most important sources \nof independent reporting. When the leading TV station gobbles up the \npaper, what happens to the other TV broadcasters in the market? They \nsimply can't compete at the same level. It seems apparent that the \nremaining TV stations do less news, or they move to softer news \nformats. This isn't good for news, this isn't good for democracy.\n  If the FCC had acted to create more voices--perhaps by requiring \nthose broadcasters who want a television-newspaper combination to start \na new newspaper rather than just buying one--I could see the wisdom in \ntheir decision. Instead, the FCC has acted to reduce the total number \nof voices in communities all across the country. Some say that the \nFCC's decision will allow these newspaper/broadcast combinations in \nover 190 media markets, covering 98 percent of America's population. \nSince the newspaper/broadcast rule was put in place in 1975, we have \nalready lost two-thirds of our independent newspaper owners. Let me \nreiterate that: two-thirds of our independent newspaper owners have \ndisappeared since 1975. And somehow we're going to make democracy \nbetter by further reducing the number of independent newspaper owners \nby allowing broadcaster television owners to buy them--it just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  The issue of media ownership goes to the heart of our democracy and \nthe crux of the way in which we form our opinions on other issues of \ncritical importance. We need to be extremely careful that in \nderegulation we don't undermine diversity in the marketplace of ideas \nand information. I look forward to continuing my work in this area and \nurge the public to keep the pressure on Congress to undo the damage \nunleashed by the FCC on June 2. I ask that my colleagues support S.J. \nRes. 17.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise to outline my concerns about Senator \nDorgan's resolution to disapprove the Federal Communications \nCommission's June 2, 2003 decision to relax the broadcast media \nownership rules.\n  The FCC's decision to increase the proportion of market share \nbroadcasters may own in any given market from 35 percent to 45 percent \nand to give newspaper owners the ability to own radio stations and vice \nversa has raised significant questions relating to the proper scope of \nregulation and protection of our fundamental First Amendment values.\n  As a procedural matter, I am concerned about the Senate acting on the \nDorgan resolution given the pending court proceedings reviewing the \nFCC's rule modifications. On September 3, 2003, in Prometheus Radio \nProject v. Federal Communications Commission, the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals stayed the effective date of the FCC's new rules, pending \nresolution of the appeal on the merits. No. 03-3388, 2003 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 18390. Given the procedural status of the FCC's rules, it is \npremature for the Senate to act on the Dorgan resolution. A more \nprudent course for the Senate is to await the Court of Appeals \ndecision, review it carefully, and then determine what action, if any, \nis warranted.\n  With respect to the substance of the FCC's rule modifications, I want \nto reiterate my strong support of the bedrock principles underlying the \nFCC's regulation of our Nation's media: diversity of viewpoints; \nlocalism; and competition. I have been--and remain--committed to these \nprinciples, particularly with respect to examining critical regulatory \nand enforcement issues surrounding increased concentration of our \nNation's media outlets. We must preserve our fundamental First \nAmendment values by protecting our marketplace of ideas--that is, \nfreedom of expression and diversity of viewpoints.\n  When it comes to ensuring competition and diversity in our media \nmarkets, I have not--and will not--analyze the issue by blindly \ncondemning all merger consolidations. To me, ``big'' is not necessarily \nbad. Rather, the issue of media consolidation requires a careful \nweighing of our Nation's interest in promoting competition and \ndiversity.\n  In my view, such an analysis requires careful examination of the \npotential\n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\nfor anti-competitive conduct, rather than adherence to inflexible \nregulatory restrictions or hard and fast enforcement rules. Market \nforces--not Federal across-the-board regulations--will ensure that \nconsumers benefit from a merger or consolidation in the media industry.\n  Like many of my Senate colleagues, I am concerned about the health \nand well-being of the small and mid-sized media companies in our \nnation. In the State of Utah, we have many excellent small and mid-\nsized media companies who provide a great service to all Utahns. To \nthis end, traditional antitrust enforcement can more effectively and \nefficiently protect competition and enhance diversity than regulatory \none-size-fits-all approaches. I believe appropriate enforcement of our \nnation's antitrust laws will provide greater protection to small and \nmid-sized media owners than any arbitrary FCC rules.\n  In light of all of these considerations, I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Dorgan resolution. Given the significant interest in the \nissue here in the Senate, we should monitor the court proceedings \nreviewing the FCC rule. Once the Court has acted, we should then \ndetermine what appropriate steps, if any, are needed to preserve and \nprotect our bedrock First Amendment principles of media ownership: \ndiversity, local programming and competition.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan \nresolution, and in the hope that the FCC will take a careful, second \nlook at the changes it made to media ownership rules.\n  Not everything the FCC did was something I would oppose. For \ninstance, I support what the FCC did in terms of allowing companies to \nown a combination of television, radio, and newspapers in the largest \nof media markets, like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York or San Francisco.\n  But on the whole, the new FCC rules raise some very real concerns \nthat one or two national companies may begin to dominate too much of \nthe news and other content delivered to American homes.\n  The American experiment has been one of free press, diversity of \nvoices, fair competition, and the ability to hear, and to be heard. \nThat experiment, in my opinion, has been a resounding success.\n  Of course, the world has changed, and will continue to do so. As a \nresult, it is sensible for our regulatory agencies to revisit outdated \nrules and modify them to better suit changing technologies and the \nchanging realities of a more crowded, more advanced nation.\n  Nevertheless, it is possible to go too far in trying to address these \nchanging realities, and I believe that the FCC has gone too far in \ncrafting some of these new media ownership rules. For instance, in \nallowing a broadcast network to own and operate local broadcast \nstations that reach, in total, up to forty-five percent of U.S. \ntelevision households, instead of thirty-five percent under the old \nrules, the FCC has opened the door to vast conglomerates of news \nstations all feeding the same content to almost half the people in the \ncountry.\n  We don't know how or even whether this would happen, but the \npotential for eliminating local content and reducing the diversity of \nopinions presented on television is simply too great.\n  Likewise, the cross-ownership rules--the rules that determine whether \na company can own both television and newspapers in the same market, or \ntelevision and radio, and so on--raise some concerns for markets with \njust four of five television stations.\n  In those small- to medium-sized markets, with between four and eight \ntelevision stations, combinations are limited to one of the following:\n  One daily newspaper, one television station, and up to half of the \nradio station limit under the local radio ownership rule for that \nmarket; one daily newspaper, and up to the radio station limit under \nthe local radio ownership rule for that market, but no television \nstations; or two television stations, if permissible under the local \ntelevision ownership rule, and up to the radio station limit under the \nlocal radio ownership rule for that market, but no daily newspapers.\n  The old rule prohibited common ownership of a full-service broadcast \nstation and a daily newspaper within the same city. In fact, according \nto the Congressional Research Service, when it adopted the rule in \n1975, the commission not only prohibited future combinations between \nnewspapers and broadcast stations, but also required existing \ncombinations in highly concentrated markets to divest holdings to come \ninto compliance within 5 years. But under this new rule, one company \ncould own the largest television station in town, the only newspaper, \nand half the radio stations. It is easy to see how, in these mid-sized \nmarkets, the amount of diverse content would rapidly diminish.\n  On the other hand, I am not as concerned with the new rules \npertaining to larger markets like Los Angeles. In a market with more \nthan two dozen television stations and countless radio stations and \nnewspapers, it is far less likely that one or two companies could come \nto control enough of the media market to truly stifle diversity of \nopinion or competition among content sources.\n  So it is my hope that the FCC will go back and reexamine these new \nrules, keeping in mind the concerns of Congress and the American \npeople, who have spoken out loud and clear about this issue. Fix what \nneeds to be fixed, keep what is not broken. But come up with a new set \nof rules that makes sense for all Americans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the \nimplications of too much media concentration. During the Senate \nconsideration of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, I voted for an \namendment authored by Senator Dorgan to keep the Television National \nBroadcast Cap at 25 percent of television households that a broadcast \ncompany could reach through its local broadcast stations. I opposed \nincreasing the cap to 35 percent as the 1996 bill allowed.\n  In June the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, voted to adopt an \norder to relax current media ownership rules. I am a cosponsor of S.J. \nRes. 17, authored by Senator Dorgan, being considered by the Senate \ntoday to disapprove of the FCC ruling to lift media ownership \nrestrictions. Loosening current media concentration restrictions would \nallow the media to become less responsive to local concerns and less \nlikely to represent broad and diverse viewpoints. This is not in the \npublic interest and should not be allowed.\n  Today Members of the Senate can oppose these detrimental rule changes \nthat will result in greater media concentration and less consumer \nchoice by voting to disapprove them under the Congressional Review Act.\n  I have supported the congressional review of rules dating back even \nbefore I came to the Senate. And I am proud and pleased that we have \nthe opportunity to use it to stop this FCC rule today. This is exactly \nthe situation in which the legislative review process is not only \nuseful but necessary.\n  When I first ran for the Senate in 1978, legislative review was \nactually a part of my platform. With all of the power executive \nagencies have we need to have a mechanism by where the politically \naccountable--that is the elected officials--can have a direct say in \nthe rules and regulations issued by Executive Branch agencies. These \nagencies are supposed to be carrying out the will of Congress, and we \nhave not only the right, but the responsibility to oversee their \nactions.\n  I joined forces in the late 1970's and early 1980's with then \nCongressman Elliott Levitas in the House. In fact, along with Senator \nDavid Boren of Oklahoma, we got the legislative veto passed. But that \nlaw was held unconstitutional by the courts in the Chadha case because \nit allowed for a one house veto. The court ruled that legislation \nsubject to the President's veto power is necessary to avoid violating \nthe principle of separation of powers.\n  We then fought to establish a congressional review process. It was \nwith the bipartisan effort of Senators Harry Reid and Don Nickles \nalmost 10 years ago, that we finally got legislative review enacted \ninto law and I was proud to be part of that effort.\n  And I'm glad to see that what many of us argued decades ago in \nsupport of this review process has proven to be true. This \ncongressional review process is a two-edged sword. Some opponents \nargued it would be used only to limit\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\nvaluable social programs, but we proponents argued that it was neutral \npolitically--that it could be just as useful to protect against an \nagency that is regulating too little as it could be to rein in an \nagency that is regulating too much, or as with the case of the FCC, \nregulating unwisely.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, issued rules making changes to long-\nstanding limits on the types and amounts of media outlets that can be \nowned and controlled by a single company. These rule changes \ndrastically increase the ability of a few companies to control access \nto information in this country. The rule changes undermine the public \ninterest and do nothing to ensure diversity of viewpoints, \n``localism,'' coverage of events in local communities by people who are \na part of that community, or to ensure that healthy competition exists \namongst media outlets.\n  The American people know these changes are not in the public \ninterest, and that is why I have heard directly from more than 1,650 of \nmy constituents urging Congress to overturn the FCC's actions.\n  Specifically, the rule changes adopted by the FCC earlier this year \nwould allow a single company to control television stations with access \nto almost half of the American broadcast audience. How that can be \nbilled as increasing competition or diversity of viewpoint is a \nmystery. Given that these rules were written with only one public \nhearing and without opportunity for public comment, it is not \nsurprising that they fail to reflect the public interest.\n  It is important to recognize that overturning these rules is not just \nabout preventing additional domination of the airwaves. It is about \nensuring the survival of local newspapers that genuinely know and are a \npart of the community.\n  The rule changes would allow the sole or dominant newspaper in a city \nto merge with the top broadcaster in 200 of the 210 media markets in \nthe country! That would mean 98 percent of the American public could \neffectively lose an independent voice in their community. Already, \nsince 1975, two thirds of independent newspaper owners have ceased to \nexist, leaving only 290 independent newspapers in a country of 292 \nmillion people.\n  If these rules are allowed to take effect, it will mean fewer \nreporters on the ground chasing stories in our local communities, and \nless local investigative journalism. It would make it possible for \nindividual markets to be dominated by a single newspaper/TV \nconglomerate which could control well over half the news audience and \ntwo-thirds of the reporters in a given local market.\n  Inevitably, the merging of broadcasters and newspapers reduces the \nnumber of voices in individual markets and threatens to place too much \ncontrol over local news and information in the hands of too few \ncompanies. Repackaging and repeating stories produced in other venues \nis not the same as real reporting of local news.\n  One of the most common refrains that we hear to justify this \ntremendous change is that new outlets for news and information are now \navailable. While I firmly believe that we are only at the cusp of an \ninformation age that will drastically change how we receive \ninformation, it makes no difference if the new access points are \ncontrolled by fewer people.\n  The reaction to these rules has been quick and sure. I have heard \nfrom over 1,650 of my constituents directly, an additional 10,000 \nthrough the Move On petition. The House and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee have taken action to reverse the increase in the cap on \nbroadcast audience in the appropriations process, and the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals has temporarily halted implementation of these rules. \nBut the clearest way to send a message to the FCC that these rules \ncannot stand is to pass this resolution disapproving the rule changes. \nWe expect the FCC to be a watchdog not a lapdog.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution as a first step in \nreinvigorating competition and preserving local control in mass media.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to support the Senate resolution to \noverturn the Federal Communications Commission's, FCC, decision to \nrelax our Nation's media concentration rules. That decision threatens \nour democracy by placing more power over what we see and hear in the \nhands of fewer big interests.\n  The voices of those who oppose the FCC decision range from Bill \nClinton to Bill Safire, from the National Rifle Association to the \nNational Organization for Women. I am particularly disappointed with \nthe manner in which the agency has ignored these voices. The FCC held \nonly one public hearing on these rules. But commissioners and their \nstaff met with just one firm lobbying on behalf of big media more than \n30 times.\n  The agency received more than 700,000 letters opposing the relaxation \nof the rules and only a handful supporting that decision but failed to \ntake that overwhelming public sentiment into consideration. I reject \nthe FCC rule because the FCC ignored the people's concerns.\n  Congress must send the agency a clear bipartisan message--the \nairwaves belong to the American people, not to you and not to a small \ngroup of media elites. The FCC must be forced to address the concerns \nof the American people. The people know that the FCC decision to relax \nour media ownership threatens democratic discourse and participation. \nIt will allow massive media giants to grow--media giants that already \nuse multiple media outlets to promote their views and overwhelmingly \ndominate public debate.\n  The courts told the FCC to explain why the rules were justified. With \nthe more than 700,000 public comments opposing relaxation of the rules, \nthe agency had that justification. The American people understand that \nit cannot be in the public interest to further relax the rules that \nprotect the public's access to multiple sources to information and \nmedia. My office alone has received 4600 letters and e-mails on the \nissue.\n  The FCC is charged with protecting the public interest. In this case, \nI believe the commission has failed and Congress must act.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, in June, the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, issued an order that modified its media ownership \nrules in accordance with the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The modified \nrules increased from 35 percent to 45 percent of households the cap \ngoverning broadcast network ownership. The new rules also make easier \nnewspaper-broadcast cross ownership by largely lifting the ban \nprohibiting a newspaper from buying a TV or radio station in the same \nmarket.\n  S. J. Res. 17 would overturn all aspects of the FCC ruling. I do not \nbelieve the FCC ruling is without flaw, but a blanket negation of the \nrule-making is not an appropriate response. Though I am not in favor of \nthe increased cap governing broadcast network ownership, I do support \nthe modified newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. I believe the \nrelaxed cross ownership ruling encourages a concordant relationship \nbetween newspapers and television stations that will offer a higher \nstandard of quality in news content and reporting. This, in turn, reaps \ninnumerable benefits for communities across America. As I believe the \nvalue of the modified cross ownership ruling usurps the potential \ndangers of the increased cap governing broadcast network ownership, I \ncannot support S. J. Res. 17.\n  To unequivocally vacate all aspects of the FCC ruling is to do a \ndisservice to incalculable citizens across this country who will \nbenefit from the modified newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. For \nthe aforementioned reasons, I am voting ``no'' on S. J. Res. 17.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. In a strong democracy, a variety of views \nmust be available to citizens. Protections are essential so that \nminority views can be heard. That was the vision of America's founders \nwhen they drafted the First Amendment to the Constitution, and it has \nserved the Nation well. Its principles are especially important today. \nNeither the broadcast industry nor anyone else is entitled to a \nmonopoly over the dissemination of information in our society.\n  The presence of a diversity of voices, each contributing to our \nnational discourse, is essential for the functioning of our democratic \nsociety. And the best way to foster that diversity is through \ncompetition.\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\n  Today, however, an increasingly serious problem is being caused by \nthe buyouts of local broadcast stations by national media \nconglomerates. Competition suffers, and local issues of great \nimportance to individual communities often go unheard.\n  Many of us in Congress are deeply concerned that the remaining \ndiversity of our media will be further be reduced by the Federal \nCommunications Commission's recent decision to weaken media ownership \nrules. The new rules allow even greater media concentration, in spite \nof its adverse effect on competition, the diversity of views, and major \nnational, State, and local priorities.\n  I support Senator Dorgan's proposal to reject these rules, because \nthey are not in the public interest, and would seriously weaken the \nprotections in current law that prevent excessive concentration in the \nbroadcast industry. The public has little to gain and a great deal to \nlose if we allow the FCC to slash the protections that serve them so \nwell.\n  Each weakening of restrictions on media ownership in recent years has \nbeen followed by a burst of new corporate consolidation. Mergers have \nsharply reduced the number of media companies and threaten to erode the \ndiversity and competition that are so important to our Nation. The new \nrules will greatly increase this problem, by allowing fewer firms to \ncontrol the flow of information--locally or nationally. It makes no \nsense for Congress to allow restrictions on the flow of information \nthat is so important to our democracy in this information age.\n  As a trustee of the Nation's public airwaves, the FCC has a \nresponsibility to include the American public in its decision-making \nprocess. Yet the commission has largely ignored public comment and \ndebate before it these sweeping changes in the nation's broadcasting \nrules.\n  The commission agreed to one public hearing on the overall issue, and \nit refused to publicly disclose the rules before they were voted on. \nSuch secrecy is unacceptable. What possible harm can come from public \ndisclosure? The commission's ``notice and comment'' procedure is \nintended to allow an informed debate about these important issues of \npublic policy, but in this case the agency used its procedures to keep \nthe public in the dark.\n  Even with incomplete information, the public reaction against the \nproposed changes has been unique in the history of the FCC. The \ncommission received nearly three quarters of a million comments, and \nover 99.9 percent of them opposed the increase in media consolidation.\n  As a result, a wide variety of organizations--including civil rights \ngroups, churches, family values groups, and labor unions--have called \non the FCC to reconsider the proposal. The National Rifle Association, \nthe National Organization for Women, and many others expressed grave \ndoubt about the wisdom of allowing greater consolidation. Nevertheless, \nthe FCC approved the new rules.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a clear message today to the commission \nand the public by nullifying these rules and reversing this misguided \ndecision the commission to support the interest of media conglomerates \nand ignore the public interest.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on a \njoint resolution, of which I am a proud cosponsor, to disapprove the \nFederal Communications Commission's June 2, 2003, rules designed to \nloosen restrictions on broadcast media ownership. It is the \nCommission's responsibility to ensure that media ownership rules serve \nour national goals of diversity, competition and localism. \nUnfortunately, the Commission's June 2, 2003, ruling fails to meet this \nstandard.\n  The resolution before us today would reverse the FCC's decision to \nchange the national television ownership cap from 35 percent to 45 \npercent, a decision that threatens local and independent voices in \ntelevision. The television industry is undergoing rapid consolidation \nas a handful of national networks have acquired local stations across \nthe country. I am concerned that when local stations are purchased by a \nnational network, independent voices are lost in the media marketplace. \nLocally owned and operated stations are more likely to be responsive to \nlocal needs, interests and values than those stations owned and \noperated by national networks. Indeed many local stations are small \nbusinesses that drive innovative competition. A system of concentrated \nstation ownership will trend toward nationalized programming aimed \nprimarily at maximizing revenue with less concern for local interests \nand less room for competition.\n  The resolution before us today will also reverse the FCC's decision \nto significantly loosen restrictions on cross-ownership of broadcast \nstations and newspapers within single markets. The cross-ownership rule \nis intended to increase or at least maintain the number of independent \neditorial voices in a community. This is especially important in \nsmaller communities where citizens have fewer media operations covering \nlocal matters. While there is scant evidence that weakening this rule \nwill result in significant economic benefit, leading academics and \nmedia experts have argued that doing so will dangerously reduce the \nvenues for independent public discourse.\n  I am also concerned with the process by which the FCC conducted these \nproceedings. This media ownership rulemaking is among the most \nimportant the FCC has undertaken, and it has garnered unprecedented \npublic interest. Despite this, the Commission moved forward with \ndramatic rule changes without first taking public comment on a specific \nproposal. The Commission's outreach was simply insufficient. All \nparties concerned would have been better served if the Commission \npublished a specific proposal and then allowed for a period of public \ncomment before promulgating any rule changes.\n  The Commission's first responsibility is to ensure diversity, \ncompetition and localism. The Commission has no responsibility to \nfacilitate the business plans of the major networks or any other narrow \neconomic interest. I strongly support the disapproval resolution before \nus today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Federal Communications Commission's \nrules pertaining to media ownership have long served a vital function, \nhelping to ensure a diversity of viewpoints in the media marketplace. \nThe FCC's attempt to undo these important rules that have served us so \nwell is misguided and harmful. The FCC's 35 percent cap on national \naudience reach has not only served to promote diversity, it also \nprotects local programming, allowing it to reflect local values and \npreferences. If the cap is increased to 45 percent we can be sure that \nmajor networks will meet or exceed the new threshold, as some companies \nhave done under the current standards, allowing for the acquisition of \nlocal stations while eliminating the unique choices that local \nprogramming can provide.\n  I am also concerned about the FCC's effort to remove the newspaper/\nbroadcast cross-ownership limitations in 80 percent of all media \nmarkets. Currently, cross-ownership rules prevent a single corporation \nfrom becoming too powerful a voice in a given community. Lifting the \ncross-ownership ban will leave many communities reliant on one company \nto decide what they are able to see and hear.\n  There are those who argue that the increase in the number of media \noutlets has obviated the need for such rules. The reality, of course, \ndebunks this notion. While the number of media outlets has increased, \nownership has become more concentrated. What's more, many of the \nlargest new media outlets appear to be owned and controlled by the same \nconglomerates that control traditional media.\n  In light of these facts, it seems illogical that the FCC would \nexacerbate a disturbing trend that is transforming the marketplace of \nideas into little more than a corporate superstore. A recent, troubling \ntendency of the large media companies was highlighted in The Wall \nStreet Journal this week in an article noting these companies' rapid \nacquisitions of cable channels to ``re-create the old programming \noligopoly'' of the pre-cable era. The numbers tell the story. Of the \ntop 25 cable channels, 20 are now owned by one of the big five media \ncompanies, according to The Wall Street Journal article of September \n15, 2003.\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\n  The unsettling statistics extend to other communications branches as \nwell. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the number of owners \nof commercial radio stations has declined by approximately 25 percent \nsince 1996. Even more alarming is the fact that since 1995, ``the \nnumber of entities owning commercial TV stations has dropped by 40 \npercent.''\n  I welcome and strongly encourage the emergence and proliferation of \nnew and different platforms for news and information. We can expect \nthat more and more Americans will gain access to and will use these \nresources. In our democratic society, there still are good and sound \nreasons for encouraging and protecting the diversity of viewpoints \navailable in more traditional media. The FCC--to which the American \npeople have entrusted some of this responsibility--should be working to \ndiversify, not homogenize, the news and information media available to \nthe American public.\n  I ask the Wall Street Journal article of September 15, 2003, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 15, 2003]\n\n          How Media Giants Are Reassembling the Old Oligopoly\n\n                           (By Martin Peers)\n\n       Two years ago, Mattel Inc. gave CBS a choice. The network \n     had refused to broadcast the toymaker's movie ``Barbie in the \n     Nutcracker'' in prime time. So Mattel threatened to pull \n     millions of dollars of advertising from the Nickelodeon cable \n     channel--owned by CBS parent Viacom Inc.\n       Viacom, which had spent a decade bulking up with \n     acquisitions, now wielded its new clout, according to people \n     familiar with the situation. If Mattel made good on its \n     threat, Viacom said, it would be blacklisted from advertising \n     on any Viacom property--a wide swath of media turf that also \n     includes MTV, VH-1, BET, a radio broadcasting empire and even \n     billboards. Mattel backed down, and the Barbie movie ended up \n     running during a less-desirable daytime period.\n       Neither company will comment on the scrape, but Viacom says \n     Mattel remains a ``valued advertising partner.'' More \n     generally, President Mel Karmazin in an interview is blunt \n     about his company's strategy: ``You find it very difficult to \n     go to war with one piece of Viacom without going to war with \n     all of Viacom.''\n       Viacom and its big media peers have been snapping up cable \n     channels because they're one of the few entertainment outlets \n     generating strong revenue growth these days. More broadly, \n     the media giants have discovered that owning both broadcast \n     and cable outlets provides powerful new leverage over \n     advertisers and cable and satellite-TV operators. The \n     goliaths are using this advantage to wring better fees out of \n     the operators that carry their channels and are pressuring \n     those operators into carrying new and untried channels. \n     They're also finding ways to coordinate promotions across \n     their different holdings.\n       Entertainment giants such as Viacom, NBC parent General \n     Electric Co. and Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, now reach \n     more than 50% of the prime-time TV audience through their \n     combined broadcast and cable outlets. The total rises to 80% \n     if you include the parents of newer networks--such as News \n     Corp.'s Fox and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s WB--and NBC's pending \n     acquisition of Vivendi Universal SA's cable assets, estimates \n     Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\n       The big media companies are quietly re-creating the ``old \n     programming oligopoly'' of the pre-cable era, notes Mr. \n     Wolzien, a former executive at NBC. Of the top 25 cable \n     channels, 20 are now owned by one of the big five media \n     companies.\n       The idea of owning broadcast networks as well as cable \n     channels is ``comfortable for people like ourselves,'' says \n     Bob Wright, chairman of NBC, which two weeks ago signed a \n     preliminary agreement to acquire Vivendi Universal's USA and \n     Sci Fi cable channels, along with the Universal film studio, \n     bolstering a stable of cable channels that includes \n     Bravo, MSNBC and CNBC.\n       For the past several years, Viacom and other media \n     companies have pressed the Federal Communications Commission \n     to relax restriction on owning local TV station. One of their \n     main arguments: Their audience is shrinking as cable booms \n     and the TV audience fragments. The original three broadcast \n     networks now capture only 33.7% of the prime-time television \n     audience, down from 69.3% in 1985-86. Cable now boasts a \n     49.3% share, compared with 7.5% in the mid-'80s, according to \n     a Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau analysis of data from \n     Nielsen Media Research.\n       But with the wave of consolidation and the increased reach \n     of the media giants, some cable systems are fighting to keep \n     restrictions on TV-station ownership in place. Cox \n     Enterprises, parent of the fourth-biggest cable operator, Cox \n     Communications, has argued that the big broadcasters are \n     abusing protections granted them under federal law. The \n     broadcasters, Cox argues, are using those protections to \n     charge cable systems more for their cable channels. Cox and \n     others have complained to the FCC that media companies make \n     them accept less-popular cable channels in exchange for \n     carrying their broadcast networks.\n       Media companies counter that their consolidation only puts \n     them on a level playing field with cable operators, who are \n     themselves merging into giants. Comcast Corp.'s acquisition \n     of AT Corp.'s cable division last year gave it a reach of \n     more than 21 million homes, for instance, almost 30% of homes \n     served by cable. Comcast has already begun to tell cable \n     channels it wants to save money on what it pays for \n     programming, setting the scene for increasingly contentious \n     negotiations with big media companies.\n       ``There has been so much consolidation'' among the \n     distributors that ``unless you are equally big . . . you risk \n     a situation where you can be marginalized,'' says Viacom \n     President Karmazin.\n\n\n                          following the money\n\n       In buying up cable channels, the media conglomerates are \n     simply following the money. The music business is shrinking \n     rapidly as piracy eats into sales. Universal Music Group, the \n     world's biggest, is now thought to be valued at $5 billion to \n     $6 billion, less than half what it was a few years ago. The \n     film business is volatile, with a quarter's performance \n     dependent on whether movies bomb or not. The publishing \n     business is steady but grows at a slow pace. Broadcast \n     television's audience is shrinking, and its business model is \n     entirely dependent on advertising revenue, a cyclical \n     business.\n       Cable channels are gushing cash because they generate \n     revenue from two sources--subscriptions and advertising. The \n     subscriptions don't come directly from customers, but through \n     cable-TV services, which operate the vast array of wires and \n     pipelines connected to homes, and through satellite-TV \n     services that beam the signal. For the right to carry the \n     programming on their systems, these cable-operating companies \n     pay a range of monthly fees, from 26 cents a subscriber for \n     VH-1 to more than $2 for ESPN. These fees, for the most part, \n     increase every year, providing a steadily rising annuity for \n     the channel owners.\n       As cable viewership has increased, so has advertising. \n     Since 1980, cable-channel ad revenue has risen from \n     practically nothing to $10.8 billion in 2002, according to \n     the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau. Some channels, \n     meanwhile, are cashing in on strong brand names. Nickelodeon, \n     for one, is a merchandising powerhouse, with products \n     including Dora the Explorer backpacks and SpongeBob \n     SquarePants videogames.\n       The result has been an explosion in profits. MTV earned \n     just $54 million in 1989, estimates Kagan World Media, but is \n     expected to make more than 10 times that much this year. QVC, \n     the home shopping channel, generates so much money that \n     Liberty Media recently agreed to buy full ownership of the \n     channel at a value of about $14 billion--the same value put \n     on all of Vivendi Universal's film and TV assets.\n       Cable channels' surging profits have transformed the bottom \n     lines of their parent companies. E.W. Scripps Co., the 125-\n     year-old Cincinnati newspaper publisher and TV-station owner, \n     now relies on its cable division for much of its profit \n     growth. In 1994, Scripps launched the Home and Garden channel \n     on the initiative of a TV executive, Ken Lowe, amid \n     widespread skepticism. One Scripps newspaper publisher \n     approached Mr. Lowe at the time to complain ``a lot of the \n     cash that I'm making here is being shipped to you . . . You \n     better know what you're doing,'' Mr. Lowe recalls.\n       Nine years later, HGTV has become one of the most popular \n     cable channels with shows such as ``Design on a Dime'' and \n     ``House Hunters.'' Scripps added a controlling stake to the \n     Food Network in 1997. In the second quarter of this year, the \n     impact of cable channels, including the Home and Garden \n     channel and the Food Network, was clear; Newspaper and \n     broadcast-TV profits both fell, while cable-channel profit \n     jumped 70%, helping Scripps's net profit more than double. \n     Scripps stock is trading near its 52-week high of $90.65, up \n     almost 30% for the past 12 months.\n       The publisher who had complained about the cable-channel \n     investment recently thanked Mr. Lowe, now Scripps's CEO, \n     noting that the rise in Scripps's stock price would put his \n     three children through college, Mr. Lowe says.\n       Since 1990, almost half of the top 50 cable channels have \n     changed hands. Among the big deals: Disney's $19 billion \n     acquisition of ESPN's parent, Capital Cities/ABC, and Time \n     Warner's $6.7 billion purchase of CNN parent Turner \n     Broadcasting, both negotiated in the summer of 1995. In 2001, \n     Disney bought the Family channel from News Corp. for $5.2 \n     billion.\n       Last year, NBC bought Bravo for $1.3 billion, CBS, owner of \n     the Nashville Network (now Spike TV) and Country Music \n     Television, itself was gobbled up in 2000 by MTV's longtime \n     parent, Viacom. Viacom has since added channels such as BET \n     and Comedy Central.\n       Mr. Karmazin recently boasted to investors that the \n     company's broadcast and cable outlets reach 26% of the \n     nation's viewers in prime time, a significantly bigger share \n     than any other company. Having such a big market share is \n     ``real important for lots of reasons, in terms of dealing \n     with advertisers and our cable partners,'' he told investors.\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\n       Ad sales and marketing executives from the CBS and MTV \n     Networks divisions meet regularly to share information and \n     plot cross-promotional opportunities. In January 2001, MTV \n     staged the halftime show for the Super Bowl, which was \n     broadcast on CBS, featuring performances from Aerosmith and \n     Britney Spears.\n       Last fall, CBS helped stem a slide in young women viewers \n     of its reality blockbuster series ``Survivor'' with a \n     documentary on the series that ran repeatedly on MTV before \n     the new season of Survivor premiered. The premiere episode of \n     ``Survivor'' on CBS saw a 25% jump in its young female \n     audience, says George Schweitzer, executive vice president of \n     marketing for CBS. CBS promoted its sitcom ``King of Queens'' \n     through a special last Friday on Viacom's Comedy Central \n     cable channel.\n\n\n                         protecting one another\n\n       The broadcast and cable sides of Viacom generally don't try \n     to sell ads jointly, but the common ownership allows them to \n     protect each other's flanks. At a presentation to advertisers \n     last spring, MTV executives compared the audience reach for \n     most of MTV Networks with ABC, NBC, Fox and WB--but CBS's \n     figures weren't included in the breakdown, so that MTV didn't \n     siphon ads from its corporate cousin.\n       Meanwhile, Disney's ownership of both ABC and ESPN allows \n     it to spread out the cost of expensive sports packages such \n     as its deals with the National Football League and the \n     National Basketball Association. ABC Sports is, in fact, \n     overseen by the same executive who runs ESPN, George \n     Bodenheimer, and the two operations regularly promote each \n     other's programming and share talent.\n       Joint ownership of cable and broadcast is particularly \n     valuable in negotiations with cable operators. A 1992 law \n     allows broadcasters to regularly renegotiate the price for \n     carrying TV stations' signal on cable. While broadcasters \n     could charge a cash fee, they usually offer the broadcast \n     stations free in exchange for carrying a new cable channel \n     they've launched. Few viewers would subscribe to cable if \n     ABC, CBS or NBC weren't on the channel line-up, so the cable \n     operators have little leverage.\n       The strategy lets broadcasters add more cable channels, \n     including many narrowly focused networks. Since 1993, big \n     media companies have launched at least 35 new cable channels \n     by bartering the right to carry their broadcast stations, \n     estimates George Callard, an attorney with Cinnamon Mueller, \n     a law firm that is counsel to the American Cable Association.\n       Using such a strategy, cable operators say, Disney has \n     shoehorned its Soapnet cable channel, which features reruns \n     of soaps such as ``General Hospital,'' into services reaching \n     33 million homes. Disney argues that fewer than half of those \n     homes have the channel as a result of a barter arrangement.\n       Cox Enterprises complained in a filing with the FCC in \n     January that Cox Communications has to agree to carry Soapnet \n     nationally in exchange for the right to offer ABC stations in \n     just a few of its markets. A Disney spokesman says Cox is a \n     ``savvy negotiator'' that ``wouldn't have signed the deal \n     unless they found value in it.''\n       Catalina Cable, a cable-TV operator on Catalina Island off \n     the California coast, has only 1,449 customers. Ralph Morrow, \n     Catalina's owner, says he was asked to carry Soapnet when he \n     tried to renew his right to carry a Disney ABC affiliate for \n     the beginning of 2000. He says he suggested paying cash for \n     ABC instead. Disney's response was that the cash fee for ABC \n     would be ``really high,'' he says. ``They made it clear to \n     me'' that he didn't have that option ``at a reasonable \n     price.'' A Disney spokesman says Mr. Morrow mischaracterized \n     its offer, noting that Disney offers operators ``multiple \n     options, including a stand-alone cash offer which we believe \n     to be a fair offer and fair value.''\n       Mr. Morrow, who says he doesn't see the need for a soap-\n     opera channel, now pays Disney 11 cents a subscriber for \n     Soapnet. Disney responds that surveys of viewers have shown \n     Soapnet to be popular. The channel drew 97,000 viewers in \n     July and August, according to Nielsen. In the same period, \n     HGTV--which is available in about two and a half times as \n     many homes--averaged 457,000 viewers.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nresolution. I say this as someone who is unhappy with the core aspects \nof the FCC's ruling. I disagree with the move to lift the 35 percent \nnational television viewership cap. I believe the 35 percent ceiling \nhas served us well in preserving the goals of competition, localism, \nand diversity.\n  However, the decision was extremely comprehensive and complicated and \nincluded some changes which I do favor. For example, I strongly support \nthe Commission's approach to ease the ill-advised restrictions on \nnewspaper-broadcast cross-ownership. The empirical data from the \nnewspaper/broadcast station combinations that were grandfathered in \nshows that this has allowed for a greater diversity of voices.\n  Miles City in my home State of Montana provides a vivid example. \nKATL-AM and the Miles City Star are one such operation. Each operates \nautonomously and KATL provides valuable local news coverage to the \narea. Through the pooling of resources, smaller stations which might \nnot be viable are able to maintain their economic health and continue \nto serve the local community.\n  Again, I reiterate my strong opposition to the FCC's decision to lift \nthe national broadcast ownership cap to 45 percent from 35 percent. If \nthe major networks are allowed to own even more of their affiliate \nstations, local concerns will have less of a role in shaping what \nprogramming makes it on the air.\n  Affiliate stations that are independently owned may choose, from time \nto time, to preempt network programming that they believe does not \nconform to the mores of their local communities. That is localism. I \nguarantee that the local views of the citizens of Butte, MT differ from \nthose of the citizens in New York City. Independently owned stations \nare answerable only to local demands. So, if the station owners feel \ncertain programming doesn't reflect their local community values, they \nkeep it off the air.\n  Not only will lifting the cap mean that stations are less likely to \npreempt programming, but it also means that there will be less local \ninput into the composition of network schedules. As the networks own \nmore and more of their affiliates, the independently owned affiliates \nwill lose negotiating leverage. In short, you'll see programming \ndecisions made more and more in Los Angeles and New York, instead of in \nlocal markets.\n  We already raised the national television cap in 1996 from 25 percent \nto 35 percent. It would be premature to raise it again so soon.\n  I fully understand the sentiment that lead to this resolution. I \nagree with the concerns of many of my colleagues, particularly on the \ntelevision cap. However, this is not the way to go about it.\n  The Commerce Committee upon which I serve--has moved to protect the \nnational broadcast cap. I also serve on the Appropriations Committee \nand the Commerce, Justice, State bill for this year includes a measure \nto protect the 35 percent cap. I support these moves, which target \nindividual rule changes, rather than the resolution being considered \ntoday, which rolls back the entire decision.\n  Again, I emphasize I am not happy with the FCC ruling. But I don't \nthink the answer is to wipe out every aspect of the FCC ruling with one \nsingle vote. If we are going to get it right, we need to look at each \nregulation and each issue individually. Let's not throw out the baby \nwith the bathwater.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I control the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield to \nme?\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have been going back and forth, and I will yield to \nthe other side and then yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S.J. \nRes. 17, the joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the \nFederal Communications Commission with respect to broadcast media \nownership.\n  I reviewed the press release the FCC issued on June 2 to announce its \nchanges to the ownership rules. The press release was entitled, ``FCC \nSets Limits on Media Concentration.'' The problem with that press \nrelease was that the FCC did not set limits; it virtually abolished \nthem. A majority of the FCC commissioners capitulated to an industry \nthey no longer hold at arms' length.\n  I say capitulated because I read that FCC commissioners and other \nagency officials have taken more than 2,500 trips valued at $2.8 \nmillion since 1995, paid for by the industry the FCC is supposed to \nregulate. How ``arm's length'' is that?\n  As an aside, I am heartened that the FCC reauthorization bill the \nCommerce Committee report puts an end to industry-sponsored travel for \nFCC Commissioners and staff.\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\n  With respect to the ownership rules, it was regrettable that FCC \nChairman Michael Powell saw fit to hold one and only one public hearing \non the subject.\n  And it was regrettable that Chairman Powell appeared to be willing to \ntalk with industry officials and the press about the proposed rule \nchanges, but not with the Commerce Committee, until the rule was \nissued.\n  It was regrettable that the FCC officials went to great lengths to \npoint out that the agency received nearly one million comments and \nconstituent post cards on the rule changes, and then chose to disregard \nthe vast majority of them.\n  It is regrettable that the so-called ``diversity index'' cited as \njustification for further deregulation cannot be used in a petition to \ndetermine if companies are violating ownership limits.\n  It is particularly regrettable that three of the five Commissioners \napparently feel that news is just another commodity, like shoes or \ncars.\n  News is not just another commodity, except to the media barons who \nstand to benefit most from the FCC rule changes.\n  Here is what Lowry Mays, the founder and CEO of Clear Channel, had to \nsay in Fortune magazine recently:\n\n       We're not in the business of providing news and information \n     . . . We're simply in the business of selling our customers \n     products.\n\n  Remember, this is the man whose company owns over 1,200 radio \nstations with some 110 million listeners spread across all 50 States \nand the District of Columbia.\n  So much for the public interest.\n  Over the years, Congress established media ownership rules to ensure \nthat the public would have access to a wide range of news, information, \nprogramming, and political perspectives. Over the years, the courts \nhave repeatedly recognized the public interest goals of diversity, \ncompetition, and localism.\n  Consolidating media ownership means that a few large corporations can \nexercise considerable control over the news.\n  Is it really in the public interest to make it easier for a few \ncompanies to dominate the airwaves and determine what news the American \npeople will, or will not hear?\n  As the distinguished jurist Learned Hand remarked in 1942, ``The hand \nthat rules the press, the radio, the screen, and the far-spread \nmagazine rules the country.''\n  I am the only member of the Commerce Committee from the New York \nmetropolitan area. In my back yard, News Corp. already owns two VHF \nbroadcast stations, a daily newspaper, a broadcast network, a movie \nstudio, a satellite service, and four cable networks. Under the new \nrules the FCC issued, News Corp. will be able to add another TV station \nand own a total of eight radio stations. And do not forget: News Corp. \nis gobbling up DirecTV.\n  That is not diversity. That is not ``fair and balanced.''\n  At a Commerce Committee hearing on media ownership, Mel Karmazin of \nViacom argued that ``Americans are bombarded with media choices via \ntechnology never dreamed of even a decade ago, much less 60 years \nago.''\n  That is true, but misleading. Who owns these media? Viacom owns CBS \nand UPN; 35 television stations that reach 40 percent of the national \nviewing audience; Paramount Studios; and cable channels such as VH1, \nMTV, BET, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and Showtime.\n  Viacom, through Infinity Broadcasting, also owns 185 radio stations \nand has substantial ownership interests in several Internet properties, \nincluding CBS.com and CBSMarketwatch.com. Viacom even owns Blockbuster, \nso it has a significant stake in video and DVD rentals.\n  It should be self-evident that consolidating media ownership would \nmake it possible for a few large corporations to exercise considerable \ncontrol over the news.\n  Media giants also exert enormous control over advertisers. I received \na letter last month from Neil Faber, president of NexGen Media, a \ncompany that specializes in national and spot broadcasting, print, and \noutdoor media buys. He wrote:\n\n       For decades I have been deeply concerned with this \n     direction of increasing concentration of ownership. This \n     concentration limits consumer choice and results in higher \n     advertising rates that, in all probability, have been passed \n     on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for products \n     or services and tends to constrain diversity of viewpoints.\n\n  New York Times columnist William Safire summed up the problem and \nwhat is at stake in a May 22 column. He wrote:\n\n       The overwhelming amount of news and entertainment comes via \n     broadcast and print. Putting those outlets in fewer and \n     bigger hands profits the few at the cost of the many. . . The \n     concentration of power--political, corporate, media, \n     cultural--should be anathema to conservatives. The diffusion \n     of power through local control, thereby encouraging \n     individual participation, is the essence of federalism and \n     the greatest expression of democracy.\n\n  In the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Congress directed the FCC to \nconduct a biennial review of the rule changes the Act contained. Given \nthe complexity of the issue, a biennial review was overly ambitious.\n  Be that as it may, Chairman Powell said during the biennial review \nthat led up to the rule changes proposed in June, ``Getting it right is \nmore important than just getting it done.'' He said that, but then he \ndid the opposite. The FCC got it done, but did not get it right.\n  Getting it right means serving the public interest, not increasing \nownership concentration and boosting profitability for a few companies' \nshare-holders.\n  I hope the Senate will pass this joint resolution to send a strong, \nunequivocal message to the FCC that it got it wrong on June 2.\n  I ask Unanimous Consent that the letter I received from Neil Faber \nand the May 22 op-ed by William Safire that appeared in the New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           NexGen Media Worldwide,\n\n\n                                                 Incorporated,\n\n                                                   August 8, 2003.\n     Senator Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am the founder, President, and \n     Chief Executive Officer of NexGen Media Worldwide Inc., a \n     media company that specializes in the planning and execution \n     of media buys across virtually every medium, including \n     national and spot broadcasting, print, and outdoor. We have \n     been in business almost twenty-five years.\n       As both a media and advertising professional, as an Adjunct \n     Professor of Marketing at NYU for fifteen years, and as a \n     concerned citizen of the U.S. and the State of New Jersey, I \n     am responding to the recent article in The New York Times by \n     Michael K. Powell, Chairman of the Federal Communications \n     Commission on the subject of the FCC's decision that would \n     allow one company to own broadcast stations reaching up to \n     45% of the national market, an increase from the current cap \n     of 35%.\n       For decades, I have been deeply concerned with this \n     direction of increasing concentration of ownership. This \n     concentration limits consumer choice and results in higher \n     advertising rates that, in all probability, have been passed \n     on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for products \n     or services and tends to constrain diversity of viewpoints.\n       It is certainly true that the U.S. has a diverse media \n     marketplace. It is in the spirit of maintaining this \n     diversity that we should avoid concentration of media in the \n     hands of the few. In the past, each local radio station in \n     most markets, as an example, was primarily run by separate \n     entities. While the number of stations is greater, the \n     ownership is by fewer companies. So, this results in fewer \n     independent sources of information (i.e., news, weather, \n     traffic), entertainment, and fewer diverse editorial \n     viewpoints. When one looks at television, the Television \n     Bureau of Advertising shows that from 1980 to the present, \n     the number of television stations available per home grew 8 \n     fold. Yet, the average number of television stations that \n     viewers watch weekly increased by only 2\\1/2\\ times. So, \n     while station options have grown dramatically over this \n     period, relatively speaking, why did the number of stations \n     viewed increase at a dramatically disproportionately lower \n     rate? These facts strongly suggest that there should be more \n     independent outlets, more diversity, with greater freedom of \n     programming choices.\n       It is logical that even if each station in a corporate \n     structure were totally independently run, at some place in \n     this corporate hierarchy the general manager of each station \n     still reports to one or more top level corporate executives \n     whose major responsibilities include providing ``guidance'' \n     to maximize the corporation's profits. This reality further \n     supports the contention that concentration of ownership also \n     tends to inflate advertising prices and limit editorial \n     viewpoints.\n       Mr. Powell writes that the major networks own a small \n     percentage of all television stations. The fact is, however, \n     that the stations owned by the networks include those in the \n     major markets that represent the lion's share of the audience \n     in both the local markets and nationally. Here, too, \n     concentration\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\n     of ownership presents a potential risk to independent and \n     diverse editorials and creates the framework for higher \n     advertising rates. This is analogous to what occurred in this \n     year's Network Television ``upfront'' marketplace in which \n     advertising prices skyrocketed in the area of approximately \n     15% to 20% despite an arguably weak economy. It is \n     interesting to note that the advertising dollars deployed for \n     the upfront were concentrated with just a few mega-media \n     buying services accounting for more than 75% of the \n     advertising spent with the networks.\n       As another example of how concentration of ownership can \n     adversely affect the capacity to effectively negotiate, look \n     at sports programming. It is true, as Mr. Powell states, that \n     many top sports programs have moved to cable and satellite. \n     But, the large media giants also own these outlets, i.e., \n     more concentration. So when negotiating with these cable \n     companies, e.g., advertisers are, in reality, negotiating \n     with the same few media giants who control them.\n       We live in a free society. Limiting ownership and \n     concentrating media power cuts against the grain of free \n     society choice that is indigenous to our democracy. \n     Competition allows for choice and the ability to have greater \n     choice benefits both consumers and the advertising community. \n     This country needs to move towards more independent stations \n     in the future rather than continuing to concentrate media \n     ownership in the hands of the few. It is not whether we \n     should specifically increase the cap from 25% to 45%, it is \n     the direction to more concentration that needs to be \n     reversed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Neil Faber,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2003]\n\n                          The Great Media Gulp\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       The future formation of American public opinion has fallen \n     into the lap of an ambitious 36-year-old lawyer whose name \n     you never heard. On June 2, after deliberations conducted \n     behind closed doors, he will decide the fate of media large \n     and small, print and broadcast. No other decision made in \n     Washington will more directly affect how you will be \n     informed, persuaded and entertained.\n       His name is Kevin Martin. He and his wife, Catherine, now \n     Vice President Dick Cheney's public affairs adviser, are the \n     most puissant young ``power couple'' in the capital. He is \n     one of three Republican members of the five-person Federal \n     Communications Commission, and because he recently broke \n     ranks with his chairman, Michael Powell (Colin's son), on a \n     telecom controversy, this engaging North Carolinian has \n     become the swing vote on the power play that has media moguls \n     salivating.\n       The F.C.C. proposal remains officially secret to avoid \n     public comment but has forced into the open by the two \n     commission Democrats. It would end the ban in most cities on \n     cross-ownership of television stations and newspapers, \n     allowing such companies as The New York Times, The Washington \n     Post and The Chicago Tribune to gobble up ever more \n     electronic outlets. It would permit Viacom, Disney and AOL \n     Time Warner to control TV stations with nearly half the \n     national audience. In the largest cities, it would allow \n     owners of ``only'' two TV stations to buy a third.\n       We've already seen what happened when the F.C.C. allowed \n     the monopolization of local radio: today three companies own \n     half the stations in America, delivering a homogenized \n     product that neglects local news coverage and dictates music \n     sales.\n       And the F.C.C. has abdicated enforcement of the ``public \n     interest'' requirement in issuing licenses. Time was, \n     broadcasters had to regularly reapply and show public-\n     interest programming to earn continuance; now they mail the \n     F.C.C. a postcard every eight years that nobody reads.\n       Ah, but aren't viewers and readers now blessed with a whole \n     new world of hot competition through cable and the Internet? \n     That's the shucks-we're-no-monopolists line that Rupert \n     Murdoch will take today in testimony before the pussycats of \n     John McCain's Senate Commerce Committee.\n       The answer is no. Many artists, consumers, musicians and \n     journalists know that such protestations of cable and \n     internet competition by the huge dominators of content and \n     communication are malarkey. The overwhelming amount of news \n     and entertainment comes via broadcast and print. Putting \n     those outlets in fewer and bigger hands profits the few at \n     the cost of the many.\n       Does that sound un-conservative? Not to me. The \n     concentration of power--political corporation, media, \n     cultural--should be anathema to conservatives. The diffusion \n     of power through local control, thereby encouraging \n     individual participation, is the essence of federalism and \n     the greatest expression of democracy.\n       Why do we have more channels but fewer real choices today? \n     Because the ownership of our means of communication is \n     shrinking. Moguls glory in amalgamation, but more individuals \n     than they realize resent the loss of local control and \n     community identity.\n       We opponents of megamergers and cross-ownership are \n     afflicted with what sociologists call ``pluralistic \n     ignorance.'' Libertarians pop off from what we assume to be \n     the fringes of the left and right wings, but not yet realize \n     that we outnumber the exponents of the new collective \n     efficiency.\n       That's why I march uncomfortably alongside CodePink Women \n     for Peach and the National Rifle Association, between liberal \n     Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens under the banner \n     of ``localism, competition and diversity of views.'' That's \n     why, too, we resent the conflicted refusal of most networks, \n     stations and their putative purchasers to report fully and in \n     prime time on their owners's power grab scheduled for June 2.\n       Most broadcasters of news act only on behalf of the \n     powerful broadcast lobby? Are they not obligated, in the \n     long-forgotten, ``public interest,'' to call to the attention \n     of viewers and readers the arrogance of a regulatory \n     commission that will not hold extended public hearings on the \n     most controversial decision in its history?\n       So much of our lives should not be in the hands of one \n     swing-vote commissioner. Let's debate this out in the open, \n     take polls, get the president on the record and turn up the \n     heat.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this \nresolution. By using the Congressional Review Act, which I worked on \nand helped pass with my colleague and friend Senator Reid from Nevada, \nwe would totally throw out the entire FCC regulation. Some people \ndisagree with parts of the regulation, but we would be throwing out the \nentire regulation.\n  The Senator from Arizona said let's do this the old-fashioned way. \nLet's have hearings and mark up a bill so there is a bill that is going \nthrough the authorizing committee and there is also some language going \nthrough the Appropriations Committee. Maybe those are better and more \nappropriate vehicles than the Congressional Review Act, which rejects \nthe entire regulation.\n  What about the cross ownership rules? Cross-ownership rules say if \none has a newspaper, they cannot own a TV station, or vice versa. Well, \nunless they were grandfathered years ago, they could, but if they are \nnew in the business, they cannot own both. The ban on cross ownership \nwas modified on sound reasoning and solid evidence. The antiquated ban \nshould not be reinstated.\n  My colleague from Nevada, who is now presiding, said things have \nchanged. We now have thousands of radio stations. We have lots of \nopportunities. We have new vehicles. We have the internet. We have \ncable. We have lots of opportunities for people to get their news from \na variety of sources. If we throw out these rules, we are almost saying \nwe want to live by and maintain those old rules, which really are \narchaic and do not work.\n  This is too Draconian of a measure, to throw out the regs in their \nentirety. I urge our colleagues to vote no on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Republican side, 3 minutes 44 seconds. \nOn the Democratic side, there are 10 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will take 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I do not view this issue as one \nthat is driven by ideological bias, but it is one which I think \ndeserves a great deal more consideration.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, as busy and as crowded as our calendar \nis, to bring up S. 1046 which has been reported out and is on the \ncalendar. That would give us time to fully debate and amend these very \ncomplex and difficult issues. Therefore, I oppose the passage of CRA.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  I have great respect for those who disagree with the position that I, \nSenator Lott, and many others have taken on this issue, but the \nresolution of disapproval, which is part of the Congressional Review \nAct, is, in effect, a legislative veto. It is perfectly appropriate to \nuse it in this circumstance.\n  I will talk a little bit about why this bipartisan resolution is \nimportant. First, it is acknowledged by everyone that we have had \ngalloping concentration in the broadcast industry in recent years. One \ncompany now owns\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\nwell over 1,200 radio stations. The same is happening in television. I \ndo not happen to think big is always bad but I think the FCC's new \nrules will just hasten the day when we have fewer and fewer companies \nowning virtually all of the broadcast properties in this country.\n  So if one thinks that what the American people see, read, and hear \nshould be controlled by fewer and fewer people, then they would like \nthe FCC rules and they would want to oppose this resolution of \ndisapproval. But if they believe in localism, diversity, and \ncompetition, which are the hallmarks of the reason we provide free \nlicenses and the free use of the airwaves to companies by which they \nprofit, in which we say to them they have responsibilities attached to \nthis license, localism, diversity, competition, if you believe those \nenhance this country, enhance local areas or communities or counties or \nStates, then you are going to want to support this resolution of \ndisapproval.\n\n  A lot of our folks think the FCC has written rules that fundamentally \nweaken our democracy. Our democracy is nourished by the free flow of \ninformation, by localism, by competition. The fact is, three-quarters \nof a million people sent their comments to the FCC saying: Don't do \nthis. It ranges from the National Rifle Association, National \nOrganization for Women, Walter Cronkite, Jesse Helms. This is a broad-\nbased group of American people who believe very strongly that what the \nFCC has done is wrong.\n  The most dramatic rule changes in the history of broadcasting have \nbeen embarked upon by the FCC with one hearing in Richmond, VA. They \nconcocted this rule that said: Oh, by the way, here is what we think \nshould happen. We believe it is all right, in the largest city in this \ncountry, for one company to own the dominant newspaper, three \ntelevision stations, eight radio stations, and the cable company. And \nthe same company can do that in the largest city, the next largest \ncity, the next largest city, the next largest city.\n  It is not all right. We know better than that. Let me describe a \nlittle of what is happening with this concentration. Perhaps you are \ndriving down the street in Salt Lake City listening to your car radio, \ntuning the dial until you find a radio station you happen to enjoy, one \nwith good music, someone with a sonorous voice saying: Good morning in \nSalt Lake City. It's sunny here. What a beautiful day outside. The sky \nis blue.\n  And you think what a great announcer they have in Salt Lake City \nwhen, in fact, that person may be broadcasting from a basement \nbroadcast booth in Baltimore, MD. It is called voice track. It is \ncalled let's pretend. Let's pretend someone is broadcasting locally, \nbut instead that person is using the Internet information to say it is \nsunny here in Salt Lake City, trying to make folks in Salt Lake City \nbelieve they are broadcasting in Salt Lake City. ``Voice tracking''--\nremember that term.\n  Central casting--it is the same approach in television. You like \nthat? You just take localism, take local interest out of broadcasting \nand pretend it is local. If localism is unimportant, why do they even \nhave to pretend?\n  What about turning on your television set seeing people eating \nmaggots? Yes, you can see that on television. Maybe you don't like \nseeing people eating maggots. Maybe you think seeing people eat a \ncupful of maggots shoved in front of them--maybe you think that ought \nnot be shown in our community.\n  So you call the broadcaster, and you say I am going to complain about \nthis programming. How did you do this? Why would you show a program in \nwhich people eat maggots?\n  And the broadcaster writes back--this happens to be a July 25 letter. \nI won't use names:\n\n       We received your letter dated June 30, 2003, regarding the \n     content of the . . . show. . . .\n       We forwarded your letter to the . . . Network. The Network, \n     not [us], decides what shows go on the air here for the . . . \n     Owned and Operated Television Stations.\n\n  The network likes maggots. It comes to your hometown and you don't \nhave a choice, nor would a local broadcaster, and certainly not \naffiliates, stations owned by the broadcaster. They are going to \nbroadcast it.\n  What has happened to localism? Dead? Wounded? Bleeding? If the FCC \nhas its way with this rule, it will be gone, just plain gone.\n  Is there a reason for us to be concerned? I think so. There is a \nbroad, bipartisan group of interests in the Senate using the \nlegislative veto to say let's say to the FCC: What you have done is \nwrong.\n  Let me read a letter from our distinguished former colleague, Jesse \nHelms, because, as always, he puts it very succinctly.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Jesse Helms wrote a letter to my colleague, Trent Lott.\n\n       Dear Trent:\n       Thank you for your leadership in trying to undo the \n     disaster created by the Federal Communications Commission's \n     new media ownership rules. These rules will benefit huge \n     conglomerates and no one else.\n\n  Let me point out, Senator Helms is one of the few people who served \nin this Senate who came from a broadcast background.\n\n       Sometimes I think people in Washington, particularly at the \n     Commission, have forgotten that the FCC role is to preserve \n     localism, diversity, and competition. In no way are those \n     criteria supported by the recent FCC ruling. If the \n     commission fails, as it has, then Congress must step in. You \n     and Senator Dorgan have done that. I can think of no reason \n     to allow fewer companies to own more and more of the media. \n     Media ownership is a bipartisan issue that commands a close \n     review by Democrats and Republicans.\n       When your resolution comes to the Senate floor, I'll be \n     cheering for 51 votes.\n\n  It is signed by Jesse Helms, former U.S. Senator.\n  In this morning's newspaper, the FCC chairman, Mr. Powell, makes \ncomments about what we are doing here today. I happen to like Chairman \nPowell. Personally, I think he is a good person. We have had a good \nrelationship. I think he has made a horrible mistake. His leadership on \nthis issue at the Federal Communications Commission, as I have said \npreviously, has led the Commission to cave in as quickly and as \ncompletely to the special interests as anything I have ever seen.\n\n  Mr. Powell says ``the move in the Senate today'' referring to this \nmove ``is bordering on the absurd.''\n  I am sorry. There is nothing at all absurd about the Senate taking \ndirect aim at a rule by a Federal regulatory agency that is \nwrongheaded, and saying we are going to veto this rule. There is \nnothing absurd about that at all.\n  This Congress has the right under this legislation to do it. This has \nbeen rarely used. It is the second occasion in which the Senate has \nused this. We would only do it when a regulatory agency, issuing \nregulations, has so starkly decided to misrepresent what is the public \ninterest.\n  The FCC is a regulatory body. One would expect them to wear striped \nshirts and have a whistle and blow the whistle when it is needed on \nbehalf of the public interest, to stand up for the public interest. But \nwhen regulatory agencies refuse to stand for the public interest, then \nwe must take action.\n  My colleague, Senator McCain, talks about S. 1046. I am a cosponsor \nof that legislation. I support it very strongly. I hope the Senate will \npass that as well. I will only observe that this resolution of \ndisapproval will run into some whitewater rapids when it comes to the \nHouse. I understand that. So, too, would S. 1046 if it gets to the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The fact is, we ought to in every conceivable way avoid the problems \nthat will come from these rules. My colleagues and others have talked \nabout the problem of growing concentration in the media. It is getting \nworse, not better. The worst possible result, in my judgment, would be \nto say let's just let the FCC rules go into effect.\n  A Federal circuit court has already issued a stay. They understand \nthat the American people were not given the opportunity in the hearing, \nthe one hearing that existed in Richmond, VA. The case has not been \nmade for this FCC rule. So we have a stay at the Federal court.\n  A reasonable step and a thoughtful step on behalf of this Senate is \nto stand up this morning for the public interest and say to the FCC: \nYou had a responsibility and you failed. We have every right under the \nCongressional Review\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\nAct to enact, this morning, a resolution of disapproval. I hope \nsufficient numbers of my colleagues will join me, will join Senator \nLott, and others, in a strong bipartisan resolution to say we don't \nlike what the FCC has done. We think it is not at all in support of the \npublic interest. We believe it undermines this democracy which rests on \nthe free flow of information. We believe we ought to disapprove of this \nrule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at the request of the leadership, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the joint \nresolution. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I say to the Senate, we are on an energy \nand water bill. There is no long list of amendments we are aware of. We \nare aware of two, maybe three amendments. We ask that Members help us \nfinish this evening. It seems now it is the will of both the majority \nand the minority we finish tonight.\n  The next subject matter will be an appropriations bill, from what I \nunderstand. The majority leader has so committed the next bill will be \nan appropriations bill. There should be no reason why we cannot finish \nthis bill tonight. There may be two amendments. There may be three. On \nthe other hand, there could be just one. We would like Senators to help \nby getting those amendments as soon as possible so right after the 2:30 \nvote we can move right ahead with the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to my distinguished Chair of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island is ready to offer his \namendment immediately following the vote on the Feinstein amendment. We \nunderstand there may be an amendment offered by Senator Cantwell. There \nmay be some procedural problems with that. We are still working on \nthat. I am confident she will be ready to offer that as soon as we \nfinish the Reed amendment. There may be another amendment Senator \nDomenici and I have been working on, working with the chairman of the \nfull committee to see if that can be resolved in some other way.\n  I have not spoken to either of the leaders about this, but I have had \nmany questions about the storm that is coming. People are very \nconcerned about that for very personal reasons. The storm, we believe \nthey have indicated, now will strike about noon on Thursday. If it \nkeeps going the way it is, it will be a very devastating storm. We know \nsome people have obligations this weekend. As I said, I have not spoken \nto the two leaders, but as the storm develops I am sure they will talk \nto us.\n  I agree with the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Domenici. We \nwill move forward and have all the amendments offered tonight and \nfinish this bill tonight. If there is some reason we cannot do the \nvotes tonight, we will have the votes set for tomorrow morning. We will \nmove to expeditiously finish this bill as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this last weekend I got a new name. Fifty-\nnine years ago when I was born I was named Michael Bradley Enzi. The \nmiddle name comes from my Grampa and Gramma Bradley on my mother's \nside. They were homesteaders in Montana. My grandfather on my dad's \nside homesteaded in North Dakota and named his son Elmer, but he died \nshortly after I was born and before I could know him. My dad's favorite \nsong was ``Elmer's Tune'' but he thought there were enough Elmers \nalready and named me Michael. I grew up being Mickey and then Mike. As \nI mentioned, this last weekend I got a new name and I am truly \ndelighted.\n  I am now Grampa--and that is spelled with an M, not an N, and there \nis no D in it. I will explain that in just a moment.\n  My son and his wife had a son. My son, also like me, had the good \nfortune to overmarry, to Danielle, a delightful young lady from \nKentucky whom he\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nmet in Washington, DC. She is one of the most organized, focused, and \nthoughtful people I know. My son Brad and daughter-in-law Danielle had \na son. I cannot begin to share the emotion and feeling that overwhelms \nme today. It is such an incredible feeling to hold another generation \nin your hands.\n  When my son was born, we named him Michael Bradley Enzi, as well, and \ninstead of giving him the title junior we just used his middle name \nBrad to avoid confusion. Now we have a third Michael Bradley Enzi, but \nwe do not believe in titles so we call him Trey to avoid confusion. Now \nDanielle and Trey had extremely fortunate timing for Diana and me. Trey \nwas supposed to be born the end of this month, but he and his mother \nmoved that up to when Diana and I were in the neighborhood. Diana and I \nmet Brad and Danielle on Friday so I could get the transportation \nsystem. We used to call that strollers and car seats; now it is \ntransportation systems. My dad started a tradition of buying the wheels \nfor my kids. That means the wagons, the skateboards, the rollerblades, \nthe bikes, et cetera. When I heard I was going to be a grampa, I staked \nthe ``wheels'' out, too.\n\n  So we picked out the transportation system. Danielle thought she \nstarted having contractions. We knew she had walked a lot. So Brad \nchecked her into the hospital at midnight. At 8 a.m. the water broke, \nand at 4:21 p.m., Saturday, September 13, we all got new names. Trey \nweighed 6 pounds 14 ounces and was 20\\1/2\\ inches long, with huge hands \nand long feet, of course--his 6 foot 8 inch dad, who played basketball \nfor Wyoming, has size 16 feet and easily palms a basketball.\n  Danielle came through, as is her nature, invigorated and \nenthusiastic. You would not have known by looking at her face, except \nfor that special aura of being a mother, that she had just given birth. \nThe rest of us were emotional wrecks. The best way I can tell you of \nthe thrill is to tell you that we canceled the events of the weekend \nand extended an extra day, and I spent as much of that time as I could \njust holding that baby, watching him breathe and move ever so slightly, \nand listened to every little sound he made. Of course, I had to let \nDiana hold him a little, too. And his mom and dad even wanted turns.\n  If you would have told me I would spend hours just gazing at this \nmiracle of life, and having only that thought for hours, I probably \nwouldn't have believed you. But I have some instant replay memories of \nthat little face and those moving hands and those blankets and that \ncap, to hold the body heat in, locked in my mind.\n  I am constantly doing little instant replay memories for myself and \nthanking God for the opportunities he has given me--from finding Diana \nand learning about prayer with our first child, the daughter who was \nborn premature, who showed us how worthwhile fighting for life is, to \nthe birth of our son, to the birth of our youngest daughter, who just \ngot married, to helping me through open heart surgery so that I might \nhave this chance to hold yet another generation in my hands.\n  I think of the Prayer of Jabez in Chronicles, where he says: ``Lord, \nplease continue to bless me, indeed.'' And to that I add my thanks for \nthis and all the blessings noticed and unnoticed.\n  So I am a grampa. That is not grandfather--too stilted. Years ago my \ndaughter gave me a hand-stitched wall hanging that says: ``Any man can \nbe a Father, but it takes someone special to be a Dad.''\n  The name is also not grandpa. That is a little too elevated. My \ngrampa--spelled with an M and no D--my Grampa Bradley took me on some \nwonderful adventures. He taught me a lot--fishing, hunting, and work. \nHe ``let'' me help him plant and water trees when I was 4. He showed me \nhow to chop sagebrush and make flagstone walks. He covered up holes he \nencouraged me to dig. He covered them so people wouldn't drive a car \ninto them. He taught me how to spade a garden, mow a lawn, and trim it \nproperly.\n  He later showed me the point in life when you are supposed to start \ncarrying the heavy end of the log. Later in life, he had heart trouble \nand couldn't go fishing by himself, so he took me along. After a few \nminutes, he would place himself at the picnic area and visit with the \ntourists who stopped. He would tell them about his grandson who would \nbe arriving shortly with fish and have quite a group waiting for my \nreturn.\n  He liked to be called Grampa. And I am now delighted to have the \nopportunity to earn that name. I wish I could adequately share with you \nthe joy in my heart.\n  Trey, grandson, welcome to this world of promise and hope and love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming, \nwho just entered another phase of his life. He is a grampa, but he can \nalso get very silly. I am a grandpa, and I know the silliness that \ncomes along with it. It is a wonderful kind of silliness, and it is a \ndimension in life of which I hope all men have the opportunity to be a \npart.\n  So my neighbor in the West and my neighbor here on Capitol Hill, to \nyou and your bride, who is now a grandma, congratulations.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 1 minute, please?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I add my congratulations to Grampa Enzi \nand Diana. There is no Member of this body who exemplifies family \nvalues more than those two. There is no Senator who has greater \naffection in this body. Trey has a great family to join.\n  My wife Mary and I are so excited for you. She called me early this \nmorning to report the news. We express our congratulations to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought I would spend a few moments this \nmorning talking about an impending crisis that is offshore of the east \ncoast at this moment that may well be headed our way.\n  Hurricane Isabel could well make its way into this region and do \ngreat devastation. That devastation could well be to the forests and \nthe timberlands of North Carolina and Virginia. And it could well be in \nsome areas of Maryland, where it could come ashore.\n  The reason I stand before the Senate this morning to talk about it is \nthat we in the West are experiencing another kind of catastrophic event \nin our forests. They are called wildfires. Yet somehow we in the \nSenate, in the shaping of public policy, do not look at hurricane \ncrises in our forests and our public lands the way we look at \nwildfires. In August of 1910, a wildfire started in Idaho and Montana, \nand 3 days later 3 million acres of land were gone.\n  Our forest health problems are not isolated to the problems of the \nrural West. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo slammed ashore near Charleston, SC, \nand cut a path northwest through North Carolina and into Virginia. On \nthe Francis Marion National Forest, 70 percent of the trees were \nkilled. We, the Government, immediately expedited the process of \ncleanup, salvage, and replanting, funneling millions of dollars into \nthat effort. This is a similar expected path of Hurricane Isabel, and \nthe Governor of Virginia has already declared a state of emergency.\n  In January of 1998, over 17 million acres of forests were heavily \ndamaged in an ice storm that stretched across New York State, New \nHampshire, Vermont, and into Maine. We responded appropriately with $48 \nmillion to help in the cleanup.\n\n  In the spring of 1999, when a blowdown, followed by a southern bark \nbeetle epidemic, hit the Texas National Forests, we provided emergency \nexemptions that allowed managers to enter into wilderness areas--\nbelieve it or not--to sanitize the stands to slow down the insect \ninfestation.\n  Just last year, in the supplemental Defense appropriations bill, we \nhelped Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson deal with forest health \nemergencies in their State of South Dakota by suggesting that, by law, \nNEPA appeals not be able to be litigated.\n  Each time, a commonsense approach was supported by this body when a \ncrisis hit our public forests. Each time,\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\nwe reached out to our neighbors and said: We will help clean up the \nforests to ensure the health of the forests and to ensure the vitality \nof those forests for wildlife and for human life.\n  As the Healthy Forest legislation comes up for debate, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico--who is in the Chamber now to handle the energy and \nwater appropriations bill--and I, the other Senator from Idaho, Mike \nCrapo, and the Senator from Mississippi have been working with our \ncolleagues from California and Oregon to assure that we can begin a \nprocess on the public lands of the West to attempt to clean them up, to \nreassure healthy forests. Yet somehow--by some groups, and by some \nSenators--it is looked at as an entirely different process from what \nHurricane Isabel could well do to the forests of the Carolinas and to \nthe forests of Virginia.\n  Out West and across other forests of our country, this year we have \nlost nearly 4 million acres to wildfire and yet we struggle to get the \nmoney, we struggle to get the right to allow the process to clean up, \nto rehabilitate and reestablish the environment of these forests. It is \ntime we wake up. What is happening to the forests of the West today is \nnatural. It is a result of bug kill, it is a result of drought, and it \nis a result of us taking fire out of the ecosystems a good number of \nyears ago. Somehow now we are not being allowed to treat it the very \nway we have allowed hurricane damage and other natural damages to be \ntreated.\n  So I plead with the Congress, I plead with this Senate, to realize \nthis, to work with us to build a healthy forest bill. I thought it was \nappropriate to come to the Senate floor to say this at a time when \nIsabel is about ready to hit land and begin to damage the forests of \nthe East Coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11521-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11521-S11529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2754, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2754) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Feinstein amendment No. 1655, to prohibit the use of funds \n     for Department of Energy activities relating to the Robust \n     Nuclear Earth Penetrator, Advanced Weapons Concepts, \n     modification of the readiness posture of the Nevada Test \n     Site, and the Modern Pit Facility, and to make the amount of \n     funds made available by the prohibition for debt reduction.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased today that we have set \na time and we are going to vote on the so-called Feinstein amendment. I \nam also pleased we will hear from a very distinguished Senator whose \nthoughts and reputation in the Senate, from this Senator's standpoint, \nare becoming more valid, more looked upon, and listened to.\n  The issue before us is a straightforward issue that is trying to be \nmade complex. It is not the issue of building new nuclear weapons. \nSenator Chambliss and I can start off by saying there is nothing in \nthis bill that permits us to build a single, solitary, new nuclear \nweapon. That requires an act of Congress that is not before us.\n  Secondly, the Senator knows it provides for the testing ground in \nNevada, which we had said since we put it in mothballs, it should be \nready for testing at any time. Any time today means 3 years. Under this \nlegislation, at the request of the administration, it will be \nmodernized so it will only take 1\\1/2\\ years to get ready for a test, \nif a test is necessary.\n  So far, those things I have said, it would seem to me, should pass \nthis Senate 100 to 0. There are two other issues I am sure my friend \nfrom Georgia will explain, but none of them do anything to build a new \nline of nuclear weapons for this great Nation. That is not the issue, \nand I hope the Senator from Georgia will join me in convincing a few \nmore Senators this is an issue to be defeated. Small funding, big \nideas; little, tiny funding with great repercussions if we fail to do \nwhat we ought to do.\n  I yield the floor and welcome the Senator's comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his kind \ncomments, but most importantly I thank him for his strong leadership on \nthe issue of energy and any number of other issues. In my years in the \nHouse I had the privilege of working with the Senator when he was \nchairman of the Budget Committee. What great leadership he provided, \nand he is carrying that forward as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Energy now. It is indeed a privilege and a pleasure to \nwork very closely with him to make sure a strong energy policy is \ndeveloped in the United States of America, something that is sorely \nlacking. Under the Senator's leadership we are going to make sure that \nhappens.\n  Before I make my comments relative to this amendment, though, I \ncannot help but take a minute to say to the Presiding Officer that as a \ngrandfather twice over, I am very happy for the Chair and Diana. I will \nsay if he thinks he is having fun today, every day gets more and more \nfun.\n  Being the obnoxious grandparent I am, I would like to compare \npictures with the Presiding Officer as he moves down the road. My \npictures of little John and little Parker are something special that I \nhold very near and dear. I see the Chair already has his. So we will \ncompare them early on.\n  I rise today to speak in opposition to the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein. I do not support this \namendment for several reasons and I would like to take a few minutes to \noutline my concerns. The amendment offered contains four provisions, \nall of which will negatively affect our Nation's security and our \nability to maintain a modern and safe nuclear weapons capability.\n  This amendment prohibits our Nation's scientists from researching one \nof the foremost military challenges our Nation faces, which is an enemy \nusing a hardened, deeply buried facility to protect weapons of mass \ndestruction or carry out command and control operations. Our Nation has \njust begun exploring whether modified existing warheads might be \neffective in countering such targets. The underlying bill provides \nfunds to conduct the second year of a 3-year feasibility study to see \nif existing weapons can be modified to address this critical threat. \nThe bill allows the United States to simply explore--and I emphasize \nthe word--the full range of weapons concepts that could offer a \ncredible deterrent and response to new and emerging threats. It is \nimperative that our Nation continue to perform this research. It \nabsolutely has to be done.\n  The funding for advanced concepts that this amendment strikes will \nalso prohibit our scientists from exploring and incorporating changes \nto our existing nuclear-related programs, including upgrades to safety \nand security measures that make our nuclear arsenal more reliable and \nsafer. Advanced concepts are the ``idea machines'' for scientists and \nengineers at our national laboratories that allow them to take \nadvantage of advancement in technology. Essentially, this amendment \nwould restrict our scientists from doing their job, which is to improve \nthe reliability and sustainability of our programs.\n  The amendment also restricts funding for the improvement of our \ncountry's timeline to prepare for an underground nuclear test. Our goal \nis to reduce the timeline from the current threshold of 36 months to 18 \nmonths. The President could decide that a test is necessary to confirm \na problem or test a fix to a problem involving the safety, security or \nreliability of a nuclear weapon in the stockpile. This administration \nhas determined that, should such a test become necessary, the United \nStates should not have to wait 3 years to address the problem in the \nstockpile. As our nuclear systems age, the necessity to conduct a test \nbecomes more likely, should the President determine that it is in the \nnational interest to do so. This amendment would make our Nation and \nour nuclear arsenal less, not more, secure.\n  The last provision in this amendment would have the most drastic \neffect, I believe, to our Nation's security. For the first time in more \nthan a decade, the United States will now be able to\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\ndesign and implement a program to manufacture a plutonium pit, an \nessential nuclear warhead component. The lack of this proficiency has \nseriously constrained our ability to maintain our nuclear stockpile. In \nfact, the Department of Energy, in 2002, indicated that the U.S. is the \nonly nuclear power that lacks the ability to manufacture ``pits.'' All \npits currently in the U.S. nuclear stockpile were made at the Rocky \nFlats Plant near Denver, CO, which opened in 1952. The Department of \nEnergy halted pit manufacturing operations there in 1989. The \nadministration has proposed a multi-year planning and design process \nthat would result in a final decision on constructing a modern pit \nfacility in 2011. If construction is approved, the proposed facility \nwould begin full operation in 2020. The modern pit facility allows us \nto incorporate this capability into our nuclear weapons program and \nmodernize our systems accordingly.\n  Should this amendment pass, the United States' capabilities for \nensuring a safe, reliable nuclear arsenal will continue to regress for \nseveral years. This amendment will prohibit the U.S. from taking \nadvantage of the latest technology.\n  Let me reiterate, the U.S. is not planning to resume testing; nor are \nwe improving test readiness in order to develop new nuclear weapons. In \nfact, the U.S. is not planning to develop any new nuclear weapons at \nall. Our goal is to maintain a safe, secure, reliable, and effective \nnuclear weapons program, and for this reason I oppose the pending \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. I thought \nI would comment in three areas.\n  First of all, I have had an opportunity to visit our laboratories in \nthe United States. I will talk a little bit about that. Then I would \nlike to review where we are in the overall aspect as far as our nuclear \nweapons are concerned. Finally, I will talk a little bit about what is \nin the authorization bill we passed in the Senate earlier on in the \nyear, and talk a little bit about the fact that we have considered most \nof these amendments already. I don't understand why we are bringing \nthem up for reconsideration, because the Senate has spoken.\n  I had an opportunity earlier this year to go around and visit the \nlaboratories. I began to understand how important it is--that we need \nto study our nuclear weapons and we need to understand where we are in \nregard to the strategic nuclear stockpile.\n  Not long ago, several years back, the hope for the strategic nuclear \nstockpile was that it would work, but there was skepticism in the \nscientific community. But going around the laboratories earlier this \nyear, those scientists, very capable scientists, very dedicated \nemployees we have in our laboratories--and they want to see world peace \nand they don't necessarily want to see the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons--understand the need for us to know what is happening as far as \nour own strategic stockpile is concerned; that we need to continue to \nevaluate the threats from our enemies or potential enemies and where we \nstand in relation to that threat.\n  I was convinced that we need to do studies; we need to do some design \nthought; we need to bring it up for discussion. Nobody is out here \nsaying we need to go into a nuclear arms race. I think that is \noverstated. But I think there is a lot of science that needs to be \nknown, still, as far as nuclear weapons. We are going through a period \nof time where our stockpile is aging. Because it is aging, there are \nsome phenomena that we perhaps do not understand. We want to make sure \nwe understand. We want to make sure we have a safe environment and, \nfrom a safety aspect, that we understand what happens with aging.\n  The administration's budget request for fiscal year 2004 included \nseveral initiatives to advance their agenda as spelled out in the 2001 \nNuclear Posture Review. The Nuclear Posture Review laid out a plan to \nreduce the nuclear threshold by making advances in conventional \nmunitions and missile defense capabilities, and in revitalizing our \nnuclear weapons infrastructure, while at the same time reducing the \nnumber of nuclear weapons--reducing the number of nuclear weapons in \nour stockpile from around 6,000 to between around 1,700 and 2,200 \noperationally deployed nuclear warheads.\n  One focus of the Nuclear Posture Review is to make advances in our \nnuclear weapons capabilities to deter future threats instead of \nmaintaining a nuclear weapons stockpile which was designed to deter \npast threats.\n  This bill includes funding to support the administration's \ninitiatives. Specifically, the Senate bill provides $6 million for \nadvanced concepts, $15 million to continue a 3-year feasibility study \non the robust nuclear earth penetrator, which is commonly referred to \nas RNEP, and $25 million to enhance our test readiness capabilities at \nthe Nevada Test Site. That was mentioned in previous comments on the \nSenate floor, how important it is in order to meet our 18-month \nresponse requirement that this needs to be met. There needs to be money \nto meet that requirement. And there is $23 million to continue \nconceptual design efforts for a modern pit facility. Each of these \nindividual facilities will enhance our Nation's readiness and \ncapabilities in support of the Nuclear Posture Review.\n\n  I think the Members of the Senate need to know the Nuclear Posture \nReview was analyzed by those people in the know, those people who \nunderstand what is happening in other countries, people who understand \nthe science and understand where we are in this country.\n  The advanced concepts initiative will support preconceptual and \nconcept definition studies and feasibility and cost studies approved by \nthe Nuclear Weapons Council. With advanced concepts, we are beginning \nto challenge our scientists, designers, and engineers to consider what \nis within the art of the possible. They will be challenged to think, \ndiscover, create, and innovate. By supporting the administration's \nrequest for the advanced concepts initiative, we will ensure there is \nan active advanced development program to assess the capabilities of \nour adversaries, conceptualizing innovative methods for countering \nthose threats, developing weapon system requirements in response to our \nadversaries, and prototyping and evaluating the concepts.\n  The advanced concepts initiative will also help our experts to design \nenhanced safety and security aspects for our nuclear weapons, \nparticularly the aging nuclear weapons that we possess.\n  The Feinstein amendment would strike this funding for advanced \nconcepts.\n  The RNEP study is not a new issue for the Congress to consider. Last \nyear, Congress authorized and appropriated $15 million for the first of \nthe 3-year feasibility studies on the robust nuclear earth penetrator. \nThis bill provides funding for the continuation of the feasibility \nstudy. It does not authorize the production or deployment of such a \ncapability. The RNEP feasibility study will determine if one of two \nexisting nuclear weapons can be modified to penetrate into hard rock in \norder to destroy a deeply buried target that could be hiding weapons of \nmass destruction or command and control assets.\n  The Department of Energy has modified nuclear weapons in the past to \nmodernize their safety, security, and reliability aspects. We also \nmodify existing nuclear weapons to meet new military requirements. The \nB61-11, one of the weapons being considered for the RNEP feasibility \nstudy, was already modified once before to serve as an earth penetrator \nto hold specific targets at risk. At that time, the modification was to \nassure the B61 could penetrate frozen soils. The RNEP feasibility study \nis an attempt to determine whether the same B61 or another weapon, the \nB83, could be modified to penetrate hard rock or reinforced underground \nfacilities.\n  Funding research on options, both nuclear and conventional, for \nattacking such targets is a responsible step for our country to take.\n  Admiral James Ellis, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, confirmed \nin testimony before the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on April 8, 2003, \nthat not all hardened and deeply buried targets can be destroyed by \nconventional weapons. Many nations are increasingly developing hardened \nand deeply buried targets to protect command and communications and \nweapons of mass destruction production and storage assets. It is \nprudent to support the study\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nof potential capabilities to address this growing category of threat.\n  What the Senate bill provides funding for is simply the second year \nof the 3-year feasibility study, nothing more. Should the National \nNuclear Security Administration determine through this study that the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator can meet the requirements to hold a \nhardened and deeply buried target at risk, NNSA still could not proceed \nto full-scale weapon production development or deployment without an \nauthorization and appropriation from Congress.\n  We should allow our weapons experts to determine if the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator could destroy hardened and deeply buried \ntargets and to assess what would be the collateral damage associated \nwith such capability. Then Congress would have the information it needs \nto decide whether development of such weapons is appropriate and \nnecessary to maintain our Nation's security.\n  The Feinstein amendment would strike funding to continue the ANEP \nfeasibility study.\n  The enhanced test readiness initiative has also been closely \nconsidered by the Congress and the administration. The House and the \nSenate Armed Services Committees required the Department of Energy, in \nconsultation with the Department of Defense, to do a study to determine \nthe optimum readiness posture for the Nevada Test Site. After a \nthorough review, the optimal test readiness posture chosen by the \nDepartment of Energy was 18 months.\n  Against the thoughtful consideration of both the Congress and the \nadministration, the Feinstein amendment would strike the funding to \nallow our Nation's readiness to be enhanced at the Nevada Test Site.\n  Another important initiative is the continuing efforts to design and \nconstruct a modern pit facility to ensure the United States can, once \nagain, manufacture plutonium pits for our existing nuclear weapons \nstockpile and for future weapons design, if necessary. The United \nStates is the only nuclear power which does not have the current \nability to mass produce plutonium pits.\n  Let me restate that. The United States is the only nuclear power that \ndoes not have the current ability to mass produce plutonium pits.\n  Although we have limited capabilities to produce a few pits at the \nLos Alamos National Laboratory since the shutdown of Rocky Flats in my \nhome State of Colorado, the United States has not produced plutonium \npits. That is a problem for our aging nuclear weapons stockpile since \nthe pits and those weapons are aging beyond their design life, and as a \nradioactive material, plutonium continues to deteriorate until the pits \ncan no longer be usable. The Feinstein amendment would strike funding \nfor the modern pit facility.\n  All of the administration's nuclear weapons initiatives are designed \nto make sure the United States has the best and the brightest \nscientists and engineers prepared to innovate, create, test, and even \nmanufacture, if necessary, to make sure any adversary is deterred from \nconducting harmful actions against the United States or its allies.\n  There are protections in the National Defense Authorization Act which \nprovide that, at a minimum, no engineering design work can occur on the \nrobust nuclear penetrator without specific authorization from Congress. \nWe maintain our ability to control any mass production of those nuclear \nweapons.\n  We already had that debate. We should allow these initiatives to \ncontinue. Therefore, I am urging my colleagues to join me in voting \nagainst the Feinstein amendment.\n  There are a couple more issues I would like to cover. First, I ask \nunanimous consent that an op-ed by the Secretary of Energy, Spencer \nAbraham, from the Washington Post on Monday, July 21, 2003, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 21, 2003]\n\n                      Facing a New Nuclear Reality\n\n                          (By Spencer Abraham)\n\n       The United States took another step toward eliminating the \n     last vestiges of Cold War nuclear weapons production in May \n     when the Department of Energy awarded contracts for \n     construction of fossil fuel power plants to replace three \n     Russian nuclear reactors. These reactors produce not only \n     heat and electricity but also weapons-grade plutonium, enough \n     to build 1\\1/2\\ nuclear weapons a day. When the new U.S.-\n     financed power plants are constructed and the nuclear \n     reactors shut down, weapons-grade plutonium will no longer be \n     produced in Russia.\n       President Bush is deeply committed to reducing the number \n     of our nation's strategic nuclear warheads by two-thirds, and \n     to preventing nuclear and radiological materials from falling \n     into the hand of terrorists. This $466 million project is the \n     latest advancement in an aggressive nonproliferation effort \n     that has expanded from $800 million to $1.3 billion per year \n     since the president took office. That's why I was perplexed, \n     during congressional debate on the defense budget by the \n     hysterics over the $21 million that would allow our \n     scientists to contemplate advanced weapons concepts that \n     could be used to protect against 21st-century threats. (In \n     all, some $6.4 billion in the budget is for Department of \n     Energy nuclear weapons programs.)\n       This funding should not have surprised anyone. It is the \n     logical result of early Bush administration initiatives, \n     endorsed by Congress, to conduct a thorough review of the \n     nation's nuclear weapons policy. That review determined that \n     the 21st-century national security environment differs \n     greatly from that of the past half-century.\n       Deterrence during the Cold War led to a predictable--if \n     chilling--balance of terror that has now largely vanished. \n     Henceforth threats will likely evolve more quickly and less \n     predictably. It is a situation that demands the restoration \n     of our capacity to meet new challenges.\n       Recently the United States has begun making great strides \n     to rebuild those capabilities. Now, for the first time in \n     more than a decade, we are able to manufacture a plutonium \n     pit--also known as a trigger--an essential nuclear warhead \n     component. The lack of this proficiency has seriously \n     constrained our ability to maintain our nuclear stockpile. We \n     have also launched a much-needed facility modernization \n     program. But maintaining our capability to address 21st-\n     century challenges requires more.\n       Should our scientists decide we cannot certify the \n     reliability of our nuclear stockpile, we must be capable of \n     conducting a nuclear test in a much shorter time frame than \n     the current three years. The capacity to test within 18 \n     months is a critical capability every president must have. We \n     must also give our weapons scientists the resources and \n     authority to explore advanced weapons concepts, including \n     research related to low-yield weapons. Funding constraints \n     and confusing legal prohibitions have stifled most new \n     thinking on these issues. This has, in turn, made us less \n     capable of devising the best responses to emerging threats.\n       The challenges posed by rogue nations or terrorists \n     possessing weapons of mass destruction are strikingly \n     different from that posed by the Soviet Union. Yet our best \n     thinkers aren't being allowed to fully shift their focus from \n     winning the Cold War to meeting new challenges.\n       Finally, we must move ahead to address one of the foremost \n     military challenges identified in our recent review--an enemy \n     using hardened, deeply buried facilities, to protect its \n     weapons and other assets. We have just begun to explore \n     whether modified existing warheads might be effective in \n     attacking such targets. Similar analyses of the applicability \n     of conventional weapons to addressing this threat are also \n     being done.\n       We are not planning to resume testing; nor are we improving \n     test readiness in order to develop new nuclear weapons. In \n     fact, we are not planning to develop any new nuclear weapons \n     at all. Our goal is designed to explore the full range of \n     weapons concepts that could offer a credible deterrence and \n     response to new and emerging threats as well as allow us to \n     continue to assess the reliability of our stockpile without \n     testing.\n       This is a sensible course that meets our national security \n     requirements by restoring our capabilities and ensuring that \n     we have the flexibility to respond quickly to any potential \n     problems in the current stockpile, or to new threats that \n     require immediate attention. Our policies are designed to \n     strengthen the deterrent value of our nuclear weapons so that \n     they don't ever have to be used.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly point out some of \nthe things we had in the Defense authorization bill as it applied to a \nnumber of areas affecting nuclear weapons. The section that dealt with \nthe developing low-yield nuclear weapon--section 3131 of the Defense \nauthorization bill--repeals the ban on research and development of low-\nyield nuclear weapons. But that same section also includes a provision \nwhich states that nothing in this repeal should be ``construed as \nauthorizing the testing, acquisition, or deployment of a low-yield \nnuclear weapon.''\n  Also included in that same provision is a section that limits DOE \nfrom beginning phase 3. Phase 3 is the full-scale engineering \ndevelopment or any subsequent phase of a low-yield nuclear weapon \n``unless specifically authorized by the Congress.''\n  Finally, also in that same section 3131, a report is to be submitted \nto determine if the repeal of the ban on research and development of \nlow-yield\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\nnuclear weapons will affect the ability of the United States to achieve \nits nonproliferation objectives.\n  On that section of the Defense Authorization Act, we had a number of \namendments that we considered on the floor which we have already voted \non. Again, one was the Feinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein offered \nan amendment to strike the repeal of the ban on low-yield nuclear \nweapons research. The motion to table was agreed to by a vote of 51 to \n43. That was the Senate's position supporting the language of the \nSenate authorization bill on Armed Services.\n  The Reed-Levin amendment was also brought up in that section. They \noffered an amendment which retains the ban on low-yield nuclear weapon \nresearch. This amendment would retain the ban on phase 3 and subsequent \nphases but allow research on phases 1, 2, and 2A. This amendment was \nvery similar to a House-Senate Armed Services Committee provision.\n  Chairman Warner offered an amendment in the form of a substitute \nwhich struck the Reed-Levin amendment and added a limitation which \nrequired a specific authorization from the Congress before the \nSecretary of Energy can proceed with phase 3--which again is \nengineering development--or any subsequent phases of low-yield nuclear \nweapons. The Warner substitute passed by a vote of 59 to 38. The Reed-\nLevin amendment, as amended by the Warner substitute, passed by a vote \nof 96 to 0.\n  In another section in the Senate Armed Services Committee \nauthorization bill dealing with the robust nuclear earth-penetrator--\ncommonly referred to as RNEP--there was an authorization for $15 \nmillion for RNEP, which was the amount of the request we had in the \nbudget proposal. That was section 1050.\n  Section 3135 also requires DOE to receive a specific authorization \nfrom Congress before commencing with phase 3 or any subsequent phase of \nthe RNEP.\n  Time and time again, the Senate has spoken--that there will not be \nany further procedure on nuclear weapons development and advanced \nengineering unless there is specific authorization from the Senate.\n  Under the RNEP, there were a couple of Senate floor amendments that \nwe considered. For example, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment to \nprohibit the use of funds for the nuclear earth-penetrator weapon, and \nthe motion to table was agreed to by a vote of 56 to 41.\n  There was a Nelson amendment on RNEP. That amendment limited the DOE \nfrom beginning phase 3--full-scale development--or any subsequent phase \nof the robust nuclear earth-penetrator without a specific authorization \nfrom Congress.\n  Chairman Warner prepared a very similar amendment, and the Nelson \namendment was agreed to by a voice vote.\n  We have debated this issue thoroughly. The Senate has spoken on these \namendments and on these provisions. The appropriators have language \nsupporting what we have already voted on and what has been passed by \nthis body. I think it is time to move forward.\n  I think it is important that we move forward with the appropriations \nbill in light of our energy needs in this country. We shouldn't delay.\n  I rise in support of the bill, and I rise in opposition to the \nFeinstein amendment and ask my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nColorado for his comments and overall summary of this situation. It has \nbeen extremely helpful. I am very grateful that he found time to do it \ntoday.\n  I understand that Senator Bayh desires to speak as if in morning \nbusiness shortly with reference to the death of the Governor of his \nState. He is on his way. When he arrives, I will yield to him. He said \nhe wanted 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my reasons for \nsupporting the Feinstein amendment. This amendment first and foremost \nseeks to reduce the funding for the robust nuclear earth penetrator, or \nRNEP. While on the Armed Services Committee, I took the lead on \nnumerous occasions in opposing this program. I believe that it sends \nthe wrong signal to other nations when we are proposing to expand our \nnuclear arsenal at the very same time we are trying to control the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction worldwide.\n  Further, this country clearly has superiority in advanced \nconventional weapons, as evidenced by the recent conflict in Iraq. Very \nfew, if any, nations can compete with the U.S. in conventional weapons. \nWe should be relying on this advantage in conventional weapons rather \nthan forcing other nations to compete with us on nuclear weapons as we \ndid before the end of the cold war.\n  There is also a pragmatic reason why I believe the RNEP is not \nneeded. In my opinion, our existing arsenal, particularly the B-83 \ntactical nuclear bomb, is more than adequate to serve as a deterrent \nagainst the hardest underground targets that confront us today. The \nadministration envisions the RNEP as a weapon that will destroy deep \nunderground targets. Yet proponents of this argument seem not to have \nconsidered the loss of function to an underground target that a B-83, \nwhose yield is in excess of 1 megaton, will cause. I am sure that after \nsuch a devastating explosion, very little, if any, of the deepest \nunderground targets will pose much of a threat to the U.S.\n  Further, the amendment seeks to strike funding for the advanced \nconcepts initiative. The administration claims that such funds are \nneeded to keep our weapons scientists on the cutting edge of warhead \ndesign but they have not explained to us what avenues of research they \nwish to pursue. In my opinion, we barely know enough about modeling how \nour existing warheads function under the stockpile stewardship program. \nOur modern strategic warheads, such as the W-76 and W-88, are very \ncomplicated; modeling them challenges even the most advanced \ncalculations on our laboratory supercomputers. There is no need at this \ntime to embark on the new avenue of research in the advanced concepts \ninitiative when we don't understand the science underlying the \nstockpile stewardship of our deployed arsenal. The advanced concepts \ninitiative will be a dangerous distraction from the stockpile \nstewardship program.\n  The third provision of this amendment is somewhat more complicated. \nLet me begin by stating that I strongly support the construction of a \nmodern pit facility as an integral component of the stockpile \nstewardship program. An earlier version of this amendment struck the \nfunding for conceptual design work on this facility, which, in \nmy opinion, was a mistake. I expressed my concerns to Senator \nFeinstein, and I am pleased that this version of the amendment retains \nthese conceptual designs funds.\n\n  There is a fundamental reason why I think the modern pit facility is \nimportant. Our pits are approaching ages in some cases of up to 35 \nyears old. Our best scientists do not fully understand the way aging \naffects on these plutonium pits. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, we \nare just now at the stage where we can produce our first prototype test \npit, 15 years after the Rocky Flats plant stopped production of these \npits. But the Los Alamos facility cannot expand to handle the \nproduction that our stockpile may require 15 years from now.\n  With regard to siting the facility, I do not believe that we will \nhave all the information we will need to do so by 2004. I have not seen \nany statements by the administration on what size the stockpile will be \nin 2012, when the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty reduces the \nstockpile down to 1200 to 1700 strategic weapons. I note that this \ntreaty does not account for the deployed warheads found in gravity \nbombs. As a result of this lack of precision in future stockpile size, \nthe DOE's Environmental Impact Statement gives production rates that \nrange by a factor of four from 100 to 450 pits per year. Given that the \nstockpile size has not been decided at this time, and that the modern \npit facility will not start operations until 2018, I cannot see how the \nDepartment of Energy can configure, much less site, their pit \nproduction facility in fiscal year 2004. I concur with Senator \nFeinstein that the DOE can hold off siting the facility for a year, \nwhile continuing its design to\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\nmatch the stockpile requirements from the Department of Defense.\n  I would like to note that I have advocated that if and when DOE \njustifies the facility's size, then Carlsbad, NM is the best location \nfor it. Carlsbad's close proximity to Los Alamos National Laboratory \nmeans that the scientists who are researching the best ways to re-\nmanufacture pits will be able to easily travel and impart that \nknowledge to the production plant. Carlsbad has a top-notch workforce \nat the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant well-trained for handling \nradioactive materials that will be essential to the pit facility. The \nCarlsbad community has shown strong support for the facility as well.\n  I support this amendment, but I also want to make clear that I also \nsupport the goal of constructing a modern pit facility, provided that \nthey have a clear mandate from the Department of Defense on the \nfacility's size based upon the stockpile, and we expect in 2018, when \nit begins operation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I stand today in support of my \ncolleague Senator Feinstein, and her amendment to strip the funding \nfrom the robust nuclear earth-penetrator and the advanced weapons \nconcepts program, and to stop the enhancement of the time-to-test \nreadiness at the Nevada Nuclear Test Site and the site selection of the \nmodern pit facility. I fully support Senator Feinstein's efforts to \nattempt to put an end to nuclear proposals that have not yet been \njustified by hard arguments but would likely result in adverse \nconsequences.\n  Almost a decade ago, the United States, our allies, and the freedom-\nloving nations around the world rejoiced as the cold war ended \npeacefully and the threat of total nuclear annihilation was lifted. We \ndreamed then and we hope now that we will never again enter into a \nglobal struggle with thermonuclear consequences.\n  Yet there are those in this world who would still do us harm, and \nthey are armed with weapons of mass destruction. To pretend otherwise \nwould be to pander to a most dangerous delusion. There is a real danger \nthat they seek to secure those weapons in hardened or deeply buried \nbunkers. We must put our best scientists to work to learn how to \nneutralize this threat.\n  At the same time, we must be careful that in seeking to neutralize \nthis threat, we do not aggravate it by pursuing dangerously \ndestabilizing policies and weapons programs.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have been \nbriefed on our military's conventional and nuclear capabilities. Like \nmost Americans, I have also watched with pride as our armed forces \nprove in Iraq and around the world that they are second to none. Based \non these observations, I am convinced that we can and will meet the \nthreat posed by our enemies without having to resort to developing \nnuclear weapons to destroy deeply buried or hardened targets at this \ntime. To do so would be premature at best and dangerous and misguided \nat worst.\n  I am further convinced by the testimony and writings of experts, both \nthose who have worn our Nation's uniform and those who did not, that \nnot only is the utility of these nuclear weapons questionable, but so \nis the very fact of whether or not they will work as hoped.\n  Developing low-yield nuclear weapons at this time would also severely \nundermine our global nonproliferation efforts. I believe that at a time \nwhen the United States is seeking to convince the North Korean \nleadership that they do not need to engage in a brazen drive for a \nrobust nuclear capability; at a time when our diplomats are trying to \ndeescalate nuclear tensions along the Indian and Pakistani border; at a \ntime when the International Atomic Energy Agency is presently engaged \nin negotiations with Iran over denuclearization and inspections, that \nwe would be naive to think that we can coax these nations to drop their \nnuclear plans while we invest in pursuing our own new nuclear \ncapabilities.\n  In addition to undermining our international nonproliferation \nefforts, a new generation of nuclear weapons, especially the low-yield \nvariety envisioned by the administration, will blur the bright lines \nbetween conventional and nuclear capabilities, and raise the likelihood \nof resorting to the latter. I am not alone in this concern. Former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili stated \nthis concern clearly and persuasively: ``[a]ny activities that erode \nthe firebreak between nuclear and conventional weapons or that \nencourage the use of nuclear weapons for purposes that are not \nstrategic and deterrent in nature would undermine the advantage that we \nderive from overwhelming conventional superiority.''\n  The world we live in is indeed a dangerous place. In response to \nthese dangers, however, we must guard against rash actions that \nundermine our ultimate security. The new nuclear weapons the \nadministration advocates will not substantially increase our sense of \nsecurity and may in fact detract from it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator \nFeinstein's amendment to remove funding for the development of new \nnuclear weapons. The administration is seeking $15 million to fund more \nresearch on the robust nuclear earth penetrator a nuclear bunker buster \nand $6 million for research on new nuclear weapons.\n  I must register my shock that the administration has requested this \nfunding, reversing almost 60 years of U.S. nuclear policy. Funding such \na request is the first step on a ``slippery slope'' that could \nirreversibly lead us to testing and maybe even deploying these new \nnuclear weapons.\n  It is imperative that we nip this mischief in the bud by supporting \nSenator Feinstein's amendment.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the administration has consistently \nidentified one distinct threat to U.S. security and reiterated this \nthreat innumerable times in the past year: The proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction and their transfer to terrorists.\n  In the President's speech to the United Nations on Sept. 12, 2002, in \nhis address to Congress in October, 2002, in his State of the Union \nspeech this past January, he repeatedly expressed his concern about the \nproliferation of biological, chemical, and especially nuclear weapons.\n  Many Members of Congress voted to send our young men and women to \nIraq to eliminate the threat of Saddam Hussein's supposed nuclear \narsenal. We were told that while Saddam had not yet developed nuclear \nweapons, he was actively intent on doing so and the consequences would \nbe horrific.\n  Meanwhile, during this same year, the administration is looking to \ncreate new nuclear weapons.\n  Our diplomats have just returned from six-way talks in Beijing aimed \nat resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis instigated last fall when \nKim Jong IL announced his defiance of the 1994 Agreed Framework. How \ncan our negotiators in good faith reassure the North Koreans and the \nother participants at these talks of peaceful United States intentions \nin the region, while at home, in our labs, nuclear scientists are \nexperimenting with new nuclear weapons that will eventually have a \nyield 70 times that of the bomb dropped at Hiroshima?\n  It is abundantly clear that there is a copycat effect of U.S. \nmilitary planning. According to former Undersecretary of Energy, Rose \nGottemoeller:\n\n       Other countries watch us like a hawk. They are very, very \n     attentive to what we do in the nuclear arena. I think people \n     abroad will interpret this as an enthusiastic effort by the \n     Bush administration to re-nuclearize. And I think definitely \n     this nuclear funding is going to be an impetus to the \n     development of nuclear weapons around the world.\n\n  I clearly remember the devastation that the atom bombs wrought not \nonly on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but on all society. As Adlai Stevenson \nput it, ``Man wrested from nature the power to make the world a \ndesert.''\n  Since those two unforgettable days in 1945, administration after \nadministration, Republicans and Democrats, have made it clear that \nnuclear weapons have held a special status within the U.S. arsenal. \nU.S. policymakers have committed to the international nuclear arms \ncontrol regime.\n  The research funding in this bill for the nuclear earth penetrator \ndeparts from 60 years of nuclear policy. If these weapons are \nresearched, they will be inevitably be tested, which will undermine a \n10-year U.S. commitment to a nuclear testing moratorium.\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n  I am deeply concerned about the standing of the United States in the \ninternational community.\n  As a result of the unilateral approach the Bush administration has \ntaken in Iraq, we have lost friends, trust, respect and admiration in \nthe global community. This new nuclear policy departure will only \nfurther erode U.S. leadership and esteem in the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Feinstein's \namendment to strike funding allocations for certain nuclear weapons \nresearch and development activities contained in H.R. 2754 the energy \nand water appropriations bill. Before I discuss the particulars of this \namendment, let me explain why it matters so very much in the context of \nthe international environment in coming decades.\n  Today, the United States is the pre-eminent conventional superpower \nin the world. We spend more on our Nation's military than the rest of \nthe world combined. As the dazzling display of firepower exhibited by \nour troops in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrates, our Nation boasts the \nmightiest military machine in world history.\n  But none of that means our Nation is secure or can afford to rest on \nits laurels. As September 11 graphically exhibited, the world is a very \ndangerous place, if only because our adversaries and rivals are turning \nto asymmetric warfare to nullify our military advantages and exploit \nour weaknesses. One key asymmetry lies in the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The spread of technology around the world allows a greater \nnumber of states and non-state actors to access the knowledge, \ntechnology, and infrastructure required to develop and produce nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons.\n  Nuclear weapons, in particular, can nullify the overwhelming \nconventional military strength of the United States. Today no weapons \nsystem can defend against the detonation of a nuclear weapon in an \nAmerican city. National missile defense holds out the prospect one day \nof preventing the delivery of nuclear weapons via intercontinental \nballistic missiles, but the technology is so premature that any \neffective system is years, if not decades, away. Indeed, a terrorist is \nunlikely to use an ICBM with a return address. And there is absolutely \nno system that can prevent a barge from sailing into New York City's \nharbor and detonating a nuclear explosive on board.\n  So nuclear proliferation represents the gravest threat today to our \nnational security, a threat from which our overwhelming conventional \nmilitary strength provides little protection. How do we best respond to \nthis threat? One school calls for the development of new nuclear \nweapons for possible use in an otherwise nonnuclear conflict. In order \nto ensure that a North Korea or an Iran cannot secure its chemical and \nbiological weapons or hide its leaders in underground bunkers, some \npeople call for new nuclear weapons capable of penetrating layers of \nearth and destroying deeply buried targets.\n  Advocates of new nuclear weapons go off the deep end, however, when \nthey suggest that low-yield weapons could ever destroy deeply buried \ntargets, or that a ``bunker-busting'' weapons would not cause horrific \ncivilian casualties. The laws of physics dictate that a warhead cannot \npenetrate more than 50 feet of dry rock before gravitational forces \ncause the warhead to break up. That means that a nuclear weapon big \nenough to destroy a deeply buried target--even a target 100 feet below \nground--cannot be ``low-yield''. Any low-yield weapon would simply lack \nthe explosive power necessary to destroy a target buried at that depth \nor lower. So the nuclear weapons designers tell us explicitly: A Robust \nNuclear Earth Penetrator will never be a low-yield weapon.\n  But what would happen if a low-yield weapon were used against a \nburied target? According to the physicist Sidney Drell, a one-kiloton \nnuclear weapon, well below the 5-kiloton threshold below which nuclear \nweapons are called ``low-yield'', detonating at a depth of 40 feet \nbelow the surface would still create a crater larger than the entire \nWorld Trade Center impact zone and churn up about 1 million cubic feet \nof radioactive material into the air. This very small one-kiloton \nnuclear weapon would wreak tremendous damage, contaminating the \nsurrounding area for miles on end with dangerous gamma rays and other \nradiation. This reality is vastly different from the image of a \nsurgical weapon promoted so often by its advocates.\n  Advocates of low-yield nuclear weapons are trying to have it both \nways. They want a weapon powerful enough to take out bunkers, \nneutralizing any stored chemical and biological agents, that are buried \ndeeply below the Earth's surface. At the same time, these weapons must \nbe small enough to minimize civilian casualties and destruction on the \nsurface. Unfortunately, scientists and weapons designers say it just \ncan't be done.\n  Weapons designers will tell you that the real purpose for low-yield \nnuclear weapons is not to strike underground targets when all other \noptions have failed. Rather, these weapons could strike regular surface \ntargets like leadership compounds--while reducing the damage that a \nmore regular-sized nuclear weapons would cause. But that resurrects the \nmisguided strategic concept that nuclear weapons are just handy tools, \nlike any other weapon--a bizarre notion that should have expired along \nwith Dr. Strangelove decades ago. Besides, low-yield weapons are \nnothing new. Every time we developed them, however, the military \nconcluded that they weren't worth the effort.\n  Any deterrence benefits that new low-yield nuclear weapons would \nprovide are far outweighed by both the risk that they will actually be \nused and the dangerous signal that they send to other countries--\nintentionally or not--that we intend to fight nuclear wars. Low-yield \nweapons, in particular, blur the traditional firewall between nuclear \nand conventional war. The sidestep the fact that a nuclear weapon is a \nweapon of a wholly different order and magnitude from any other weapon \nin existence today--something that any sane and rational society would \nonly use as a truly last resort. As Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated \nin 1945, even crude nuclear weapons are city-killers.\n  Let me point out one final challenge to the possible use of low-yield \nnuclear weapons to strike deeply buried targets. Any decision to order \nsuch a strike must rely upon unimpeachable intelligence, because no \nrational President will order even a low-yield nuclear weapons like \nwithout great confidence in the success of the mission. It is precisely \nthat type of intelligence which is so difficult to obtain when it comes \nto acquiring information on the location of WMD stockpiles and \nleadership compounds in rogue states. Just look at what happened during \nthe war on Iraq this spring. Twice, we thought we had Saddam in our \nsights. Our intelligence folks told the President they had good \ninformation that Saddam was in a particular location at a given time--\nbut in both cases they were wrong. Saddam either was never there or had \nleft before the bombs arrived. And as for taking out Saddam's chemical \nor biological weapons, ``all the king's horses and all the king's men'' \nwill get back to us later.\n  I'm not casting blame on our intelligence community--it is an \nincredible challenge to gain real-time tactical information in the heat \nof battle. But imagine the international outcry had the United States \nused a low-yield nuclear weapons to go after Saddam. Not only would we \nhave failed to kill him because he was not in the bunker, we would have \ncaused incalculable civilian casualties, razed a large part of Baghdad, \nand breached the nuclear threshold.\n  Is this a price any future Commander in Chief would or should be \nwilling to pay? Our enemies are not stupid--they will increasingly \nlocate valuable targets near or next to civilian sites, such as mosques \nand hospitals. They may will bury deeply hidden bunkers under these \nsites. Again, should any President give the OK to use a low-yield \nnuclear weapon under such circumstances? If not, why incur the fiscal \nexpense, diplomatic costs, and strategic risks of developing these new \nweapons in the first place? Why give other countries the sense that \nnuclear weapons are a vital element in our war-fighting plans, when \nthere would still be no rational reason for us to use them except in \nretaliation?\n  So what's the right response to the world we live in today, where \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\nproliferation poses the greatest security threat we face? I wish I \ncould offer you one simple solution that will effectively answer this \nchallenge. Unfortunately, no such magic bullet exists. Instead, we need \nto rely on a shrewd combination of accurate intelligence, diplomacy, \nmultilateral cooperation, arms control, export controls, interdiction, \nsanctions, and when appropriate, the threat or use of military force, \nto deter and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  In those situations where we must target deeply buried targets, \nconventional weapons offer a promising alternative to introducing \nnuclear weapons into the conflict. After all, chemical or biological \nweapons stored in an underground site can do no harm as long as they \nremain within that bunker. And an earth-penetrating nuclear weapon \ncould spread far more chemical or biological agents than it burned up, \nunless it landed very precisely on the target. So our military could \nemploy large conventional bombs to seal or destroy the entrance and \nexit tunnels to underground sites, so that any weapons stockpiles \nstored in such sites will not be going anywhere for a while.\n  Other scientists have discussed the feasibility of targeting a series \nof conventional missiles, one following the other, in order to burrow a \n``pilot hole'' toward a deeply buried target. So let's be clear--\nnuclear weapons are not the only possible solution for attacking an \nunderground target.\n  The neoconservative school argues that diplomacy, arms control, and \ninternational ``norms' have failed to deter rogue states like Iran and \nNorth Korea from developing nuclear weapons programs. There may be some \ntruth to that, but diplomacy has been instrumental in slowing down the \nprogress of these programs and restraining their scope. In addition, \nnonproliferation regimes and international norms have provided \ntremendous value in convincing more established states in the \ninternational system to remain non-nuclear. For example, it was their \ndesire for international legitimacy which, in part, persuaded Argentina \nand Brazil to give up their nascent nuclear weapons programs in the \n1980's. The same can be said for Japan, Taiwan, the Ukraine, and South \nAfrica, which have all foregone, halted, or voluntarily given up their \nown nuclear weapons programs.\n  How does the Feinstein amendment fit into this broader discussion \nover U.S. nuclear weapons strategy and the battle to combat nuclear \nproliferation? The energy and water appropriations bill includes the \nadministration's original requests for funding of a series of \ncontroversial nuclear weapons activities, including research into \nadvanced nuclear concepts, such as low-yield weapons, and reduction of \nthe time period between when a President makes the decision to resume \nnuclear testing and when our nuclear weapons complex would be able to \ncarry out a test.\n  This new funding to enhance our readiness to resume nuclear weapons \ntesting and conduct research on new weapons concepts and designs will \nlead us to a world where the further proliferation of nuclear weapons \nis more widely tolerated. While the senior officials in the current \nadministration have disavowed any intent to resume nuclear testing or \nproduce new nuclear weapons, their actions tell a different story.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review of December 2001 identified not only \nRussia and China as potential targets in a future nuclear war, but also \nNorth Korea, Iran, Syria, and Libya. The latter countries were cited as \nseeking weapons of mass destruction, but not necessarily nuclear \nweapons.\n  More recently, civilian Pentagon leaders ordered a task force to \nconsider possible requirements for new low-yield nuclear weapons, even \nwhile assuring the Senate that no formal requirement has yet been \nestablished.\n  A presidential strategy document reportedly stated that the United \nStates might use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state possessing \nchemical or biological weapons.\n  Senior officials publicly discuss the possible need to resume \nunderground nuclear testing, either to ensure that existing weapons are \nsafe and reliable or to test new weapons, all the while scorning the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The Feinstein amendment would strike out the $15 million allocation \nfor the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, eliminate the $6 million \nallocation for Advanced Weapons Concepts Initiative and prohibit the \nuse of any appropriated funds to shorten the time period required to \nprepare for an underground nuclear test from the current 24 to 36 \nmonths to less than 24 months.\n  It would also prohibit the use of funds for site selection or \nconceptual design of a Modern Pit Facility, which would produce \nreplacement plutonium triggers for the existing nuclear stockpile. The \namendment reallocates the eliminated funding to the paramount goal of \ndeficit reduction.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that this amendment only proposes to do \nwhat the Republican-controlled House largely already did in July, when \nit adopted its version of the Energy and Water appropriations bill. \nAccording to press reports, Representative David Hobson, the Republican \nchairman of the relevant House Appropriations subcommittee, defended \nhis panel's decision to strike this funding by asserting the U.S. \nGovernment should first address the rising costs of managing its \nexisting nuclear stockpile and disposing of its nuclear waste before \nmoving ahead with new nuclear programs. Neither the full House \nAppropriations Committee nor the House as a whole challenged the \nsubcommittee's mark.\n  We should all remember the House's actions when our opponents charge \nthat this amendment will jeopardize U.S. national security or \nrepresents some extremist, antinuclear weapons agenda. In fact, the \nopposite is true.\n  So what's the bottom line here? Today, the United States deploys \n6,000 strategic nuclear warheads and possesses in total more than \n10,000 deployed or reserve nuclear weapons. As we are the overwhelming \nconventional military power in the world, it is decidedly against our \ninterest to see others obtain and/or use nuclear weapons. Why on earth, \nthen, are we considering the acquisition of additional and more \nadvanced nuclear weapons?\n  If we continue on these steps to develop these new weapons, our \nfriends and enemies alike can easily dismiss our future admonitions on \nwhy nuclear weapons fail to provide true security. Indeed, our \nadversaries will take to heart one overriding lesson: Develop your own \nnuclear weapons to deter a preemptive U.S. strike.\n  Let me close with a statement by Secretary of State Colin Powell, a \nman who spent the majority of his career in the uniformed military. In \nMay 2002, Secretary Powell discussed the potential for an India-\nPakistan conflict to evolve into a nuclear clash. But his larger point \nholds true for our debate today:\n\n       Nuclear weapons in this day and age may serve some \n     deterrent effect, and so be it, but to think of using them as \n     just another weapon in what might start out as a conventional \n     conflict in this day and age seems to be something that no \n     side should be contemplating.\n\n  The Feinstein amendment enhances U.S. national security by preventing \nour Nation from sleepwalking into an era when nuclear weapons are \nconsidered just another weapon. The United States is the leader of the \nworld. Other nations watch us and they follow our lead. Let's not lead \nthem astray.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the debate over \nfunding for the administration's request for studying new nuclear \nweapons in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill.\n  The administration proposes that Congress fund the study of two new \nnuclear weapons: a robust nuclear earth penetrator, RNEP, and a low \nyield nuclear weapon.\n  Why does the United States need these new nuclear weapons?\n  The administration's case for these new nuclear weapons presumes that \ndeterrence may not be working well in the post-cold war security \nenvironment. Leaders of rogue states may conclude that the United \nStates cannot attack their deep bunkers or weapons of mass destruction, \nWMD, and so act or use their WMD with impunity. These new nuclear \nweapons supposedly will bolster the U.S. deterrent.\n  But does our nuclear arsenal no longer deter?\n  Deterrence involves credibly threatening an enemy to deter them from \ntaking unwanted actions. It involves having the forces to fulfill the \nthreat\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nand the resolve to carry out the threat. We have enough nuclear weapons \nto accomplish this goal. Over a decade after the end of the cold war we \npossess an arsenal that could still end life on earth as we know it. \nThis massive destructive power should give pause to any nation or \ndictator that wants to attack the United States with nuclear weapons.\n  While the Congress was on recess, the annual remembrance of the \nbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the end of World War II passed. \nOn August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on \nHiroshima. Three days later another was dropped on Nagasaki. Shortly \nthereafter Japan surrendered, ending World War II.\n  The Hiroshima bomb had an explosive power of 15 kilotons of TNT and \nkilled almost 70,000 people immediately and injured as many more. The \nNagasaki bomb was 22 kilotons and killed 40,000 people and injured \nanother 25,000. There had been devastating conventional bombing attacks \nduring World War II. The fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo also caused \nwidespread damage and loss of life. But the realization that one plane \nwith one bomb could destroy a city was a new and fearsome development.\n  After the end of World War II and the onset of the cold war, the U.S. \narsenal expanded rapidly. By 1960, more than ten thousand nuclear \nweapons were in the U.S. arsenal. Weapons had expanded from kiloton to \nmegaton size. The U.S. arsenal grew to have 20,500 megatons of TNT \nexplosive power.\n  A megaton is an enormous amount of destructive power. A kiloton is a \nthousand tons. A megaton is a million tons. In 1960, the U.S. arsenal \nhad almost seven tons of TNT of explosive power for every one of the \nthree billion men, women and children on the planet.\n  The massive overkill of the U.S. arsenal, like its Soviet \ncounterpart, has declined since the 1960s. The United States still \nkeeps thousands of nuclear weapons. But the average explosive power of \na U.S. nuclear weapons has decreased. As a result the U.S. arsenal \ntoday contains only some 1,200 megatons of explosive power. Still \nenough, however, for 400 lbs. for every person on Earth.\n  Some advocates of small nuclear weapons claim massive firepower is a \npoor deterrent. They argue that the United States would not use a large \nnuclear weapon for a limited strike. They further argue that smaller, \nmore usable nuclear weapons will be a more credible deterrent because \nrogue state leaders will believe the United States could use them. The \nadministration proposes to investigate the possibilities of a new \nnuclear weapon with a yield of less than five kilotons to meet this \ngoal.\n  Five kilotons is one third the size of the Hiroshima bomb. It is not \na low-yield weapon. It is equivalent to 5,000 tons of ten million \npounds of TNT. Yet, the use of such new lower yield nuclear weapons is \nincredible because it is impractical and there are conventional weapons \nthat can or will be able to do the job. We are told there are dozens if \nnot hundreds of buried hardened targets. Without excellent intelligence \non where WMD or rogue leaders may be hidden, the United States would \nneed to drop dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons. The radioactive \nfallout from such a strike would be large. The international political \nfallout would be massive and so would be the international \nenvironmental effects.\n  The U.S. nuclear arsenal is currently diverse and flexible. the \nUnited States in fact already possesses such low-yield nuclear weapons. \nI asked Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham for the record when he was \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee this spring if the United \nStates had operational nuclear weapons that could have yields of less \nthan five kilotons. Secretary Abraham's unclassified written response \nwas that, ``The U.S. has two existing nuclear weapons that have \ncertified yields of less than five kilotons.''\n  As for the robust nuclear earth penetrator, we already have one of \nthese as well. As has been well publicized, in the mid-1990's, the \nUnited States deployed the B61-11 bomb for an earth penetrating \nmission.\n  The administration claims the B61-11 is no longer adequate for the \njob. Energy Department officials informed congressional staff in an \nunclassified briefing that the B61-11 was designed not to penetrate \nrock but to attack only certain targets in hard or frozen soil in \nRussia. It is not able to counter targets deeply buried under granite \nrock. Moreover, it has a high yield, in the hundreds of kilotons. If \nused in North Korea, the radioactive fall out could drift over nearby \ncountries such as Japan.\n  Is the solution to a seeming limitation to the B61-11 exploring yet \nmore and more nuclear weapon designs? This search for a perfect nuclear \ndeterrent reminds me of the mad logic of the cold war where the United \nStates and Soviet Union pursued more and more nuclear weapons of more \nand more sophisticated designs to try to cover more and more \ncontingencies. These endless improvements are unnecessary, expensive \nand dangerous.\n  For example, some argue using new small penetrator nuclear weapons is \npreferable to using conventional weapons for attacking buried chemical \nor biological weapons. They hope that a nuclear weapon would incinerate \nhidden weapons. However, calculations by Princeton physicist Robert \nNelson indicate that, unless the strike is extraordinarily precise, the \nblast from a nuclear weapon has as good a chance of dispersing buried \nagents as destroying them. Our conventional forces can also attack or \ndisable deeply buried targets. They will continue to improve in \neffectiveness and lethality. We should focus on improving their \ncapability, not chasing some nuclear will o' the wisp.\n  The $21 million for the RNEP and advanced weapons concepts, including \nthe low-yield nuclear weapons, in the fiscal year 2003 budget could be \nbetter spent elsewhere to guard us against real nuclear threats. There \nis widespread agreement that al Qaeda or other terrorist groups would \nmake use of a dirty bomb if they could get hold of radioactive \nmaterials. I have released three General Accounting Office reports this \nyear that show the United States and international controls over \nradioactive sealed sources that could be used in a dirty bomb are \nseverely lacking. The Energy Department could better spend the funds \nbeing proposed for new nuclear weapons on improving the tracking and \nsecurity of dangerous radioactive sources here and abroad.\n  Pursuing new nuclear weapons will undermine our non-proliferation \ngoals. The example we set for the rest of the world does matter. \nGetting the world's approval for the indefinite extension of the \nNuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1995 was dependent on the United \nStates and the other nuclear powers signaling they would rapidly \nnegotiate a comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, CTBT.\n  The United States and Russian decision to stop nuclear testing in the \nlead up to the CTBT talks put pressure on France and China to end their \nnuclear test programs in the 1990's. Had the United States and the \nother nuclear powers not stopped nuclear testing it would have been \neven more difficult to pressure Pakistan and India to put a quick to \ntheir nuclear tests. It would be even harder to put pressure on North \nKorea today.\n  Getting the world to continue to help us to pressure North Korea and \nIran will be more complicated if the United States weakens its \ncommitments to non-proliferation. In early September, Russia complained \nthat several states' failure to ratify the CTBT is delaying its entry \ninto force at an international conference convened to look at this \nquestion. This controversy over the U.S. non-proliferation policy is \nnot welcome news when the administration is now seeking support to \ncondemn Iran's nuclear program at an upcoming IAEA meeting. News \nreports indicate that the United States will have a hard time doing \nthis as Iran has more allies on the IAEA's board than does the United \nStates.\n  The non-proliferation regime, laboriously constructed by the United \nStates and the international community over 30 years, has been a \nsuccess. Rather than having dozens of countries with nuclear weapons, \nwe confront a few, final, hard cases that have been a problem for many \nyears but whose time is running out. New nuclear weapons are not the \nway to address the challenges these nations pose.\n  Rather, a diplomacy of engagement, building the support of the \ninternational community, and maintaining our strong alliance \ncommitments and conventional forces is the way forward.\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n  The administration is learning that force and confrontation are not a \nsolution to the non-proliferation problem. Saddam Hussein's weapon of \nmass destruction program was not an imminent threat. Continued \ninspections and indefinite monitoring which were envisioned under the \nU.N. resolutions would have contained his program. Confrontation with \nNorth Korea has led to an acceleration of the North Korean nuclear \nprogram not its demise. Now the administration must negotiate seriously \nwith North Korea to bring and end to the crisis and create a new \nsecurity regime in the Northeast Pacific.\n  The administration should understand more and more types of nuclear \nweapons will not guarantee deterrence, prevent the proliferation of \nWMD, prevent war or conflict. In fact, during the cold war we found our \never increasing nuclear arsenal could not achieve these goals. \nParanoid, pygmy or pariah states, as Professor Richard Betts once \ncharacterized them, sought nuclear weapons for their defense due to \ntheir imagined or justified fears, their perceived conventional \nweaknesses, or because of their outcast status. Nuclear weapons did not \nprevent the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Arab-Israeli wars, or the \nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n  Deterrence has many components: nuclear forces, conventional forces, \nstrong alliances, a strong economy, and a strong resolve among them. At \nthis moment in history we need an intelligent diplomacy, strengthened \nalliances and capable conventional forces more than we need more and \nnew types of nuclear weapons.\n  We have enough nuclear weapons to maintain nuclear deterrence. If \nanything, we should be seeking ways to further reduce ours and other \ncountries' nuclear arsenals, not add to them. Talk to the contrary by \npromoters of new nuclear weapons misrepresents the strength of our \nexisting forces and our resolve. We are sending the wrong message about \nour military strength.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject funding for these new nuclear weapon \ndesigns.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator Feinstein's amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of Senator \nReid, it has come to my attention, for a reason involving an individual \nSenator, that it would be more accommodating if we started our vote at \n2:45. Does the Senator have any objection to that?\n  Mr. REID. I modify the request that the time between 2:15 and 2:45 be \nequally divided between both sides, Senator Domenici controlling 15 \nminutes and Senator Feinstein controlling 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I indicate to the Senate that we will have a few \nminutes before the vote. I will summarize again and we will have \nhandouts if anyone needs to know what this Senator thinks the issues we \nwill vote on are.\n  In summary, No. 1, there is no authorization to build any new nuclear \nweapons. We are building none now. We have not built any for a long \nperiod of time.\n  No. 2, a portion of this bill says the Nevada Test Site will be made \nready so it can be used in 18 months rather than 3 years. Almost \neveryone knowledgeable in the field thinks it is high time that \nhappened.\n  No. 3, there is a small amount of money to begin planning, designing \nand feasibility, for a pit manufacturing facility. We are the only \nnation with nuclear weapons which has no spare pits, plutonium pits, \nthe essential ingredient. We have tried to make them in Los Alamos. It \nis makeshift and it has been very expensive.\n  It is clearly indicated for the next 40 or 50 years we need to build \na facility. This bill provides a start on that long-term effort.\n  Not yet have I said anything about new weapons or America engaging in \na new course of conduct with respect to nuclear energy. That is not \nhappening.\n  Next, the bill says, do not tie the hands of our great scientists \nwith reference to the future. Let them study, let them think, let them \ndesign, but do not let anyone build any new weapons. Let them think \nabout the future and what might be needed in light of the changed \ncircumstances in the world. It is very prudent to do that.\n  In all three regards, there are clear cases the Feinstein amendment \nshould fail. I hope it does so we can proceed ahead with these things \nthat are necessary.\n  I yield whatever time the distinguished Senator from Indiana needs. I \nshare my grave concern and condolences over the death of his esteemed \nGovernor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11529-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11529-S11530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR FRANK O'BANNON\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank my colleague from New Mexico, and I thank all \nMembers of this body.\n  It is with a sense of melancholy but also gratitude that I rise today \nto celebrate the life of Frank O'Bannon. He died as he lived, in \nservice to the people of the State of Indiana.\n  Frank O'Bannon was my friend and spent the best years of his life in \npublic service: 18 years following in the footsteps of his father in \nthe Indiana State Senate where he served as the leader of the \nDemocratic Party; 8 years as lieutenant governor where we enjoyed a \nseamless partnership working on behalf of the people of our State, \nalways a source of wise counsel, support, and encouragement; in these \nlast 7 years, working on behalf of the people as Governor of the State \nof Indiana.\n  His accomplishments were many and will be everlasting in memory. His \ndevotion to education was second to none. He fought for higher academic \nstandards, a system of assessments to determine how children are doing \ntoward meeting those standards, and taking aggressive steps to ensure \nthat every child across our State would have access to the skills \nnecessary to make the most of their God-given abilities.\n  He worked tirelessly first as lieutenant governor and then as \nGovernor on behalf of a better economy, more job opportunities for the \npeople of Indiana. Particularly during these recent difficult years he \ndoubled his efforts to ensure that our State would be competitive with \nnot only our neighboring States but also with those with which we \ncompete from abroad.\n  Frank O'Bannon cared about a better quality of life for all Hoosiers. \nHe work tirelessly for better health care for the citizens of our \nState, particularly for the young. I am so very proud the State of \nIndiana ranks at the top in the country in terms of how we have used \nthe new CHIP Program to extend health care benefits to disadvantaged \nchildren across our State. I was privileged to work with him in my \ncapacity in the Senate to ensure our State continued to receive full \nfunding for our efforts.\n  Frank O'Bannon had many other important contributions in his legacy. \nMost recently I had a chance to visit the new White River State Park in \nIndianapolis and the magnificent Historical Society Center in \nIndianapolis where he hosted, along with our first lady, Judy O'Bannon, \nthe other Governors from across the country to showcase the magnificent \nplace that Indianapolis has become. The Historical Society was a \nwonderful setting for the Governors. We had a chance to display the \nfinest of Hoosier heritage for the entire country.\n  The White River State Park will be a magnificent urban park \nattracting not only tourists from across the State but also business \nand industry as leaders of finance seek a better quality of life for \ntheir employees. His contributions to that effort were substantial, as \nwell.\n  I believe Frank O'Bannon was a special man not for his material \naccomplishments but instead for the kind of man he was. There is an old \nsaying that character is destiny. I believe that is true. Therefore, it \nis no wonder that Frank O'Bannon accomplished so much. He was a man of \ntrue and outstanding character, indeed. In all my years of association \nwith him I never once saw him do something that was mean or petty. He \nunderstood very well that it is far better to be loved than feared. \nEven more, I always saw him place self-interest behind the public good, \ntruly remarkable during an age of cynicism and skepticism about those \nin public life.\n\n  There is an old proverb that says the definition of a statesman is \nsomeone who plants a tree in whose shade he will never rest. Seedlings \nhave been\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nplanted across our State that will grow into strong oaks under which \nfuture generations will rest with ease, more secure because of the work \nand the legacy of Governor O'Bannon. He was a statesman, indeed.\n  A calling characterized all too frequently by ego and hubris, Frank \nO'Bannon was always humble, gentle, giving credit to others, even when \nhe deserved the lion's share. One of his favorite pastimes was to go to \nhis cabin in Harrison County in southern Indiana to commune with nature \nand watch the wildlife and experience Mother Nature. That is where \nFrank and Judy O'Bannon were most at home. That speaks volumes about \nhis character, as well.\n  Let me say a word, too, about Judy. She was an exemplary first lady, \nleading our State in the celebration of the recent millennium, always \nconcerned that our history and culture never be lost, always reaching \nout to those in need. She is generous of spirit. I hope her \ncontributions to our State will continue for many, many years to come. \nJudy O'Bannon has done the people of our State proud.\n  So today, my colleagues and Mr. President, we mourn, but we can take \ncomfort in the knowledge that our loss has been Heaven's gain, that the \nlife and legacy of Frank O'Bannon will not end with our grieving or \nwith my few inadequate words but will remain everlasting in the hearts \nof Hoosiers everywhere as long as we can still recall what makes our \nState such a special place.\n  I thank my friends and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I think a recess is \ncoming; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11530-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, \ndespite the recess, to be able to speak 3 minutes in opposition to \nSenator Feinstein's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to \nSenator Feinstein's amendment, certainly not in opposition to her. She \nis one of my closest friends in the Senate, and I admire her greatly. \nWe just simply disagree on this particular amendment.\n  Of all the debates we are going to have in the coming months, I think \nthis is one of the most important. The amendment would prohibit the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Energy from pursuing an \nadvanced concept and research design to transform some current \ninventories of nuclear weapons, to be able to do something they cannot \ndo today; that is, to penetrate hardened sites to counter the war on \nterrorism.\n  The war on terrorism is like every other war in many ways. The people \nwe are fighting have the same hopes and aspirations as the people who \nfought in World War II. In Hitler's world, if you were not of a certain \nethnic makeup, you could lose your life. And in Hitler's world, there \nwas total obedience to the state. And the Japanese empire had a very \nintolerant view of the people who were different and disagreed.\n  The idea that one particular group wants to shape the world in a very \nharsh fashion has been with us as long as time itself. And in the \nterrorist world, young girls don't go to school. In their world, there \nis one way to worship God. It is their way. If you choose to do it some \nother way, you could lose your life.\n  So the basic concepts of the war on terrorism are very old. But the \nway we fight this war is going to take some adapting. The group that \nwins the war on terrorism will be the group that was able to adapt the \nbest.\n  Here is what I see coming down the road for the American military, \nfor American policymakers. The terrorist organizations that perpetrated \n9/11 and that we are pursuing all over the world today do not have \nnavies and armies, and they do not have a nuclear force as we faced in \nthe former Soviet Union. But they have a desire, unequaled by anybody, \nto build a nuclear weapon, to acquire chemical and biological weapons. \nTheir desire is great. Their commitment to use it is unquestioned.\n  Let it be said, without any doubt, if they could get a nuclear \nweapon, they would use it. If they could get chemical or biological \nweapons that would hurt millions of Americans or people who believe in \nfreedom, they would use it.\n  The only way they are not going to use it is to make sure they don't \nget it. And the best way to make sure they don't get it is to bring \nthem to justice, and to end their ability to finance terrorist \nactivities, to organize, and to project force.\n\n  I can foresee in the near future, not the distant future, that \nterrorist cells will reorganize. They will use some remote part of the \nworld to form their plans, to plot and scheme, and maybe to actually \nmanufacture--some remote part of the world that is very well guarded \nand not subject to conventional attacks, in a part of the world where \nit would be hard to get conventional forces to neutralize the terrorist \nthreat. I see that as a very real possibility in the coming decades, in \nthe coming years, maybe even the coming months.\n  The legislation we have before us would take off the table our \nability to adapt our nuclear deterrent force to meet that threat. Look \nhow much money we spent during the cold war to neutralize the Soviet \nthreat--the Star Wars programs and other ideas that made it very \ndifficult for our enemy at the time to keep pace. It is one of the \nreasons the world is safer today, because we were able to adapt.\n  We took our nuclear programs, not to use the weapons, but to prevent \nthose weapons from being used against us. We adapted our nuclear force \nin a way that eventually won the cold war.\n  I think that same scenario exists today. We should have on the table \nthe ability of the great minds in this country to adapt, if necessary. \nAnd there is nothing in this proposal by the administration to build a \nweapon. It is to look at our current inventory and see if it can be \nadapted to a real threat.\n  I admire Senator Feinstein, but I think her amendment would do a \ngreat injustice to the future policymakers and the military men and \nwomen of the future when it comes to fighting the war on terrorism \nbecause this war has just started. It is not anywhere near over. The \nmajor players are still alive, but they are trying to get people to \nfollow in their footsteps. So we are going to be in this war for a long \ntime.\n  The question before the Senate and before the country is, If we knew \nthat bin Laden, or someone like him, was in some mountain fortress in \nAfghanistan or some other country, on the verge, within that fortress, \nof developing a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon, what would we \ndo to stop it?\n  I think we should do everything we can to stop it. And the idea of \nbeing able to use a redesigned nuclear weapon to keep a terrorist from \nhitting us with a nuclear weapon is something that we have to come to \ngrips with because it is part of the war on terrorism.\n  So I hope the Senate will reject Senator Feinstein's efforts to stop \nthis inquiry because this is an inquiry that needs to be made sooner \nrather than later. I think the Bush administration is on the right \ncourse and the right path in taking the great minds of our time and \nletting them adapt our nuclear force to the coming threats because the \ncoming threats are not from the Soviet bloc countries; they are going \nto be our allies. The coming threats are from people who hide in \nfaraway places, deep in the bowels of the earth, with great hatred in \ntheir hearts.\n  We need to meet that threat. So I ask each Member of the Senate to \ndig within their heart and to make sure their vote does not take an \noption off the table that may well save this country from something we \nnever experienced: a major nuclear, chemical, or biological attack.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11530-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11530-S11531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when 7 \nminutes have expired so I can defer to my cosponsor, Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nnames of Senators Johnson, Murray, Clinton, and Rockefeller be added to \nour amendment as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Kennedy and I came \nto the floor and we spent some time arguing on behalf of an amendment \nto this bill which contained language similar to what was recently past \nby a large majority in the House of Representatives. The bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives struck the language that appropriates \nfunds to begin a new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  Now, there are some on the other side who say, and continue to say, \nthis is just a study; there is no development. I believe that is not \nthe case. Let me connect the dots for you.\n  In January of 2002, the administration put forward a Nuclear Posture \nReview which advocates the development of new types of nuclear weapons. \nLater that year, the President signed National Security Directive 17, \nindicating that the United States might use nuclear weapons first to \nrespond to a chemical or biological attack.\n  Earlier this year, a decade-old prohibition on the development of \nlow-yield nuclear weapons was rescinded in the Defense authorization \nbill. For 10 years, this kind of thing was prohibited. That \nprohibition, known as the Spratt-Furse amendment, was repealed earlier \nthis year.\n  This spring a statement of administration policy for the Defense \nauthorization bill clearly included support for the research and \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  In this bill the Senate is being asked to provide the dollars to \nbegin this effort--$15 million for the study of a robust nuclear earth \npenetrator. We are talking in excess of 100 kilotons; $6 million for \nadvanced concepts research, including low-yield weapons; funding for \nenhanced test site readiness; and a huge new $4 billion plutonium pit \nfacility--all of this when we are already spending $2.3 billion for a \nLos Alamos facility that can provide replacement for the U.S. nuclear \nstockpile.\n  We are strongly opposed to America beginning a new generation of \nnuclear weapons. We are opposed to it for two reasons: No. 1, the low-\nyield nuclear weapon--under 5 kilotons--essentially begins to blur the \nuse between conventional and nuclear weapons, therefore making it \neasier to use. And, No. 2, because the world will watch this and the \nworld will respond. The way in which they will respond is with a new \nnuclear arms race.\n\n  If the United States begins to develop tactical, battlefield nuclear \nweapons, how long will it take for two indigenous nuclear powers, \nnamely India and Pakistan, arch enemies, to say we should do the same \nthing. How long will it take for North Korea or Iran or any other \nnation that so seeks to begin such a similar program?\n  As many internationally have said: America preaches nonproliferation, \nand then it goes ahead and develops new nuclear weapons.\n  I think that is hypocritical. I do not think this country should be \nin that position.\n  So we strike these items; we fence two, we place the rest of the \nmoney in deficit reduction.\n  I want to say a few words about the nuclear pits because I think \nthere is some misunderstanding. Although current production capacity \nmay be limited, it is simply not true, as some have asserted, that the \nUnited States lacks the capacity to manufacture replacement pits. \nAccording to the Department of Energy's own Web site:\n\n       The first pit that could be certified for use in the \n     stockpile was manufactured in April 2003 as a first step to \n     establish an interim--10 to 20 pits per year--production \n     capability at Los Alamos in 2007.\n\n  And the Los Alamos facility can be modified to produce 150 pits a \nyear.\n  Although the exact number is classified, reputable open sources \nestimate that there are between 5,000 and 12,000 extra pits in reserve \nat Pantex, beyond the 10,600 current intact warheads.\n  The average age of the plutonium pits in the U.S. stockpile is 19 \nyears, and the Department of Energy estimates a pit minimum life to be \nbetween 45 and 60 years, with no life-limiting factors.\n  This is the beginning. This money will go to field a new generation \nof nuclear weapons. We should not do this. The House had the good sense \nto eliminate this language. The Senate should follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes ten seconds.\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And how much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 13 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Four minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am recognized for how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has yielded 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield the remainder of \nmy time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then, would the Chair let me know when I have a minute \nand a half left, please?\n  First of all, I welcome the opportunity to be here with my friend and \ncolleague from California in what I consider to be one of the most \nimportant votes that we will have this year. It is an issue involving \nour security. It is an issue, I believe, also, in the battle on \nterrorism.\n  It was just 40 years September 24, 40 years ago on September 24, that \nwe had the signing of the first partial test ban treaty.\n  This chart reflects in a very abbreviated way, but an enormously \nimportant way what has happened over the last 40 years as leaders of \nthe Democrats and Republicans alike moved us away from the real \npossibility of nuclear confrontation, and we have seen enormous \nsuccess. We have seen the willingness of countries around the world to \ngive up their capability of developing nuclear weapons because they \nwanted to be a part of the worldwide effort on nuclear proliferation. \nThey also recognized it would be a more secure world if we didn't have \nfurther nuclear expansion.\n  We listened to the debate yesterday and the points that were well-\nmade by my very good friend from New Mexico about how this legislation \nis really not about developing a new nuclear weapon. But the Senator \nfrom California pointed out three different references, all which have \nbeen included as a part of the Record. The most obvious is the \nadministration's own statement of administration policy this past \nspring asking for the continued need for ``flexibility in the \ncooperative threat reduction program and support for critical research \nand the development''--I will say this again--``and the development for \nlow-yield nuclear weapons.'' That is what this issue is about.\n  Are we going to reverse the last 40 years? Do we possibly think there \nwill be a safer America if we begin to move back towards the testing \nand the developing of what they call mini-nukes?\n  I don't believe so, because I believe a nuke is a nuke is a nuke. It \nis an entirely different weapons system than those in our conventional \nforces. We understand that. We have to take what the administration has \nstated: they intend to move ahead in the development of a new nuclear \ncapability.\n  Those with responsibility within the administration have made it very \nclear. In February of 2003, Fred Celec, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Nuclear Affairs, said:\n\n       If a nuclear bomb could be developed to penetrate rock and \n     concrete and still explode, it will ultimately get fielded.\n\n  In April of 2003, Linton Brooks, Chief of Nuclear Weapons at the \nDepartment of Energy, stated before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       I have a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield because . \n     . . I have a bias in favor of things that might be usable.\n\n  We have been warned. We have the capability that exists to make sure \nwe have the deterrence on into the future. But this is a radical \ndeparture of 40 years of Republicans and Democrats alike moving us away \nfrom the dangers of nuclear confrontations and the dangers of nuclear \nproliferation to the development of small nuclear weapons. And we will \nfind this an invitation for the terrorists around the world to come and \nseek out that weapon. If we develop a small nuclear weapon, what are we \ngoing to find? The corresponding action by countries around the world--\nthe Iranians and the North Koreans continuing their progress in \ndeveloping their own nuclear weapons system.\n  That doesn't make sense in terms of the country that is the number \none military force in the world today. It doesn't make sense, and it \ndoesn't make sense for our battle against the war on terrorism.\n  It is very clear why this amendment is needed. The administration \npretends it is not really planning to produce these new kinds of \nnuclear weapons--the mini-nukes and the bunker busters. They just want \nto find out if they are feasible.\n  We all know what is at stake. The administration wants us to take the \nfirst steps down a new path. But going down that path could easily make \nnuclear war more likely. Just a little step--they say. But it is still \na first step. And a step down that path now could make the next step \neasier, and the next and the next. It is a path that makes nuclear war \nmore likely, and the time to call a halt is now--before we take the \nfirst step.\n  We ask for and implore the support of our colleagues to move us away \nfrom the real dangers of nuclear proliferation and the development of \nthese dangerous mini-nukes that can pose a danger to the world \npopulation.\n  I withhold whatever time is left.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before the chairman of the committee \nspeaks, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stabenow be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, first of all, it should \nbe understood by everyone that this language which is being stricken \ndoes not permit the United States of America to build any new nuclear \nweapons--large, small, medium-sized, or otherwise. There is no \nauthority in this bill to build new nuclear weapons.\n  No. 2, this bill says that in Nevada we used to test nuclear weapons \nfor decades. Whenever our nuclear laboratory experts used to certify to \nour Presidents that the weapons were in good shape, ready, reliable, \navailable, and safe, they did it principally because we had a testing \nground in Nevada, and we tested bombs to know precisely their efficacy, \nreliability, et cetera.\n  When we decided to no longer test, we essentially closed down or put \nthat test facility in mothballs. But we knew we must always keep it in \ncase we needed it. We left it there, saying if we ever need it, we can \nuse it in 3 years.\n  All this amendment does--it could be a totally freestanding \namendment, if one wanted, but it is part of the amendment that the \nSenator from California strikes--is say let us upgrade that Nevada Test \nSite so if we need it, we can use it in 1\\1/2\\ years. There are few \nAmerican nuclear experts who do not think 1\\1/2\\ years is the correct \namount--not 3 but 1\\1/2\\. That has nothing to do with us setting about \nto build a brand new small nuclear weapon. It has nothing to do with us \nbuilding a stockpile of new weapons. It has to do with just what I \nexplained and nothing else.\n  Third, regardless of what has gone on in Los Alamos for the last 7 \nyears in an effort to produce for America plutonium pits--the \ningredient for a nuclear weapon that must be there or you don't have a \nnuclear weapon--we have no American manufacturing center for the \nproduction of pits. The Los Alamos facility has been a facility that we \njust pushed. We pushed it and pushed it, and finally it has almost \nproduced a pit. But it has not produced a certifiable pit yet in 7 \nyears of effort. It has produced a pit or two, but they are not \ncertifiable, which means they are not complete.\n  All this bill says is the time has come to build a plant to \nmanufacture pits for the next 40 years--not for a new weapons system \nbut so we can have them in storage for the next 40 years. We are the \nonly nuclear weapons power without spare pits for nuclear weapons. Yes, \nthe only one. Why would we say we should not do that? The only reason \nwe would do it is if we believed what the Senator from California \nalleges; that is, we are doing it because we are going to build a new \nset of nuclear weapons.\n  If we were authorizing a series or a set of new nuclear weapons, this \namendment would be the biggest amendment in the country. It would have \nbeen written about, talked about, harked about, and we would have been \nall over and upside down and inside out. But there is nothing in the \nbill that produces a single new nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\n  That comes to the final part. It is very simple, if you will just \nlisten and know what we are trying to do.\n  Those who manage our nuclear, those who are our nuclear experts, who \nuse their minds to dream up ideas about where we are going to be, what \ntroubles we might have in the future, and what new might occur in the \nworld that might require changes, are the men and women of great \ntalent. This bill does what the executive branch and the experts on \nnuclear management say: Let those people think, let those people \ndesign, let those people postulate, and don't put blinders on their \nbrains and say you can't even think about these things because it might \nsomeday yield an idea that might cause us to do something different \nwith a nuclear weapon.\n  Frankly, I believe the men and women who already put that fantastic \nbrainpower to work in this area deserve to have their brains used, not \ntied in knots by rules about what you cannot think about and what you \ncannot plan for.\n\n  The third part, this amendment says you cannot plan, think about, \ndesign for the future, even when you know you cannot build them, which \nis what the rule is going to be.\n  We have argued this about as long as we can. I have argued it about \nas hard as I can. I am getting close to being tired of arguing this, \nbut it is so important we not make a mistake. It would be a tragic \nmistake to vote for the Feinstein amendment. There is nothing we are \ndoing that the Feinstein amendment should stop. If, in fact, we were \ngoing to build nuclear weapons, you ought to be concerned and perhaps \nvote with her, if she is saying do not do it. But we do not plan to. It \nis not in here. And she cannot stop it because we are not going to do \nit. In that regard, the amendment is useless.\n  But it is not useless when it comes to the three things that it does: \nIt will stop us from planning the manufacturing plant of the future for \npits. It will do that. And we should not do that. Second, it will stop \nthe money and the planning and the work to bring the Nevada Test Site \nup to par and ready for a new test in 18 months rather than 3 years. It \nwill do that. And third, it will put blinders on the scientists with \nreference to them being able to speak about the future and future \nneeds, which change.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Jack Reed has an amendment that \nis acceptable, if he is ready. Is the Senator ready?\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\n  Mr. REED. I have my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 1659 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 1569.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of fund for certain activities relating \n  to advanced nuclear weapons concepts, including the robust nuclear \n                           earth penetrator)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 313. No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     to the Department of Energy by this Act may be available for \n     activities at the engineering development phases, phase 3 or \n     6.3, or beyond, in support of advanced nuclear weapons \n     concepts, including the robust nuclear earth penetrator.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson \nof Florida be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Feinstein-Kennedy \namendment did not pass because I believe that amendment really \nresponded to the issues of the moment. We are in a dangerous time \nbecause we see around the globe where there are nations aspiring to \nbecome nuclear powers, where proliferation is one of the most dangerous \nthreats this Nation faces, particularly proliferation that would \nprovide fissile material to terrorists, which is the great fear of all \nof us.\n  In order to resist the growth of nuclear powers around the globe, we \nhave to be faithful to our commitment to arms control and our sense \nthat further development of nuclear weapons--and, I would argue, \nweapons without military requirements--is really not so much an \nexercise in protecting the United States but it is an exercise that \nwill lead us down a path that could see our country exposed to even \nmore dangers. So I am very much concerned that the Feinstein-Kennedy \namendment failed.\n  Therefore, I am proposing an amendment that I hope will essentially \nput restraints upon the use of these dollars in the development of \nnuclear weapons, and I will explain it in more detail later. It would \nconstrain the expenditure of funds to the the research phase. It would \npreclude monies to be used to engineer a weapon, to test a weapon, and \nto deploy a weapon. It is language that is consistent with the language \nincluded in the Defense Authorization Act which we passed several \nmonths ago.\n  We are at a difficult moment in our history, as I mentioned.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield for a question to my cosponsor, \nSenator Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I appreciate the Senator offering this \namendment and I just want to underscore with a question that the \nSenator's amendment will allow the research to go on as we intended in \nthe Defense authorization bill but would not allow the development and \nthe engineering where these weapons would be actually designed until \nsuch time as the executive branch would come back to the Congress to \nget approval to do that. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REED. That is absolutely correct. It reflects the value of the \ncontribution the Senator from Florida made in the Defense authorization \ndebate.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. There are some who have criticized any attempts at arms \ncontrol as futile, as failures. That, I think, is a dangerous idea. I \nhope arms controls work because history seems to show that, without \ncontrolling arms, eventually they wind up being used, and when it comes \nto the issue of nuclear weapons, that is a great nightmare that has \nhaunted all mankind since 1945.\n  Since that date, we have been successful in containing the use of \nnuclear weapons. It is because we took prudent steps to try to control \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons, the development of nuclear \nweapons. And at this juncture in history, to stand up and say arms \ncontrol does not work not only misreads history but misses the point \nentirely. We have to make it work. Indeed, arms control has provided us \nat least some respite, some bit of breathing space, from the horrors of \nHiroshima. That in itself is a success.\n  Today, particularly when we look at North Korea, I think we had all \nbetter hope fervently that arms control can work because without some \ntype of arms control there, we will be in an extraordinarily precarious \nsituation.\n\n  If we look at the situation in Iran, where the international arms \ncontrol agency is trying to work with the Iranians, trying to get them \nto cooperate with the world community, that is an example of arms \ncontrol in action. I hope--and I am sure I speak for everyone else--\nthat that effort succeeds.\n  Time and again, when we have had serious situations, we have been \nable to use the norms established by international arms control \nagreements as leverage in a particular crisis. Arms control is not \nperfect, but without it we would be in a much more dangerous and much \nmore devastating world environment.\n  This administration, however, has effectively turned its back on so \nmany different initiatives: The repeal of the ABM Treaty, the failure \nto follow up the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty by sending it again to \nthe Senate for a vote. This and so many other examples suggest that the \nadministration has not effectively read the lessons of history. I \nbelieve they have the mistaken view that arms control will never work \nrather than trying to make it work, understanding it is not perfect but \nit is essential to our national security strategy.\n  My colleague and friend John Spratt stated it very well in an article \nin the March 2003 edition of Arms Control Today. In his words:\n\n       My greatest concern is that some in the administration and \n     in the Congress seem to think that the United States can move \n     the world in one direction while Washington moves in another, \n     that we can continue to prevail on other countries not to \n     develop nuclear weapons while we develop new tactical \n     applications for such weapons and possibly resume nuclear \n     testing.\n\n  Congressman Spratt was very clear. In life, one really cannot have it \nboth ways. I think this is an example of that. At one time, you cannot \nbe trying to persuade, convince, and cajole other nations to abandon \nthe development of nuclear weapons while you are blatantly going ahead \nand developing them yourself. The approach of the administration has \nbeen to attempt to get it both ways. It will be doomed to failure.\n  I would argue that rather than declaring the arms control movement \ndead, we have to give it renewed life. Indeed, we can point to \nsuccesses in the past that should give us some comfort to know that if \nwe work hard, if we work in a disciplined and dedicated way, we can use \narms control to enhance our security--not exclusively depend, \ncertainly, on arms control, but it has to be an important part of our \nrepertoire.\n\n  In the early 1960s, when there were a few nuclear powers--the United \nStates, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China--there was a fear that \nwithin a decade or more, as President Kennedy expressed it, there would \nbe at least 25 countries that developed nuclear weapons. What was \nfeared did not come to pass because of effective, meaningful arms \ncontrol exemplified in many respects by the nonproliferation treaty and \nother initiatives.\n  Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has cited this record, \nindicating his support for continued efforts at arms control. In his \nwords:\n\n       [I]nstead of the 25 or so countries that President Kennedy \n     once predicted, only a handful of nations possess nuclear \n     weapons. Of course we suspect many more countries have \n     chemical or biological weapons, but still short of the scores \n     that had been predicted in the past. We have reached this \n     state of affairs in no small part through the concerted \n     effort of many nations. Agreements, such as the nuclear \n     nonproliferation treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     organizations such as the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers \n     Group--these constitute a global security architecture that \n     has served us satisfactorily and kept us safe.\n\n  But critics of arms control fail to acknowledge that Argentina and \nBrazil and South Korea and Taiwan ceased\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\ntheir suspected nuclear programs in part because of the international \nnorms represented by the nonproliferation treaty. Without these norms \nand without the United States exemplifying these norms, I don't think \nwe would have the success we have had in these cases that I have cited.\n  Similarly, when the Soviet Union dissolved and the Newly Independent \nStates of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine found themselves with \nnuclear weapons, they voluntarily turned them in as a result of the \nnorms established by the international arms control regimes. South \nAfrica has also given up their nuclear weapons.\n  This is an example, not of perfect success but of success. If we \nbegin to abide by our commitment to the nonproliferation treaty, to our \ncommitments to reducing nuclear weapons rather than building new ones, \nwe might be able to provide more leverage on countries such as India \nand Pakistan so that they would join the nonproliferation treaty and \nthe Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. That is the kind of leadership we \nneed at the moment. I hope we can get it.\n  As I mentioned before, we also are facing very serious problems with \nNorth Korea and Iran. I hope they can be resolved peacefully. But that \npeaceful resolution implies extending arms control agreements to these \ncountries. So disparaging arms control is doing a great disservice to \nour national security and to our strategy.\n  The Bush administration has seemed bound since their first days in \noffice to reverse 50 years of arms control activities, both by \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. In December 2001, they \npublished their Nuclear Posture Review.\n  This review was troubling in many respects. For the first time in \nhistory, this review suggested that we would use weapons, nuclear \nweapons, not simply to deter another nuclear power but to engage a \nnonnuclear power. The report essentially said that we would consider \nfor the first time and be prepared to use nuclear weapons against \nnonnuclear nations that were nonaligned with a nuclear power--a \ntremendous reversal in our strategic outlook, blurring the distinction \nbetween conventional weapons and nuclear weapons, a distinction that \nsince Hiroshima we on both sides of the aisle have endeavored mightily \nto maintain crystal clear. This blurring, this suggestion that we would \nuse nuclear weapons in a first strike against nonnuclear powers, set \nthe tone for other administration pronouncements.\n\n  Last November, a memo from then-Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology and Logistics, Pete Aldridge, became public. \nThe memo directed nuclear weapons laboratories to:\n\n     . . . assess the technical risks associated with maintaining \n     the U.S. arsenal without nuclear testing . . . [and suggested \n     the] U.S. take another look at conducting small nuclear \n     tests.\n\n  Following up to this memo, the President's budget for fiscal year \n2004 included $24 million to reduce the time needed to prepare to \nconduct a nuclear weapons test from 2-3 years at present to 18 months--\nonce again, a very sobering and ominous suggestion that we would begin \nto test nuclear weapons again; that we would abandon our efforts to \nassure the quality of our stockpile through nontesting means and that \nwe would conduct tests.\n  If the United States of America begins again to conduct nuclear \ntests, I think that would be an open invitation to other countries, \nsuch as India and Pakistan, and perhaps powers undeclared as yet, to \nbegin a nuclear testing program. It certainly would be good cover \ninternationally.\n  The President's budget in 2004 also went on to request $22.8 million \nto accelerate the design and select a site for a new modern pit \nfacility.\n  Plutonium pits are necessary components of nuclear weapons. We have \nnot had the ability to build such pits since 1988. We do need a pit \nfacility. But the proposal of the administration goes far beyond any \nconceivable needs, given the current situation. They want to create a \nfacility that is capable of producing up to 500 pits per year. That \nwould be 500 nuclear weapons per year. That is a rate that rivals \nanything in the cold war, and according to the administration, the cold \nwar is over--except, I guess, when it comes to nuclear policy or at \nleast nuclear design and production policy.\n  Then in addition to this development, the administration has been \nvigorously pressing for the design of a robust nuclear earth-penetrator \nto be used against hard and deeply buried targets. The RNEP would be a \nmodification of an existing nuclear device, necessarily a very large \nnuclear device. It has been deemed a bunker buster. But, frankly, the \nkilotonnage or the tonnage of this RNEP is so large it would be a city \nbuster, not a bunker buster. The kilotons of the weapons dropped on \nHiroshima and Nagasaki were 14 and 21 kilotons, respectively, and this \nRNEP could be 71 times larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. That \nis not a bunker buster. That is not a discrete weapon that could take \nthe place of precision conventional weapons. Yet the administration is \npressing forward.\n  Then this year the administration requested the repeal of the 1993 \nstatutory ban on the research, development, and production of low-yield \nnuclear weapons and $6 million for funding for advanced nuclear weapons \nconcepts.\n  Current law prohibits work, design, research with respect to weapons \nbelow 5 kilotons. The administration seeks to repeal this ban--strike \nit out--even though there is no military requirement for these small \nsized nuclear weapons.\n  When asked about this proposal, Ambassador Linton Brooks, the Acting \nDirector of the National Nuclear Security Administration, stated before \nthe Armed Services Committee:\n\n       I have a bias in favor of something that is the minimum \n     destruction. . . .that means I have a bias in favor of things \n     that might be usable.\n\n  Here we have it. A history of 5 decades of trying to create a nuclear \npolicy that dissuades the world from using nuclear weapons and we are \ntrying to develop small nuclear weapons, which the scientists at this \ntime say--the lab leaders say--are designed to be used. We have crossed \na huge space between our policy of 5 decades and this newly emerging \npolicy. We have moved from being the leader in arms control to being \nsomeone who treats arms control casually, if not flippantly. The irony, \nof course, is we stand to suffer the most. I hope we could reverse this \ntrend.\n  I had hoped very much that the Feinstein-Kennedy amendment would be \nagreed to because I think that would have sent a strong signal and be a \npractical and pragmatic step. But now we have the opportunity to \nconstrain the funds that are being expended for those preliminary \nresearch aspects of nuclear weapons development. As my colleague, \nSenator Nelson, said, it will give Congress a chance to decide, after \nmore information, more debate, and more justification, whether it is in \nour national interest to proceed with the development, engineering, and \ndeployment of a new class of nuclear weapons.\n  The amendment I offer today will allow the Department of Energy to \nuse $22 million in funding that the President requested for advanced \nnuclear weapons concepts for research alone. The amendment would not \nallow money to be used for developing, testing, or deploying new \nnuclear weapons, or RNEP, which is a modification of an existing \nweapon.\n  This amendment would assure that the appropriations bill is \nconsistent with the language that is included in the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense authorization bill. During that debate, an amendment that would \nrequire the Department of Energy to seek specific authorization and \nappropriations before proceeding with phases beyond research passed \nthis body by a vote of 96 to 0. The Senate has clearly spoken on this \nissue. The amendment I offer today will ensure that the Department of \nEnergy will comply with the wishes of Congress by returning to the \nCongress before beginning development, testing, production, and \ndeployment of a new nuclear weapon or the RNEP.\n  I believe we should retain the prohibition on any research or \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons. But if that must change--if \nwe must eliminate the threat-first amendment--I believe the research is \nall that is necessary at this time and that there should be a full and \ncomplete debate on any development funding for a system of nuclear \nweapons or the RNEP based upon research first.\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\n  The primary reason that the administration says it needs this money \nfor advanced nuclear concepts is to, in their terms, ``train the next \ngeneration of nuclear weapons scientists and engineers.''\n  Ambassador Brooks, Director of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, stated that research must be funded to ``remove the \nchilling effect on scientific inquiry that could hamper our ability to \nmaintain and exercise our intellectual capabilities to respond to needs \nthat one day might be articulated by the President.''\n  In July, Energy Secretary Abraham said: ``We are not planning any \nnuclear weapons at all.'' If research is the reason, if research is the \njustification, if we are planning no nuclear weapons, then this \namendment provides the funding and the authority for the research.\n  This amendment is very clear about what is allowed. There are very \ndistinct phases in the development of nuclear weapons. Since 1953, the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Energy have worked in a \nvery formalized weapons development process. Indeed, the Atomic Energy \nCommission was one of the predecessors of the effort. And the Atomic \nEnergy Commission was also involved in the formulation of the process.\n  My amendment would prohibit ``development engineering,'' which is the \nthird phase. This is for new weapons development.\n  All of these phases would be authorized, and the funds could be \nexpended for concept definition, feasibility study, design definition, \nand cost study. But you could not go into phase 3, development \ndefinition. It is clear and precise--allowing the research and allowing \nall that is necessary, according to both the rationale to train our \nscientists and also the affirmation by the Secretary of Energy that we \nwere not planning to develop new nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator conclude amendment No. 1659 regarding \nthe Energy Department's research on nuclear weapons?\n  Mr. REED. I did not. In the next few minutes I will complete my \ncomments on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator might offer that amendment so I \ncould give him my concurrence.\n  Mr. REED. The amendment has been offered. I think Senator Levin wants \nto speak. But the Senator's concurrence will be invited as soon as I \nconclude.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on this side of the aisle, we accept the \nReed-Levin-Kennedy-Feinstein amendment because it is current policy. It \njust repeats current policy unequivocably. This is what the policy of \nthe country is. We did not change that in our bill. The Senator is most \nwelcome to try to make it eminently clear what that current policy is. \nFor that reason, we will accept it whenever it is ready to be accepted \nby the Senate.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I thank the chairman for \nhis kindness in accepting the amendment. The policy is included in the \nDefense authorization bill. But there is a debate ongoing about what \nthe precise policy is. We want to at least set this limit with respect \nto the policy.\n  The chairman suggesting that it will be accepted will prompt me to \nquickly conclude my comments.\n  I note that my colleague from Michigan is here also seeking \nrecognition.\n  We brought this measure to the Defense authorization debate. As was \nindicated in my discussion with Chairman Domenici, the Senate passed \nthis provision overwhelmingly. This is now included in this \nappropriations bill. It is going to be an interesting conference \nbecause our colleagues in the House have stricken the money; that is \nthe preference that I would suggest is the best approach. But short of \nthat, this at least constrains the spending of the funds to the first \nthree phases of research, which apparently, at least in my view, \ndirectly responds to the professed need for the funds, and it will also \nagain support the statement of the Secretary of Energy that there is no \nplan to develop nuclear weapons.\n  In a letter to the Armed Services Committee, Admiral Ellis, the \nCommander of the Strategic Command, which command is responsible for \nall nuclear weapons, stated that:\n\n       U.S. Strategic Command is interested in conducting rigorous \n     studies of all new technologies examining the merits of \n     precision, increased penetration, and reduced yields for our \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  Once again, this proposal corresponds to the request from our \nmilitary leaders in what they are looking for today.\n  I hope that not only this amendment will be incorporated into this \npending appropriations bill but that in conference we at least maintain \nthis.\n  I again urge my colleagues to think hard again about the Kennedy-\nFeinstein proposal and the proposal that is already included in the \nHouse provisions. But today is an opportunity at least to slow down a \nrush to develop nuclear weapons which have no, or very limited, \nmilitary requirements, and it would give us an opportunity as a \nCongress to debate the wisdom of our course of action.\n  Let me conclude by saying we have changed course dramatically. After \n50 years of being the leading nation in the world arguing for arms \ncontrol, arguing for sensible constraints in the development of nuclear \nweapons and limits on nuclear weapons, we have become a nation that is \ncasual about our commitment to arms control, that denigrates it too \noften, and that course has left us with the only other option which is \nI think less appropriate. As I said initially, if there are no arms \ncontrol, then there is a higher probability of arms usage. With nuclear \nweapons, that is a thought that no one wants to contemplate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Rhode Island for \nhis leadership in this area. It is critically important that we show \nsome constraint--at least in funding of new nuclear weapons and \nmodifications of existing nuclear weapons in order to make them more \nusable.\n  Appropriating funds, as this bill does, for research on a new nuclear \nweapon and research on a modification of existing weapons in order to \nmake them more useful moves us in a dangerous new direction which marks \na major shift in American policy. It is inconsistent with our \nlongstanding commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to \nend the nuclear arms race. It undermines our argument to other \ncountries around the world that they should not develop or test nuclear \nweapons. Unfortunately, the bill before us supports this dangerous new \ndirection by putting funds into research of both the new weapon and \nmodification of existing weapons to make them more usable.\n  At least the pending amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island puts \nan explicit constraint on the expenditure of that money. Why it is so \nimportant this language be included is that it makes explicit, before \nwe can move to the developmental stage of these new weapons, there must \nbe an explicit congressional vote. It cannot happen--this next stage, \nwhich we hope will never come--if the Reed language is adopted and \nmaintained in conference, and if we were able to maintain similar \nlanguage in conference in the authorization bill that development of \nthese new weapons and modified weapons, to make them more usable, could \nnot happen without an explicit action on the part of Congress.\n\n  That is not the current policy that there be an explicit \nauthorization. It is not inconsistent with current policy that there be \nan explicit authorization before we approve development, but it is not \nthe existing policy.\n  It is critically important that at least if we cannot stop this \ncountry from moving in a direction which is so totally inconsistent \nwith what we are urging the rest of the world to do, at a minimum, we \ngo as far as we can in expressing the determination of at least many of \nus that we move not at all, if possible, before we move that there be a \nformal vote on the part of Congress.\n  I do not understand how we can argue to other countries, with our \nheads high, that they should not move in a nuclear direction at the \nsame time we are doing research on new nuclear weapons. We are telling \nothers, do not go down that road. But instead of being a leader in the \neffort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are going to \nmove recklessly down that\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nsame road. We are following a policy that we do not tolerate in others.\n  The adoption of the Reed amendment would at least put some brake on \nthe speed at which we are going down that road, and hopefully, before \ndevelopment is reached, before taking the next milestone on that road.\n  Appropriating funds for research in new nuclear weapons begins to \ntake the United States in a dangerous new direction that marks a major \nshift in American policy, is inconsistent with our longstanding \ncommitment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to end the nuclear \narms race, and undermines our argument to other countries around the \nworld that they should not develop or test nuclear weapons. \nUnfortunately the bill now on the Senate floor would also support this \ndangerous new direction. But the pending amendment puts an explicit \nconstraint on it.\n  Current U.S. law bans research and development of new nuclear weapons \nthat could lead to their production. The specific weapons covered by \nthe ban are so called low-yield nuclear weapons which have a nuclear \nexplosive yield of 5 kilotons or less. Five kilotons is roughly a third \nthe size of the nuclear bomb that was used at Hiroshima, which \nimmediately killed an estimated 140,000 people and left many more \ninjured.\n  The Bush administration asked that this ban be repealed. If the ban \nis repealed, the purpose is to make nuclear weapons more usable. As \nstated by Linton Brooks, the Administrator of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration in testimony before the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 8, \n2003, ``I have a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield because I \nhave the bias in favor of something that is the minimum destruction . . \n. I have a bias in favor of things that might be usable.''\n  The language approved by a majority of the Armed Services Committee \nand included in the Senate passed version of the Defense authorization \nbill would repeal this ban. Without this ban there is no impediment in \nlaw to research, development, testing, production, or deployment of \nnew, low yield nuclear weapons. The bill before us would also support \nthe repeal of this ban by appropriating $6 million to begin the \nresearch on new low-yield nuclear weapons, or for any other advanced \nnew nuclear weapons concept.\n  The Defense authorization bill authorizes the National \nNuclear Security Administration to continue work on a robust nuclear \nearth penetrator (RNEP). The Energy and Water bill would appropriate \nthese funds.\n\n  This effort would modify one of two existing high-yield nuclear \nweapons to create a nuclear weapon that will penetrate rock. Both \nweapons being looked at for possible modification are high yield \nnuclear weapons with yields that are approximately 30 and 70 times the \nexplosive power of the Hiroshima bomb. Without a requirement that the \nearth penetrator weapon be authorized by Congress, there is no legal \nimpediment to its development, testing, production, or deployment.\n  At a time when the United States is trying to dissuade other \ncountries from going forward with nuclear weapons development, when we \nstrongly oppose North Korea's pulling out of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, when we are trying to prevent Iran from \nestablishing a nuclear weapons program and when we are spending over a \nbillion dollars to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons material and \ntechnology, these actions would send a terrible message. We are telling \nothers not to go down the road to nuclear weapons. But instead of being \na leader in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nwe are recklessly driving down that same road. In short, the United \nStates is following a policy that we do not tolerate in others.\n  President Bush on June 18 stated that the United States will not \ntolerate a nuclear Iran. Similarly in May President Bush, in a joint \nstatement with the President of South Korea, said he would not tolerate \na North Korean nuclear weapon.\n  The leaked version of the Nuclear Posture Review identifies both \nNorth Korea and Iran as countries against which the United States \nshould be prepared to use nuclear weapons. Clearly North Korea is the \nfocus of the concern about hard and deeply buried targets and the \ndesire to pursue the development of an RNEP.\n  At the same time that the United States is actively engaging in talks \nwith North Korea to persuade them to give up their nuclear weapons \nprogram and urging the IAEA to ensure that Iran does not pursue a \nnuclear weapons program, we are beginning the process to develop new \nnuclear weapons. The Bush administration is taking action to ensure \nthat there is a robust complex to build new nuclear weapons and an \naccelerated test readiness program to test them.\n  Where is the consistency in our actions? Having undertaken a \npreemptive war against an alleged imminent threat in the name of \ncounter proliferation, can the United States effectively unite the \nworld against Iran and North Korea's pursuance of nuclear weapons \nprograms when the Bush administration appears to be on the verge of \nreversing a decades old nuclear policy and pursuing new tactical \nnuclear weapons? Weapons that, in the words of Linton Brooks, the \nAdministrator of the National Security Administration, ``might be \nusable.''\n\n  The inconsistency of U.S. action was noted in a May 17 editorial in \nthe Economist Magazine:\n\n     . . . America would dangerously blur the line against nuclear \n     use by anyone. That would make it more likely, not less, that \n     America's own forces would eventually have nuclear weapons \n     used against them too. Mr. Bush has said repeatedly, with \n     reason, that he wants America to rely less on nuclear weapons \n     for its future security, not more. In their determination to \n     leave no weapons avenue unexplored, his advisors are \n     proposing to lead America along a dangerous path. Time the \n     president called a halt.\n\n  On July 17 of this year the New York Times also commented on the \ninconsistency between urging others to forego nuclear weapons \ndevelopment at a time when the United States is beginning to put in \nplace all the elements of a new nuclear weapons program. Particularly a \nprogram whose goal appears to be to produce nuclear weapons that \n``might be usable.''\n  The July 17 editorial cautioned:\n\n       Nuclear bombs should not be casually re-engineered for \n     ordinary battlefield use at a time when countries like North \n     Korea, Pakistan and India have added nuclear weapons to their \n     arsenals and a chief objective of U.S. policy is to make sure \n     these weapons are never used.\n\n  I urge the Bush administration to continue to work to persuade both \nNorth Korea and Iran to disavow nuclear weapons programs. Arms control \nstill has a vital role to play. As Deputy Secretary of State Armitage \nsaid, in defense of the Nonproliferation Treaty, ``Agreements such as \nthe Nonproliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, \norganizations such as the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group--these \nconstitute a global security architecture that has served us \nsatisfactorily and kept us sage.''\n  As Rose Gottemoeller, a former Assistant Secretary of Energy said:\n\n       Other countries watch us like a hawk. They are very \n     attentive to what we do in the nuclear arena. This is going \n     to be considered another step in the tectonic shift. I think \n     people abroad will interpret this as part of a really \n     enthusiastic effort by the Bush administration to \n     renuclearize. And I think definitely there's going to be an \n     impetus to the development of nuclear weapons around the \n     world.\n\n  Let us slow down and think about the road on which we are about to \ntravel.\n  Senator Reed, Senator Kennedy, and I offer an amendment today to once \nagain preserve Congress's role in any decision to move toward the \ndesign, engineering, testing, or deploying of any new nuclear weapon. \nAnd equally important, this amendment will require us to stop and think \nseriously before going down the road toward new nuclear weapons.\n  The amendment would require the Department of Energy to obtain a \nspecific authorization from Congress before the Department could move \nto phase 3 or beyond in the nuclear weapons development process. Phase \n3 is the engineering development phase, the point at which a concept \nwould begin to be a new weapon.\n  The amendment would also apply to this same phase, the engineering \ndevelopment phase, in the process of modifying an existing weapon for a \nnew military requirement. When the Department modifies an existing \nweapon the engineering development phase is the 6.3 phase. This \namendment would apply to the 6.3 phase as well.\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\n  Language similar to this amendment passed the Senate 95-0 during the \nconsideration of the Defense Authorization Act. There was no \ndisagreement then, and should not be now, that Congress retain a \ncentral role in any decision to seek new nuclear weapons.\n  In 1994, Congress determined that the United States did not need to \nembark on a new nuclear weapons program, which would require nuclear \nweapons testing prior to being deployed, and banned research that could \nlead to production of new, low-yield, nuclear weapons. The current law \nis found at section 3136 of the Fiscal Year 1994 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. It is commonly known as the Spratt-Furse provision.\n  The Senate passed version of the Fiscal Year 2004 National Defense \nAuthorization Act repeals the current Spratt-Furse law, while the \nHouse-passed version of the Fiscal Year 2004 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, modifies the current law. The House modification \nwould allow the Department of Energy to conduct research on low yield \nnuclear weapons but not to begin the engineering design phase of the \nnuclear weapons process.\n  The conferees have been working for several months to resolve the \nmany differences in the two versions of the Defense Authorization Act. \nOne of the issues that the conferees have yet to resolve is the issue \nof the Spratt-Furse provision.\n  The conferees are discussing whether Spratt-Furse should be modified, \nas in the House-passed bill, or repealed, as in the Senate-passed bill, \nor whether both provisions could be dropped and the current law \npreserved. It is important to note that the Reed amendment is \nconsistent with any of the possible outcomes in the defense \nauthorization conference.\n  Whatever the outcome, the Reed amendment will ensure that Congress \nplays a role in future nuclear weapons decisions.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nensure that the Army Corps of Engineers meets its responsibilities to \nthe restoration of the Baltimore metropolitan area ecosystem \nrestoration project. The amendment authorizes and directs the Corps to \nimplement the project in accordance with the Baltimore Metropolitan \nWater Resources--Gwynns Falls Feasibility Report, prepared by the Army \nCorps of Engineers and the city of Baltimore.\n  For 10 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been studying \nwater resource problems in the Baltimore metropolitan area. In 1994, \nthe Baltimore District completed a reconnaissance report which \nconcluded that there has been extensive degradation to the marine, \naquatic, wetland, riparian and terrestrial habitats in the Baltimore \nmetropolitan area. Over the years, rapid growth of the area, filling of \nwetlands, and previous construction of Federal works to meet flood \ncontrol and navigation needs, among other things, have contributed to \nthe degradation of the streams that drain the Baltimore basin. The \nreport identified a Federal interest in restoring the ecosystem of six \nwatersheds, with the Gwynns Falls watershed selected first for further \nstudy.\n  The city of Baltimore agreed to share with the Corps in the cost of \nthe next phase of the study process--a $1.6 million feasibility study. \nDuring the course of that more detailed study, the Corps found that \nthere was a significant loss of stream water and groundwater into \nsewers located in the stream channels and, in order to restore the \nGwynns Falls ecosystem and more than 2 million gallons of water per day \nto the watershed, the cracks in these sewers must be repaired. In \nDecember 2001, Corps Headquarters agreed that the sewer line \nrehabilitation work was integral to--and should be included in--the \necosystem restoration project and was within the Corps' environmental \nrestoration authority. In fact, the Corps found that it was far less \nexpensive to line the sewers and seal the manholes than undertake other \nalternatives such as channel lining and artificial watering. The draft \nBaltimore Metropolitan Water Resources Gwynns Falls Watershed \nFeasibility Report, completed in January 2002, recommended sewer system \nrehabilitation as a key part of the environmental restoration projects \nfor Gwynns Falls. It was anticipated at that time, that the feasibility \nreport would be completed by May 2002 and the project would be \nauthorized for construction in the Water Resources Development Act of \n2002.\n  In 2001, the city of Baltimore and EPA began the process of \nnegotiating a consent decree to address the city's collection system \noverflow problem which was polluting area streams and waterways in \nviolation of the Clean Water Act. Baltimore signed the consent decree \nwith EPA in April 2002 making the city legally responsible for \napproximately $900 million in sewer infrastructure improvements \nthroughout the city, including fixing the sewer system in the Gwynns \nFalls watershed by the year 2007. The city did so with the \nunderstanding that the Corps would share in the approximately $13 \nmillion cost of sewer rehabilitation in this area.\n  Months went by and no action was taken on the feasibility report \nuntil April 2003, when the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy effectively reneged on the agreement to participate in this \nproject. Although the office, once again, concurred that the sewer work \nwas integral to the ecosystem restoration project, it claimed that the \nsewer rehabilitation portion of the recommended project was now the \nlegal responsibility of the city--because it signed the consent \ndecree--and therefore it was inappropriate for the Federal Government \nto cost-share in this part of the project. Despite having acted in good \nfaith to comply with Federal law and participating for years in studies \nwith the Army Corps of Engineers with the intended purpose of improving \nthe urban ecosystem in this area, the city of Baltimore is now being \npenalized for signing this consent decree. Throughout this process, the \ncity was never appraised by the Corps that, if it signed the consent \ndegree, the Corps would not be able to share in the cost of this \nproject. Now Baltimore is left with the prospect of either attempting \nto remove the Gwynns Falls project from the consent decree--an \nuncertain prospect at best--or somehow overcoming a Corps planning \nguidance document. That is what we are seeking to do with this \namendment.\n  It is important to point out that there is no other instance that we \nhave been able to identify in Federal law or regulation, that prohibits \na municipality from using Federal funds or programs to help achieve \ncompliance with a consent decree. Indeed, a number of cities have used \nthe Clean Water State Revolving Fund or EPA State and Tribal Assistance \nGrants for this purpose. There is no logical reason that the Corps of \nEngineers' program should not follow suit.\n  Why offer the amendment to this measure? First of all, it does not \nappear that the Senate will consider a Water Resources Development Act \nthis year. Second, time is running out for the city of Baltimore. In \norder to meet the 2007 consent decree deadline and to avoid future \npenalties for sewage discharges, the city must begin design and \nconstruction of the Gwynns Falls project shortly.\n  This amendment simply directs the Secretary to implement the project \nin accordance with the original plans in the Gwynns Falls Feasibility \nStudy.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1709\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have strongly supported efforts to advance \nopportunities to open markets abroad to an array of clean energy \ntechnologies. At my urging, the Bush administration, in October 2002, \nreleased the Clean Energy Technology Exports, CETE, strategy. This \naction plan outlined a 5-year, nine-agency initiative that is intended \nto ``increase U.S. clean energy technology exports to international \nmarkets through increased coordination among Federal agency programs \nand between these programs and the private sector.'' The CETE directive \nis geared at helping to address three major challenges in global energy \npolicy: increased U.S. competition in developing country markets; \nenvironmental sustainability, including climate change; and energy \nsecurity.\n  Even though the participating Federal agency partners released this \nstrategic plan last year, no funding has been identified by any of the \nagencies to implement the CETE strategy. All too often, this is the \ncase with multi-agency initiatives that do not have the explicit \nsupport of the administration, and I fear that, once again, this is the \ncase. At this point, little, if anything new, is being done by this \nadministration to promote clean energy technologies overseas.\n  My amendment is a small step that is intended to get the ball rolling \nby establishing an administrative center. A truly effective program of \nthis magnitude deserves significantly more attention and funding, and \nthe U.S. is missing a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of \nglobal clean energy technology markets. However, we must start \nsomewhere, and my amendment is a practical one. If the CETE strategic \nplan is going to be successful, then such an initiative requires a \nfocal point--a one-stop-shop, so to speak--to allow industries and \norganizations with interests to more effectively access the services of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Thus, my amendment provides $400,000 in funding for the Office of \nInternational Market Development within the Department of Energy to \nhelp carry out the task. While this center is to be physically housed \nat the Department of Energy, DOE, the center's mission is to help carry \nout the multi-agency CETE strategy. I also strongly urge all \nparticipating agencies such as the Department of Commerce, U.S. Agency \nfor International Development, and others to contribute staff and other \nappropriate resources to get this center up and running.\n  This is just a start on a long overdue Federal initiative. But, if we \nare serious about addressing the immense global energy and \nenvironmental challenges that we commonly share with other nations, \nthis initiative must get much greater attention and far more support \nfrom this administration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1715\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Warner \nin offering this amendment directing the Secretary of the Army to \ndevelop an environmental impact statement, EIS,\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\nto evaluate the risks and benefits of introducing non-native oysters in \nChesapeake Bay.\n  The Chesapeake Bay was once the largest producer of oysters in the \nworld, providing some 20 million bushels annually at the turn of the \ncentury. The once abundant oyster populations not only sustained an \nimportant part of our economy, providing jobs for thousands of \noystermen and others in the seafood and maritime industries, but served \nas filters, cleaning the entire volume of the Bay's waters every three \nto six days and provided habitat and sustenance for many of the Bay's \nliving resources. Today, the Bay's oyster population is only one \npercent of what it was a century ago--the victim of the deadly diseases \nMSX and Dermo as well as over-harvesting and the loss of habitat. \nMaryland's watermen and the oyster industry are being threatened with \neconomic extinction and scientists estimate that it now takes the \ncurrent population of oysters nearly a year to filter the Bay's waters.\n  In 1999, scientific experts from Maryland and Virginia reached a \nconsensus on how to restore oysters which contained two essential \ncomponents--the construction of three-dimensional oyster reefs and the \nestablishment of permanent reef sanctuaries--to create habitat and \nprovide for the growth and increased fecundity of oyster populations. \nThis approach was embraced in the Chesapeake 2000 Bay Agreement which \nset an ambitious goal of increasing oyster abundance by tenfold by the \nyear 2010. Over the past three years, our Chesapeake Bay area \nCongressional Delegation has worked closely together to secure the \nnecessary authorizations and appropriations of approximately $5 million \na year through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NOAA to help the \nStates of Maryland and Virginia implement this strategy. Indeed, we are \ndelighted that the Senate energy and water appropriations bill, which \nwe are considering today, provides $4.5 million an increase of $1.5 \nmillion over the fiscal 2003 level and President's budget request to \ncontinue this effort. By restoring the physical oyster habitat, \ncreating new oyster reefs and planting disease-free oysters on these \nreefs, it is our hope that this project will increase native oyster \npopulations and ultimately help to ensure the economic and \nenvironmental revival of the Bay.\n  In order to expedite the process of repopulating oysters in \nChesapeake Bay, officials in Maryland and Virginia have recently \nproposed introducing a non-native Asian oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis, \nwhich is quick growing and more disease resistant into the Bay. \nHowever, because of differing opinions about the risks and benefits \ninvolved, the Chesapeake Bay Commission a tristate legislative \ncommission--requested that the National Academies of Science National \nResearch Council, NRC, undertake a study of the pros and cons of \nintroducing this non-native species. On August 14, 2003, the National \nResearch Council released this report entitled ``Non-native Oysters in \nChesapeake Bay'' which concluded that introducing a reproductive \npopulation of the Asian oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis, in Chesapeake \nBay should be delayed until more is known about the potential \nenvironmental risks.\n  The NRC report found that ``[I]t is not possible to predict if a \ncontrolled introduction of reproductive C. ariakensis will improve, \nfurther degrade, or have no impact on either the oyster fishery or the \necology of the Chesapeake Bay.'' The report recommended contained \naquaculture of sterile C. ariakensis as an `` interim action that \nprovides an opportunity for researchers to obtain critical biological \nand ecological information on the non-native oyster required for risk \nassessment.'' It included detailed recommendations for biological, \necological, and socio-economic research that should be conducted to \nbetter inform public decisionmaking about the Asian oyster.\n  In a letter dated July 22, 2003, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nthe Secretaries of the Virginia and Maryland Departments of Natural \nResources requested that the Corps coordinate development of an \nenvironmental impact statement to evaluate the States' proposal to \nintroduce reproductively capable Asian oysters in the waters of \nChesapeake Bay. The Corps responded that it cannot initiate an EIS \nunless specifically authorized and funded by Congress to do so. This is \nwhat our amendment seeks to accomplish. The amendment provides $200,000 \nin Federal funds to initiate the study, which must be matched by the \nStates. It further directs the Secretary to establish a scientific \nadvisory body consisting of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, \nthe University of Maryland, and other appropriate research institutions \nto review the sufficiency of the environmental impact statement. In \naddition, it directs the Secretary to consider the findings and \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences in the preparation \nof the environmental impact statement.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to our fellow Senators, we are \nfinished with the exception of a colloquy or two, which are going to be \nready shortly. However, we have been informed that Senator John McCain \nof Arizona desires to offer an amendment relative to a provision in the \nbill. We are trying to contact him to let him know we are finished but \nfor his amendment. If we can get him here--and we are going to try our \nbest--we will ask him to offer his amendment. We will vote on it and \nthen vote on final passage and we will be finished, which means that, \non the request of our leader that we be finished by 7 o'clock tonight, \nwe should do that easily, if we can find the Senator and start that \nprocess.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman allow me to \nspeak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nother amendments in order except those cleared by the two managers of \nthe bill; and the Senator from Arizona is going to offer an amendment. \nI ask unanimous consent that those be the only amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill not--I just want to say I agree because we have been telling the \nSenate that for a number of hours today, and now the time has come. We \nwant to finish tonight, and there should not be any other amendments. \nThey should have brought them here, if they have them. So I think the \nconsent request is well taken. It should be granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for the time I shall need. If any other pending \nbusiness comes up, I will gladly step aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                    los angeles river revitalization\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, the ranking member \nof the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I want to thank Senators Domenici and Reid for their hard work in \ndeveloping this legislation. In particular, I appreciate the attention \nthat they have given to the infrastructure needs of California, as well \nas to the overall importance of this bill for those of us representing \nwestern States.\n  Los Angeles, the largest metropolitan area in the western United \nStates, faces many challenges. Local community leaders are working hard \nto revitalize the areas surrounding the Los\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\nAngeles River. The river, reinforced with concrete to provide flood \ncontrol benefits, runs 51 miles through much of urban Los Angeles.\n  Both the Senate and House of Representatives include funding in the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bills for operation and maintenance of \nthe Los Angeles County Drainage Area project. However, the House \nAppropriations Committee also included language directing $2 million of \nadditional funding to be used to ``support Corps of Engineers \nassistance in local activities to revitalize the project areas for \npublic safety, environmental restoration, recreation, aesthetics, \ncommunity improvement, and related purposes.''\n  This additional funding would provide essential support for local \nleaders and community stakeholders, working in conjunction with the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, to move forward with this critical project. I \nurge the Senate conferees to agree with the House funding level for \nthis project.\n  I know how much the Senator from Nevada cares about improving our \ncommunities and protecting our precious natural resources. This project \nworks toward achieving both of these important goals.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator from California that our \ncommunities need the tools and resources to develop infrastructure \nprojects that revitalize the environment, as well as the economy. I \nalso agree that the project described by Senator Boxer has the \npotential to offer many benefits to the Los Angeles area and I will \nwork to support this in conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his support.\n\n\n                           dworshak reservoir\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for your \nefforts, and those of the subcommittee ranking member, Senator Reid, in \nworking with Senator Craig and me to support the important work of the \nU.S. Corps of Engineers in the Clearwater River Valley to mitigate \ndamages caused by fluctuating levels in the Dworshak Reservoir.\n  As my colleagues know, the challenges of responding to the riverine \nneeds of endangered salmon have been an enormous strain on the \ncommunities of the Pacific Northwest. We all share the commitment to \nrestore Pacific Northwest salmon. This is a national interest. However, \nthe efforts to restore the runs have a disproportionate and direct \nimpact in communities in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.\n  The town of Orofino in the Clearwater River Valley of Idaho is just \nsuch a community. The town sits at the base of the Dworshak Reservoir, \nwhich is capped by a Corps-managed dam. The Corps periodically uses \nwater from Dworshak Reservoir to help adjust temperatures in the \ndownstream rivers when salmon are making their runs to and from the \nocean.\n  When spills are required, the levels of Dworshak Reservoir fall. \nSometimes, this can amount to drops of approximately 90 feet. A 90-foot \ndrop is catastrophic to recreational opportunities provided by the \nreservoir. Boat docks and trailer ramps no longer reach the water, \nbeaches dangle precariously above the waterline, and muddy banks \nexposed for as far as the eye can see.\n  The Corps has offered its help in mitigating the economic hardships \ncaused by its actions in periodic reductions in reservoir water levels. \nI applaud that offer. I also commend Senator Domenici and Senator Reid \nfor providing the extra resources in the operations and maintenance \naccount for the Dworshak Reservoir in this legislation to accommodate \nthose mitigation efforts. I yield to the distinguished chairman to \nelaborate on that point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to echo the comments of the Senator about the \nimportance of these resources. We have provided an additional $1 \nmillion above the President's request for the O function for this \nspecific economic mitigation commitment for the community. It is the \ncommittee's intent that the Corps should use these resources to help \naddress the recreational needs of the Clearwater River Valley community \nresulting from the alterations of the water level in the reservoir.\n  I believe the senior senator from Idaho, and a member of the \nsubcommittee, also would like to be heard on this point.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I echo the words of my colleague from Idaho on the \nimportance of this enhanced funding. Few areas in the Pacific Northwest \nsuffer more directly or as clearly by the changing needs of migrating \nsalmon.\n  I have been to Orofino and surrounding communities several times and \nhave noted the rise and fall in fortunes of the nearby towns in \naccordance with the levels of water in the reservoir. As the Nation \ncontinues to press on this and other Pacific Northwest communities to \ntake steps to revive protected salmon species, the Nation should also \nassist towns disproportionately affected by that national call to \naction. I appreciate the committee chairman securing these resources to \nrecognize that commitment.\n  It is my understanding that it is the committee's intention that \nthese resources are provided to the Corps to be spent in the community \nin a manner that helps restore the economic base of the surrounding \ntowns. These activities would include environmental measures and the \nestablishment of a functional large boat moorage. Is this correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the committee's intention, and I appreciate \nyour commitment to this important provision. I also appreciate Senator \nCrapo's desire in helping to clarify these issues so that the needs of \nthe Clearwater River Valley communities can be effectively addressed. I \nyield back to Senator Crapo.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the chairman, and I yield back the floor.\n\n\n                              section 104\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have some concerns with the language in section 104. \nThese are, I believe, technical concerns. My understanding is that the \nCorps of Engineers, in order to more effectively manage their \nresources, is interested in having continuing contract authority for \ncongressionally authorized water resource studies. I have no problem \nwith that, but I am not sure that the language is correct in 104.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding as well, and I believe that we \nneed to work together and with the Corps to draft language that is \nexactly correct. I will work with the Senator from Vermont to make the \nnecessary changes in conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will also work with my colleagues to make the \nnecessary changes, as I do not believe there is a substantive \ndisagreement.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I look \nforward to working on this language in conference.\n\n\n                        high-level waste cleanup\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Chairman Domenici knows I have been \nconcerned about DOE's high-level waste cleanup program from its \ninception. Shortly after our committee concluded action on the bill, \nthe GAO issued a report, entitled, ``Challenges to Achieving Potential \nSavings in DOE's High-Level Waste Cleanup Program.'' In light of the \nlanguage in our committee report on the program, the GAO provides a \nvaluable and timely perspective on the nuclear waste clean-up program \nand confirms many of my concerns, as well as those expressed by our \ncommittee during our hearings.\n  Mr. President, as stated in our committee's report:\n\n       The Committee notes with concern the recent notification by \n     the Department that the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant, \n     Richland, Washington, construction project baseline would \n     increase from $4,350,000,000 to $5,781,000,000, an increase \n     of over $1,400,000,000. The relative lack of outrage over a \n     baseline change of that magnitude speaks volumes about what \n     the Congress and public have come to expect from the \n     Department's clean-up program. The tank waste treatment \n     project has a long and sordid history that indicates both the \n     magnitude of the task before the Department, as well as the \n     Department's historic combination of overly optimistic cost \n     estimates coupled with consistent project mismanagement. The \n     Committee notes its concern in the demonstrated pattern of \n     Departmental officials announcing reform of some aspect of \n     the clean-up program, only to depart and be replaced by a new \n     set of officials coming before the Committee to describe \n     dramatic cost overruns on the project baselines promised by \n     their predecessors, and claiming no responsibility for the \n     assumptions underlying those previous commitments.\n       The Department is now into the second year of entering into \n     new acceleration and reform agreements consistent with the \n     policy conclusions of the Secretary's 2001 top-to-bottom \n     review of the environmental clean-up program. The efforts is \n     commendable in its success in focusing the Department and its \n     stakeholders on the importance\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n     of completing clean-up activities decades earlier than \n     planned. The acceleration agreements entered into at the \n     various clean-up sites have allowed the Department to book \n     huge paper out-year savings and acceleration of completion \n     dates. For example, the Department is claiming savings of \n     $12,000,000,000 and 20 years at the Savannah River Site, \n     South Carolina; $30,000,000,000 and 35 years at Hanford, \n     Washington; $2,000,000,000 and 6 years at Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee; and $19,000,000,000 and 35 years at Idaho. In many \n     cases the savings are based on assumed changes in law, yet-\n     to-be reformed regulatory environments, contractor savings, \n     and other highly optimistic assumptions. The Department has \n     had its successes, most notably Rocky Flats, Colorado, and \n     should be commended. But even with such highlights, the \n     weight of the historical record leaves the Committee to \n     question who will be around in the future (other than the \n     taxpayers) when these estimated cost savings will inevitably \n     be revised.\n\n  Mr. President, I respect Secretary Roberson's efforts to encourage \ninnovation in the program. Last February, she proposed a new initiative \naimed at accelerating cleanup at DOE's sites and focusing on more rapid \nreduction of the considerable environmental risks. She projects this \nwill cut years off the program and produce $63 billion in savings.\n  Now that GAO has issued its first report on the acceleration \ninitiative, I hope the chairman will join me in examining their \nfindings and recommendations and identifying actions that we may \nrecommend to the conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has my assurance that GAO's report and \nrecommendations will be carefully analyzed and that I will work with \nhim to ensure that they are considered as we work toward conference.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the chairman and urge that he give special \nattention to the following GAO recommendation:\n\n       DOE's accelerated cleanup initiative should mark the \n     beginning, not the end, of DOE's efforts to identify other \n     opportunities to improve the program by accomplishing the \n     work more quickly, more effectively, or at less cost. As DOE \n     continues to pursue other management improvements, it should \n     reassess certain aspects of its current management approach, \n     including the quality of the analysis underlying key \n     decisions, the adequacy of its approach to incorporating new \n     technologies into projects, and the merits of a fast-track \n     approach to designing and building complex nuclear \n     facilities. Although the challenges are great, the \n     opportunities for program improvements are even greater. \n     Therefore, DOE must continue its efforts to clean up its \n     high-level waste while demonstrating tangible, measurable \n     program improvements.\n\n  This recommendation underscores my view that DOE should continue to \ndevelop and test new technologies, which may have the potential to \nprovide price and schedule savings. Since 1996, our committee has \nrecommended that DOE investigate alternative melting technologies, \nincluding the advanced vitrification system, to back-up the baseline \nsystem. These recommendations came from the National Academy of \nSciences and from DOE's own sponsored studies.\n  Pursuing backup systems has always made sense. As GAO points out, the \nrisks inherent in the chemical composition of the tanks require a \nbackup approach as insurance. As our committee report explains, ``the \nweight of the historical record'' often requires us to ask ``who will \nbe around in the future (other than the taxpayers) when these estimated \ncost savings will inevitably be revised.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I share the Senator's concerns and will inquire about \nGAO findings and will join you in urging the Department to give \npriority to developing technologies that are different from the \nbaseline system and could provide an insurance policy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's response and \nrequest his efforts in conference to encourage DOE to evaluate and \ndemonstrate backup technologies that have shown potential to provide \ncost and schedule savings in the program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator raising these issues, and I \nurge the Department to carefully consider his thoughtful comments and \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the chairman and appreciate his leadership.\n\n\n  u.s. army corps of engineers' operation and maintenance funding for \n        noxious weed control at lake sakakawea, garrison dam, nd\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the \nAppropriation Committee, and particularly subcommittee Chairman \nDomenici and Senator Reid for their work on this bill. I bring to the \nchairman's attention a troubling problem we have in North Dakota around \nLake Sakakawea, a reservoir controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. As water levels drop, more of the land around the lake owned \nby the Corps becomes exposed, which is a perfect habitat for noxious \nweeds. In fact, an additional 140,000 acres have become exposed due to \nlow water levels causing explosive growth.\n  The spread of noxious weeds is directly impacting farmers, ranchers, \nand other landowners in the vicinity of Lake Sakakawea. These \nlandowners are responsible for controlling noxious weeds on their land; \nhowever, their efforts are futile when their land can be easily \ncontaminated from weeds on Corps land. Unless the Corps has more \nresources to fight the noxious weeds, landowners will continue to face \nan uphill battle.\n  Mr. REID. I, too, am concerned about the situation around Lake \nSakakawea and appreciate my colleague from North Dakota for bringing \nthis to our attention. I agree that the Corps of Engineers has an \nobligation to address it, and I would be happy to work with my \ncolleagues to identify additional funds to tackle the noxious weeds \naround Lake Sakakawea.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \nsupport, and I would like to work with him and the chairman of our \nsubcommittee to find additional funding to combat this growing problem \nin the energy and water conference. Right now, the Corps is stretched \nthin financially and, as a result, it cannot keep pace with this \nexpansive and growing problem. The Corps has a clear responsibility to \naddress this problem and it cannot be ignored. It is my hope that the \nCorps will dedicate funds to controlling this weed problem from the \nmoney that would be provided from the amendment offered by Chairman \nDomenici and Senator Reid that would add $65 million to the Corps \noperations and maintenance budget. The low lake level is due to the \npersistent drought plaguing much of the West, and I believe that the \nCorps has a responsibility to address problems on its lands resulting \nfrom weather-related conditions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I recognize the situation faced by those around Lake \nSakakawea, and I will work with you to address this problem as we move \nthis bill to the Energy and Water Appropriations conference.\n\n\n                              section 310\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, section 310 of the current legislation \ndirects the Secretary of Energy to file a permit modification to the \nWaste Isolation Pilot Plant's, WIPP, Waste Analysis Plan, WAP. Section \n310(a) requires that for determining compliance with the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901 et. seq., and any other applicable laws, \nall waste received for storage and disposal shall be limited in \nconfirmation that it contains no ignitable, corrosive or reactive waste \nthrough the use of radiography or visual examination of a statistically \nrepresentative population of waste; and to review of the waste stream \nprofile form to verify that the waste contains no ignitable, corrosive \nor reactive waste. Section 310(b) requires that compliance shall be \nmonitored exclusively in the WIPP underground rooms through airborne \nmonitoring of volatile inorganic compounds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, is the chairman aware of an ongoing \nstudy, due December 2003, by the National Academy's Board on \nRadioactive Waste Management regarding waste characterization \nrequirements for contact handled transuranic waste to be disposed of at \nthe WIPP facility?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yes I am aware that there has been \nongoing scientific studies in this area.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, will the chairman agree that as section \n310 undergoes conference with the House and the language is considered \nthat it is consistent with the ongoing study by the National Academy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I believe the provision has been developed based\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\nupon sound science and will be glad to compare the National Academy \nreport with section 310.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for taking the time \nto discuss this matter with me.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have agreed not to offer my amendment \nwhich would have required the submission to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works of a log of documents relating to New \nSource Review at the Department of Energy by a time certain. My \nagreement is based on a promise from the Department made to my staff \ntoday. The Department has committed that this log will be delivered to \nme and the committee within the next few days. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a September 25, 2002, letter from the Department to me, as then \nchairman of the committee, be printed in the Record following my \nremarks. This letter promised delivery of the document log by October \n24, 2002, yet the Department failed to provide that log.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2002.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter is in further response to \n     your December 19, 2001, letter to Secretary Abraham \n     requesting certain documents in the possession of the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) and related to Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA) review of its New Source Review \n     (NSR) program. This supplements our earlier acknowledgment of \n     your request on March 1, 2002, as well as a letter earlier \n     today that transmitted certain documents that are arguably \n     responsive to your request.\n       Based on conversations with Committee staff following our \n     letter from earlier this afternoon, we understand that the \n     Committee staff is interested in what additional responsive \n     documents DOE has located and what our intentions are with \n     respect to those documents. Other than Congressional \n     testimony and the like, which we understand not to be covered \n     by the Committee's request, the additional arguably \n     responsive documents DOE has located consist of internal \n     Administration communications regarding the ongoing \n     development of proposed and final rules.\n       We understand that EPA has previously indicated to you its \n     concerns providing internal executive branch deliberative \n     communications of this nature but has also indicated that it \n     wants to continue to work with the Committee on a cooperative \n     basis. We further understand that you have reached agreement \n     with EPA regarding how these interests may be accommodated. \n     We share EPA's wish to work out a reasonable accommodation of \n     these interests, and stand ready to provide you these \n     materials on the same basis as that set out in EPA's letter \n     to you of today.\n       Specifically, on or before October 24, 2002, we will \n     provide the Committee the 1996 NSR rulemaking documents \n     responsive to Items I through V of your December 19, 2002 \n     request. With respect to documents responsive to Items II and \n     IV of your request, we will continue discussions with the \n     Committee to reach a mutually acceptable accommodation for \n     the delivery and protection of information that is attorney \n     work product or otherwise protected by law. With respect to \n     documents responsive to your request that related to the \n     upcoming proposed rule, we agree to continue to discuss our \n     respective positions on Congressional access to those \n     documents. In the meantime, and not later than October 24, \n     2002, we will produce a log of documents responsive to your \n     request that relate to the upcoming rules on new source \n     review. Finally, with respect to any responsive documents we \n     locate that are not addressed above, including responsive \n     documents related to the NSR ``90 day review,'' we will \n     provide these to the Committee by October 24, 2002, on the \n     same basis as EPA.\n       If you have any questions regarding this matter, please \n     call me or have a member of your staff call me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Dan R. Brouillette,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                      Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2754, the \nfiscal year 2004 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, as reported by \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending cap for 2004.\n  The pending bill provides $27.3 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority and $27.3 billion in discretionary outlays in fiscal year \n2004 for the Department of Energy, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  The bill is $1 million below the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and $47 million in outlays below the 302(b) \nallocation. The bill provides $511 million more in budget authority and \n$483 million more in outlays than the President's budget request, and \n$1.2 billion in budget authority and $1.8 billion in outlays more than \nthe 2003 enacted level.\n  I am concerned that there may be an amendment to add $125 million in \nemergency funding for the Corps of Engineers. This amendment, if \noffered, will have a Budget Act violation and I will not be able to \nsupport it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of the bill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I urge the adoption of the bill as it was reported from \ncommittee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n S. 1424, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 2004: SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2004, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................    27,312   .........    27,312\n  Outlays..............................    27,312   .........    27,312\nSenate Committee allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................    27,313   .........    27,313\n  Outlays..............................    27,359   .........    27,359\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority.....................    26,156   .........    26,156\n  Outlays..............................    25,555   .........    25,555\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................    26,801   .........    26,801\n  Outlays..............................    26,829   .........    26,829\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................    27,080   .........    27,080\n  Outlays..............................    27,173   .........    27,173\n \n                   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, July 21, 2003.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to address two parts of the Senate \nenergy and water bill that are extremely important to Washington State: \nthe environmental cleanup program, which impacts the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation, and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  First, let me express my deep appreciation to Chairman Domenici and \nSenator Reid for their work on this bill. As always, they have taken \nlimited resources and produced a well-balanced bill. That's a big \nchallenge given the great needs our country faces in infrastructure, \nwater, and energy. They have worked hard to understand the needs of my \nState and every State, and I thank them. I also thank the subcommittee \nstaff. Clay, who is now at the White House, Drew, Tammy, Roger and \nNancy do a remarkable job dealing with the thousands of requests from \nMembers, and I thank them as well.\n  I want to begin by talking about the environmental cleanup program at \nthe Department of Energy. That program is charged with cleaning up \nnuclear sites across the country, including the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation in Washington State. For many years, I have had to fight \nthe efforts of this and other administrations to under-fund this \ncritical responsibility.\n  This year, I am pleased that we don't have to fight for increased \nfunding. I think that success is due to several factors. First, we have \na bipartisan group of Senators who are committed to cleaning up sites \nin their States, and our group has pushed hard for this increased \nfunding. In addition, we are fortunate to have the subcommittee \nchairman and Senator Reid as allies in this effort. The Department of \nEnergy also deserves credit for putting forward a good budget request \nthat puts these funding issues behind us this year.\n  But despite the agreement on funding levels, there is another problem \nthat is brewing which I believe threatens the effective cleanup of \nthese sites.\n  Like the people of the Tri-Cities, WA, I want to make sure that \ndangerous waste is cleaned up. I am concerned that this administration \nmay try to change the ground rules so it could declare victory and walk \naway from the\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nsite, without doing all the clean up work that's required. That could \nhappen if the administration changes the definition of high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  To prevent that type of game-playing, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the Department of Energy. That \nsuit sought to block new DOE rules on the reclassification of nuclear \nwaste. Before that case went to trial, the NRDC and the States offered \nto settle the issues. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice and the \nDepartment of Energy rejected that cooperative approach.\n  The case went to court, and the Department of Energy lost. One would \nexpect the DOE to go back to the plaintiff and the states to settle the \nissues, but that's not what happened. Instead the DOE came running to \nCongress, asking for legislation to do what it could not do in court.\n  Unfortunately, this tactic of fighting the states and trying to do an \n``end run'' around the other partners in the cleanup is not new for \nthis administration. The truth is that the fastest, most effective way \nto clean up these sites is for the DOE to work in partnership with the \nStates and Federal regulators. Time and time again, however, this \nadministration has tried to go it alone to the detriment of the \nresidents who live near these contaminated sites.\n  To make the best use of the funding provided in this bill, the \nDepartment of Energy needs to get back to working in partnership with \nthe States and Federal regulators. A unilateral approach will simply \ncost more money and will only create further delays. I understand the \nDepartment and contractors want to get on with their work, but they \nmust recognize that State and Federal regulators also have a job to do. \nAnd most importantly, the people who live near these sites deserve to \nknow, understand, and have input on the activities taking place near \ntheir homes.\n  In a letter to Speaker Hastert, the Department claims the loss in \ncourt will greatly impede the cleanup of waste in Idaho, South \nCarolina, and Washington State. That simply is not true, according to \nthe NRDC, the attorneys general of those three States, and the \nenvironmental directors of each State. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nreject the Department's request for a change in law.\n  I also strongly urge the Department of Energy to get back to its job \nof cleaning up the waste, rather than wasting valuable time seeking \nhelp from Congress over a court case that it lost.\n  I would also like to applaud the report language in the Senate bill \nthat directs the Office of Management and Budget to review the \nDepartment of Energy's cleanup agreements, contracting, and cost \nestimates. I believe we should press the Department and contractors to \ncleanup these sites faster and more cheaply. Everyone supports this \ngoal. However, we should not reduce the cleanup standards or threaten \nthe safety of workers and surrounding communities. We must examine \nagreements and contracts to make sure they are realistic and that they \ndon't rely on regulatory agreements and technologies that do not exist \ntoday. I do not want to stand here in two, three or ten years and have \nto explain that the reason some agreement or contract did not meet \nsuccess was because it was never achievable in the first place.\n  Let me close this topic by making clear that we are making progress \non cleanup around the country. This is a very challenging program that \ndeals with the most dangerous materials in the world. That often \nrequires new solutions and technologies, but our scientists, engineers, \nand workers have risen to the occasion. At Hanford, we are nearly done \nremoving the spent fuel from the K-basins. This work is likely to be \ncomplete before the required timeline. Early success is also being \nachieved on the cocooning of reactors and cleanup of the plutonium \nfinishing plant.\n  In short, we are starting to make real and substantive progress in \nthis effort. In this bill, we are providing the necessary funding. Now, \nwe need the Department of Energy to take this money and work hand-in-\nhand with regulators and communities to make the cleanup a success.\n  The second issue I would like to address is the budget for the Army \nCorps of Engineers.\n  As Chairman Domenici and Senator Reid often say, we face the \nchallenge of an inadequate budget for the Corps with every \nadministration. In that simple sense, this year is nothing new. \nHowever, I think we are facing a compounding crisis this year when you \nconsider: the scale of this year's cutback of the Corps' budget, the \ncumulative effect of years of inadequate funding, and the President's \nfailure to fund low-use/shallow draft ports.\n\n  First, the President's budget for the Corps is $445 million less than \nour current fiscal year budget. I commend the chairman and Senator Reid \nfor restoring $233 million of this funding. In the end, however, it \ncreates a downward trend at a time when we cannot afford to ignore our \ninfrastructure. This funding shortfall means we are not keeping up on \nour time-lines to construct projects that are already underway. It also \nmeans we are not moving ahead on new projects that are critical for \nexpanding our infrastructure capability and expanding our ability to \nexport American products.\n  Even more troubling is the growing backlog in our operation and \nmaintenance funding. Our infrastructure is falling apart around us--\nthreatening our economy, and in some cases the lives of our sailors and \nboaters.\n  In Washington and Oregon, we have many examples of Corps \ninfrastructure that is falling apart. John Day Lock and Dam has a crack \nrunning the entire length of one monolith. That threatens the entire \noperation of the lock. This will require more than $8 million, which is \ntwice what is included in the President's budget. I thank the \nSubcommittee for providing an increase for the John Day Lock in the \nSenate bill.\n  Here's another example. Thousands of feet of the north and south \njetties at the Mouth of the Columbia River have been lost to storms. \nThe loss of these jetties creates greater dredging issues and threatens \nthe safety of ships and boats that are navigating one of the most \ntreacherous bars in the country.\n  If left unchanged, the amount of funding provided in the budget for \nBonneville Lock and Dam would result in a $4 million penalty against \nthe United States. Again, thankfully, the Senate subcommittee increased \nfunding and will avoid that penalty.\n  These are just a few of the threats facing our existing, major water \ninfrastructure. Clearly, the budget for the Corps is grossly \ninadequate.\n  We also need to remember that the budget does not provide sufficient \nfunds for low-use and shallow draft ports. In fact, in some cases there \nis no funding to meet these needs. The President's budget seems to take \npride in under-funding or zeroing out funds for these ports and \nchannels. There is an apparent belief in the administration that \nbecause of the low volume use of these harbors it would constitute an \nunwise use of Federal funds to keep them open. This narrow view of the \nsituation abandons some of our most economically-challenged rural \ncommunities in Washington, in Oregon, and across the country.\n  Look at the port of Chinook in Washington State where a failure to \nperform maintenance dredging on the Chinook channel has nearly closed \nthe Port. It was only because the subcommittee intervened and the Corps \nresponded quickly that the port will not be closed this fall and winter \nto fishing fleets. I express my sincere appreciation to the work of \nthis subcommittee for protecting the jobs relying on this port.\n  When the port of Chinook is properly maintained, the annualized cost \nof dredging the channel is about $400,000. That small investment \nproduces major economic benefits. The commercial and recreational use \nof the Port's marina alone bring in more than $3 million. Add to that \nnumber the value of the Buoy Crab Company, which employs 40 year-round \nworkers and 100 seasonal employees. It's the second largest crab \nprocessor in Washington State. And we cannot forget that the port is \nlocated in a rural county that is facing some of the highest \nunemployment rates in the State.\n  Near Chinook is the port of Ilwaco, which generates almost $9 million \nin commercial seafood sales. Charter boat fishing generates an \nadditional $2.8 million. Again, a consistent dredging program can \nmaintain an economy\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nthat brings millions of dollars into a rural economy and keeps our \npeople employed.\n  In Oregon, they have 7 or more low-use, shallow draft ports. All of \nthem are located in rural, coastal communities, and none of them \nreceived funding in the President's budget. The only bright note once \nagain is that the subcommittee has chosen to fund these ports and to \nprotect the jobs they support.\n  It appears that there are more than 25 ports and channels that \nreceive funding not included in the President's budget. These are ports \nand channels that will remain open only because this subcommittee \ndecided to value jobs and economies in rural America.\n  We must find a way to get this administration and future \nadministrations to provide adequate budgets for the Corps. We cannot \ncontinue to underfund our existing infrastructure and fail to invest in \nbuilding our economies.\n  I thank Chairman Domenici and Senator Reid for their support of water \ninfrastructure and for their efforts on this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have often spoken of the grandeur of West \nVirginia's mountains and the abundance of tranquil mountain streams \nthat gurgle quietly throughout the State. However, these same majestic \nmountains and streams are also conduits for disaster and devastation. \nWhen the heavy rains hit, waters from the mountaintops surge to the \nvalleys and turn once peaceful meandering mountain streams into angry, \nraging, muddy torrents of horror, rising up over their banks and \ndestroying anything in the way.\n  In West Virginia, such torrential flooding seems to be an annual \nevent--since 1993, the State has had eleven federally declared \ndisasters. In this year alone, the State has had two federally declared \ndisasters. In the latest round of devastating flooding in the state \nearlier this summer, twenty counties were declared Federal disaster \nareas. Homes were damaged or destroyed, and the severe impact on the \ninfrastructure in the southern part of the State--from roads, bridges, \nwater and sewer, to power sources--brought a normal way of life to a \nscreeching halt once again.\n  I know that West Virginia is not alone in attempting to recoup from \nsuch disasters. This year, many States have been impacted by floods, \ntornados, ice storms, and other severe conditions of nature that have \ncrippled individuals and communities alike. That is why I am co-\nsponsoring an amendment with Senator Reid in the amount of $65 million \nthat would provide funding assistance through the Army Corps of \nEngineers to aid impacted States in recovering and rebuilding from \nrecent natural disasters. This funding, coupled with the $983 million \nFederal Emergency Management Agency recently received through the FY \n2003 Supplemental, should go a long way in helping States get back on \ntheir feet.\n  This amendment provides $65 million for the Corps under the \noperations and maintenance account to help repair damages to public \nfacilities, such as obstructive deposits in flood control streams, bank \nerosion threatening public facilities, damages to other public \ninfrastructure such as water and sewer facilities. Additionally, funds \nprovided will allow the Army Corps to repair weather related damages \nthat have occurred to Federal infrastructure.\n  Weather-related damages have occurred to public infrastructure across \nthe country that is beyond the ability of local governments to repair. \nAs I mentioned, West Virginia has recently suffered devastating floods. \nNumerous other States such as Michigan, Louisiana, Missouri and \nIllinois are still suffering from damages that occurred in previous \nstorm events. In May of this year, unusually heavy rainfall occurred in \nfour counties of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan causing rivers and \nstreams throughout the area to swell out of their banks, inflicting \nsevere and widespread damages. The greatest damages occurred in \nMarquette County where an earthen dike at Silver Lake Basin failed, \nsending an estimated eight billion gallons of water cascading \ndownstream through the city of Marquette toward Lake Superior. The \nfloodwaters destroyed or damaged numerous public and private structures \nand caused unprecedented environmental and ecological damage within the \nDead River Basin and into Lake Superior in Marquette County. Two power \ngeneration facilities were damaged. One of the power generation \nfacilities, the Presque Isle plant in the city of Marquette, resulted \nin shutdown for more than 30 days. Without power, two iron ore mines, \nwhich produce about 20 percent of our nation's annual iron ore output, \nwere shut down, idling 1,200 workers. Dozens of other area businesses, \ninstitutions and private homeowners were also seriously impacted. Three \nof the four counties affected are impoverished, with a majority of the \npopulation over 65 years of age. Local governments simply do not have \nthe capital to pay for the public damages. Without an infusion of \nFederal aid, Marquette and the other three counties will have a \ndifficult, if not impossible, task of recovering from this disaster.\n  This amendment fills a significant funding void to provide States \nexpedited recovery from natural disasters that have occurred throughout \nthe United States. These funds are vitally needed, as any flood, \ntornado, or storm victim can tell you, and I urge the Senate to approve \ntheir inclusion in this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this important \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern regarding \nsection 205 of H.R. 2754, the fiscal year 2004 energy and water \nappropriations legislation. The provision affects the protection of the \nRio Grande silvery minnow. As ranking member of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over the \nEndangered Species Act, I am concerned about the impact this provision \nwill have on the future survival of this species.\n  In New Mexico, Federal, State and environmental stakeholders were in \nthe midst of negotiations that would yield long-term solutions to the \nwater crisis in the Rio Grande. These negotiations began in response to \na 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that both San Juan-Charm water \nand native Rio Grande water could be taken by Federal officials to meet \nenvironmental conditions for the silvery minnow. The discussions were \nrecently suspended due to the time pressures placed on the parties by \nthe provision in this bill.\n  The parties, convened by Governor Richardson, are seeking locally \ndriven resolutions that would both fulfill the intent behind this \nprovision and also address the conditions that precipitated the need \nfor the court's opinion.\n  These negotiations have moved very close to agreement on the \nsustainable and equitable management of water resources in the Middle \nRio Grande. The negotiations were a great step toward collaboration and \nmade progress under the Governor's leadership. That they have been \ncalled off, due largely to this provision, puts at risk a precedent for \ncollaboration that could be a model for endangered species and river \nmanagement throughout the West.\n  I am concerned that section 205 would prevent the Bureau of \nReclamation from releasing water from its reservoirs to maintain \nsilvery minnow habitat and that without access to this water, it will \nbe more difficult to acquire the water needed to meet the target flows \nin the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion endorsed in \nthis provision. Any action that takes water out of the Bureau's hands \nincreases the pressure on remaining water supplies and on the silvery \nminnow. Negotiated water management reforms, not exemptions to the \nEndangered Species Act, will best meet the needs of all who are \ndependent on the Rio Grande.\n  This rider also would seek to sanction a biological opinion from the \nFish and Wildlife Service. The Endangered Species Act is a flexible \ntool that allows for biological opinions to adapt to changing \ncircumstances and increased knowledge. If this biological opinion is \nendorsed by this provision, it is likely that it would not be reopened, \neven if the Service learns of more effective methods for protecting the \nsilvery minnow.\n  The Rio Grande silvery minnow occurs only in the middle Rio Grande. \nThis species was historically one of the most abundant and widespread \nfishes in the Rio Grande basin, occurring\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nfrom New Mexico, to the Gulf of Mexico. It was also found in the Pecos \nRiver, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, from Santa Rosa, NM, \ndownstream to its confluence with the Rio Grande in south Texas. It is \nnow completely extinct in the Pecos River and its numbers have severely \ndeclined within the Rio Grande. Currently, the species occupies only \nabout five percent of its known historic range.\n  The parties to the mediation, the Governor's office; environmental \ngroups; the conservancy district; the Bureau of Reclamation; several \nIndian Pueblos; the State water engineer; and the city of Albuquerque \nshould be able to continue their negotiations to find a mutually \nagreeable solution to this problem, without jeopardizing the underlying \nspecies protections provided by the Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In May of this year, unusually heavy rainfall occurred in \nfour counties of the Upper Peninsula of my home State of Michigan--\nBaraga, Gogebic, Marquette and Ontonagon Counties--causing rivers and \nstreams throughout the area to swell out of their banks, inflicting \nsevere and widespread damages. These four counties are not able to \nabsorb this disaster as they have overall unemployment and poverty \nrates higher than the state average.\n  The greatest damages occurred in Marquette County where an earthen \ndike at Silver Lake Basin failed, sending an estimated 8 billion \ngallons of water cascading downstream through central Marquette County \nand the city of Marquette toward Lake Superior. Rapidly moving water \nand massive amounts of trees, logs and other debris has severely \nundercut many sections of the riverbank, making them unstable and \ncreating serious public safety and environmental concerns.\n  Damages to one of the power generation facilities, the Presque Isle \nplant in the city of Marquette, resulted in shutdown for more than 30 \ndays. Without power, two iron ore mines, which produce about 20 percent \nof our Nation's annual iron ore output, were shut down, idling 1,200 \nworkers. These mines contribute nearly $115 million in personal income \nannually and are two of the largest employers in Marquette County. Even \nthis temporary shutdown has had a significant negative impact on the \nlocal, regional, State and national economies. Dozens of other area \nbusinesses, institutions and private homeowners were also seriously \nimpacted.\n  Current estimates of economic damages alone to these counties, mostly \nto Marquette County, are calculated at over $100 million. There have \nbeen severe impacts to roads, bridges, culverts, water control \nstructures, utility infrastructure and environmental and ecological \ndamage to the waterways resulting from this flooding. When the public \ndamage figures, currently estimated at $18-20 million, are combined \nwith those high economic impacts caused by the loss of electrical power \ngeneration capabilities and the environmental degradation to the area, \nit paints a devastating picture for this area in Michigan. Further, \nthis area is still recovering from the flooding that occurred last \nyear. The fact that these counties have suffered two major disasters in \ntwo years is extremely significant.\n  Without our assistance, Marquette and the other three counties will \nhave a difficult, if not impossible, task of recovering from this \ndisaster. And the health, safety, economic vitality, and quality of \nlife of the communities and their citizens will certainly suffer for \nyears to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this request for $125 million in \nemergency funding for flood damage remediation assistance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I heretofore indicated there would be a \nvote on a McCain amendment preceding final passage. The Senator has \nsent word that he no longer desires to offer his amendment. He \nwithdraws it. That means there are no amendments pending. We are ready \nto go to final passage.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask that the Chair lay before the House the message \nfrom the House accompanying S. 3, as under the previous agreement.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A message from the House to accompany S. 3, a bill to \n     prohibit the procedure commonly known as partial-birth \n     abortion.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have before the Senate right now what \nis usually a procedural motion. When the House passes a bill and the \nSenate passes a bill and they are different, we procedurally just move \nto disagree with the House and their provision and go to conference, \njust as we did prior to the calling up of this bill, S. 3.\n  The Presiding Officer, who is sitting here for the Vice President, \nsaid we were appointing conferees.\n  The Senator from California has sought to have a debate about whether \nwe are going to disagree with the House and therefore go to conference. \nI don't understand quite why this is necessary since it is purely a \nprocedural motion. I have been in the Senate not that many years. I \nhave been here about 9 years and have never had a debate on a motion to \ndisagree with the House and to have this kind of time spent when \neverybody agrees that is what we need to do.\n  I will support the motion to disagree with the House so we can go to \nconference and come up with a bill on partial-birth abortion that will \nbe in a conference report that will then come to the Senate that will \nnot be amendable.\n  If we did not disagree with the House, and the bill came here to the \nfloor, we would have the House bill here. It would be subject to \namendments. We would go on again for a long time and have debates and \ndiscussions on other amendments. We would have to send it back to the \nHouse, and we would be going through this game again.\n  So this is just a way to bring finality to this process of trying to \nget a bill which has now been hanging out here in the Senate. We passed \nthis several months go. The House did also. We have sort of been on \nhold here because of this procedural motion.\n  Now that we have agreed to allow 8 hours of debate--2 of which were \nlast night--we will debate a couple hours tonight, and tomorrow morning \nwe will have run a couple more hours, and then, hopefully, finish it \nsometime, maybe tomorrow evening. But the idea is to get this bill to \nconference where I am confident we will get a bill that will be to the \nliking of the vast majority of the Senate as well as the House and the \nPresident.\n  With that, we will have this bill signed and for the first time have \na Federal piece of legislation to ban a procedure which the late \nSenator from New York, standing at that desk right over there, referred \nto as ``infanticide.''\n  It is a gruesome procedure which is very difficult to talk about \nbecause it is so gruesome and graphic, this description of what this \nprocedure is all about.\n  It is used almost always on babies who would otherwise be born alive, \nwho are post 20, 21 weeks in gestation, which is halfway through a \npregnancy, or later.\n  These babies are, as I said before, in most cases, healthy. The \nmothers are healthy. This procedure is used because late in pregnancy a \nmother decides, for some reason, that she no longer wants the child \nwithin her--which is a tragic situation to have a child that is \nunwanted. I think we all recognize the tragedy of that.\n  But I think what most Members of the Senate have said is that this \nprocedure--not that she shouldn't have the right to do it. Roe v. Wade, \nas interpreted by many subsequent Supreme Court cases, gives a woman \nthe absolute right to an abortion at any time during pregnancy.\n  Now, for those of you who have not listened to debates on abortion \nbefore in the Senate or who have not read the case law with respect to \nabortion, that may come as a surprise to you, that Roe v. Wade, and its \nsubsequent line of cases, has developed to the point where there is no \nrestriction--no restriction--on the right to an abortion up until the \nmoment the baby separates from the mother completely. Up until that \ntime, the Supreme Court now has decided that a woman has a right to \nkill the child within her. Or even, as in the case of partial-birth \nabortion, the Supreme Court ruled that the woman has a right to kill \nthe child who is but an inch, 2, or 3 inches completely from being \nseparated from the mother in the process of being delivered. That is \nhow extreme the Roe v. Wade decision is.\n  Now, I would say that for most Americans who are listening, that is \nfurther than they had thought Roe v. Wade had taken this country, and \nthat it is not where the vast majority of Americans are. That is why 70 \npercent of the people in this country oppose partial-birth abortion and \nwould like to see it banned. That is why the vast majority of people in \nthis country are for some limitation on abortion.\n  Depending on the poll you see, anywhere from 15 to 23 percent of the \nAmerican public want abortions available at any time during pregnancy. \nMost Americans--the overwhelming majority of Americans--want some \nrestrictions.\n\n  Now, in the Senate we did something I would argue was unfortunate. A \ncouple months ago we adopted an amendment offered by the Senator from \nIowa which was truly an extreme amendment.\n  We hear so much talk about people who are pro-life, who are against \nabortion, as being extremists. The definition of ``extreme'' is someone \nwho is outside the norm. Well, when you have 15, 16, 17 percent holding \nthis position, and 85 percent holding the other position, it is very \ndifficult for the 16 percent to say the 85 percent is extreme.\n  But that is what we hear on the floor of the Senate, that those who \nbelieve in the absolute right given under Roe v. Wade--the absolute \nright--to have an abortion at any point in time in a pregnancy, for any \nreason--because you don't like the color of your child's eyes or \nbecause your child may have a cleft palate or because something \nhappened in your personal life that has upset you and you no longer \nwish to carry this child, even though you may be 37 or 38 weeks along--\nit doesn't matter.\n  Under Roe v. Wade, and under the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Iowa, we have said in the Senate--I believe wrongly and unjustly--\nthat should be the law of the land, that a woman's right, domain over a \nchild, is absolute until complete separation. There are some who even \nargued after separation. But, thankfully, the Senate voted last year \nthat a child who was born and completely separated has a constitutional \nright. That is how far we have come. We actually passed a bill last \nyear which said that once a child is born it has constitutional \nprotection. That is the biggest step we have been able to take to \nprotect the life of innocent children in America.\n  But what this Roe v. Wade language--this language which I anticipate \nbeing dropped in conference--says is that we believe in the absolute \nright--absolute right--of a woman to terminate a pregnancy, to kill the \nchild within her, at any point in time, for any reason. That is what \nthe law of the land says.\n  Now, I would make the argument that Roe v. Wade, because of this \ntwisting of the Constitution--it really is tortuous--has done something \nthat we have not seen done in this country, that we have not seen done \nin this country since the Dred Scott decision.\n  If we think back to the Dred Scott decision--well over 100 years ago, \n150 years ago--the Dred Scott decision was based on a misunderstanding \nof ordered\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nliberty, of ordered rights that we laid out in our founding documents. \nIn the Declaration of Independence, the document on which this country \nwas founded, we made a statement as a country that we hold dear. The \nDeclaration of Independence--of maybe all the documents, of all the \ngreat works of craftsmanship of words that we have seen put forth in \nthis country--there are very few that match the eloquence of the \nDeclaration of Independence.\n  What the Declaration of Independence said is: We hold these truths to \nbe self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by our \nCreator with certain inalienable rights. And then what--this is very \nimportant.\n  The Presiding Officer is a great student of history and maybe the \ngreatest advocate for the understanding of history and the knowledge of \nwho we are as Americans. I would argue the Declaration of Independence \ntells us more about who we are as Americans than maybe any other single \ndocument. But what this document says is: We are endowed by--not a \nCongress or not the courts or not some king--our Creator, the God that \nyou worship, Allah, Jesus, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a God who \nmay be a God of the Hindu religion, whatever that creator is, the \ncreator God, he has given us rights by the fact that we are human.\n\n  What these rights consist of the Constitution laid out. They laid \nthem out very particularly because there is an order to the rights that \nGod has given us. There has to be. We have the right to life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness. They didn't say the pursuit of happiness, \nliberty, life. They didn't say liberty, life, happiness. They said them \nin a specific order because without that ordering of liberty, without \nthat ordering of rights, they make no sense. For you cannot have \nhappiness, true happiness, you cannot pursue true happiness, which the \nFounders really sought as truth--the ability to find what is true and \nwhat is right and what is just, and that would in a sense make you \nhappy--you cannot pursue happiness without the freedom to do so, \nwithout the liberty, the right of liberty to think and to pursue your \nbeliefs freely.\n  But you cannot have liberty, obviously, if you are not alive. If you \ndon't have life, then what good is liberty? And if you are not alive, \nif you have no right to your own life, you can't pursue happiness. So \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are not just words that \nwere thrown out there because they sounded lofty or because they were \nrolled off the tongue in a way that makes a nice impression. They are \nthere because they are foundational in understanding how free people \ntreat each other, how a free society must conduct itself in order for \nit to prosper.\n  What did Dred Scott do? The Dred Scott decision put the liberty \nrights of the slaveholder over the life rights of the slave. It said \nthat I, as a slaveholder, could own and control you, could kill you, \ncould sell you as a piece of property--liberty rights over life rights. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court in the 1850s said that was constitutional. As a \nresult, many people believed that, because it was constitutional, it \nwas therefore right. It was legal. It was just. It was moral. Why? \nBecause our laws are a reflection of a collective morality. Our laws \nare a reflection of what we as a society believe is right.\n  At first there were a few. As Henry the Fifth in Shakespeare said: We \nfew, we band of brothers. In this country there were few who stood and \nsaid: No. It may be legal, it may be seen as just by the courts, but it \nis wrong. It is immoral; it is unjust; and it is a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the basis upon which this country was founded.\n  As Abraham Lincoln said, a house divided against itself cannot stand. \nThe separation began to grow. And more and more people began to \nunderstand the injustice of taking the liberty rights of one to trump \nthe life rights of another. There were many in this country and many in \nthis very Chamber who believed we could sustain that, as unjust as \nmaybe they even thought it was.\n  Many would have said: Well, I am personally opposed to slavery. I \nwould never own a slave. I would never do something like that. But who \nam I to tell someone else they can't own a slave? Is that my \nresponsibility? I may think it is immoral, but how can I impose my \nmorality on a slaveholder who has his own economic interests? He has a \nfamily to raise. He has complications in getting his crops in.\n  There are exigencies out there that those who promoted slaveholding \nsaid: We need this. We don't like it.\n  I am sure there were many people on both sides of the aisle who said: \nWe support slavery. We don't like it. We don't encourage it. Yes, we \nthink it is probably immoral. But we need to have this option available \nfor people if that is what they choose. We need to give people the \nright to choose.\n  Eventually there were enough people in this country who decided they \ncould not let that stand. Unfortunately, we had to fight a war to \nchange it.\n  After that war, I am sure there were many in this Chamber who thought \nthis great scourge, this black mark, this pox upon the American \nexistence had been wiped away, never to be seen again; that we would \nlearn from history never to repeat this horrendous injustice, this \nimmoral behavior as a society. We would never, ever again misorder our \nliberties. But they were wrong. For today in this country, as a result \nof Dred Scott 2, the Roe v. Wade decision, we have seen the same thing \ncome about.\n  We now have the life rights, the most important right given to us as \nchildren of the Creator, crushed and hidden away behind the concept of \nliberty. It repulses us now to think that people used liberty to defend \nslavery. They used the right of free people to live their life freely \nto defend slavery.\n  I hope that 100 years from now--hopefully soon--people will be on the \nfloor looking back at this time and saying: I can't believe they did it \nagain. I can't believe they didn't learn their lesson. I can't believe \nthey didn't see that a House divided against itself cannot stand.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, the Presiding Officer, is honest. It has \nbeen said many times that those who do not learn from history are \ndoomed to repeat the mistakes of history. And so we are, and so we will \ncontinue, I suspect. But it is important that the few, we merry band of \nbrothers, stand up, in spite of what may be majorities against us--and \ncertainly the media and the popular culture is speaking against us--and \nspeak the truth that our Founders laid out.\n  They did not say we believe or we think we were endowed by our \nCreator. They did not say it is our opinion that these rights exist. \nThey claimed truth. They claimed truth, and they devoted their lives, \ntheir fortunes, and their sacred honor to fight for that truth during \nthe Revolutionary War.\n  People who came from little hamlets all over the north and the border \nStates did the same. Today, in their own quiet way, millions of \nAmericans do the same. They fight the battle. They fight it with prayer \nchains. They fight it at home at night and through their prayers, \nthrough the counsel of those who are going through troubled times. They \ndo it through the love they feel toward those who are going through \ndifficult times in their lives, but they understand that the truth \nclaim that our Founders chiseled into the Declaration of Independence \nwill not be forgotten in our society.\n  We will lose many more battles. There is no doubt we will lose many \nmore battles, but ultimately, I have to believe, because I do believe \nin America, we will win the war and reestablish truth, justice, and \nrighteousness--righteousness as defined by our Founders, as understood \nin the nature of humans. We will win that war one day.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ntaken equally off both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to join with \nmy colleague from California and talk about this important measure \npending before the Senate.\n  First, I applaud the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, for \ninsisting on a vote on this motion to disagree with the House. She has \nbeen a long-time leader in the Senate and the House in protecting a \nwoman's constitutional right to privacy and her right to choose.\n  The motion before us is a motion to disagree with the House version \nof the late-term abortion bill. What is the reason we would want to \ndisagree with the House bill? The House bill is exactly the same as the \nSenate bill except for one key difference: It failed to include the \nresolution which I offered on the Senate floor, adopted in the Senate \nregarding the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade.\n  This is the exact language that is in the Senate bill that the House \ndisagrees with:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade 410 \n     USC113(1973) was appropriate and secures an important right;\n       and (2) such decisions should not be overturned.\n\n  That is all it says. That is what the Senate adopted. That was my \namendment that I offered to the bill, and the Senate adopted it. This \nis what the Senator from Pennsylvania said was extreme. It is just a \nsense-of-the-Senate that Roe v. Wade was appropriate and secures an \nimportant right and should not be overturned. The Senator from \nPennsylvania says that is extreme.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania may think that. From listening just a \nlittle bit to him--and I have heard him talk at length on this issue on \nthe Senate floor in the past--I am sure the Senator from Pennsylvania \nbelieves Roe v. Wade was an extreme decision. It is his right to think \nthat. I do not say he cannot think that if he wants to, but that is not \nwhat the majority of people in this country believe. It certainly is \nnot the way the vast majority of women in our society feel.\n  Again, this passed the Senate 52 to 47. It passed the Senate before \nin the same version. About 4 or 5 years ago, we passed the same thing, \na sense of the Senate that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. So, \nagain, the only difference between the House and the Senate bills is \nsimply this: The House does not have this language in it, so, again, to \ngo to conference with the House we have a vote to disagree with what \nthe House did.\n  If we agreed with what the House did, we would have no need for the \nconference. We would send the bill to the President. For example, if \nthe House had included this language in their bill, we would not be \nhere tonight talking about this. It would already have gone to the \nPresident and he would have signed it into law. So that is what we are \ntalking about. We are going to have a record vote on a motion to \ndisagree with the House version. It is my belief that if one votes to \ndisagree with the House version, then they are disagreeing with the \nfact that they did not put this language in their bill. That is the \nonly difference.\n  Therefore, if my colleagues vote to disagree with the House, then \nthey are voting to agree with the Senate. If they vote to agree with \nthe Senate, they agree that this language should stay.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania may try to explain it one way or \nanother, a procedural vote, blah, blah, blah--all that kind of stuff--\nbut the truth is, if my colleagues vote to disagree, the only thing on \nwhich they disagree is this language supporting Roe v. Wade. That is \nwhy I think it is important to have this vote.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says he is going to vote to disagree \nwith the House, and then try to explain it some way. I mean, a vote is \na vote. One can try to explain it any way they want, but the fact is \nthis is the only difference.\n  I believe most people in this country believe that Roe v. Wade is a \nmainstream, moderate decision by the Supreme Court. It is one that \nAmerican women have come to rely on, and I believe we owe it to them to \ninsist that it remains in this bill.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has already said they will drop it in \nconference. Well, that is kind of interesting, is it not? The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has already preordained that no matter what we vote \non in the Senate, they are going to drop it in conference.\n  I think every woman in America ought to know this. Every woman in \nAmerica ought to know that the Republican leadership--and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is in the Republican leadership--has said: We do not \ncare what the Senate said, we are going to drop this language.\n  Can there be any doubt in any American woman's mind that their right \nto privacy, their right to choose, hangs by a thin thread?\n  The vote in the Senate was 52 to 47. Someone was missing. But a few \nvotes here, a few votes there in the coming election, and I can \nguarantee that the right to choose for every young woman in America \nwill be taken away. This Congress and this President will see to it \nthat Roe v. Wade is overturned. They will see to it.\n\n  Every woman ought to know that whether they think abortion may be \nright or not, that is not the point. The point is whether a woman \nshould have control over her own reproductive system or should some man \nhave control over it? Or should a Supreme Court have control over it? \nOr should a legislative body such as a Senate or a House--comprised \nmostly of men, I might say--tell a woman what her reproductive rights \nare?\n  I have often wondered, if we could have randomly picked a Senate of \n100 women or randomly picked a House of 435 women--I am sure there \nwould be some women who would probably vote to do away with Roe v. \nWade--but I would wager that the vast majority of any vote held in a \nChamber of 100 women would be overwhelmingly: Keep your hands and keep \nyour laws off my body. Keep your hands and your laws away from my right \nof privacy and my right to choose.\n  Does anybody have any doubt that a Senate of 100 women or a House of \n435 women would vote differently than that? We would only be fooling \nourselves if we thought they would vote the same as the men in the \nSenate and the men in the House. And I say pick them randomly.\n  On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in \nRoe v. Wade. Again, for the record, it was a challenge to a Texas \nstatute that made it a crime to perform an abortion unless a woman's \nlife was at stake. That is what some in this Chamber want us to go back \nto.\n  Siding with Jane Roe, the Court struck down the Texas law. In its \nruling, the Court recognized for the first time that a constitutional \nright to privacy is ``broad enough to encompass a woman's decision \nwhether or not to terminate a pregnancy.''\n  It also set some rules. The Court recognized that the right to \nprivacy is not absolute and that a State has a valid interest in \nsafeguarding maternal health, maintaining medical standards, and \nprotecting potential life.\n  A State's interest in potential life is not compelling until \nviability, the point in pregnancy at which there is a reasonable \npossibility for the sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb. A \nState may, but is not required to, prohibit abortion after viability. \nLet me repeat that. A State may--it is not required--prohibit abortion \nafter viability, except when it is necessary to protect a woman's life \nor health, and that is the difference.\n  This is what the Supreme Court said:\n\n       The stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting \n     its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it \n     chooses, regulate, and even proscribe--\n\n  Prohibit--\n\n     abortion except where it is necessary in appropriate medical \n     judgment--\n\n  Interesting, the Court said medical judgment; they did not say \nlegislative judgment--\n\n     for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n\n  Very important words.\n  Some people, when they get all ``rhetoricked'' about this issue, say \nthat a woman can choose at any point, even up to minutes before the \nchild is born, to terminate her pregnancy. That is not what the Supreme \nCourt said. The Supreme Court said the State may even proscribe--\nprohibit--after viability ``except where it is necessary, in \nappropriate medical judgment, for the\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\npreservation of the life or the health of the mother.''\n  So we see what the Senator from Pennsylvania and those who want to do \naway with Roe v. Wade are saying. They are saying: Look, we do not \ntrust medical judgment, we do not trust a woman, and we do not believe \nthat the health of the mother should be in here. ``Life,'' maybe, but \nnot ``health of the mother.'' That is the difference. That is the key. \nAgain, is that really extreme?\n\n  Oh, I hear the arguments. They say, ``Health of the mother? Why, the \nwoman can say anything. Why, a woman can say, `I may break out in a hot \nsweat if I don't end this pregnancy. Maybe my big toe hurts; therefore, \nI have to have an abortion.' ''\n  Again, what this gets back to is a mistrust of women, that somehow a \nwoman cannot make that decision as to how it affects her health; that \nsomehow a man, a legislator, a legislative body, has to then intervene \nbecause, you see, you can't trust women to make that decision.\n  I trust women to make that decision. I have never in all my years \never talked to a woman who has had an abortion who took it lightly, \nwilly-nilly, just a little procedure and move on. This is one of the \nmost profound, traumatic, life-changing decisions a woman will ever \nhave to make. It is not made lightly. It is made under great anguish, \nwith great thought and contemplation.\n  So I guess when it comes down to that, I say I put my trust in women \nto make that decision. Not me. It is not going to happen to me. I will \ntrust the woman, with her husband, her family, her doctor, her priest, \nrabbi, minister--whatever religious faith she may be--but ultimately it \nis up to the woman to make that decision.\n  That is what this is all about, isn't it? When you cut down through \nall of it, get rid of all the rhetoric, it gets down to whether women \ncan be trusted to make these decisions. That is what my resolution \nsaid. It said Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and should not be \noverturned.\n  Before the 1973 landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade, it was estimated that \neach year about 1.2 million women resorted to illegal abortion, despite \nthe known hazards of frightening trips to dangerous locations in \nstrange parts of the city, of whiskey used as an anesthetic, of \n``doctors'' who were often marginal or unlicensed practitioners, \nsometimes alcoholic, sometimes sexually abusive, under unsanitary \nconditions, with incompetent treatment. Many times there were \ninfections, hemorrhages, disfigurement, and death.\n  By invalidating the laws that forced women to resort to back-alley \nabortions, Roe was directly responsible for saving women's lives. It is \nestimated at least 5,000 women died yearly from illegal abortions \nbefore Roe v Wade.\n  Who were these women? They were not the well-to-do. We all know from \nour youth that the well-to-do, the people who were well situated, had \naccess. They always had a friend, they had a doctor who would perform \nit and not say anything. They would pay him and that would be the end \nof it. To say otherwise, to say that never happened, stretches \ncredulity. We know that. And we all know cases of it happening.\n  No, it was not the well-to-do. They had their own special doctors who \ncould keep things quiet. It was poor women, women without connections, \nwomen who lived in small towns in rural Tennessee and rural Iowa who \ndidn't have that kind of access, poor women who lived in cities and \nurban areas who resorted to these back-alley abortions because they \ndidn't have the ``connections.''\n  Sometimes I feel there are many who want to overturn Roe v. Wade \nbecause, you know, deep down inside they know if it ever came to them \nor their families and they were confronted with a situation where their \nloved one--a wife, a spouse, a mother, a daughter, a sister--for health \nreasons had to terminate a pregnancy, for health reasons wanted to \nterminate a pregnancy, they could get it done because they have \nconnections. Don't you see? We all kind of have these kinds of \nconnections, if you are well connected like a Senator or a Congressman, \npeople with financial resources.\n\n  We can do away with Roe v. Wade, but if it ever happened to my \nsister, my daughter, and it was health, and I knew it was going to \naffect her health for the rest of her life--well, we would find \nsomebody to take care of it, don't you know.\n  Again, it is back to poor women. Unfortunately, what is lost in this \nrhetoric is the real significance of the Roe decisions. Here is what \nthe Supreme Court said, again, just 3 years ago in Stenberg v. Carhart. \nThis was the Nebraska law. Nebraska had passed a law banning abortions \nexcept to save the life of the mother.\n  Here is what the Supreme Court said 3 years ago. The governing \nstandard requires an exception:\n\n       . . . where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment \n     for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n\n  That is what the Court said 23 years prior to that in Roe v. Wade. \nThat is exactly what it said. So the Supreme Court in 2000, in the \nNebraska case, said here is the governing standard.\n  Then they said:\n\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that, in the \n     process of regulating the methods of abortion, imposed \n     significant health risks.\n\n  Once again the Supreme Court has said:\n\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that, in the \n     process of regulating the methods of abortion, impose \n     significant health risks.\n\n  That is why this late-term abortion bill before us I am sure will go \nto the Supreme Court and it is going to strike it down. Why? Because \nthere is no exception for the health of the mother: Zero, no exception.\n  The whole concept of late-term abortions obviously is not something \nanyone relishes. I do not. It is not something that conjures up pretty \nthoughts. But neither does conjuring up the thought of a woman for \nwhom, in the judgment of medical experts, this is the safest procedure \nto protect her health, and the woman can't have this procedure done and \nmay lose her ability to ever have a child again.\n  A few years ago I met from my neighboring State of Illinois a woman \nwho came to Iowa to speak to me when this issue came on the floor. She \nwent public. In other words, she came out in the public. She is happily \nmarried. She had this late-term abortion procedure, this D-and-X \nprocedure it is called, performed because she had a serious health \nproblem.\n  Whether or not it is true, the doctor told her this was the safest \nprocedure for her; that if, in fact, she did not have this procedure, \nthe other two procedures that were left--one of them being a \nhysterectomy, and I don't remember what the other one was--would \nobviously leave her incapable of every having children again. She told \nme what a painful decision this was for her to give up this fetus that \nshe had carried for several months. She spoke to me in heart- wrenching \ndetail about how painful this was for her. But they made that decision. \nShe made that decision with her husband, with her religious counsel, \nand she had this late-term abortion procedure done by a qualified \ndoctor in a hospital in sanitary conditions with good medical personnel \naround her. And her and her husband went on to have more children--\nbeautiful children.\n  Who am I as a Senator to have gone to that woman and said: You can't \ndo that. I don't care what your doctor says. It makes no difference. It \nmakes no difference how your health is going to be affected. It makes \nno difference whether you can ever have a child again. You cannot have \nthat procedure done.\n  That is what we are saying here, folks. That is what we are saying to \nthis woman. We don't care what the doctor says. We don't care what the \nmedical judgment is. We don't care how badly your health may be \naffected. You can't have that done.\n  As a Senator, I am going to tell a woman that? Some people around \nhere may want to play God. Some people around here may want to play \ndictator and dictate to women what they can and cannot do. That is not \nmy role. That is why the longer we look at Roe v. Wade, and the \ndecision that was made by the Supreme Court--and when we read the \nNebraska case--it becomes clearer and clearer that the Supreme Court \nmade a very wise decision in 1973. They set up a trimester system. When \nthey set up the viability, the State does not have an interest. But \nafter viability, States may even prohibit an abortion except to save \nthe life\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\nor the health of the mother. The longer that we have to look at what \nhas happened with Roe v. Wade the more clear it becomes to this Senator \nthat that really was a very wise decision.\n  This decision is profoundly private. As I said, it is life altering. \nAs the Court understood, without the right to make autonomous decisions \nabout a pregnancy, a woman cannot participate freely and equally in \nsociety because Roe v. Wade not only establishes a woman's reproductive \nfreedom, it was also central to women's continued progress toward full \nand equal participation in American life.\n  In the 30 years since Roe v. Wade, the variety and level of women's \nachievements have reached higher levels. Now the Supreme Court in 1992 \nobserved this. They said:\n\n       The ability of women to participate equally in the economic \n     and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their \n     ability to control their reproductive lives.\n\n  That is why I believe the freedom to choose is no more negotiable or \nshould be no more subject to the whims of the Senate or the House than \nthe freedom to speak or the freedom to worship. It is a matter of \ntrusting women to make the right decision.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to disagree with the House \nversion of the bill but not to do it in some phony sense; that somehow \nwe are going to vote but that is not what I mean. I think votes around \nhere have consequences. They have meaning. That is the language. The \nsense of the Senate that the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. \nWade is appropriate and secures an important right, and such decisions \nshould not be overturned. That is all it says. The House would not \nadopt that. The House wouldn't adopt that.\n\n  It is my hope that the conferees will preserve the Roe v. Wade \nresolution. But again, it is the Republican leadership that runs the \nSenate and runs the House. It is the Republican leadership that \nrepeatedly wanted to restrict a woman's right to choose. It is the \nRepublican leadership that says the language of Roe v. Wade is extreme, \nand that every woman in America ought to understand that--especially \nyoung women whose lives are ahead of them, who have grown up with more \nfreedom, more avenues open to them to fulfill their choices in life as \nto who they want to be and what they want to do than was ever available \nto women in my generation.\n  I think many young women in America today just take it for granted \nthat if they should ever find themselves in a situation where they \nmight seek an abortion, they will be able to do so.\n  I talk with young women. I recently came off a political campaign \nlast year. I had many young women talk about this time after time after \ntime--college-age women, young women who say to me: There is no way \nthat they are ever going to take away my right to choose; it just won't \nhappen.\n  They don't believe it could happen. I hate to disappoint these young \nwomen.\n  The vote here was 52 to 47. It was that close. It could be \noverturned. This Senate, this House, and this President could overturn \nthat and take it away and turn the clock back. And that is what some \nwant to do.\n  I have no doubt that the Senator from Pennsylvania is sincere in his \nbeliefs. I don't doubt that for a minute. And he is certainly entitled \nto his beliefs. He is not entitled to force the women of America to \nbelieve as he does. The women of America ought to make their own \nchoices and not have us make them for them.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of banning \npartial-birth abortion in the United States.\n  We have a unique opportunity to end this grisly practice of partial-\nbirth abortion in this country. Sadly, some in this Chamber have \ndelayed a vote to send this bill to conference and then to the \nPresident. That is what needs to take place. This has passed the body \nrepeatedly. The President is ready to sign it. It is time to move \nforward on this issue.\n  This is an important milestone. This will be the first time since the \nSupreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade that the Congress will have \ncurtailed in any way the practice that results in the death of an \ninnocent human being and the emotional wounding of the mother. In this \nprocess, both are victims--the child and the mother.\n  The partial-birth abortion procedure, which former Senator Moynihan \ncalled the closest thing that he had seen to infanticide, is something \nthat needs to be banned once and for all. This comes from both sides of \nthe aisle. This comes from the American public. The vast majority of \nthe American public, over 77 percent, support banning this procedure of \npartial-birth abortion. They see this as it is, as clearly the late-\nterm killing of a child. And it ought to be stopped. It should have no \nplace in a civilized country. It should have no place in a country such \nas the United States which stands for human rights and the dignity of \nthe individual.\n  I believe the true mark of a civilized society is not the level of \nhuman dignity that it confers on the strong and wealthy. Its true mark \nis on how much it confers on the vulnerable and on the oppressed. \nClearly, an abortion procedure that dismembers and kills a partially \nborn human being has no place in a civilized society.\n  Aside from partial-birth abortion, it is becoming increasingly clear \nthat the impact abortion has on this society, on the people, and \nparticularly on the women who have had abortions, is itself profound.\n  I will talk briefly about the impact of having an abortion on a \nwoman. There are an increasing number of studies coming forward about \nthe woundedness that takes place to a woman.\n  I mention to my colleagues and to those watching a particular Web \nsite titled ``Women Deserve Better.'' I have met with the leadership \nfrom this group. A number of the women have had abortions--some of them \nhave not--and deeply regret it, going through years of suffering, \nemotional suffering, personal suffering, physical suffering, as a \nresult. They have now said: We were not told the story at that time. We \nwere not told the truth of the amount of suffering we would go through. \nWe were told this would take place and it would be quick and easy and \nit would be over with and that would be it. And it is far from the \ntruth.\n  I cite one study from their Web site ``Women Deserve Better,'' \ntalking about psychological and emotional complications reported in a \n1994 survey of women who had abortions and sought counseling, finding \nthey experienced a range of problems. These are the women who have \nhad abortions, including increased use of drugs and/or alcohol to \ndeaden their pain, recurring insomnia and nightmares, eating disorders \nthat began after they had the abortion, suicidal feelings, and many \neven attempted suicide. This is a report they have cited.\n\n  They went on to also cite who is at high risk for developing serious \nemotional and psychological problems following an abortion. They list a \nnumber of groups. One was women who had abortions after 12-weeks' \ngestation. That is certainly the case in partial-birth abortions where \nyou have a gestation that would be over 12 weeks.\n  People should look at this. I ask unanimous consent to have this \nprinted in the Record at the end of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We have two victims here: the child and the woman.\n  I am also particularly concerned that the widespread acceptance of \nthis brutal practice of partial-birth abortion has already \nsignificantly coarsened public attitudes toward human life in general, \nparticularly toward the most vulnerable in our society, whether they \nare the unborn or old and infirm. This coarsening of public attitude \nover the past several years has made other assaults against the dignity \nof human life possible, assaults such as partial-birth abortion, \neuthanasia, assisted suicide, destructive embryo research, and now even \nhuman cloning where we would research on humans, we would\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\npatent a person and then research on them.\n  Furthermore, new studies in groups are coming forward addressing the \nhorrible impact, as I noted earlier, on women who have had abortions \nand what this abortion's impact is on the woman.\n  We all have a duty, an obligation, as citizens of the United States \nto stand up against the moral outrage of abortion. Human life is \nsacred. It is a precious gift. Human life is not something to be \ndisposed of by those with more power. Yet one of the most extreme \nassaults against human dignity is made against some of the most \ninnocent among us. Whether from the first moments of life, to the \nmoments just before birth, a child is a precious and unique gift, a \ngift never to be given or to be created again.\n  It seems, therefore, that in some measure this debate is about \nwhether or not that child prior to birth is a child at all. That really \nis the central question. Is that child, before birth, a child at all? \nIs this young human a person or is it a piece of property? That is the \nreal debate. One has to conclude this child is a child; it is not \nproperty. This harkens back to the slavery debate.\n  I also point out there is new evidence on this, as well. We try to \ndebate: Is the child in the womb a child or property?\n  I note a news article that came out Sunday in this country in the \nChicago Sun Times--and also in Australia in Sunday's Herald Sun--which \nreported that Dr. Stuart Campbell, professor and chair of the \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Fetal Medicine Unit at \nSt. George's Hospital in London, a man who pioneered 3-D ultrasound \ntechnology in 2001, said he has seen fetuses moving their fingers as \nearly as 15 weeks' gestation, yawning at 18 weeks, and smiling and \ncrying at 26 weeks. We are seeing this done at 3\\1/2\\ months.\n  Doctors currently believe fetuses cannot feel pain until at least 12 \nweeks' gestation when the fetus's nervous system is formed, but we are \nfinding more and more, earlier and earlier, that what this child is \nfeeling, seeing, and knowing, moving their fingers at 15 weeks--is that \na child that moves those fingers or is it a piece of property? Is it a \nrobot? Is it a blob of tissue or is it a child?\n  What impact does it have on the mother if that child's life is \nterminated? At any point in time from that point forward, what impact \ndoes it have on the mother when that child's life is terminated? \nImagine yourself, what impact does it have on you when your child's \nlife is ended? What impact does that have when you back it up in time? \nIt has a profound impact on the individuals involved. It has a profound \nimpact on society. That is why this process must be ended. That is why \nwe must stop partial-birth abortion. It is hurting everyone. It is \nhurting the society. It is hurting the people involved. It is hurting \nthe child who is killed in this process. And it is hurting everyone.\n  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the women depicted in the Portrait \nMonument, foresaw this awful view of human life in a letter she wrote \nin October to Julia Ward Howe in October of 1873. She said:\n\n       When we consider that women are treated as property, it is \n     degrading to women that we should treat our children as \n     property to be disposed of as we see fit.\n\n  That was in 1873. That quote is applicable today. The Congress must \nspeak against this degradation of human life. These are life issues of \nenormous consequence and they are issues by which history and eternity \nwill judge us.\n  Finally, I would like to close with a quote from Mother Teresa, one \nof my personal heroes. Her concern for the poorest of the poor and her \nservice to them was above reproach. Her work is being carried on today \nin India and around the world. I am sure it is going to be carried on \nfor years to come.\n  She once said this:\n\n       Many are concerned with the children of India, with the \n     children of Africa where quite a few die of hunger, and so \n     on. Many people are also concerned about the violence in this \n     great country of the United States. These concerns are very \n     good. But often these same people are not concerned with the \n     millions being killed by the deliberate decision of their own \n     mothers. And this is the greatest destroyer of peace today--\n     abortion which brings people to such blindness.\n\n  And that is why this practice must be ended.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, this practice is going to be \nended. It is going to end this year. When this body passes this bill, \nwhen the conference finally meets, when the conference report comes \nback and the conference report is passed, when the President signs this \ninto law, this practice is going to stop.\n  It is going to be the point in time when we as a country start waking \nup and looking at the huge cost of taking these young lives, of what it \nhas done to us, what it has done to the children, what it has done to \nthe mothers involved, and what it has done to us as a society.\n  But, thankfully, this procedure is going to end this year. I think \nthen we as a country--and we are now--will start waking up, saying: It \njust isn't right to take this child's life. You end up with two \nvictims, one dead and one wounded, in the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     abortion hurtswomen--Medical and Psychological Talking Points\n\n       1. 43% of American women will have at least one abortion by \n     age 45.\n       2. In the U.S., over 140,000 women a year have immediate \n     medical complications from abortion.\n       3. This includes problems such as: infection, uterine \n     perforation, hemorrhaging, cervical trauma, and failed \n     abortion/ongoing pregnancy.\n       4. Abortion increases a woman's risk of breast cancer by \n     30%.\n       5. Childbirth actually protects against cancer of the \n     reproductive system.\n       6. After an abortion there is a higher risk of developing \n     cervical, and ovarian cancer.\n       7. Abortion can lead to infertility, a serious long-term \n     complication that often goes undetected for many years.\n       8. Abortion can lead to complications in future pregnancies \n     including: premature birth, placenta previa, and ectopic \n     pregnancy.\n       9. In the 2 years following an abortion women have a death \n     rate twice as high as women who continue with their \n     pregnancies.\n       10. A woman who undergoes an abortion has a suicide risk \n     six times higher than women who have given birth to a child.\n       11. It is minorities who suffer from the greatest number of \n     serious complications and death after abortion.\n       12. Psychological and emotional complications reported in a \n     1994 survey of women who had abortions and sought counseling \n     found that they experienced a range of problems including: \n     increased use of drugs and/or alcohol to deaden their pain, \n     reoccurring insomnia and nightmares, eating disorders that \n     began after the abortion, suicidal feelings, and many even \n     attempted suicide.\n       13. Who is at high risk for developing serious emotional \n     and psychological problems following and abortion? Teenagers; \n     Women who already have children; Women who have abortions \n     after 12 weeks gestation; Women who feel pressured into the \n     abortion; Women struggling with value conflicts.\n       This information is important for every woman to know, but \n     it is especially relevant for parents of teens because of the \n     impact abortion can have on a minor's emotional health, \n     physical health, fertility, and future pregnancies.\n\n\n                               references\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a disturbing \ndevelopment that has just come to light. This development questions \nVice President Cheney's continuing financial ties to Halliburton, the \noil services company he once headed.\n  This past Sunday, the Vice President made the following statement to \nTim Russert on ``Meet the Press.'' I quote from that statement. The \nVice President said:\n\n       Since I left Halliburton to become George Bush's Vice \n     President, I've severed all of my ties with the company, \n     gotten rid of all of my financial interest. I have no \n     financial interest in Halliburton of any kind and haven't \n     had, now, for over three years.\n\n  After he made that statement, my curiosity led me to take a look at \nthe Vice President's financial disclosure records. What I saw in those \nreports was completely at odds with what he said on television Sunday \nmorning. Vice President Cheney's official financial disclosure filings \nwith the Office of Government Ethics reveals that not only does the \nVice President continue to have financial ties to Halliburton but also \nthat Halliburton is continuing to provide personal financial benefits \nto the Vice President.\n  In the years 2001 and 2002, the Vice President received large \n``deferred salary'' payments from Halliburton. In 2001, Halliburton \npaid Vice President Cheney $205,298 in salary, and in 2002 Halliburton \npaid Vice President Cheney $162,392 in salary. He is scheduled to \nreceive similar payments this year, 2003, and in 2004 and 2005. That is \na pretty strong ``financial tie,'' in my view. If you ask every-day \nAmericans if someone has a financial interest in a company that pays \nthem annual compensation, I am certain the answer would be universally \n``yes.''\n  Deferred salary is not a retirement benefit or a payment from a \nthird-party escrow account but, rather, an ongoing corporate obligation \nthat is paid from company funds. If a company were to go under, the \nbeneficiary could lose the deferred salary.\n  In an attempt to mitigate the Vice President's continuing financial \ninterest in Halliburton, his financial statement disclosure form says \nhe ``acquired'' an insurance policy ``to ensure that he will receive \nthe equivalence of his remaining deferred compensation account with \nHalliburton.'' The terms of this insurance policy, its costs, and who \npaid for it are still unclear.\n  In addition, Vice President Cheney continues to hold 433,333 \nunexercised Halliburton stock options. At the end of 2002, Vice \nPresident Cheney's financial disclosure form stated he continued to \nhold these options, although the exercise prices are above the \ncompany's current stock market price. Even though these exercise prices \nare above current values, these options could in the future bring a \nsubstantial windfall, if Halliburton's earnings in stock value continue \nto grow as it benefits from large government contracts.\n  This morning, I looked at a chart that showed Halliburton's stock \nvalue and its growth from October of last year until the current time. \nIt has grown by about 75 percent while the rest of the industry has \nremained flat over the years.\n  These options could bring, as I said, a substantial windfall if \nearnings in stock values continue to grow--I repeat--because of the \nvalue I find people have placed on Halliburton stock resulting in some \npretty good contracts they have gotten in dealing with issues in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\n  The Vice President has signed an agreement, he said, to donate any \nprofits from these stock options to charity, and has pledged not to \ntake any tax deduction for the donation. Alternatively, he doesn't have \nto pay taxes on the value growth he would have otherwise paid. But \nshould Halliburton stock prices increase over the next few years, the \nVice President could exercise the stock options for substantial profits \nbenefiting not only his designated charity but also providing \nHalliburton with a substantial tax deduction.\n  The issue is simple. Vice President Cheney claims he has no financial \nties to Halliburton, but his own financial disclosure report says \notherwise. The American people deserve to know about this relationship \nwith Halliburton. He may argue he has structured deals to minimize his \nfinancial windfall from his Halliburton arrangements, but he clearly \nstill has ``financial ties'' to the company.\n  The fact that Halliburton received an enormous contract without a \ncompetitive bid or public disclosure--it was the subject of debate \nwhich we had on this floor--it was then agreed that all contracts \ndealing with Iraq and its reconstruction would be part of the public \nrecord.\n  Back in May, I wrote to the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee requesting hearings on the no-bid contracts awarded to \nHalliburton in Iraq. I believe these developments now make it even more \nimportant for the Senate to hold hearings. I renew my plea to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to hold hearings on the administration's \ninitial contracts with Halliburton.\n  Just this week, we learned that Halliburton's no-bid contract with \nthe Army Corps has increased from $700 million to nearly $1 billion. It \nis a lot of money.\n  The American people deserve answers to these serious questions \nconcerning government ethics and accountability.\n  I also believe it is in the interest of the administration to \ncooperate so the air can be cleared and the record set straight so we \nknow once and for all whether the Vice President admits publicly that \nhe has a financial tie with Halliburton or continues to deny it, \ndespite the written record filed with the Senate Ethics Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11558-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11558-S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FUNDING FOR WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we are rolling along, trying to complete \nour work on appropriations, it won't be long that we will have the \nappropriations for the Interior Department on the Senate floor. I would \njust like to bring my colleagues up to date on some of the challenges \nwe will be facing and how we probably have to come up with some \nimagination to take care of some of the problems.\n  We watched the weather reports from my State of Montana. Montana has \nhad an unusually hot, dry summer. We have also been plagued with \nwildfires this year. In fact, the lion's share of the fires has been in \nmy State. I want to speak for a moment on something I think has great \nimportance--the need to provide additional funds to the Forest Service \nand the Department of the Interior to pay for the cost of fighting this \nyear's wildfires.\n  Nationwide, the numbers are staggering. Once again, we have suffered \na terrible fire season. Little does America know, 27 firefighters lost \ntheir lives this year in the line of duty. Over 789 homes and other \nstructures have been destroyed, and 2.8 million acres have burned. \nDuring the recent Labor Day weekend, 25,000 firefighters were working \non fires in every State in the West.\n  As in 2000, my home State of Montana has been hit by the largest \nshare of the damage. In fact, for much of the summer, half of the total \nacres burning in the whole Nation were burning in Montana. So far we \nhave lost 600,000 acres, and the fire continues today. Weather \nconditions, with cooler temperatures and 2.5 inches of rain this week \nreported in Big Fork, MT, have helped. But there are still 20 fires \nthat have the potential of blowing up unless the moisture continues.\n  During the August break, I saw the devastating impact of these fires \non our parks, forests, and communities firsthand. The fires were so bad \nthat portions of Glacier National Park and Yellowstone Park were closed \nto the public for many days, as were many national forest lands and, \nthis time, wildlife refuge lands. The impact of these fires is \ncatastrophic, not only on the land but also on the people.\n  During July and August, hundreds of residents were evacuated as 80 \nfires burned out of control throughout Montana. Roughly 125 structures \nwere destroyed, and that included 23 homes.\n  Fighting these fires is expensive. The Forest Service has been \nspending as much as $20 million a day on firefighting alone. Total \nexpenditures this fiscal year will approach $1 billion. That is \ntaxpayer money. In order to pay for these extraordinary costs, the \nForest Service has been forced to borrow $595 million from other \nnonfire accounts. The Department of the Interior has borrowed $100 \nmillion already and is expected to borrow at least $50 million more \nbefore the fire season is over. Putting it in a conservative manner, \nthe two agencies together will borrow $850 million from other accounts \nto fight fires this fiscal year.\n  Prior to the August recess, the President and the administration \nsubmitted a supplemental request for $289 million for fire suppression. \nMy colleagues may recall, I was angry when the House ultimately sent us \na supplemental that did not include these funds. In my view, it was \nhighly irresponsible since the fire season was well under way and we \nknew those funds would be needed.\n  At this stage, it may be just as well that the House omitted these \nfunds. The pending supplemental request is now totally inadequate in \nlight of what has transpired over the last month. If we were to approve \nonly the pending administration request, we would leave the Forest \nService and the Department of the Interior with a combined shortfall in \nother programs of between $550 and $600 million.\n  What would be the impact of this? In a word--substantial. The issue \nis not whether fires will or won't be fought when necessary. Both \nagencies will continue to protect life, property, and the important \nnatural resources wherever possible. The issue is what won't get done \nif we fail to repay the accounts that have been raided.\n  Last year, we were in a similar situation. Both the Forest Service \nand the Interior borrowed heavily from nonfire accounts. This caused \nboth agencies to stop work on certain things until those amounts were \nrepaid and that account replenished. In the end, we only repaid about \n60 cents on every dollar borrowed, which was the amount proposed by the \nadministration in its supplemental request.\n  The impacts of this shortfall were very real, but the agencies \nmanaged to keep most programs above water by managing carryover, \ncanceling defunct projects, and reducing the scope of projects. But as \na result of last year's shortfall, this low-hanging fruit is gone.\n  If we do not act soon to repay in full--and that is my intent, to \nrepay in full the amounts borrowed during the fiscal year 2003--the \nimpacts will be far greater. A wide variety of programs will be deeply \naffected--from endangered species monitoring to facilities \nconstruction, from land acquisition to recreation management, from the \nprocessing of grazing permits to the sale of timber. Failing to repay \nthe amounts borrowed will affect all of these things. It amounts to a \nde facto rescission of funds appropriated by Congress just 6 months \nago.\n  To my colleagues from over the Nation, I would say this is not just a \nwestern problem simply because that is where most of the fires burn. It \nis a problem for every State in the Union because the funds are \neffectively being borrowed from every State. They are being borrowed in \nmany cases from projects and programs that were funded at the specific \nrequest of every Member in this body. If the amounts are not repaid, \nthose amounts will permanently be taken from many of those same \nprojects and programs again. Maybe it will come from a National Park \nService construction project. Maybe it will be in Massachusetts. Maybe \nit will come from land acquisition in Arizona. Maybe it will come out \nof grazing management in Colorado. More than likely, it will come from \nall that I have mentioned.\n  The use of borrowing authority to fight fires is not necessarily a \nbad thing. It is a reasonable mechanism when the amounts being borrowed \nare\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\nrelatively modest, when sufficient carryover funds are readily \navailable, or when the borrowed amounts are ultimately repaid. But the \nborrowing has become routine. The amounts involved are massive. We no \nlonger have large carryover amounts in other accounts, and we have \nhabitually not repaid the full amount that was borrowed.\n  It is a terrible, inefficient way to run a program.\n  In the past, both the Congress and the administration have been \nguilty of playing budgetary games with fire suppression funding, but \nthe current situation is only a faint reflection of that fact. Congress \nincluded in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill essentially the \nsame amounts that were requested by the administration for wildlife \nfire management. That amount, in turn, was determined by using the 10-\nyear average cost of fire suppression. But that 10-year average no \nlonger is reasonable or a reasonable benchmark for a number of reasons.\n  Look at our forests. Fuel loads on the floors of our forests are \nincreasing. Increasing costs of personnel and equipment are fully \nreflected in the 10-year average, and the wildland-urban interface is \nexpanding, which increases the cost of fire suppression.\n  I think Congress and the administration need to deal with these \nissues, particularly hazardous fuel loads. But that will not happen \novernight, and it does not change the situation we are in today.\n  To be clear, I have no interest in giving the Forest Service or the \nDepartment of the Interior a blank check to fight fires. We must \ncontinue to seek ways to reduce costs, and that is why the \nAppropriations Committee has asked the National Academy of Public \nAdministration to study recent trends in firefighting costs. But while \nthat academy did find some areas for improvement, it found no smoking \ngun, and there is no silver bullet.\n  The system is broken, Mr. President, and the administration must work \nwith us to fix it. It cannot rationally expect to produce cost \ncontainment in one program by starving the life out of others.\n  In the short term, we must enact a supplemental that fully repays the \namounts they borrowed during fiscal year 2003. I call on the \nadministration to send us another supplemental request for these \namounts.\n  For the longer term, we have to have annual budget requests that more \nadequately reflect the current reality of suppression costs. We also \nneed to take another look at borrowing authority we traditionally have \nprovided these agencies.\n  Unless adequate action has already been taken on the impending \nsupplemental, I expect to offer amendments on this subject when the \nInterior appropriations bill comes to the floor. I hope these \namendments will be widely supported by my colleagues.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to give a little forecast of what is \nahead on another appropriations bill because these are tremendous \nchallenges.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    appalachian regional commission\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, ARC, and to thank Chairman Domenici \nfor his leadership and his support to ensure that the Appalachian \nRegional Commission's fiscal year 2004 funding needs are adequately \nmet.\n  The ARC was established in 1965 to support economic development in \nthe Appalachian Region. Today, the region includes 410 countries in 13 \nStates, representing a population of more than 23 million. There are 50 \ncounties in Tennessee currently participating in the ARC. Funding \nprovided by Congress is used by the commission to fund locally \nsponsored projects such as education and workforce training programs, \nhighway construction, water and sewer system construction, leadership \ndevelopment programs, and small business start-ups and expansions.\n  I am proud that a Tennessean, Anne B. Pope, is currently serving as \nthe Federal Co-Chair of the Commission. In this position, she is \nworking to further the ARC's five primary goals, which include \nimproving education and workforce training, physical infrastructure, \ncivic capacity and leadership, business development, and health care. \nEach year ARC provides competitive grant funding for several hundred \nprojects to further these goals. In 1965, one in three Appalachian \nresidents lived in poverty. However, by 1990, the poverty rate had been \ncut in half. ARC programs are helping to shape a brighter future for \nthe Appalachian region by working with local communities to foster \neconomic growth and development.\n  Last year, Congress reauthorized the ARC's non-highway programs \nthrough 2006, and authorized new programs in telecommunications, \nentrepreneurship, and job-skills training. Moreover, the legislation \nsigned by President Bush reinforced the ARC's commitment to \neconomically distressed counties by mandating that at least half of the \nCommission's project funding be made available to support activities \nthat benefit distressed areas. These changes will help to create more \nopportunities for areas still struggling to join the Nation's \nmainstream economy.\n  I am proud of the work that the ARC is doing in Tennessee, and I \napplaud Chairman Domenici for his continued support of the ARC's \nprograms. It is my hope that, as we move to conference, we can work \ntogether to ensure that the ARC's funding needs continue to be met.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11559-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11559-S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE FIRST ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, ``A government of the people, by the \npeople and for the people.'' In his immortal description of American \ndemocracy, President Lincoln made self-government sound almost easy.\n  The truth is, democracy is challenging, continuous work. No war, no \nsacrifice made by one generation--no matter how enormous--can sustain \nour democracy forever. Ultimately, each generation of Americans must do \nthe work of democracy itself or our democracy atrophies.\n  ``Civic education'' is the term we use to describe the process by \nwhich we transmit the knowledge, skills and attitudes that people need \nin order to be responsible citizens. It is at least as important to the \nfuture of our democracy as our economic might or our military power. \nFor that reason, I am very pleased to announce today that the Joint \nLeadership of the Congress of the United States will host a 3-day \nCongressional Conference on Civic Education later this month--September \n20, 21, and 22.\n  This Congressional Conference on Civic Education will bring together \neducators and other experts from every State to focus national \nattention on the state of civic education in America. I am honored to \nserve as an honorary host for the conference, along with the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, and our counterparts in the House, Speaker \nHastert and Democratic Leader Pelosi.\n  It is our hope and our expectation that the conference will help \nlaunch a nationwide movement, and produce strategic plans to strengthen \ncivic education and civic participation at every level of government--\nlocal, State, and national. It is the first of five annual civic \neducation conferences planned by the Joint Leadership.\n  The goals of this first conference include: increasing public \nunderstanding of America's representative democracies and the need for \nAmericans to play a responsible role in their Government; underscoring \nfor policymakers that America's schools play a critical role in \npreparing students for effective citizenship, and expanding the \nopportunities for policymakers to participate in carrying out this \ncivic mission; and encouraging the formation of State delegation \nworking groups that will take the lead in improving civic education in \ntheir respective States.\n  The Congressional Conference on Civic Education is a fitting and \nappropriate way for Congress to join the Nation in commemorating \nCitizenship Week.\n  The conference is a project of the Alliance for Representative \nDemocracy, a national project designed to reinvigorate and educate \nAmericans on the critical relationship between Government and the \npeople it serves. The Alliance's members are the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, the Center on Congress at Indiana University, and \nthe Center for Civic Education. The Alliance for Representative \nDemocracy project is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act \nof Congress.\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\n  There is no more important or urgent task facing our Nation than \nmaking sure that this and future generations of Americans have the \nskills, knowledge and attitudes required to maintain this Government \n``of the people, by the people and for the people.''\n  Every State delegation attending this first annual Congressional \nConference on Civic Education will identify its own specific goals for \nimproving civic engagement in our society and citizenship education in \nour schools.\n  I am sure my colleagues join me in applauding the dedicated educators \nand others who will be traveling to Washington from all over the \ncountry for this important conference. We thank them for their time and \ntheir commitment to this worthy endeavor.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues \nthe recent remarks of our former colleague Senator Max Cleland \nconcerning U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  This is a passionate, powerful speech by a true American hero whose \ntremendous service to, and personal sacrifice for, this country should \nmake of all of us mindful of his cautions and warnings. I ask unanimous \nconsent that former Senator Cleland's speech by printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [DSCC Iraq Policy Forum, Washington, DC, Sept. 15, 2003]\n\n                         Disaster in the Desert\n\n                (Former Senator Max Cleland, D-Georgia)\n\n       ``The public had been led into a trap from which it will be \n     hard to escape with dignity and honor. They have been tricked \n     into it by a steady withholding of information,'' he said. \n     ``The Baghdad communiques are belated, insincere, incomplete. \n     Things have been far worse than we have been told, our \n     administration more bloody and inefficient than the public \n     knows. He added: ``We are today not far from a disaster''--\n     T.E. Lawrence The Sunday Times of London August 22, 1920.\n       Let me see if I can get this straight.\n       The President of the United States decides to go to war \n     against a nation led by a brutal dictator supported by one \n     party rule. That dictator has made war on his neighbors. The \n     President decides this is a threat to the United States. In \n     his campaign for President he gives no indication of wanting \n     to go to war. In fact, he decries the over-extension of \n     American military might and says other nations must do more. \n     However, unbenounced to the American public, the President's \n     own Pentagon advisors have already cooked up a plan to go to \n     war. All they are looking for is an excuse.\n       An element of the U.S. military is under attack. The \n     President, his Secretary of Defense and his advisors sell the \n     idea to Congress and the American people that it is time to \n     go to war. Based on faulty intelligence, cherry-picked \n     information is fed to Congress and the American people. The \n     President goes on national television to explain the case for \n     war, using as part of the rationale for the war an incident \n     that never happened. The Congress buys the bait hook, line \n     and sinker and passes a resolution giving the President the \n     authority to use ``all necessary means'' to prosecute the \n     war.\n       The war is started with an air and ground attack. Initially \n     there is optimism. The President says we are winning. The \n     cocky, self-assured Secretary of Defense says we are winning. \n     As a matter of fact, the Secretary of Defense promises the \n     troops will be home soon.\n       However, the truth on the ground that the soldiers face in \n     the war is different than the political policy that sent them \n     there. They face increased opposition from a determined \n     enemy. They are surprised by terrorist attacks, suicide \n     bombers, village assassinations, increasing casualties and \n     growing anti-American sentiment. They find themselves bogged \n     down in a guerrilla land war, unable to move forward and \n     unable to disengage because there are no allies in the war to \n     turn the war over to. There is no plan B. There is no exit \n     strategy. Military morale declines. The President's \n     popularity sinks and the American people are increasingly \n     frustrated by the cost of blood and treasure poured into a \n     never-ending war.\n       Sound familiar? It does to me!\n       The President was Lyndon Johnson.\n       Got Ya!\n       The cocky, self-assured Secretary of Defense was Robert \n     McNamara.\n       Got ya again!\n       The Congressional resolution was the Gulf of Tonkin \n     resolution.\n       You are catching on!\n       The war was the war that me, John Kerry, Chuck Hagel, John \n     McCain and three and-a-half million other Americans of our \n     generation were caught up in. It was the scene of America's \n     longest war. It was also the locale\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\n     of the most frustrating outcome of any war this nation has \n     ever fought.\n       Unfortunately, the people who drove the engine to get into \n     the war in Iraq never served in Vietnam.\n       Not the President.\n       Not the Vice-President.\n       Not the Secretary of Defense.\n       Not the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n       Too bad. They could have learned some lessons.\n       First, they could have learned not to underestimate the \n     enemy. The enemy always has one option you cannot control. He \n     always has the option to die. This is especially true if you \n     are dealing with true believers and guerrillas fighting for \n     their version of reality--whether political or religious. \n     They are what Tom Friedman of the New York Times calls the \n     ``non-deterables.'' If those non-deterables are already home \n     in their country, they will be able to wait you out until you \n     go home.\n       Second, if the enemy adopts a `hit and run' strategy \n     designed to inflict maximum casualties on you, you may win \n     every battle but the battles you fight (as Walter Lippman \n     once said about the Vietnam War,) can't win the war.\n       Third, if you adopt a strategy of not just preemptive \n     strike but also preemptive war you own the aftermath. You \n     better plan for it. You better have an exit strategy because \n     you cannot stay there indefinitely unless you make it the \n     51st state. If you do stay an extended period of time, you \n     then become an occupier, not a liberator. That feeds the \n     enemy against you.\n       Fourth, if you adopt the strategy of pre-emptive war, your \n     intelligence must be not just ``darn good,'' as the President \n     has said, it must be ``bullet proof,'' as Secretary Rumsfeld \n     claimed the administration had against Saddam Hussein. \n     Anything short of that saps credibility.\n       Fifth, if you want to know what is really going on in the \n     war, ask the troops on the ground, not the policy makers in \n     Washington. The ``ground truth,'' as the soldiers call it, is \n     always more accurate than the truth expounded through the \n     mouths of those who plan the war and have a political, \n     personal and emotional investment in their policy. They will \n     bend any fact, even intelligence, to their own ends. If the \n     ground truth and the policy truth begin to diverge, ``Shock \n     and Awe'' will turn into what one officer in Iraq has \n     described as, ``Shock and Awe S__!''\n       Sixth, in a democracy instead of truth being the \n     first casualty in war, it should be the first cause of \n     war. It is the only way the Congress and the American \n     people can cope with getting through it. As credibility is \n     strained, support for the war and support for the troops \n     goes downhill. Continued loss of credibility drains troop \n     morale, the media becomes more suspicious, the public \n     becomes more incredulous and the Congress is reduced to \n     hearings and investigations.\n       Instead of learning the lessons of Vietnam, where all of \n     the above happened, the President, the Vice-President, the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense have \n     gotten this country into a disaster in the desert. They \n     attacked a country that had not attacked us. They did so on \n     intelligence that was faulty, misrepresented and highly \n     questionable. A key piece of that intelligence was an out-\n     right lie which the White House put into the President's \n     State of the Union speech. These officials have over-extended \n     the American military, including the Guard and the Reserve \n     and expanded the United States Army to the breaking point. A \n     quarter of a million troops are committed to the Iraq war \n     theater, most bogged down in Baghdad. Morale is declining and \n     casualties continue to increase. In addition to the human \n     cost, the funding of the war costs a billion dollars a week, \n     adding to the additional burden of an already depressed \n     economy.\n       The President has declared ``major combat over'' and sent a \n     message to every terrorist, ``Bring them on.'' As a result, \n     he has lost more people in his war than his father did in his \n     and there is no end in site.\n       Military commanders are left with extended tours of duty \n     for servicemen and women, told long ago they were going home, \n     and keeping American forces on the ground where they have \n     become sitting ducks in a shooting gallery for every \n     terrorist group in the Middle East.\n       Welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President. Sorry you didn't go when \n     you had the chance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11562-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

It is the town's only bridge to span \nVermont's longest river, the Otter Creek. Originally constructed in \n1915, the new bridge will reestablish an historic gateway between the \neast and west of Justin's home community.\n  Proctor's Marble Arch Bridge, adorned with Highland Marble quarried \nfrom beneath Vermont's grand mountains, is an elegant example of \nartistry, craftsmanship and heritage, values that we Vermonters cherish \nand respect.\n  SGT Justin Garvey, Proctor High School Class of 1998, exemplified \nthese values as well. Justin was, by all accounts, an outstanding young \nman. He was known as a strong competitor, a motivated student, and an \navid outdoorsman. His friends knew him as being good hearted and good \nhumored. Justin was a loyal brother, a dedicated son and a loving \nhusband.\n  Justin Garvey loved and is loved by his family and community.\n  He crossed the Marble Arch Bridge innumerable times. When he last \ncrossed this bridge, he was on a journey that would take him to serve \nin the United States Army 101st Airborne Division, one of America's \nmost elite defense forces.\n  Not every soldier has the ``stuff'' to make the 101st Airborne. But \nit was no surprise to those who knew him that Justin Garvey studied and \ntrained and worked to become a top-notch soldier. A fellow soldier \nwrote that ``He was a man who had no enemies . . . he is everything I \nwant to be as a man. Everyone who ever met Justin was better for it. It \nwas an honor to have served with him up to the end, that night. He \ntaught me what a true hero is.''\n  From before its inception and throughout its history, America has \ndepended upon the willingness of men like Justin Garvey to put \nthemselves in harm's way for the sake of country and countrymen.\n  Indeed, this Nation has survived only because of such men and such \nwomen.\n  When Justin Garvey last crossed Proctor's historic Marble Arch \nBridge, he was already a hero to his family and friends in this \ncommunity. Today, all of Vermont and all of America recognize Justin \nGarvey as an American hero.\n  Indeed, the world is in his debt.\n  It is fitting and proper that we should dedicate a memorial to SGT \nJustin Garvey, Proctor native, American hero.\n  May God Bless Justin and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11562-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11562-S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE KATYN FOREST MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the \nvictims of the Katyn Forest Massacre in 1940. Katyn Forest is a quiet \nwooded area near the Gneizdovo village, a short distance from Smolensk \nin Russia. It was at this site, on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's \norders, that the Soviet NKVD shot and buried more than 4,000 Polish \nservice personnel that had been taken prisoner when the Soviet Union \ninvaded Poland in September 1939. Most of these victims were Polish \narmy reservists--lawyers, doctors, scientists and businessmen, Poland's \nelite and intelligentsia--who were called up to active service \nfollowing the Nazi invasion of Poland.\n  On September 17, 1939, under the terms of a secret Moscow-Berlin \ntreaty, forces of the Soviet Union invaded Poland through its eastern \nborder. Polish troops, overwhelmed by the German invasion on its \nwestern border, surrendered to the Red Army on the pretense they would \nbe protected. More than 15,000 Polish soldiers and civilians were sent \nto prison camps at Kozielsk, Starobielska and Ostashkov in the Soviet \nUnion.\n  In an effort to eliminate potential threats to Soviet control of \nPoland and what Stalin described as counter-revolutionary espionage and \nresistance organizations, Soviet troops, carried out what many have \ncalled one of the most heinous war crimes in history. Prisoners in all \nthree Soviet Camps were executed and buried in mass graves. One of \nthese graves was discovered in Katyn Forest, where between four and \nfive thousand Polish bodies were found. There were no trials; there was \nno justice for these innocent victims.\n  Although the Soviet Government originally denied their role in this \nunspeakable atrocity, on February 19, 1989 Soviet scholars released \ndocuments that revealed that Stalin had indeed ordered the mass \nexecution. The following year Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev \napologized to the Polish people for the killings. While this admission \nof guilt provided some closure, it certainly does not erase the\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\npain and suffering felt by a nation whose entire population was \naffected by this horrific event. Sixty-three years later, the name \nKatyn still stirs passions in Poland.\n  Today, I honor the victims of the Katyn Forest Massacre and commend \nthem for their courage and their sacrifice. For on that fateful day, \nmore than six decades ago, these valiant men paid the ultimate price to \nsecure their country's freedom.\n  It is my sincere hope that as more people learn about the carnage \nthat occurred at Katyn Forest and the surrounding sites, we will be \nable to come to terms with this tragedy and help heal the wounds that \nthe great nation of Poland and its citizens still suffer. When we honor \nthe memories of those brave souls who were lost on that tragic day, we \nwill prevent future generations from repeating the same horrors which \noccurred in our past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11563-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  RHODE ISLAND COUNCIL ON RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud today to honor the Rhode \nIsland Council on Residential Programs for Children and Youth, RICORP, \nfor 25 years of service to 1,250 of Rhode Island's most needy children.\n  RICORP developed training programs for childcare workers in Rhode \nIsland throughout the 1980s and by 2000, the council had established \ntraining certification programs for childcare workers, supervisors and \nclinicians. In 2001, RICORP collaborated with the Community College of \nRhode Island to develop a college curriculum in ``Children's \nResidential Programming'' and in September of 2002 the program became a \nreality.\n  RICORP has also advanced legislation in the Rhode Island General \nAssembly in 2000 to give contracted providers rate increases in fiscal \nyear 2001 and 2002. Additionally they lobbied for initiatives to \nimprove the lives of children in care, such as the Higher Education \nAssistance Grant enacted in 1999. This grant gave youth in out-of-home \nplacement free tuition if they attended one of the State colleges.\n  These are just a few examples of RICORP's contributions toward \nimproving the lives of needy children in the State of Rhode Island.\n  I join all Rhode Islanders in congratulating RICORP on its 25th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11563-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO C. FRANCIS DRISCOLL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of C. \nFrancis Driscoll, of New London, CT, who passed away on August 8 at the \nage of 68.\n  Although Frank Driscoll was born in New York, he would become one of \nNew London's most influential and devoted public servants, committing \nhis time and energy, for over 30 years, to making life better for the \npeople of that city.\n  Frank Driscoll's first work on behalf of New London came from 1961 to \n1967, when he was the executive director of the Redevelopment Agency, \nand a driving force in New London's urban renewal. But after 2 years \nworking in Washington at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment he returned to New London to take the job that he would \nhold for the next 23 years, the position of city manager--the top \nexecutive post in the city.\n  As city manager, Frank Driscoll became known as a man who was very \ncareful with how he spent city funds. A child of the Great Depression, \nhe understood that these were the hard-earned tax dollars of working \nmen and women, and he was always careful to spend those dollars wisely. \nAt the same time, he was also tireless in his efforts to obtain Federal \nfunds to improve the quality of life in New London. In fact, during the \n1970s, New London won more money in Federal aid than it raised in local \nproperty taxes. These critical funds helped New London improve and \nrenovate its schools, revitalize its business district, and ensure the \nintegrity of its water supply.\n  Frank Driscoll was a skilled, dedicated, and effective leader. But \nthose who knew him or worked with him will probably remember him even \nmore as a deeply caring and compassionate individual. He treated every \ncity employee as part of an extended family. And when it came to his \nown family, Frank Driscoll's devotion was second to none.\n  He was also a man of faith who was a vital member of his community. \nAt St. Joseph's Parish in New London, he was a member of the parish \ncouncil as well as the church choir. Frank was a man whose faith helped \nshape every aspect of his life, both public and private.\n  I know that everyone who has lived in New London since the 1960s \nfeels fortunate that they had Frank Driscoll working on their behalf. \nAnd I feel privileged to have had him as a friend.\n  I offer my most heartfelt condolences to Frank's wife Caroline, to \ntheir eight children, nine grandchildren, and to everyone else who knew \nFrank Driscoll. He will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11563-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11563-S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN TRIBUTE TO JOHN McKISSICK'S 500TH FOOTBALL WIN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in light of John McKissick's \nhistoric football accomplishments, I ask that this article from the \nSeptember 11 USA Today be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Sept. 11, 2003]\n\n             Football Coach all Alone at Brink of 500 Wins\n\n                            (By Jill Lieber)\n\n       He's the winningest football coach at any level, going for \n     his 500th victory Friday night. He has 10 state championships \n     and 26 regional titles. And in 52 years at the helm of the \n     mighty Green Wave of Summerville High School, John McKissick \n     is known for something else in this quaint, historic burg, \n     population 27,752: as a leader of the community, the glue \n     that holds the town together.\n       ``John McKissick has been a vital part of forming \n     connections around this town,'' says David Pugh, Summerville \n     High's principal. ``What makes a community successful is the \n     quality of life, and John has shown great leadership in that. \n     He has been able to connect people. He has taught them how to \n     share.''\n       McKissick, two weeks shy of his 77th birthday, has molded \n     3,014 teenage boys into players over the years. He has \n     instilled pride in tens of thousands of Summerville High \n     students, cheerleaders, band members, teachers and parents. \n     And he has provided excitement for countless more football \n     fans, who have turned out 10,000 strong, in their green and \n     gold, every Friday night in the fall for the past six \n     decades.\n       Grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers, sons, the next-\n     door neighbor's kid, even the piccolo player down the street: \n     Everybody here is tied to the Green Wave in some way.\n       Why, McKissick now is coaching the third generation of some \n     Summerville families. His own grandson, Joe Call, a former \n     Green Wave quarterback, is an assistant coach.\n       Truth be told, the folks in this town, nestled on a piney \n     ridge 25 miles northwest of Charleston, would be lost without \n     McKissick.\n       ``So many leaders have come through the John McKissick \n     system,'' says Bo Blanton, chairman of the school board and \n     former Green Wave quarterback.\n       ``Police officers. Teachers. Lawyers. Doctors. Dentists. \n     Legislators. Coaches. The bond has been formed over the \n     years, the winning tradition of the football program has \n     permeated through the community, all because of the \n     excellence of John McKissick. So many people have felt a part \n     of it. So many people have been inspired by it.''\n       At 8 p.m. Friday, at McKissick Field, on John McKissick \n     Way, the legendary coach will try to give Summerville yet \n     another treat: The Green Wave (2-0) play local rival Mount \n     Pleasant Wando High (1-1) in what could be McKissick's 500th \n     victory.\n       Coincidentally, McKissick beat Wando in October 1993 for \n     his 406th victory, which set the national high school \n     football record.\n       Berlin G. Myers Sr., Summerville mayor the past 33 years \n     and owner of the local lumber company, has declared this John \n     McKissick Week. (Several years ago, Myers actually \n     rescheduled Halloween because it fell on a game night.)\n       Joan McKissick--who wed her husband in June 1952, just two \n     weeks before he took the job at Summerville--has spruced up \n     the press box with photos of past and present Green Wave \n     players for the media rolling into town for the big game. \n     She's expecting hundreds of family and friends.\n       Troy Knight, the town's attorney, a former Green Wave ball \n     boy, manager and trainer, is a major player with the 500th \n     Committee. That's a group of local business people who have \n     brainstormed ways to commemorate McKissick's milestone.\n       They're throwing a party on the field after the game for \n     McKissick's 82 varsity players and their families, if the \n     team wins.\n       The city will come together Nov. 8 for a fundraiser: \n     Summerville will be establishing a John and Joan McKissick \n     Scholarship.\n       ``Coach McKissick is an educator, first and foremost,'' \n     Knight says. ``His vehicle just happens to be coaching. This \n     is a way for his legacy to live on forever.''\n       Winning admiration of peers\n       McKissick, a quiet, unassuming man, has not missed a game \n     in 52 years--631 games.\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\n     Not health, not weather, not an act of God has stopped him. \n     He has had only two losing seasons (1957 and 2001).\n       His wife has missed just three games. She's the Green \n     Wave's official historian and her husband's trusted \n     biographer, thanks to the piles of scrapbooks she has \n     religiously kept throughout his career. She's also the \n     curator of the largest collection of Green Wave artifacts, \n     most engulfing the playroom of their ranch house, which the \n     McKissicks affectionately call The Green Wave Room.\n       South Carolina Gamecocks coach and friend Lou Holtz is \n     keeping his fingers crossed that McKissick will reach 500 \n     Friday.\n       ``I don't know of any individual who has done more for high \n     school football or for the state of South Carolina than John \n     McKissick,'' Holtz said through his sports information \n     director. ``He not only has taught winning football, he has \n     developed winning young men. He has been so unselfish with \n     his time. His loyalty to Summerville and the state of South \n     Carolina really impresses me.''\n       Florida State coach Bobby Bowden (334 victories), second to \n     Penn State's Joe Paterno as the winningest Division I-A \n     football coach, also is sending good vibes to his good buddy \n     McKissick.\n       ``The victories bring pride to the state of South Carolina, \n     especially since he is one of their own,'' Bowden said \n     through his school's sports information director. ``It also \n     brings great attention to what you can do if you just \n     persevere. I don't know if it can ever be broken.\n       ``I think Coach McKissick's longevity is due to the fact \n     that he has his priorities in order and that football is not \n     his No. 1 priority. A man must have persistence and love of \n     the game and love of life to coach so long.''\n       Everything he wants right here.\n       McKissick's persistence and perseverance were forged from a \n     tough childhood.\n       Born in Greenwood, S.C., McKissick was the second of Harry \n     and Ethel's three sons. Harry owned the Pepsi and Nehi \n     Bottling Co.\n       A few months after the 1929 stock market crash, the \n     McKissicks returned home one night to find their house \n     destroyed by a fire. Within months, the bottling plant went \n     bankrupt. The family moved to Lake City, S.C., where \n     McKissick's dad opened a corner grocery that went belly up \n     within two years.\n       Life got better after his mom got a job as lunchroom \n     supervisor for the public schools in Williamsburg County--she \n     worked there 40 years--and his dad became a guard standing \n     shotgun on the county chain gang. But the tough times didn't \n     stop.\n       McKissick grew up in homes without toilets and running \n     water. He didn't wear shoes to school until the eighth grade. \n     And the family could afford to eat meat--fried chicken--only \n     on Sundays.\n       He was drawn to coaching because he recalled how happy his \n     Kingstree High school coach, Jimmy Welch, always looked. ``I \n     figured it must be a good profession.''\n       In the fall of '51, he landed a job in Clarkton, N.C.--over \n     the phone, sight unseen. Little did he know he'd be coaching \n     six-man football; it paid $2,700 a year. He called Lonnie \n     MacMillian, his coach at Presbyterian College and a pioneer \n     of the Split-T offense, for advice.\n       ``He gave me four plays to run told me to run--them to the \n     right and left, so it would seem like I had eight,'' says \n     McKissick, whose team went 7-0. (None of those victories are \n     included in his 499 wins.)\n       In the spring of 1952, McKissick applied for the job at \n     Summerville. ``The superintendent, Frank Kirk, later told me \n     I got the job because I was the only applicant who didn't ask \n     how much it paid.''\n       McKissick coached boys and girls basketball, baseball and \n     track. He taught two South Carolina history classes and three \n     U.S. history classes. And he mowed and lined the football \n     field, shined the football cleats, washed the game uniforms \n     and taped the players' ankles, all for $3,000 a year.\n       ``Growing up poor gave me drive,'' he says. ``I put \n     pressure on myself to try to achieve something in life. I had \n     empathy for kids who had a tough time, especially if they \n     were trying, and compassion for those who lacked \n     confidence.''\n       McKissick has been approached about college head coaching \n     jobs (The Citadel, Newberry, Presbyterian), but he has never \n     come close to leaving. His wife was a postal carrier for 30 \n     years until she retired in 1986. They raised two daughters \n     here: Debbie and Cindy, a former Green Wave cheerleader.\n       ``People always ask me why I didn't take another job,'' \n     McKissick says. ``I grew up hard, not having everything I \n     wanted. People have different wants and needs. A lot of \n     people want more than what they really need.\n       ``Working with kids has kept me young; it has allowed me to \n     grow and evolve. And I get so much self-satisfaction seeing \n     former players around town, at the filling station, the \n     barbershop. . . . Even as football coaches at area high \n     schools.\n       ``Why would I ever want to leave Summerville? It's a \n     wonderful community, with wonderful fans and great support. \n     It's my family. I have everything I've always wanted right \n     here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11564-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REAR ADMIRAL HOWARD KIRK UNRUH, JR.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to formally \nacknowledge the great accomplishments and recent retirement from the \nUnited States Naval Reserve of one of my constituents, Rear Admiral \nHoward Kirk Unruh, Jr.\n  Henry Clay said: ``Of all the properties that belong to honorable \nmen, not one is so highly prized as that of character.'' RADM Unruh is, \nindeed, a man of character and he has shown outstanding character \nthroughout his 33 years of service to the Navy.\n  Admiral Unruh's naval career began in the Garden State, where he \nattended Princeton University on a ROTC scholarship. In 1970, upon his \ngraduation from Princeton, Ensign Unruh was commissioned as an officer \nin the United States Navy.\n  He reported for duty in Hawaii where he served on the USS Elkhorn \nAOG-7. As damage control assistant and engineering officer, he accepted \na great deal of responsibility for a young man and gained valuable \nleadership experience. He learned what it meant to serve and what it \nmeant to lead, and he made the Navy an important part of his life.\n  His work did not go unnoticed, and, after completing a tour of the \nWestern Pacific aboard the Elkhorn, Unruh was selected to participate \nin Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's Human Resource Management Program in Pearl \nHarbor.\n  In 1975, Lieutenant Unruh left active duty, and went on to receive a \nMasters degree in Education from Harvard University. But the Navy was \nin his blood. So, while studying in Massachusetts, he accepted a \ncommission in the Naval Reserves and began the second phase of his \nservice.\n  For the next 28 years, Admiral Unruh served wherever and whenever he \nwas needed. He taught naval management and leadership courses; he \nmentored officers and sea cadets; he spearheaded successful \nreorganization efforts in reserve centers; and he participated in joint \nmilitary training exercises in the U.S. and abroad. In short, as he \nmoved up the ranks, he gave the Navy his wholehearted commitment on \nland and sea.\n  In 1995, he took an assignment as the Department of the Navy's duty \ncaptain at the Pentagon's Navy Command Center. There, he served under \nSecretary of the Navy and Chief Naval Operations Admiral Mike Borda and \nwas in charge of monitoring military activity around the world. On his \nfirst day on duty, human emigres flying civilian aircraft over Cuba \nwere shot down by the Cuban military, which believed that the aircraft \nwere intruding in Cuban air space. Captain Unruh acted quickly and \nadmirably, putting together data to brief the President on the United \nStates on what was happening.\n  Now Kirk Unruh retires as an Admiral and he has well earned that \nrank. Over the years, his contributions to the Navy have been duly \nrecognized. He is authorized to wear the Legion of Merit, the \nMeritorious Service Medal which he was awarded twice, the Navy \nCommendation Medal which he was awarded four times, the National \nDefense Medal with bronze star, and various other Unit and Service \nribbons. These decorations attest to the character of the man, the \nservice he has rendered, and the honor with which he has provided that \nservice.\n  Today I ask that my colleagues join with me in thanking Admiral Unruh \nfor his years of service, for his commitment to this nation and to the \nUnited States Navy, and for a job well done. As noted in his Legion of \nMerit Citation: ``By his outstanding leadership, commendable \ninnovation, and inspiring dedication to duty, RADM Unruh reflected \ngreat credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the \nUnited States Naval Service.''\n  Lastly, behind the career of most great Naval officers is a loving \nfamily that is asked to endure the hardships of constant travel and \nperiodic separation. Admiral Unruh's family is no exception. His wife \nDiane has made many sacrifices to support her husband.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to a permanent repository for high-level nuclear \n     waste; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 48\n\n       Whereas, over the past four decades, nuclear power has \n     become a significant source for the nation's production of \n     electricity. Michigan is among the majority of states that \n     derive energy from nuclear plants; and\n       Whereas, since the earliest days of nuclear power, the \n     great dilemma associated with this technology is how to deal \n     with the waste material that is produced. This high-level \n     radioactive waste material demands exceptional care in all \n     facets of its storage and disposal, including the \n     transportation of this material; and\n       Whereas, in 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1982. This legislation requires the federal \n     government, through the Department of Energy, to build a \n     facility for the permanent storage of high-level nuclear \n     waste. This act, which was amended in 1987, includes a \n     specific timetable to identify a suitable location and to \n     establish the waste facility. The costs for this undertaking \n     are to be paid from a fee that is assessed on all nuclear \n     energy produced; and\n       Whereas, in accordance with the federal act, Michigan \n     electric customers have paid $405.8 million into this federal \n     fund for construction of the federal waste facility; and\n       Whereas, there are serious concerns that the federal \n     government is not complying with the timetables set forth in \n     federal law. Every delay places our country at greater risk, \n     because the large number of temporary storage sites at \n     nuclear facilities across the country make us vulnerable to \n     potential problems. The events since September 11, 2001, \n     clearly illustrate the urgency of the need to establish a \n     safe and permanent high-level nuclear waste facility as soon \n     as possible. The Department of Energy, working with the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission, must not fail to meet its \n     obligation as provided by law. There is too much at stake: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring). That we support the United States Department of \n     Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in their efforts \n     to fulfill their obligation to establish a permanent \n     repository for high-level nuclear waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Energy, the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-270. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to beach grooming on \n     private property; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, the most effective stewardship of our environment \n     includes both public and private participation. Michigan has \n     recently taken an important step in the direction of caring \n     for our shorelines and beaches with the enactment of \n     legislation permitting shoreline property owners to take \n     certain actions to maintain beaches within specific \n     guidelines; and\n       Whereas, with the reduction in lake levels, shoreline \n     property has changed dramatically in many areas. In many \n     instances, beaches have been transformed by vegetation, which \n     has led property owners to seek authority to groom the \n     beaches. However, the potential for conflict with the long-\n     term integrity of shore lands and habitat required extensive \n     discussions to develop an effective and responsible strategy; \n     and\n       Whereas, as a result of the input of individual property \n     owners, local landowner and environmental groups, state \n     officials, and lawmakers, Michigan has enacted legislation, \n     2003 PA 14 (Enrolled House Bill No. 4257), that will allow \n     property owners to remove vegetation and debris from beaches. \n     These actions are limited in scope and strike a workable \n     balance between legitimate recreational concerns and \n     environmental considerations; and\n       Whereas, the effective compromise established with regard \n     to maintenance on Michigan beaches will be far more \n     productive than contentiousness between property owners and \n     governmental regulators. This legislation capitalizes on the \n     shared commitment private and public interests have in the \n     quality and the appearances of our beaches: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to work with the appropriate federal agencies in \n     adopting guidelines on beach maintenance activities as \n     defined in 2003 PA 14. We also encourage the United States \n     Army Corps of Engineers to work cooperatively with property \n     owners on the stewardship of beaches; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Army Corps \n     of Engineers, the Office of the Governor, the Michigan \n     Department of Environmental Quality, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-271. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to widening and resurfacing of the M 50 to US 12 \n     segment of US 127; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 95\n\n       Whereas, the Michigan International Speedway (MIS), which \n     attracts 600,000 visitors annually, is the largest sporting \n     venue in Michigan. Michigan International Speedway has \n     accepted its role as a corporate citizen with pride for the \n     last 35 years; and\n       Whereas, fifty-five percent of MIS season ticket holders \n     are from outside the state of Michigan, with season ticket \n     holders in 47 states and 12 foreign countries. The indirect \n     economic impact of the Michigan International Speedway to \n     Michigan's economy exceeds $500 million dollars annually. \n     With over 50% of the race weekend business coming from \n     outside the state, a substantial amount of money is brought \n     into Michigan's economy from the surrounding area; and\n       Whereas, in 2002, a resurfacing project was completed on US \n     127 from M 50 North to Interstate 94, which has caused a \n     deterioration in the roadway south of M 50 to US 12; and\n       Whereas, traffic counts escalate annually, averaging 20,000 \n     vehicles per day, and they spike drastically during the three \n     race weekends at Michigan International Speedway; and\n       Whereas, traffic engineers routinely specify a four-lane \n     highway as mandatory for traffic volumes that exceed 17,500 \n     on a daily basis; and\n       Whereas, transportation planners project that without any \n     new development, traffic counts along US 127 in Jackson \n     County will range from 31,000 to 51,000 vehicles daily; and\n       Whereas, the number of vehicle accidents occurring on US \n     127 is unacceptably high, with an annual average of 311 \n     occurring annually. Of this number, 248 occur on the road \n     segment between M 50 and US 12; and\n       Whereas, the state of Michigan has recognized the \n     increasing problems associated with traffic pressure on US \n     127 since 1994, when it was specifically cited in the \n     Michigan Long-Range Plan; and\n       Whereas, roadway expansion for US 127 in Jackson County has \n     previously been permitted and does not require an \n     environmental impact study; and\n       Whereas, improvements to US 127 from M 50 to US 12 will \n     both improve community safety and enhance economic \n     development efforts; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation to support funding \n     for the widening and resurfacing of the M 50 to US 12 segment \n     of US 127; and\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-272. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Highway Trust Fund and \n     the State of Texas; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 82\n\n       Whereas, an integrated, safe, and adequately financed \n     transportation system is a critical component of the \n     economic, social, and environmental well-being of both the \n     United States and Texas; and\n       Whereas, the Highway Trust Fund was established by the \n     Highway Revenue Act of 1956 as a mechanism to finance an \n     accelerated highway program, including the Interstate Highway \n     System; the revenues used to finance the trust fund are \n     derived from federal excise taxes on highway motor fuel and \n     certain truck-related taxes collected from motorists in all \n     50 states and paid into the federal Highway Trust Fund; and\n       Whereas, federal law requires that the money paid into the \n     trust fund be returned to the states in accordance with \n     legislatively established formulas that are recalculated \n     every six years in reauthorization legislation; most recently \n     the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) \n     was passed in 1998; and\n       Whereas, due to funding disparities, 26 states, known as \n     highway program donor states, receive less than their fair \n     share of the federal fuel taxes that their citizens have paid \n     into the highway account of the trust fund; from 1956 to \n     2001, Texas received only an average highway program rate of \n     return of 78 percent on the funds sent to Washington; and\n       Whereas, currently, the United States Congress is drafting \n     legislation to reauthorize TEA-21, which guaranteed a minimum \n     rate\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\n     of return of 90.5 percent on federal highway programs; a \n     coalition of the donor states seeks a guaranteed rate of \n     return of 95 percent of their share of contributions to the \n     federal Highway Trust Fund, calculated against all dollars \n     being distributed to the 50 states; and\n       Whereas, a 95 percent rate of return would allow Texas to \n     better address its highway construction, repair, and \n     maintenance needs; highway projects enhance mobility, improve \n     air quality, foster economic development, and support \n     thousands of jobs in Texas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to provide equity funding to Texas by increasing the state's \n     highway program rate of return from the Highway Trust Fund to \n     95 percent of Texas' contributions to the fund; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the Congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-273. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to the Clean Air Act \n     as it pertains to safeguarding public health and protecting \n     environmental quality; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, Section 111 of the Clean Air Act requires the \n     adoption of federal standards (known as new source review) \n     reflecting the best available control technology for \n     facilities which cause, or contribute significantly to, air \n     pollution which may endanger public health or welfare; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (USEPA) adopted such standards of performance for the \n     construction or modification of power plants; and\n       Whereas, the New Hampshire attorney general has alleged and \n     is actively pursuing litigation against upwind power plant \n     owners for violation of new source review here in New \n     Hampshire and out-of-state; and\n       Whereas, the administration of President Bush is proceeding \n     to implement modifications of the new source review program; \n     and\n       Whereas, acid rain, which is damaging sensitive ecosystems, \n     including the forests and lakes of New Hampshire. has been \n     particularly attributed to emissions from coal-burning plants \n     upwind of New Hampshire; and\n       Whereas, scientific research has established a well-defined \n     link between power plant air emissions and human health \n     impacts, including exacerbation of symptoms for those with \n     asthma, increased risk of heart attacks for those with heart \n     disease, causation of lung cancer and premature death; and\n       Whereas, there remains considerable controversy, \n     uncertainty, and question as to whether the planned changes \n     to new source review will result in continued, increased, or \n     decreased air polluting emissions compared with current or \n     alternative standards: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the general court of New Hampshire urges the \n     President, George W. Bush, and the USEPA Administrator, \n     Christie Whitman, to suspend implementation of modified \n     regulations on new source review pending independent \n     scientific review of their projected impact by the National \n     Academy of Sciences; and\n       That the general court urges the congressional delegation \n     to take and support appropriate actions against any decision \n     made by the administrator of the USEPA to modify the \n     regulations implementing Section 111 of the Clean Air Act if \n     the result would be to jeopardize New Hampshire's ability to \n     safeguard public health and protect environmental quality, \n     including a suspension of pending modified regulations \n     pending independent scientific review by the National Academy \n     of Sciences; and\n       That copies of this resolution, signed by the president of \n     the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives be \n     forwarded by the senate clerk to President George W.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the portion of the Internal \n     Revenue Code regarding veterans and their families; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 161\n\n       Whereas, Texas has long been a leader in recognizing and \n     rewarding the tremendous sacrifices of its veterans; and\n       Whereas, home ownership is viewed by many as a major \n     component of the American Dream; and\n       Whereas, enabling veterans to achieve home ownership at a \n     lower cost is but a small reward for their faithful service \n     while in the U.S. Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, in appreciation of this service on behalf of our \n     state and nation, the Texas Veterans Land Board has offered \n     below-market interest rates on home loan mortgages to \n     eligible veterans since 1983; and\n       Whereas, this program has assisted more than 500,000 Texas \n     veterans in obtaining affordable housing and in making a \n     better life for themselves and their dependents; and\n       Whereas, Texas utilizes federally tax-exempt bonds known as \n     Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds to fund approximately 50 \n     percent of all home and improvement loans made to veterans; \n     and\n       Whereas, current federal law governing the use of tax-\n     exempt bonds used to fund these loans, as contained in \n     Section 143(I)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     unfairly limits these programs to only those veterans who \n     served prior to January 1, 1977; and\n       Whereas, this restriction unfairly prevents all veterans \n     serving on active duty after 1976 from using Qualified \n     Veterans Mortgage Bonds, including more than 500,000 men and \n     women who served in Desert Shield and Desert Storm and the \n     8,000 reservists and National Guard members of Texas called \n     up to serve our country since September 11, 2001; and\n       Whereas, these courageous men and women deserve the same \n     benefits offered to their earlier counterparts, yet they and \n     their families are being denied the opportunity to use \n     Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds; and\n       Whereas, Congress has failed to remedy this discriminatory \n     federal provision on behalf of these deserving men and women, \n     despite the fact that it will not increase federal \n     discretionary spending one cent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the 108th Congress to support \n     legislative action to immediately remove the aforementioned \n     discriminatory portion of the Internal Revenue Code in order \n     that today's veterans and their families might enjoy the same \n     benefits as their earlier counterparts; and be it further\n       Revolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, the speaker of the house of representatives, \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-278. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to federal income tax \n     deductibility of state and local sales taxes that existed \n     before 1986; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the \n     deductibility of state and local sales taxes paid by federal \n     income tax return filers while it retained the deductibility \n     of state and local income taxes; and\n       Whereas, although the tax legislation was generally \n     designed to simplify the federal income tax, eliminating the \n     deduction for payment of state and local sales taxes created \n     a fundamental disparity adversely affecting citizens of Texas \n     and eight other states that do not levy a personal income \n     tax; and\n       Whereas, while citizens in the 41 other states continue to \n     deduct state and local income taxes, thereby reducing their \n     federal income tax liability, taxpayers in Texas and a few \n     other states have no corresponding tax deduction to ease \n     their burden; the net effect of this imbalance is that Texans \n     and citizens of eight other states pay a higher percentage of \n     federal taxes than the majority of American taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, in addition to fostering the inequitable treatment \n     of individual taxpayers, this disparity also has worked \n     against the states whose tax structure has no general \n     individual income tax and relies heavily on sales taxes; and\n       Whereas, a report published in March, 2002, by the \n     Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas \n     estimated that the inability to deduct state and local sales \n     taxes could cost Texans more than $700 million for the 2002 \n     tax year and, if the deductions are not restored, could cost \n     the state more than 16,000 jobs that otherwise would be \n     created with a lower tax burden and an increase in disposal \n     family income; and\n       Whereas, according to the report, reinstating the \n     deductibility of state and local sales taxes on federal \n     income tax returns could generate substantial benefits for \n     Texas families and the state's economy; and\n       Whereas, a family of four with an income of $60,000 could \n     get an additional federal income tax deduction of $1,015, and \n     a single mother with one child and an income of $35,000 could \n     deduct an additional $461; and\n       Whereas, the comptroller of public accounts estimates that \n     the more than $700 million in net tax savings that would stay \n     in Texas could encourage $590 million in new investments \n     within the state and an $874 million increase in the gross \n     state product in 2003; and\n       Whereas, as a matter of equity and fairness, Texans and the \n     citizens of other states that finance their budgets without \n     an income tax deserved to benefit from federal income tax \n     deductions comparable to those already enjoyed by the \n     majority of United States taxpayers; federal legislation that \n     reinstates the deductibility of state and local sales taxes \n     is currently before the congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to restore the federal income tax deductibility of state and \n     local sales taxes that existed before 1986; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-279. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to block grants to be used for \n     public welfare and Medicaid purposes; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 58\n\n       Whereas, State Medicaid spending currently accounts for \n     approximately 22 percent of total state spending; and\n       Whereas, under the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, \n     the federal share of state Medicaid spending provided to the \n     State of Texas has decreased by 4.2 percent over the past 10 \n     years; and\n       Whereas, average monthly Medicaid caseloads in the State of \n     Texas are projected to increase to 2,885,583 by fiscal year \n     2005 from 2,376,193 in fiscal year 2003; and\n       Whereas, prescription drug costs are a major factor driving \n     Medicaid expenditures, and annual Medicaid prescription \n     levels in the State of Texas are projected to rise to \n     40,257,515 by fiscal year 2005, from 33,859,094 in fiscal \n     year 2003; and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office projects that \n     Medicaid spending under the current system will more than \n     double by the year 2012; and\n       Whereas, the growth in federal spending of the Medicaid and \n     welfare entitlements is astronomical and spiraling, \n     significantly increasing the federal budget costs; and\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\n       Whereas, this growth will never be controlled unless the \n     State of Texas has autonomous management of the program, free \n     from federal mandates regarding individual entitlement, \n     eligibility groups, benefits, payment rates, and financing \n     structures to allow most citizens of the State of Texas to \n     benefit from the Medicaid and welfare programs; and\n       Whereas, the State of Texas will be able to design and \n     develop innovative, efficient, and productive medical \n     assistance programs that will meet the needs of the residents \n     within the State of Texas' budget capacity; and\n       Whereas, in the State of Texas, there exists the \n     possibility to improve patient outcomes and cost-\n     effectiveness with a statewide implementation of consumer-\n     directed care under the state medical assistance program: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislative of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     enact appropriate legislation to pass federal funds on to \n     states via block grants to be used for public welfare and \n     Medicaid purposes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, the secretary of the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services and all the members of the Texas \n     delegation to the congress with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered into the Congressional \n     Record of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-280. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the medical savings account \n     program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 90\n\n       Whereas, Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) offer an \n     innovative alternative to high-premium insurance policies by \n     combining tax-free savings accounts and high-deductible \n     catastrophic health insurance plans; and\n       Whereas, individuals choosing to use these accounts can pay \n     for routine and minor medical services with funds set aside \n     in a tax-free savings account, while major health care costs \n     are covered by their high-deductible health insurance plans; \n     and\n       Whereas, tax-free MSAs encourage individuals to make wise \n     and economical decisions about their health care because \n     managing their own accounts often makes them more aware of \n     the true costs of health care; MSAs also offer participants \n     greater access to medical services and the freedom to choose \n     their own health care providers; and\n       Whereas, a survey of MSA plan participants shows that \n     employers offering MSAs to their employees have been able to \n     reduce health insurance expenses by up to 40 percent; in \n     contrast, employers overall have recently experienced an \n     average 16 percent increase in health insurance premiums, \n     with some small employers confronting increases of 40 to 50 \n     percent; and\n       Whereas, the federal MSA pilot program, which was designed \n     for small employer groups and the self-employed, carries \n     restrictions that may discourage participation in the program \n     and create confusion among potential applicants, employers, \n     and insurance providers; and\n       Whereas, the federal MSA pilot program limits annual \n     deductibles for participating employees to not less than \n     $1,700 or more than $2,500 for an individual and not less \n     than $3,500 or more than $6,150 for a family; annual out-of-\n     pocket expenses under the plan cannot exceed $3,350 for \n     individual coverage and $6,150 for family coverage; and \n     annual limits for account contributions are 65 percent of the \n     deductible for an individual account and 75 percent of the \n     deductible for a family account; and\n       Whereas, according to 1996 data, about 85 percent of \n     Americans incurred medical expenses, with an average per-\n     person expenditure of about $2,400, an amount well within the \n     range limits of the MSA annual contribution for an individual \n     account; even more significant is the fact that about half of \n     those persons who incurred medical expenses had expenses of \n     less than $560; and\n       Whereas, any unspent MSA funds for a given year may be \n     rolled over to the following year; after age 65, unspent \n     funds can be rolled over to an Individual Retirement Account \n     or withdrawn without penalty for any use and taxed as \n     ordinary income; and\n       Whereas, expanding the availability of MSAs to other \n     employers, increasing the account contribution limits, and \n     lowering the limits on annual deductibles for participating \n     employees would encourage greater participation among \n     consumers, employers, and insurance providers: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to broaden the scope and availability of the medical savings \n     account program, remove its restrictions, and allow state \n     governments to design such programs for their employees; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11568-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Further Revised Allocation to \n     Subcommittees of Budget Totals for Fiscal Year 2004'' (Rept. \n     No. 108-148).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11568-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n             Lautenberg, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n       S. 1618.

A bill to amend the individuals with disabilities Education \nAct to ensure that children with disabilities who are homeless or are \nwards of the State have access to special education services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator DeWine in introducing legislation to provide a high-quality \neducation to homeless and foster children with disabilities. The \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is based on the \nbedrock American principle of equal opportunity. IDEA recognizes that \nstudents have a civil right to a free, appropriate public education, \neven if their special needs require additional resources. Because most \nfoster and homeless children face distinct challenges, they require \neven more attention and consideration to make sure their educational \nneeds are met. The Improving Education for Homeless and Foster Children \nwith Disabilities Act would make small but critical changes to ensure \nthese children have a real opportunity to fulfill their potential.\n  Students with disabilities face additional challenges in school as do \nfoster and homeless children. But to live in a foster home or in no \nhome at all and to have a disability is truly to have the deck stacked \nagainst you. Congress has a long and proud tradition of supporting and \nprotecting educational opportunity for our most vulnerable young \npeople. It's what we did when we passed the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act in 1965. It's what we did when we created Head Start, and \nit's what we did when we started giving out Pell Grants. It's time for \nus to step up once again and make the changes to make IDEA work for \nhomeless and foster children with disabilities.\n  The bill that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today addresses \nthe unique educational needs of children with disabilities who are in \nfoster care or who experience homelessness. Foster children and \nhomeless children face a unique set of challenging circumstances. There \nare over 500,000 children in foster care. Thirty percent of them are in \nspecial education. We know that foster children often do not function \nwell in school. Foster children have usually been separated from their \nbiological families as a result of child abuse or neglect, which can \nleave both emotional and physical marks for life. Given the shortage of \nfoster parents in this country, children in foster care are often \nshuttled between many different homes and schools. One young man has \nshared with me his story of living in more than 100 homes throughout \nhis childhood. Every time these children move to a new home, they may \nhave to attend a new school. And every time these children enroll in a \nnew school, they must start over in securing the supports and services \nthey need to receive the free and appropriate public education that is \ntheir civil right.\n  In addition to frequent absences and transfers, foster children often \ndon't\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\nhave parents to advocate for their educational needs. Almost every \nparent whose child has a disability will tell you that their role as \nadvocate for their child correlates directly to the quality of the \neducation their child receives. Without a parent to advocate for them, \nfoster children can languish for years with unrecognized disabilities \nor insufficient services to help them succeed in school. These \nexperiences can leave children in foster care without the education and \nsupport to lead functional, productive lives.\n  Homeless children in our country also face significant hurdles to \nsucceed in school, which are exacerbated for children with \ndisabilities. The Urban Institute estimates that 1.35 million children \nexperience homelessness each year. A high proportion of homeless \nchildren with disabilities also need special education services, yet \nmany homeless children have great difficulty accessing these services.\n  Children who experience homelessness desperately need stability in \ntheir lives, but they often lack the continuity of staying in one \nschool or even in one school district long enough for an Individualized \nEducation Plan--or IEP--to be developed and implemented. In addition, \nlike foster children, some homeless youth have no legal guardian to \nwatch out for their educational needs and to advocate for their best \ninterests.\n  Despite this difficult situation, we can help these children with a \nhigh-quality education. The Improving Education for Homeless and Foster \nChildren with Disabilities Act amends IDEA to help States and districts \nmeet these challenges. It facilitates greater continuity for students \nwho change schools or school districts, by ensuring that students' IEPs \nfollow them from school to school. It increases opportunities for early \nevaluation and intervention for homeless and foster infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities. It also provides for representation of \nfoster and homeless children on key committees that make critical \ndecisions affecting special education. This bill expands the definition \nof ``parent'' to include relatives or other caregivers who are equipped \nto make sound decisions in a child's best interest when there is no \nbiological parent available to do so. Finally, it improves coordination \nof services and information so educational and social services agencies \ncan function more efficiently to benefit these children.\n  As we reauthorize IDEA, we have an obligation to pay extra attention \nto these children and to provide the resources and support they need. \nThe real test of how we treat children in America is measured in how we \ntreat the most vulnerable among us, and this bill gives us a chance to \ndo the right thing. I urge the Senate to truly ensure that no child is \nleft behind by passing the Improving Education for Homeless and Foster \nChildren with Disabilities Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1620. A bill to condition the implementation of assessment \nprocedures in connection with the Head Start National Reporting System \non Child Outcomes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Head Start \nAssessment Act of 2003. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the \nfull-scale implementation of the Head Start National Reporting System \ntakes place after there has been ample opportunity for expert and \npublic commentary on the assessment, Congressional oversight hearings \nhave been held, and the National Academies have completed a study of \nthis issue to ensure that the assessment is reliable and appropriate.\n  Currently, children in Head Start are assessed 3 times a year on all \nof the domains of early learning and development, including literacy \nand math. The National Reporting System (NRS) is an assessment \ndeveloped by HHS, which would create an additional test for all 4-year \nolds in Head Start, roughly \\1/2\\ million children, on literacy and \nmath skills only. Children would be assessed twice a year and according \nto Administration documents, changes over time in children's scores \nwould be used to judge the success of individual Head Start programs. \nThe new testing program is expected to cost about $20 million each \nyear. Some pilot testing was begun in April and May of 2003 and HHS \nexpects to begin full implementation of the NRS this fall.\n  The purpose of the bill that I am introducing today is not to \nundermine this assessment, or to oppose assessment, but to make sure \nthat it is done correctly. As you know, I have a long history of \nsupporting accountability for educational programs. Assessments are \nimportant tools for accountability. They can be used to benefit \nteachers and students and to raise the bar for all educational \nprograms. That being said, a good assessment takes time to develop and \nthe measures and procedures that are used must be thoroughly debated \nand discussed. I have grave concerns about the speed with which the NRS \nwas developed as well as with the opacity of the process by which HHS \nhas proceeded to date.\n  Assessing young children is notoriously difficult. They are not used \nto taking tests and often do not have the emotional maturity to sit \nstill and focus on the task at hand. Their test scores tend to \nfluctuate across time and can reflect many factors unrelated to their \nskills. The National Academy of Sciences report, ``Eager to Learn: \nEducating Our Preschoolers'' made it clear that more research on \nassessing young children is needed before such assessments should be \nused for accountability purposes. Because of this, it is crucial that \nthe assessment instruments to be used in the NRS are properly validated \nand deemed to be appropriate for 4-year old children. At this point, we \nhave little information about exactly what those instruments are and \nHHS has not made available the results of pilot tests or the comments \nmade by experts on the content of the assessment.\n  To my mind, the speed with which this assessment was rolled out makes \nit unlikely that the measures have been properly developed and tested. \nIt has also become clear that the assessment targets only a few of the \nskills that Head Start seeks to instill in children. For example, \nsocial skills are not being assessed and it is clear that without them, \nchildren are simply not ready to learn.\n  It is also very important that sufficient time be taken to insure \nthat English language learners are not put at a disadvantage by being \ngiven a test that is not appropriate for them. The test is in English \nand Spanish, and yet many Head Start children speak Asian or other \nlanguages. In my home State of New Mexico, for example, I have heard \nfrom Native American Head Start Directors who are concerned that the \nNRS, in its current form, is not appropriate for their students, who \noften do not speak English in the home. We should take the time to \ninsure that the assessment tool that is ultimately used is valid and \nreliable, assesses the gamut of skills that children acquire in Head \nStart, and is appropriate for children from a wide variety of cultural \nbackgrounds.\n  It is also crucial that throughout the process of developing these \ninstruments, there is ample consultation both with the public and with \nexperts in early childhood development and research methodology. The \nresults of these consultations and decisions regarding the NRS should \nbe made public. Although HHS claims that they have had many meetings \nwith ``experts'', there is little or no information publicly available \nthat clarifies what went on at these meetings, what decisions were \nreached, and whether the advice of the experts was or was not heeded in \ndeveloping the NRS. To date, there has been no Congressional oversight \nor public task force convened. Development of an assessment tool as \nimportant as this one should not occur behind closed doors. Congress \nand the public have a right to participate in and comment on this \nprocess.\n  My bill would help to insure that the NRS is developed in the proper \nfashion. The Secretary of HHS would be required to halt the full-scale \nimplementation of the NRS until such time as Congressional oversight \nhearings have been held, the Secretary has concluded public forums on \nthis issue, and the National Academy of Sciences has conducted a study \nusing a panel of nationally recognized experts in early childhood \nassessment, child development, and education. The NAS study would \nprovide specific information regarding: a. the skills and competencies \nthat are predictive of school readiness and academic success in young \nchildren, b. the\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\ndevelopment, selection, and use of instruments to assess literacy, \nmathematical, emotional and social skills as well as health and \nphysical well-being young children, c. the proper use of early \nchildhood assessments to improve Head Start programs and d. the steps \nneeded to ensure that assessments take into account the racial, \ncultural, and linguistic diversity of Head Start students, among other \nthings.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Head Start is the flagship \neducational program for low-income children. Studies clearly show that \nchildren who attend Head Start programs show gains in their cognitive \nand social skills, but we also know that more can and should be done \nfor this vulnerable population. Assessments can be an important means \nto insure that quality is maintained in each Head Start program, but \npoorly developed or implemented assessments can do more harm than good. \nLet's take our time, consult with the experts and the public, and come \nup with a National Reporting System that we can all be proud of.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Head Start Assessment Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) When used appropriately, valid and reliable assessments \n     can be of positive value for improving instruction and \n     supporting development of young children.\n       (2) According to the National Academy of Sciences report, \n     Eager to Learn: Educating Our Preschoolers, assessment of \n     children below school age is in ``flux'' and ``all \n     assessments, and particularly assessments for accountability, \n     must be used carefully and appropriately if they are to \n     resolve, and not create, educational problems.''\n       (3) The Eager to Learn report emphasized that the intended \n     purpose and use of the data to be derived from assessments \n     should be considered in determining which assessment \n     instruments and procedures are most appropriate.\n       (4) The National Academy of Sciences reports that few early \n     childhood educators and administrators are well-trained in \n     the selection and appropriate use of assessments for young \n     children.\n       (5) According to the National Academy of Sciences report, \n     From Neurons to Neighborhoods, the emotional and social \n     development of young children is as critical to school \n     readiness as language and cognitive development.\n       (6) The Head Start Act currently requires programs to \n     assess children in Head Start a minimum of three times a year \n     against certain performance standards, which include all \n     domains of the development and learning of children.\n       (7) The proposed Head Start National Reporting System on \n     Child Outcomes assessment is not reflective of the full range \n     of skills and competencies that the National Academy of \n     Sciences reports state children require to succeed, and it \n     has not been thoroughly debated by those groups associated \n     with Head Start, including early childhood development and \n     assessment experts, early childhood educators and \n     administrators, family members of children participating in \n     Head Start, or Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES IN \n                   CONNECTION WITH THE HEAD START NATIONAL \n                   REPORTING SYSTEM ON CHILD OUTCOMES.\n\n       (a) Satisfaction of Conditions.--The Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services shall not proceed with the full-scale \n     implementation of the Head Start National Reporting System on \n     Child Outcomes, as described in the project proposal (68 Fed. \n     Reg. 17815; relating to Implementation of the Head Start \n     National Reporting System on Child Outcomes), until the \n     Secretary certifies to Congress that the following conditions \n     have been satisfied:\n       (1) Oversight hearings.--Congressional oversight hearings \n     have been concluded concerning the development and \n     implementation of the Head Start National Reporting System on \n     Child Outcomes.\n       (2) Public forums.--The Secretary has concluded, consistent \n     with the requirements of subsection (b), public forums in \n     different regions of the United States, and provided an \n     opportunity for written public comments, concerning early \n     childhood assessment proposals.\n       (3) Study on early childhood assessments.--The Secretary \n     has submitted, consistent with subsection (c), to Congress a \n     study of early childhood assessments focusing on improving \n     accountability, instruction, and the delivery of services. \n     The Secretary shall request the National Academy of Sciences \n     to prepare the study using a panel of nationally recognized \n     experts in early childhood assessment, child development, and \n     education.\n       (4) Availability of funds.--Without reducing the number of \n     students served by Head Start, sufficient funds are available \n     to--\n       (A) develop and implement any new Head Start assessments; \n     and\n       (B) deliver necessary additional technical assistance and \n     professional development required to successfully implement \n     the new assessments.\n       (b) Public Forum Participation.--To satisfy the condition \n     specified in subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall ensure \n     that participation in the required forums includes--\n       (1) early childhood development and assessment experts;\n       (2) early childhood educators and administrators; and\n       (3) family members of children participating in Head Start.\n       (c) Information Required by Study on Early Childhood \n     Assessments.--To satisfy the condition specified in \n     subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall ensure that the \n     required study contains, at a minimum, specific information \n     regarding the following:\n       (1) Which skills and competencies are predictive of school \n     readiness and future academic success.\n       (2) The development, selection, and use of instruments, \n     determined to be reliable and validated for preschoolers, \n     including preschoolers in the Head Start population, to \n     assess the development in young children of--\n       (A) literacy, language, and mathematical skills;\n       (B) emotional and social skills; and\n       (C) health and physical well-being.\n       (3) The development of appropriate benchmarks and the \n     proper use of early childhood assessments to improve Head \n     Start program effectiveness and instruction.\n       (4) The resources required for successful implementation of \n     additional assessments within Head Start and how such \n     additional assessments might be coordinated with current \n     processes.\n       (5) Whether a new assessment would provide information to \n     improve program accountability or instruction that is not \n     already available from existing assessments and reporting \n     procedures within Head Start.\n       (6) The professional development and personnel needs for \n     successful implementation of early childhood assessments.\n       (7) The practicality of employing sampling techniques as \n     part of any early childhood assessment.\n       (8) The practicality of employing observational and work-\n     sampling assessment techniques as part of an early childhood \n     assessment.\n       (9) Steps needed to ensure that assessments accommodate the \n     racial, cultural, and linguistic diversity of young children, \n     including young children with disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 1621. A bill to provide for consumer, educational institution, and \nlibrary awareness about digital rights management technologies included \nin the digital media products they purchase, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Consumers, \nSchools, and Libraries Digital Rights Management Act of 2003, \nlegislation I view as vital for American consumers and our Nation's \neducational community as they venture forth into the 21st century \ndigital media marketplace.\n  This legislation responds directly to ongoing litigation between the \nRecording Industry Association of America and Internet service \nproviders Verizon and SBC Communications. This litigation has opened \nwide all identifying information an ISP maintains on its subscribers, \neffectively requiring ISPs to make that information available to any \nparty simply requesting the information. The legislation also creates \ncertain minimal protections for consumers legally interacting with \ndigital media products protected by new digital rights management \ntechnologies.\n  I had intended to introduce individual pieces of legislation on these \nissues--privacy and digital rights management. However, given that both \nissues are so relevant to consumers in the digital age, I ultimately \ndecided to present them to my colleagues in one comprehensive bill.\n  It has been determined by a Federal court that a provision of the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act permits the RIAA to obtain this ISP \nsubscriber's identifying information without any judicial supervision, \nor any due process for the subscriber. Today, right now, solely due to \nthis court decision, all that is required for a person to obtain the \nname and address of an individual who can only be identified by their \nIntent Protocol address--their Internet phone number--is to claim to be \na copyright owner, file a one page subpoena request with a clerk of the \ncourt,\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\na declaration swearing that you truly believe an ISP's subscriber is \npirating your copyright, the clerk will then send the request to the \nISP, and the ISP has no choice but to divulge the identifying \ninformation of the subscriber--name, address, phone number--to the \ncomplaining party. There are no checks, no balances, and the alleged \npirate has no opportunity to defend themselves. My colleagues, this \nissue is about privacy not piracy.\n  The real harm here is that nothing in this quasi-subpoena process \nprevents someone other than a digital media owner--say a stalker, a \npedophile, a telemarketer or even a spammer from using this quasi-\nsubpoena process to gain the identity of Internet subscribers, \nincluding our children. In fact, we cannot even limit this subpoena \nprocess to mainstream copyright owners.\n  This past July, SBC Communications received a subpoena request for \nthe personal information of approximately 60 of its Internet \nsubscribers. The copyright owner that made the request is a hard core \npornographer named Titan Media. We cannot permit the continued \nexistence of a private subpoena that can be used by pornographers to \neasily identify Americans. If you have any doubt, all you need to do is \nlook into the generous amnesty program offered by Titan Media to those \nit accuses of piracy: buy their porn, and they won't use the subpoena \nto identify you. The threat of abuse is simply too great, as Titan \nMedia has already demonstrated.\n  The Consumers, Schools, and Libraries Digital Rights Management \nAwareness Act of 2003 requires the owners of digital media products to \nfile an actual case in a court of law in order to obtain the \nidentifying information of an ISP subscriber. This will provide \nimmediate privacy protections to Internet subscribers by forcing their \naccusers to appear publicly in a court of law, where those with illicit \nintentions will not tread, and provides the accused with due process \nrequired to properly defend themselves.\n  In addition, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to study \nalternative means to this subpoena process, so that we may empower our \nNation's intellectual property owners to defend their rights by \npursuing those who are stealing from them, but to do so in a safe, \nprivate, confidential manner where consumers are concerned, and without \nburdening the courts. Transitioning to an FTC process will ensure that \nthere can be speedy verification, due process, safety, and maximum \nprotection for the innocent, while preserving maximum civil enforcement \nagainst pirates.\n  I do not offer this legislation to debate the history and merits of \nthe DMCA. I offer this legislation for my colleagues consideration, \nbecause I find it untenable that any Internet subscribers' identifying \ninformation can be obtained, under government auspices no less, without \nany oversight or due process.\n  I want to be celar on an important point. This subpoena is mostly \nbeing sought by mainstream digital media owners who are seeking to \nprevent piracy performed using peer to peer file sharing software. \nWhile I am as disappointed as anyone that the mighty RIAA would choose \nto force a little 12-year-old girl--one of the Internet subscribers \nidentified through an RIAA subpoena--and her mother to pay them $2000 \nfor the girl's piracy, I am still opposed to piracy as much as any \nMember of Congress. I have a strong record on property rights to back \nthat up. I have no interest in seeking to shield those who have \ncommitted piracy from the law or hamper the ability of property owners \nto defend their rights. My concern with this quasi-subpoena process is \nwith the problems it creates. I have made it very clear to all \nstakeholders that I stand ready to work on alternative legislation if \nthey perefer something else to this provision, but unfortunately that \noffer has been flatly rejected.\n  This week the Senate voted to reverse the Federal Communications \nCommission's new media ownership regulations. I opposed that \nresolution, because I do not believe the FCC's amendments to its media \noutlet ownership rules are a threat to competition and diversity. \nHowever, I do stand with my colleagues in supporting a media \nmarketplace where information flows from numerous sources and our \nconstituents are empowered by a full range of robust digital outlets \nand new digital technologies available to them in the 21st century \nmedia marketplace. While well intentioned, I believe my colleagues are \nsimply focusing on the wrong issues in the current debate over media \nownership.\n  Digital rights management, otherwise known simply as DRM, refers to \nthe growing body of technology--software and hardware--that controls \naccess to and use of information, including the ability of individuals \nto distribute that information over the Internet. Over the past few \nyears the large media companies have persistently sought out new laws \nand regulations that would mandate DRM in the marketplace, denying \nconsumers and the educational community the use of media products as \nhas been customarily and legally permitted.\n  As a result, the Consumers, Schools, and Libraries Digital Rights \nManagement Awareness Act of 2003 will preclude the FCC from mandating \nthat consumer electronics, computer hardware, telecommunications \nnetworks, and any other technology that facilitates the use of digital \nmedia products, such as movies, music, or software, be built to respond \nto particular digital rights management technologies.\n  Consumers and the educational community are legally permitted to use \nmedia products in a host of ways. Some of these uses are specifically \nidentified in the Copyright Act as limitations on the rights of \ncopyright owners. Many of these uses are the result of court decisions \ninterpreting one of those limitations, the limitation known as Fair \nUse, and customs based on those court decisions. As a result, consumers \ncan record cable and broadcast programming for non-commercial, private \nhome use. They can lend DVDs and CDs to friends and family. They can \nmake copies of movies and music in different formats so that they can \nuse them with different types of playback devices. Media products can \nbe used for criticism, research, and a range of other educational \npurposes that include acts of redistribution. All of these uses of \ncontent can be made by consumers and the educational community under \nthe Copyright Act, and none of them require the permission of the \ncopyright owner.\n  The same digital marketplace that has given rise to DRM is also \nupdating the ways consumers and the educational community may use media \nproducts in powerful new ways. Broadband connectivity and new digital \nnetworking technologies--used in homes, offices, schools, and \nlibraries--raise the prospect of never having to use physical media \nagain. Instead, consumers, employees, students, and library patrons \ncould access legally owned and legally possessed media products that \nreside on such a network remotely, via the Internet. These developments \ncould revolutionize the information age at its onset.\n  Digital rights management can both help and hinder this evolutionary \nprocess. DRM can be a powerful tool for combating digital piracy. It \ncan tether digital content to specific devices, preventing that content \nfrom being used on other devices. DRM can also prohibit Internet \nredistribution of digital media products.\n  DRM also has its downside, especially when it is incorporated into \ndigital media products, and purchased unwittingly by consumers. Some \nconsumers have already become acquainted with DRM in the marketplace \nthis way. Less than 2 years ago music labels began selling copy-\nprotected CDs. Consumers came to find their CDs--that look just like \nthe CDs they have been purchasing for years--would not play on many \npersonal computers, and in some instances became lodged inside them. In \naddition, they could no longer make the legal practice of converting \nthem into digital MP3 files for use on portable MP3 players. More \nrecently, consumers purchasing the popular tax filing software, Turbo \nTax, came to realize they could only use the software on the first \ncomputer they downloaded it onto, never mind situations where they \ndesperately needed to complete their tax filings on a different \ncomputer. I have no doubt that came as a nice surprise to taxpayers \npressing to meet filing deadlines. It is my understanding that many \nconsumers are registering their view on this use of DRM by purchasing \ncompeting software not so limited.\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\n  When combined with government mandates requiring that all consumer \nappliances use or respond to specific DRM technologies and \ncapabilities, the potential for mass consumer confusion and disservice \nis clear. I introduce this legislation today, because DRM mandates \nsought by the major media companies are threatening to create just such \nan experience for consumers and the educational community. I can think \nof no greater threat to media and information diversity and competition \nthan large, vertically integrated media and Internet companies using \nDRM technology mandates to not only control distribution of content, \nbut also the ways in which that content is used by consumers in the \nprivacy of their homes, by teachers in our Nation's classrooms and \neducational institutions, and by all Americans in our libraries.\n  Last week, the Federal Communications Commission adopted regulations \napproving a private sector agreement between the cable TV industry and \nthe consumer electronics industry, called the Cable-CE ``Plug and \nPlay'' agreement. The Plug and Play agreement governs how consumer \nelectronics devices, information technology, and cable TV networks work \ntogether. Both the cable TV and CE industries should be commended for \nworking together to make digital TV sets ``cable ready,'' and speeding \nthe transition to digital television for consumers.\n  This private agreement includes digital rights management \nprovisions--called ``encoding rules--that are aimed at protecting cable \nTV programming from piracy, but in a manner that seeks to preserve the \ncustomary and legal uses of media by consumers and the educational \ncommunity to the greatest degree possible.\n  The agreement is technology neutral, in that new DRM content \nprotection technologies may be devised and deemed compliant with the \nsecurity protocols of the Plug and Play agreement. A proponent of a new \ncontent protection technology has a right to appeal to the FCC if Cable \nLabs rejects that technology, and the FCC will conduct a de novo review \nbased on objective criteria. Unfortunately, the Commission may take a \nvery different approach in protection broadcast digital television \nprogramming from piracy in its ``Broadcast Flag'' proceeding, as first \nproposed by the big media companies, and later joined by a very select \ngroup of electronics companies that own the patent in the one DRM \ntechnology, 5C approved for use in the proposal. The broadcast flag \nproposal requires every device that receives digital television content \nto recognize a ``flag'' that can be attached to DTV programming, and to \nrespond to the flag by encrypting the content using an ``authorized \ntechnology'' that would be expressly required by FCC regulation.\n\n  Unlike the Plug and plan agreement, the broadcast flag proposal makes \nit difficult for new DRM technologies to be deemed ``Broadcast Flag'' \ncompliant. The principal approval role for alternate DRM content \nprotection technologies is vested in several big media companies and \nsome of the narrow group of electronics companies owning the patent in \n5C. In the only circumstance under this proposal where the FCC would \nhave a role in approving a new technology, the baseline for FCC \nconsideration would be the preordained 5C technology and their \nassociated license terms. I hardly consider a proposal to be technology \nneutral when such important competitive determinations are placed in \nthe hands of invested stakeholders as gatekeepers. Such a proposal \ndeprives the market place of the very qualities the media companies \nneed to fight piracy: competition and innovation. I commend Intel, one \nof the 5C companies, for recognizing this grim reality and being bold \nenough to support a different course, as I will outline in a moment.\n  The important of technological neutrality in the Plug and Play \nagreement versus the tech mandate in the Broadcast Flag becomes very \nclear when you review the particular provisions of each agreement.\n  In today's world, a DRM technology does not seem to exist that can \nboth permit consumers to use the Internet to legally access content \nstored in their homes--on a home network for instance--while also \npreventing the unfettered Internet redistribution of such content. \nHowever, because the Cable-CE agreement envisions new DRM technologies, \nand make it possible for them to be approved for use with cable \nnetworks and CE devices, the potential for a new DRM technology that \ncan strike this important balance exists.\n  Since the Flag proposal is so closed off to new technologies, it is \nunlikely that it will evolve to permit point-to-point redistribution of \ndigital broadcast content over the Internet, for example, from one's \nhome to one's office or from a son or daughter to any elderly parent. \nFurthermore 5C is capable of completely locking down the ways consumers \nand the educational community can record or otherwise use DTV content. \nIt is no wonder then that the technical specifications for the actual \nFlag itself in major media's proposal provides for the possibility that \nit can be used to send new, more restrictive encoding rules to consumer \nelectronics devices that operate DTV content.\n  The Consumers, Schools, and Libraries Digital Rights Management \nAwareness Act of 2003 will ensure that anti-piracy policies for \nbroadcast DTV will provide maximum protections for industry, but in a \nmanner that relies on innovation, competition, and serving the \ninterests of consumers to achieve that goal.\n  First, the bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission from \nmoving forward with any new proceedings that impact the ways in which \nconsumers may access or distribute digital media products, aside from \nthe two previously mentioned proceedings. This will negate any future \nefforts by the big media companies to further expand the ways in which \nthey can control how content may be legally used.\n  Second, the bill sets ground rules for the FCC's broadcast flag \nproceeding. It permits the FCC, if it has such authority, to require \nconsumer electronics companies to detect a Broadcast Flag and prohibit \nillegal Internet retransmission of digital broadcast programming to the \npublic when it detects the flag. However, this proposal relies on a \nself-certification requirement, so consumer electronics and information \ntechnology companies can deploy competing and innovative DRMs that \nprohibit DTV piracy immediately, not subject to the whims of industry \ngatekeepers. Like the Plug and Play agreement this proposal provides a \nmeaningful role for the FCC, not industry stakeholders, to resolve any \ncontroversies that may arise with new technologies.\n  In addition to addressing the threat of FCC tech mandates in the \nbroadcast DTV space, this legislation also addresses other important \nconcerns regarding the introduction of DRM into the marketplace, to \nprevent some of the experiences of consumers with this important \ntechnology to date.\n  First, the bill provides on year for all stakeholders in the digital \nmedia marketplace to voluntarily devise a labeling regime for all DRM-\nenabled digital media products, including those made available solely \nonline, so consumers will know what they are buying when they but it.\n  Second, the bill prohibits the use of DRM technologies to prevent \nconsumers from reselling the used digital media products they no longer \nwant, or from donating used digital media products to schools and \nlibraries.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission--our Nation's \npremier consumer protection agency--to carefully monitor the \nintroduction of DRM into the marketplace, reporting to Congress in \nincidents of consumer confusion and dissatisfaction, and suggesting \nmeasures that can ease the impact DRM has on law abiding consumers.\n  The Senate has responded to what many view as the threat of \nincreasing consolidation in the media marketplace. If my colleagues are \nconcerned with consolidation in outlet ownership then I have no doubt \nthey will be equally concerned with Federally-mandated controls over \nhow consumers and the educational community may actually use \ninformation flowing through those outlets. Piracy Prevention is a goal \nwe can all work together to pursue. DRM-mandated business models, \nhowever, should not be the product of this Congress or any agency under \nour jurisdiction. The Federal Communications Commission seems to be \nmissing this point. I encourage all of my colleagues to work with me to \nput the\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\nbrakes on the FCC. Support the Consumers, Schools, and Libraries \nDigital Rights Management Awareness of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumers, Schools, and \n     Libraries Digital Rights Management Awareness Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is not in the interest of our nation's economy, \n     marketplace innovation, nor consumer or educational community \n     welfare for an agency of the Federal government to mandate \n     the inclusion of access or redistribution control \n     technologies used with digital media products into consumer \n     electronics products, computer products, or \n     telecommunications and advanced services network facilities \n     and services, except pursuant to a grant of specific and \n     clear authority from Congress to assure a result in its \n     regulations, and when the mandate is derived from voluntary \n     private-sector efforts that protect the legal, reasonable, \n     and customary practices of end-users.\n       (2) The limited introduction into commerce of access \n     controlled compact discs has caused some consumer, \n     educational institution, and library confusion and \n     inconvenience, and has placed increased burdens on retailers, \n     consumer electronics manufacturers, and personal computer \n     manufacturers responding to consumer, educational \n     institution, and library complaints.\n       (3) The private and public sectors should work together to \n     prevent future consumer, educational institution, library, \n     and industry confusion and inconvenience as legitimate access \n     and redistribution control technologies become increasingly \n     prevalent in the marketplace.\n       (4) The private sector should make every effort, in a \n     voluntary process, to provide for consumer, educational \n     institution, and library awareness and satisfaction as access \n     and redistribution control technology are increasingly \n     deployed in the marketplace.\n       (5) The Federal Trade Commission, in the absence of \n     successful private sector efforts, should ensure that \n     consumers, educational institutions, and libraries are \n     provided with adequate information with respect to the \n     existence of access and redistribution control technologies \n     in the digital media products they purchase, and how such \n     technologies may implicate their ability to use such \n     products.\n       (6) It is not in the interests of consumer welfare, \n     privacy, and safety, or for the continued development of the \n     Internet as a communications and economic resource, for the \n     manufacturers of digital media products or their \n     representatives to be permitted to require Internet access \n     service providers merely providing subscribers with transport \n     for electronic communications to disclose a subscriber's \n     personal information, absent due process and independent of \n     the judicial scrutiny required to ensure that such requests \n     are legitimate.\n       (7) The Federal Trade Commission should ensure that \n     consumers' welfare, privacy, and safety are protected in \n     regards to requests by manufacturers of digital media \n     products or their representatives for Internet service \n     provider disclosure of subscribers' personally identifiable \n     information outside of the judicial process.\n       (8) It is not in the interests of our nation's economy, \n     marketplace innovation, nor consumer, educational \n     institution, and library welfare to permit the advent of \n     access or redistribution control technologies to limit the \n     existence of legitimate secondary markets for digital media \n     products, a traditional form of commerce that is founded in \n     our nation's economic traditions, provides critical resources \n     for our nation's educational institutions and libraries, and \n     is otherwise consistent with applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON FCC TECHNOLOGY MANDATES.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a successful transition to digital television will \n     occur based on the mutual cooperation of all stakeholders, \n     and no one stakeholder's property interests outweigh \n     another's interests;\n       (2) the transition to digital television will be successful \n     to the degree it meets consumers' expectations based on the \n     ways they have come to expect to be able to receive and use \n     over-the-air television in the privacy of their own homes and \n     otherwise;\n       (3) digital convergence provides new tools for industry to \n     offer innovative and varied products compared to the \n     traditional analog marketplace, and it also provides. \n     consumers with innovative and varied means of using digital \n     content. In this respect, interoperability between digital \n     television products and digital cable systems remains an \n     important objective;\n       (4) a successful transition to digital television will \n     maintain this important balance of interests; and\n       (5) suggestions that consumers do not have certain \n     expectations in the digital marketplace simply because they \n     have never had access to a particular digital capability, or \n     the expectation of using or relying on such a capability, are \n     not dispositive of reasonable and customary consumer access \n     and use practices.\n       (b) Prohibition on Technology Mandates.--Except as \n     specifically authorized by Congress the Federal \n     Communications Commission may not require a person \n     manufacturing, importing into, offering for sale, license or \n     distribution in, or affecting, interstate commerce in the \n     United States a device, machine, or process that is designed, \n     manufactured, marketed for the purpose of, or that is capable \n     of rendering, processing, transmitting, receiving or \n     reproducing a digital media product--\n       (1) to incorporate access control technology, or the \n     ability to respond to such technology, into the design of \n     such a device, machine, or process; or\n       (2) to incorporate redistribution control technology, or \n     the ability to respond to such technology, into the design of \n     such a device, machine, or process.\n       (c) Effect on Pending FCC Rulemaking Proceedings.--\n       (1) Nothing herein shall prohibit or limit the Commission \n     from issuing the regulations proposed for adoption in the \n     ``cable plug and play'' proceeding in CS Docket No. 97-80 and \n     PP Docket No. 00-67.\n       (2) If the Commission determines that it has the authority \n     to issue regulations in MB Docket No. 02-230, it shall not be \n     barred by subsection (b) of this section from issuing such \n     regulations, provided, however, that such regulations shall--\n       (A) preserve reasonable and customary consumer, educational \n     institution, and library access and use practices;\n       (B) not include, directly or indirectly, any requirement \n     that a device, machine, or process designed, manufactured, \n     marketed for the purpose of, or that is capable of rendering, \n     processing, transmitting, receiving or reproducing a digital \n     media product, be manufactured using any particular \n     redistribution control technology or technologies, but only \n     may provide for establishment of objective standards to \n     achieve a functional requirement of preventing illegal \n     redistribution of digital terrestrial television broadcast \n     programming to the public over the Internet; and\n       (C) provide for manufacturer self-certification, to be \n     enforced exclusively by the Commission pursuant to its \n     existing enforcement authority, that a redistribution control \n     technology meets the requirements in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B) of this subsection and does not interfere with unrelated \n     distribution of content over the Internet.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONSUMER, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, AND LIBRARY \n                   AWARENESS.\n\n       (a) Consumer, Educational Institution, and Library Digital \n     Rights Management Awareness Advisory Committee.--The Federal \n     Trade Commission shall, as soon as practicable after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, establish an advisory committee for \n     the purpose of informing the Commission about the ways in \n     which access control technology and redistribution control \n     technology may affect consumer, educational institution, and \n     library use of digital media products based on their legal \n     and customary uses of such products, and how consumer, \n     educational institution, and library awareness about the \n     existence of such technologies in the digital media products \n     they purchase or otherwise come to legally own may be \n     achieved.\n       (b) Advisory Committee Requirements.--In establishing an \n     advisory committee for purposes of subsection (a) of this \n     section, the Commission shall--\n       (1) ensure that it includes representatives of radio and \n     television broadcasters, television programming producers, \n     producers of motion pictures, producers of sound recordings, \n     publishers of literary works, producers of video games, cable \n     operators, satellite operators, consumer electronics \n     manufacturers, computer manufacturers, any other appropriate \n     manufacturers of electronic devices capable of utilizing \n     digital media products, telecommunications service providers, \n     advanced service providers, Internet service providers, \n     consumer interest groups, representatives of educational \n     institutions, representatives of libraries, and other \n     interested individuals from the private sector, and is fairly \n     balanced in terms of political affiliation, the points of \n     view represented, and the functions to be performed by the \n     committee; and\n       (2) provide to the committee such staff and resources as \n     may be necessary to permit it to perform its functions \n     efficiently and promptly; and\n       (3) require the committee to submit a final report, \n     approved by a majority of members, of its recommendations \n     within one year after the date of the appointment of the \n     initial members.\n       (c) FTC Notice and Labeling.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (d)--\n       (1) no person shall offer for sale, license, or use by a \n     consumer, educational institution, or a library an access \n     controlled digital media product or a redistribution \n     controlled digital media product, unless that person has \n     provided clear and conspicuous notice or a label on the \n     product, at the point of sale or distribution to such \n     consumer, educational institution or library as prescribed by \n     the Federal Trade Commission, such that the notice or label \n     identifies any restrictions the access control technology or \n     redistribution control technology used in or with that \n     digital media product is intended or reasonably could be \n     foreseen to have on the consumers', educational \n     institutions', or libraries' use of the product; and\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\n       (2) this subsection shall not apply to a distributor or \n     vendor of a digital media product unless such distributor or \n     vendor has actual knowledge that the product contains or is \n     restricted by access control technology or redistribution \n     control technology and that the notice or label described in \n     this subsection is not visible to the consumer, educational \n     institution, or library at the point of distribution or \n     transmission.\n       (d) Applicability and Effective Date.--Subsection (c) shall \n     take effect 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act \n     unless the Commission determines, in consultation with the \n     advisory committee created in subsection (b) of this section, \n     that manufacturers of digital media products have, by such \n     date--\n       (1) established voluntary rules for notice and labeling of \n     access controlled or redistribution controlled digital media \n     products, including when both access control technology and \n     redistribution control technology are used in or with digital \n     media products, designed to create consumer, educational \n     institution, and library awareness about the ways in which \n     access control technology or redistribution control \n     technology will affect their legal, expected, and customary \n     uses of digital media products;

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to exempt \ncertain members of the Armed Forces from the requirement to pay \nsubsistence charges while hospitalized; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Senators Hagel, Clinton, Ben \nNelson, Murkowski, Dayton, Murray, Akaka, and I are introducing \nlegislation to help service members who are injured or become ill while \nserving in combat. Today, if one of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, or \nmarines fighting in Iraq or in Afghanistan are wounded or suffer an \nillness, they are evacuated to a military hospital. The problem is when \nthey are discharged from the hospital they are given a bill for the \nmeals they were served while being treated.\n  Under current law, service members are required to pay for their \nmeals at a rate of $8.10 per day while they are in a military hospital. \nFor example, a Marine Staff Sergeant recently spent 26 days in the \nhospital recovering from injuries endured when an Iraqi child dropped a \nhand grenade in the HUMVEE he was driving. Upon his discharge from the \nhospital, he was handed a bill for $243 for his meals. While eight \ndollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you or me, it is to a \nprivate who makes less than $14,000 a year. If we are looking to save \nmoney, we should not turn first to the pockets of our injured service \nmembers.\n  The bill we introduce today is simple. It will prohibit the \nDepartment of Defense from charging troops for meals when they are \nhospitalized as a result of either injury or illness while in combat or \ntraining for combat. This legislation shows strong support for our \nservice members currently in harm's way and helps to alleviate a \nfinancial burden on our injured soldiers.\n  This bill is similar to one filed by Congressman Bill Young in the \nHouse of Representatives, but also covers those who become ill while in \ncombat or training for combat. We already know that over 100 soldiers \ndeployed to the Persian Gulf region and Central Asia have contracted \npneumonia, 30 that become so ill that they had to be evacuated to \nhospitals in Europe or the United States. This situation highlights why \nwe must include those who suffer from illness as well as injury. I am \ngrateful to Congressman Young for his leadership on this issue and am \nhopeful we can work together to quickly pass legislation to end the \nunfair practice of charging our injured service members for hospital \nmeals.\n  The cost to the government for correcting this serious injustice is \nsignificant. This year, the Department of Defense has recouped only \n$1.5 million for hospital meals from hospitalized service members \nworld-wide. This legislation is even more limited in scope, as it only \napplies to those who become ill or injured during combat or situations \nsimulating combat. While I am cognizant of the budget constraints our \nmilitary is facing, this is a comparatively small expense that will \nmean a great deal to those service members affected.\n  Service members and military families are facing many challenges \nright now. They have to contend with long separations, potential \nfinancial hardships from extended Reserve and Guard call-ups, not to \nmention the very real fear of being wounded in combat. We should not \nadd to these burdens by charging them for their meals after a lengthy \nhospital stay for a combat-related condition.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and my colleagues in quickly moving \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the following \neditorial in support of ending this injustice from the Omaha World \nHerald, entitled ``Nickel and Diming the Troops'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES \n                   FROM REQUIREMENT TO PAY SUBSISTENCE CHARGES \n                   WHILE HOSPITALIZED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1075 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``When''; and\n       (2) by striking the second sentence and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to any of \n     the following:\n       ``(1) An enlisted member, or former enlisted member, of a \n     uniformed service who is entitled to retired or retainer pay \n     or equivalent pay.\n       ``(2) An officer or former officer of a uniformed service, \n     or an enlisted member or former enlisted member of a \n     uniformed service not described in paragraph (1), who is \n     hospitalized under section 1074 of this title because of an \n     injury or disease incurred (as determined under criteria \n     prescribed by the Secretary of Defense)--\n       ``(A) as a direct result of armed conflict;\n       ``(B) while engaged in hazardous service;\n       ``(C) in the performance of duty under conditions \n     simulating war; or\n       ``(D) through an instrumentality of war.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Section 1075(b) of title 10, United \n     States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall take effect on \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with \n     respect to injuries or diseases incurred on or after that \n     date.\n\n             [From the Omaha World Herald, Sept. 16, 2003]\n\n                      Nickel-and-Diming the Troops\n\n       It seems just plain mean-spirited to bill injured soldiers \n     for their food.\n       The U.S. government does, indeed, put a price on the \n     sacrifices of the men and women injured in military combat: \n     $8.10 per day.\n       That's the daily food allowance soldiers receive, which in \n     1981 Congress decided enlisted soldiers must repay to the \n     government when they're ``lucky'' enough to be hospitalized \n     and get free food.\n       It sounds like good fiscal sense in theory--until you \n     confront the reality of a Marine Corps reservist who lost \n     part of his foot in Iraq, unaware he'd get a $210.60 bill \n     upon discharge from the National Navy Medical Center in \n     Bethesda, Md. Or the many other soldiers like him, sometimes \n     hospitalized for long periods, sometimes handicapped for \n     life.\n       And the government is busy nickel-and-diming these heroes \n     amid a bureaucracy where a million dollars is penny-ante \n     change. (Once upon a time, it might have bought a hammer and \n     a toilet seat or two.)\n       Florida Rep. C.W. Bill Young, chairman of the House \n     Appropriations Committee, personally paid the tab for the \n     reservist hospitalized in Bethesda. His bill to correct the \n     inequity, introduced Sept. 3, already has 114 co-sponsors. It \n     seems likely to sail through Congress in the next few weeks.\n       Technically, the 1981 law does prevent ``double-dipping''--\n     paying the hospitalized soldiers the $8.10 food allowance and \n     feeding them, too. But the government already bends the rules \n     for soldiers in combat. Young's bill would extend that \n     exception to soldiers battling to recover from combat \n     injuries.\n       What a small price to pay for the men and women who paid so \n     much to protect this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11576-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11576-S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 226--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n  COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF JOSUE ORTA RIVERA V.

and\n       (8) rules for the global economy must be developed and \n     implemented democratically and with transparency and \n     accountability; and\n       Whereas many international trade and investment agreements \n     in existence and currently being negotiated do not serve \n     these interests, and have caused substantial harm to the \n     health and well-being of communities in the United States and \n     within countries that are trading partners of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That any agreement relating to trade and \n     investment that is negotiated by the executive branch with \n     other countries should comply with the following:\n       (1) Regarding investor and investment policy.--No such \n     agreement that includes provisions relating to foreign \n     investment may permit foreign investors to challenge or seek \n     compensation because of a measure of a government at the \n     national, State, or local level that protects the public \n     interest, including, but not limited to, public health, \n     safety, and welfare, the environment, and worker protections, \n     unless a foreign investor demonstrates that the measure was \n     enacted or applied primarily for the purpose of \n     discriminating against foreign investors or investments.\n       (2) Regarding services.--Any such agreement, to the extent \n     applicable, shall comply with the following:\n       (A)(i) The agreement may not discipline government measures \n     relating to--\n       (I) public services, including public services for which \n     the government is not the sole provider;\n       (II) services that require extensive regulation;\n       (III) essential human services; and\n       (IV) services that have an essentially social component.\n       (ii) The services described in subclauses (I) through (IV) \n     of clause (i) include, but are not limited to, public benefit \n     programs, health care, health insurance, public health, child \n     care, education and training, the distribution of controlled \n     substances and products, including alcohol and tobacco and \n     firearms, research and development on natural and social \n     sciences, utilities including energy utilities, water, waste \n     disposal and sanitation, national security, maritime, air, \n     surface, and other transportation services, postal services, \n     energy extraction and related services, and correctional \n     services.\n       (B) The agreement shall permit countries that have made \n     commitments in areas covered in subparagraph (A) to revise \n     those commitments for the purposes of public interest \n     regulation without financial or other trade-related \n     penalties.\n       (C) The agreement shall ensure that rules on subsidies and \n     government procurement fully protect the ability of \n     governments to support and purchase services in ways that \n     promote economic development, social justice and equity, \n     public health, environmental quality, and human and workers' \n     rights.\n       (D) The agreement shall make no new commitments on the \n     temporary entry of workers because such policies should be \n     determined by the Congress, after consideration by the \n     congressional committees with jurisdiction over immigration \n     to avoid an array of inconsistent policies and policies which \n     fail to--\n       (i) include labor market tests that ensure that the \n     employment of such temporary workers will not adversely \n     affect other similarly employed workers;\n       (ii) involve labor unions in the labor certification \n     process implemented under the immigration program for \n     temporary workers under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, including the filing by an \n     employer of an application under section 212(n)(1) of that \n     Act; and\n       (iii) guarantee the same workplace protections for \n     temporary workers that are available to all workers.\n       (E) The agreement shall guarantee that all governments that \n     are parties to the agreement can regulate foreign investors \n     in services and other service providers in order to protect \n     public health and safety, consumers, the environment, and \n     workers' rights, without requiring the governments to \n     establish their regulations to be the least burdensome option \n     for foreign service providers.\n       (3) Regarding policies to support american workers and \n     small, minority, and women-owned businesses.--Any such \n     agreement shall preserve the right of Federal, State, and \n     local governments to maintain or establish policies to \n     support American workers and small, minority, or women-owned \n     businesses, including, but not limited to, policies with \n     respect to government procurement, loans, and subsidies.\n       (4) Regarding environmental, labor, and other public \n     interest standards.--Any such agreement--\n       (A) may not supersede the rights and obligations of parties \n     under multilateral environmental, labor, and human rights \n     agreements; and\n       (B) shall, to the extent applicable, include commitments, \n     subject to binding enforcement on the same terms as \n     commercial provisions--\n       (i) to adhere to specified workers' rights and \n     environmental standards;\n       (ii) not to diminish or fail to enforce existing domestic \n     labor and environmental provisions; and\n       (iii) to abide by the core labor standards of the \n     International Labor Organization (ILO).\n       (5) Regarding united states trade laws.--No such agreement \n     may--\n       (A) contain a provision which modifies or amends, or \n     requires a modification of or an amendment to, any law of the \n     United States that provides to United States businesses or \n     workers safeguards from unfair foreign trade practices, \n     including any law providing for--\n       (i) the imposition of countervailing or antidumping duties;\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\n       (ii) protection from unfair methods of competition or \n     unfair acts in the importation of articles;\n       (iii) relief from injury caused by import competition;\n       (iv) relief from unfair trade practices; or\n       (v) the imposition of import restrictions to protect the \n     national security; or\n       (B) weaken the existing terms of the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994, or the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures, of the World Trade Organization, \n     including through the domestic implementation of rulings of \n     dispute settlement bodies.\n       (6) Regarding food safety.--No such agreement may--\n       (A) restrict the ability of the United States to ensure \n     that food products entering the United States are rigorously \n     inspected to establish that they meet all food safety \n     standards in the United States, including inspection \n     standards;\n       (B) force acceptance of different food safety standards as \n     ``equivalent'', or require international harmonization of \n     food safety standards, which undermine the level of human \n     health protection provided under domestic law; or\n       (C) restrict the ability of governments to enact policies \n     to guarantee the right of consumers to know where and how \n     their food is produced.\n       (7) Regarding agriculture and food security.--No such \n     agreement may, with respect to food and other agricultural \n     commodities--\n       (A) contain provisions that prevent countries from--\n       (i) establishing domestic and global reserves,\n       (ii) managing supply,\n       (iii) enforcing antidumping disciplines,\n       (iv) ensuring fair market prices, or\n       (v) vigorously enforcing antitrust laws,\n\n     in order to guarantee competitive markets for family farmers; \n     or\n       (B) prevent countries from developing the necessary \n     sanitary and phytosanitary standards to prevent the \n     introduction of pathogens or other potentially invasive \n     species which may adversely affect agriculture, human health, \n     or the environment.\n       (8) Regarding transparency.--(A) The process of negotiating \n     any such agreement must be open and transparent, including \n     through--\n       (i) prompt and regular disclosure of full negotiating \n     texts; and\n       (ii) prompt and regular disclosure of negotiating positions \n     of the United States.\n       (B) In negotiating any such agreement, any request or offer \n     relating to investment, procurement, or trade in services \n     must be made public within 10 days after its submission if \n     such request or offer--\n       (i) proposes specific Federal, State, and local laws and \n     regulations in the United States to be changed, eliminated, \n     or scheduled under such an agreement, including, but not \n     limited to, subsidies, tax rules, procurement rules, \n     professional standards, and rules on temporary entry of \n     persons;\n       (ii) proposes for coverage under such an agreement--\n       (I) specific essential public services, including, but not \n     limited to, public benefits programs, health care, education, \n     national security, sanitation, water, energy, and other \n     utilities; or\n       (II) private service sectors that require extensive \n     regulation or have an inherently social component, including, \n     but not limited to, maritime, air transport, trucking, and \n     other transportation services, postal services, utilities \n     such as water, energy, and sanitation, corrections, education \n     and childcare, and health care; or\n       (iii) proposes a discipline or process of general \n     application which may interfere with the ability of the \n     United States or State, local, or tribal governments to \n     adopt, implement, or enforce laws and regulations identified \n     in clause (i) or provide or regulate services identified in \n     clause (ii).\n       (C) The broad array of constituencies representing the \n     majority of the people of the United States, including labor \n     unions, environmental organizations, consumer groups, family \n     farm groups, public health advocates, faith-based \n     organizations, and civil rights groups, must have at least \n     the same representation on trade advisory committees and \n     access to trade negotiators and negotiating fora as those \n     constituencies representing commercial interests.\n       (D) Any dispute resolution mechanism established in any \n     such agreement must be open and transparent, including \n     through disclosure to the public of documents and access to \n     hearings, and must permit participation by nonparties through \n     the filing of amicus briefs, as well as provide for standing \n     for State and local governments as intervenors.\n       (9) Regarding governmental authority.--No such agreement \n     may contain provisions that bind national, State, local, or \n     comparable regional governments to limiting regulatory, \n     taxation, spending, or procurement authority without an \n     opportunity for public review and comment described in \n     paragraph (8), and without the explicit, informed consent of \n     the national, State, local, or comparable regional \n     legislative body concerned, through such means as is decided \n     by such legislative body.\n       (10) Regarding access to medicines and seeds.--(A) No such \n     agreement may contain provisions that prevent countries from \n     taking measures to protect public health by ensuring access \n     to medicines.\n       (B) No such agreement may constrain the rights of farmers \n     to save, use, exchange, or sell farm-saved seeds and other \n     publicly available seed varieties.\n       (11) Regarding developing countries.--Any such agreement \n     must grant special and differential treatment for developing \n     countries with regard to the timeframe for implementation of \n     the agreement as well as other concerns.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit legislation to \nestablish some minimum standards for the trade agreements into which \nour Nation enters. This measure is a companion to H. Con. Res. 276, a \nresolution introduced in the other body by my colleague from Ohio, (Mr. \nBrown).\n  The record of the major trade agreements into which our Nation has \nentered over the past few years has been dismal. Thanks in great part \nto the flawed fast track rules that govern consideration of legislation \nimplementing trade agreements, the United States has entered into a \nnumber of trade agreements that have contributed to the significant job \nloss we have seen in recent years, and have laid open to assault \nvarious laws and regulations established to protect workers, the \nenvironment, and our health and safety. Indeed, those agreements \nundermine the very democratic institutions through which we govern \nourselves.\n  The loss of jobs, especially manufacturing jobs, to other countries \nhas been devastating to Wisconsin, and to the entire country. When I \nopposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay round of \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations for China, and other flawed trade measures, I did so in great \npart because I believed they would lead to a significant loss of jobs. \nBut even as an opponent of those agreements, I don't think I could have \nimagined just how bad things would get in so short a time.\n  The trade policy of this country over the past several years has been \nappalling. The trade agreements into which we have entered have \ncontributed to the loss of key employers, ravaging entire communities. \nBut despite that clear evidence, we continue to see trade agreements \nbeing reached that will only aggravate this problem.\n  This has to stop. We cannot afford to pursue trade policies that gut \nour manufacturing sector and send good jobs overseas. We cannot afford \nto undermine the protections we have established for workers, the \nenvironment, and our public health and safety. And we cannot afford to \nsquander our democratic heritage by entering into trade agreements that \nsupercede our right to govern ourselves through open, democratic \ninstitutions.\n  The legislation I submit today sets forth principles for future trade \nagreements. It is a break with the so-called NAFTA model, and instead \nadvocates the kinds of sound trade policies that will spur economic \ngrowth and sustainable development.\n  The principles set forth in this resolution are not complex. They are \nstraightforward and achievable. The resolution calls for enforceable \nworker protections, including the core International Labor Organization \nstandards.\n  It preserves the ability of the United States to enact and enforce \nits own trade laws.\n  It protects foreign investors, but states that foreign investors \nshould not be provided with greater rights than those provided under \nU.S. law, and it protects public interest laws from challenge by \nforeign investors in secret tribunals.\n  It ensures that food entering into our country meets domestic food \nsafety standards.\n  It preserves the ability of Federal, State, and local governments to \nmaintain essential public services and to regulate private sector \nservices in the public interest.\n  It requires that trade agreements contain environmental provisions \nsubject to the same enforcement as commercial provisions.\n  It preserves the right of Federal, State, and local governments to \nuse procurement as a policy tool, including through Buy American laws, \nenvironmental laws such as recycled content, and purchasing preferences \nfor small, minority, or women-owned businesses.\n  It requires that trade negotiations and the implementation of trade \nagreements be conducted openly.\n  These are sensible policies. They are entirely consistent with the \ngoal of increased international commerce, and in fact they advance that \ngoal.\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\n  The outgrowth of the major trade agreements I referenced earlier has \nbeen a race to the bottom in labor standards, environmental standards, \nhealth and safety standards, in nearly every aspect of our economy. A \nrace to the bottom is a race in which even the winners lose.\n  We need to turn our trade policies around. We need to pursue trade \nagreements that will promote sustainable economic growth for our Nation \nand for our trading partners. The resolution I submit today will begin \nto put us on that path, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11579-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1659.

Mr. President, I understand that S. 1618, introduced \nearly today by Senator Rockefeller and others, is at the desk, and I \nask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the first \ntime.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1618) to reauthorize Federal Aviation \n     Administration Programs for the period beginning on October \n     1, 2003, and ending on March 31, 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I now ask for its second reading and object to my own \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill will remain at the desk and have its next reading on the \nnext legislative day.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the \nFederal Aviation Administration, FAA, and its core programs, including \nthe Airport Improvement Program, AIP, through March 31, 2004. While I \nwould like to have seen Congress pass a comprehensive multiyear bill, \nit is not going to be possible by the end of this fiscal year. We need \nto pass this noncontroversial short-term extension to allow the FAA to \ncontinue to operate its core safety and airport funding programs.\n  The Senate produced a very good FAA reauthorization bill, and I was \nproud to help in developing that legislation. Unfortunately, the final \nproduct after negotiations with the House of Representatives was not as \ngood as the Senate-passed bill. It included several dangerous \nprovisions that I could not support, and, in fact, many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have raised objections to this \nlegislation.\n  The most significant reason that the multiyear FAA bill is stalled is \nbecause the conference report includes language that allows as large \npart of the Nation's air traffic control system to be contracted out to \nprivate operators. If adopted, the conference report would allow the \nFAA to initiate the process of contracting out of some air traffic \ncontrol functions immediately while only delaying the potential \nprivatization for the 4-year life of the bill. The\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\nSenate during its consideration of the FAA bill voted 56 to 41 to keep \nall air traffic control functions as a governmental responsibility out \nof a deep sense that the safety of our skies is a basic governmental \nfunction. A bipartisan majority of Senators expressed serious concerns \nover the executive branch's future plans for the management of the air \ntraffic control system, and we voted to impose restrictions on the \nAdministration's proposal precisely to avoid the very outcome of the \nconference report.\n  Instead of negotiating in good faith over how best to guarantee the \nsafety of our Nation's air traffic control system, the majority acceded \nto the administration's demands that they be given absolute discretion \nover the future of aviation safety. My short-term reauthorization bill \nincludes language that enhances the safety of our Nation's air traffic \ncontrol while giving the executive branch an appropriate level of \nflexibility to manage the system. The United States operates the most \ncomplex aviation system in the world, and we must have in place a \ndynamic and responsive safety system. I, along with my colleagues, want \nto continue to work with the administration on making our aviation \nsystem the safest, most secure, and advanced in the world.\n  This legislation reauthorizes funding for FAA programs and \noperations. Importantly, the bill reauthorizes the AIP program, which \nwill allow the Federal Government to maintain its investment in airport \ninfrastructure. Small airports are especially dependent on AIP funding \nto fund capital improvement projects. In addition, the bill includes \nprovisions that reduce small airports share of AIP projects to 5 \npercent. The bill also allows small airports to maintain their \neligibility for AIP entitlement funds if decreased traffic due to \nSeptember 11 resulted in these airports falling below FAA-required \npassenger benchmarks.\n  Congress should not hold up these critical funds over disagreements \non unrelated issues. Broad consensus exists on the need for increased \naviation funding. This bill will provide approximately $1.7 billion in \nAIP funds, which on an annualized basis would boost AIP funding by $100 \nmillion over last year's level.\n  To make sure small communities continue to be linked to the Nation's \naviation network, the bill also reauthorizes the Essential Air Service \nProgram, EAS, and Small Community Air Service Development Program. The \nEAS program is a lifeline to our smallest and most isolated \ncommunities. The Small Community Air Service Development Program has \nhelped dozens of communities across the country expands their air \nservice options.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes new security initiatives. Although we \nhave made dramatic improvements in aviation security over the last 20 \nmonths, improving aviation security is a continuous process. This bill \nis another step in this process. The bill addresses the development and \nimplementation of the Computer Assisted Passenger Profiling Program, \nCAPPS, II, which many Senators are deeply concerned infringes on civil \nliberties. My legislation imposes a variety of safeguards to protect \ncitizens' privacy as CAPPS II is deployed.\n  This bill does not have everything I worked hard to include in the \nSenate's multiyear FAA reauthorization. As I stated, the Senate-passed \nbill was the result of hard work, compromise, and a commitment to \nimproving the Nation's aviation system. I believe with a little more \ntime, we can find a compromise on the issues holding up the multiyear \nbill, but in the meantime, the Senate should adopt this short-term \nreauthorization to preserve the integrity of the aviation system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/16/senate-section/article/S11588-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2003\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
