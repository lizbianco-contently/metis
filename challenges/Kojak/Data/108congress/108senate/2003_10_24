I further ask unanimous consent \nthat other than the offering of a substitute, the bill be open for \ndebate only during today's session.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. With this agreement in place, the two managers will be \nhere at approximately 10 this morning to begin debate on this \nappropriations measure. There will be no rollcall votes during today's \nsession. As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed on the nomination of \nMichael Leavett to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. That vote will occur at 5:30 on Monday. In addition to that \nvote on Monday, I would expect consideration of amendments to the \nforeign operations bill. I will have more to say on that later, after I \nhave consulted with the manager of that bill, the distinguished \nmajority whip.\n  I have also repeated our desire to complete a number of other \nimportant issues as we press on during these final weeks. The objection \nto begin consideration of the fair credit reporting bill was removed \nand we reached a consent to be able to proceed to that measure. \nUnfortunately, we have been unable to reach a consent for the \nconsideration of the Healthy Forests legislation, but we will continue \nto work on and for that agreement.\n  The CARE Act continues to be held up from proceeding to conference.\n  The deadline for action on the Internet tax moratorium is fast \napproaching and we really need to expedite that bill.\n  I mentioned the other day the importance of the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce In Arms Act. This bill has over 54 cosponsors and should be \nconsidered by the Senate before we adjourn.\n  Nominations, in particular judicial nominations--those nominations \nwhich have been held up--do demand our attention and should be given \ntheir due process on the floor of the Senate.\n  I mention all of these items while we continue the ongoing \nappropriations process. There is much work to do and little time in \nwhich to do it. Thus, we must make very efficient use of the Senate's \ntime. I hope Members will help the leadership on both sides of the \naisle as we go forward and schedule these remaining weeks. These \nindividual pieces of legislation, as well as the appropriations bills, \nas well as those bills that are in conference, must get done before we \ndepart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13187-7", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1781\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I take just a couple of moments to comment \non some of the activities in Iraq, especially in light of the donor \nconference that is underway as we speak. We know it is very important \nfor the world to have a clear picture of the progress that is being \nmade in Iraq today. My comments will really center, again very briefly, \non that.\n  Not very many Americans have heard of Karada Street, I would wager. \nKarada Street is Baghdad's busiest commercial avenue, and something \ntruly remarkable is happening there. Iraqis for the first time are \nenjoying the fruits of economic freedom. Not\n\n[[Page S13188]]\n\neven a bomb blast at the Baghdad Hotel just a few blocks away from this \nnow very busy commercial strip has dampened the growing activity. A \nnumber of our colleagues have traveled and are continuing to travel to \nIraq, and they come back with those encouraging reports that we are \njust beginning to hear about these days.\n  Recently, ABC News reported that at one computer and data system \ncompany, trade is up 70 percent since sanctions were lifted in May. At \nthe Al Farah used car lot, a 9-year-old Jeep sells for $1,000 less \ntoday than when Saddam was in power. Meanwhile, government workers at a \nKarada Street match factory have seen their salaries soar fivefold. The \nmanager tells the news agency, ``Now my salary is much better . . . I \ncan buy anything I want now.''\n  There is much more. Portable generators are selling at discounted \nprices. Why? Because electricity has become more reliable. Indeed, \nwashing machine and air-conditioner sales are brisk. In a particularly \nvivid example of how things have changed since the fall of Saddam, a \nlocal ice cream shop that used to serve almost exclusively Saddam's \ncircle is now open to any local resident who comes in for that cold \ntreat.\n\n  All of these stories are out there and they all point to the \ndramatic, remarkable changes that are underway that are associated with \ntasting freedom for the first time in decades.\n  One of the freedoms Iraqis have been most enthusiastic to exercise is \nthe freedom to express their views. Pollsters for a new Gallup poll \nreported last week that Iraqis were pleading to share their opinions, \nand almost every Iraqi asked to participate in the survey volunteered \nto do so. Gallup's director of international polling told reporters \nthat once they started talking, the Iraqis ``went on and on.''\n  It is not hard to imagine the exhilaration they must feel today, how \ntheir hearts must swell with the realization that they, for the first \ntime in decades, are truly free--free from tyranny, free from torture, \nfree from persecution, free to speak their minds and create a \ngovernment of their own devising, for the people and by the people.\n  For the first time in a generation, the Iraqi people live free of the \ntyranny of Saddam Hussein. They have begun to develop democratic \ninstitutions of government. They are pursuing economic policies on \ntrade and investment that are more liberal than any other country in \nthe region. The Iraqi people have begun replacing that old Saddam \ncurrency with the new, unified dinar. They will have in their wallets a \npowerful symbol of their liberation, money to save or to spend as they \nchoose, without Saddam's face mocking their hopes.\n  The Gallup poll I mentioned just a few minutes ago found that, even \nin Baghdad, the Iraqis want us to stay that course. That is because the \nIraqis now have an opportunity, as do we, to change the course of \nhistory and bring peace and stability to the heart of the Middle East.\n  For the sake of Iraq, for the sake of America, we must continue to \nfight for freedom. Our Declaration of Independence tells us that all \nmen are created equal. Now, in Iraq, we have the opportunity to once \nagain realize that essential truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13188-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

OBERLEITNER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this past May, I came to the Senate Floor \nto commemorate the 58th Anniversary of the end of World War II in \nEurope. I had been asked by the surviving members of an Army Company--\nCompany K of the 409th Regiment of the 103rd Infantry Division--to fly \na flag over our U.S. Capitol building in honor of those in the company \nwho died on the field of battle--those who did not return home--those \nwho Bill Gleason, a Private in K Company, described this way:\n\n       Some in our Company were denied the chance to reach old \n     age. They didn't make it to adulthood. They never were old \n     enough to vote in an election. They died then--there in \n     France or Germany. . . . They are frozen in time as they \n     were--forever youthful.\n\n  I have again flown flags over our U.S. Capitol and am here today on \nthe Floor of the United States Senate to pay tribute to another \nsoldier--another soldier who did not make it home--another soldier who \nwill remain forever youthful.\n  Private First Class Branden F. Oberleitner was born on June 18, 1982, \nin Columbus, OH. He grew up in nearby Worthington, OH, and graduated \nfrom Thomas Worthington High School in 2001, just two short years ago. \nHe was a beloved member of his class.\n  As a kid growing up, many of his friends and family described Branden \nas ``ornery''--as an independent kid who liked to do things his own \nway. He didn't feel a need to ``follow the crowd.'' He enjoyed looking \nfor crabs with his friends and taking trips to Kentucky to explore in \nsome of the local caves.\n  Branden valued friendship. Once you were Branden's friend, you were \nalways his friend.\n  He was loyal.\n  Branden had an innate ability to fix things. He could intuitively \nfind solutions to problems. Branden was a gifted mechanic and loved to \nwork on cars--especially the 1988 Delta Oldsmobile that seemed to \noccupy a permanent place in the family driveway. Branden's friend and \nclassmate, Tyler Louk, remembers him elbow-deep in grease working on \nthat car night after night after night.\n  Branden dreamed of opening a bike shop someday with one of his \nfriends. They were going to fix Harley's.\n  During high school, Branden started taking firefighting classes at \nthe Delaware Area Career Center. He met a man there named Keith Luce, a \nretired firefighter and now a firefighter and EMT trainer, who had been \nan airborne trooper in Vietnam. Keith became an important role model, \nmentor, and trusted friend. The two developed a tight bond. They had a \ngreat deal in common and just seemed to speak the same language. \nBranden looked up to Keith--he respected him.\n  With Keith's support and encouragement, Branden thrived in his \nfirefighter training courses. He took to it. He was adept at it. He had \nfound something that really interested him and something that he was \ngood at and enjoyed--something he could make a career out of when he \nwas finished with high school.\n  Branden's life was taking on whole new dimensions. He was becoming a \ngrounded, disciplined young man, who learned to take time to think \nthings through.\n  He became focused and developed a sense of responsibility for himself \nand an appreciation for the needs of others. He wanted to make \nsomething of his life--he wanted to help others--he wanted to be of \nservice to others.\n  The tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, brought further \nclarity to Branden's life and his plans for the future. Angered by the \nvicious attacks and compelled to protect others from future terrorist \nstrikes, Branden enlisted in the United States Army. He joined B \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne \nAssault Division, based out of Fort Campbell, KY.\n  The call to arms resonated with Branden. ``That's all he wanted to \ndo,'' said friend Kevin Earhart, who worked with Branden at a local gas \nstation before he enlisted. Military service became his passion. He was \na good soldier--regimented and resolute. He quickly earned the respect \nof his unit. Known as ``Obie,'' Branden served as an infantryman and \nback-up medic, where he was regarded as being both tactically and \ntechnically proficient. All in his unit endorsed his application for \nOfficer Candidate School. His Captain, William Riley, described him as \n``a shining example of what a soldier\n\n[[Page S13189]]\n\nshould be.'' Family friend, William Owen described him as ``a model \nsoldier--a soldier others could count on, turn to, and laugh with.''\n  This model soldier lost his life on June 5, 2003, when a rifle-\npropelled grenade hit his Humvee near the Sunni city of Fallujah, about \n30 miles west of Baghdad. Branden and the rest of his Division were \nworking to ensure the safety of U.S. peacekeeping forces on the ground \nin Iraq.\n  He was 20 years old.\n  As William Owen said at Branden's memorial service, ``He has a Bronze \nStar, a Purple Heart, and the appreciation of all of us because he \nshowed that Americans are not selfish, but selfless.''\n  Branden Oberleitner was indeed selfless.\n  He defines honor.\n  He defines bravery.\n  He defines love of country.\n  As his father, Freeman Carmack said:\n\n       It was my honor to have watched him grow into the man he \n     became: A loving brother, son, and proud member of the 101st \n     Airborne Assault.\n\n  Branden Oberleitner grabbed a lot out of life in an all too short \namount of time.\n  He lived life well. He it lived deeply. He lived it fully.\n  My thoughts and prayers remain with Branden's family--his mother, \nwith whom he was especially close, Iris Oberleitner; his father \nFreeman; brothers Lawrence and Andrew; sister Grace; grandparents Mr. \nand Mrs. Frank Carmack; and grandmother Dora Fassler.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are we now moving, under a previous \norder, to the Foreign Operations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a substitute amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1965.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and considered as original text for the purposes \nof further amendment; further, that no points of order be waived by \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1965) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my friend from Vermont and I come to \nfloor today hoping we can dispose of the Foreign Operations bill in \nshort order. That short order will not be today, but we believe we will \nhave a limited number of amendments and, hopefully, an opportunity to \nwrap this bill up within a day or so--Monday or Tuesday.\n  Our respective staffs have been burning the midnight oil reviewing \nthe amendments that we are aware of, and I strongly encourage all \nSenators to offer their amendments on Monday so we can wrap this bill \nup as quickly as possible.\n  Let me just say a very few words about the measure before us.\n  While the Senate's allocation is $796 million below the President's \nrequest, it is also $970 million above the House of Representatives. \nUnfortunately, our conference allocation will be closer to the House \nlevel, which will make conferencing the bill that much more of a \nchallenge.\n  This measure provides nearly $1.4 billion for the President's new \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria initiative for those programs under \nthe subcommittee's jurisdiction, which is $10 million above that \nrequest.\n  Up to $250 million is available for a contribution to the global \nfund, and $150 million is provided for the President's International \nMother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. This amount includes $700 \nmillion for the Global AIDS Initiative.\n  It provides $1 billion for the Millennium Challenge assistance, which \nis $300 million below the request, and $100 million for the famine \nfund.\n  The bill fully funds the request for numerous accounts, including \ninternational disaster assistance; transition initiatives; \ninternational narcotics control and law enforcement; migration and \nrefugee assistance; nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining and \nrelated programs; international military education and training; and \ninternational organizations and programs.\n  The bill provides increased funding for the Child Survival and Health \nPrograms Fund, development assistance, assistance for Eastern Europe \nand the Baltic States, and assistance for the independent states of the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  Given the $796 million cut we had to make, this bill is below the \nrequest in the Economic Support Fund, Andean Counterdrug Initiative, \nPeace Corps, debt restructuring, foreign military financing, \npeacekeeping operations, and international financial institution \naccounts--all of those below the request. Most of those accounts are \nstill funded, however, at or above their respective fiscal year 2003 \nlevels.\n  Despite the cuts in the ESF and FMF accounts, full funding for \nIsrael, Egypt, and Jordan is provided.\n  Let me say a word or two about the ACI and the Peace Corps. While ACI \nis funded at $660 million, we provide authority to transfer $37 million \nfrom the international narcotics account, resulting in a funding level \nthat is equal to last year's. For the Peace Corps, we provide $310 \nmillion and authority to transfer $20 million from the Global AIDS \nInitiative to the Peace Corps for their HIV/AIDS activities abroad. \nThis results in a funding level that is $29 million below the request.\n  Let me close by thanking my good friend from Vermont for his input to \nthis bill. I know he does not agree with everything in it. Frankly, I \ndon't either. But we have worked hard to craft a bill born of \ncompromise. I thank him for the cooperation and courtesy he continues \nto extend as the ranking member of this subcommittee.\n  With that, Mr. President, once again let me say we hope to pass this \nbill very shortly after Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, for his comments. I agree with him; I hope if people \nhave amendments they will let us know right away. We will, of course, \nhave the usual managers' package.\n  Like most appropriations bills, this is a work of compromise. My \nfriend from Kentucky and I have worked together for many years. \nSometimes he is the chairman, and sometimes I am. We find common ground \nand we write bipartisan bills, which is the tradition of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I thank Chairman McConnell and his staff for working so cooperatively \nwith me and my staff on this bill, and I urge all Members to support \nit.\n  I also thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd for the allocation \nthat was given to us. While it falls short of the President's budget \nrequest, I know they did well by us under the circumstances.\n  Since the Senator from Kentucky has done a good job in summarizing \nthe\n\n[[Page S13190]]\n\nbill, I want to mention a few highlights.\n  First, it adds $23 million for child survival and health programs. \nThese are the programs that provide lifesaving vaccines for diseases \nlike polio and measles--diseases that we hardly ever see in this \ncountry but which kill or cripple millions overseas.\n  These programs help stop the spread of viruses like Ebola and SARS, \nreduce needless pregnancy-related deaths, and provide aid to blind \nchildren and orphans.\n  Second, the bill increases funding for development assistance by $78 \nmillion. These funds pay for everything from education, to agriculture \nresearch, to democracy building. This is the core of our foreign aid \nbudget. The bill adds $20 million for Eastern Europe and the former \nSoviet Union. Both Senator McConnell and I feel strongly that the \nadministration is reducing assistance to these regions too quickly.\n  The bill includes a very important provision to ensure greater \ntransparency and accountability at the multilateral development banks.\n  As in the past, there are provisions which seek to promote human \nrights and the rule of law in Serbia, Central Asia, Latin America, and \nelsewhere.\n  I am concerned that much of the good work that Senator McConnell has \ndone on this bill could be undone by our conference allocation.\n  Even a split with the House allocation, which is $17.1 billion, would \nlead to deep cuts in many programs that are important to the President \nand important to Senators.\n  Earlier this week, the memo from Secretary Rumsfeld reminded us all \nof the importance of foreign aid in combating terrorism.\n  In that memo he wrote:\n\n       Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more \n     terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical \n     clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?\n\n  I suspect the answer to that question is no, and that should deeply \nconcern each one of us.\n  Let me mention one example. In this bill we fund children's basic \neducation. We use these funds to build schools and train teachers in \ncountries such as Pakistan and Indonesia, to counter the influence of \nthe madrassas.\n  One would think that a wealthy Nation like ours would spend billions \non education, especially in Muslim countries. It is in our self-\ninterest. But we could only provide $220 million in this bill for \neducation, which is a mere $2 million above last year's level. It is \nalso far less than most U.S. States spend, yet it is what we spend for \nthe whole world.\n  There are many other examples of how this budget falls far short of \nwhat we should be doing to combat poverty and counter the influence of \nanti-American extremism.\n  Last wee, we passed a supplemental appropriations for Iraq. It \nincluded more than $20 billion for reconstruction in that one country.\n  That is more than this entire foreign operations bill provides for \nthe rest of the world.\n  If we are serious about building better relations with the Muslim \nworld, and overcoming the hatred that is growing among the masses of \nimpoverished people in those countries, we need to put our money where \nour mouths are.\n  The President's budget request for foreign operation is $18.8 \nbillion. This bill contains $18.2 billion.\n  We have heard that our conference allocation may require us to cut \nhundreds of millions of dollars out of this bill.\n  If the President cares about this budget, he need to act now to \nprotect it in conference. He needs to pick up the phone and call the \nRepublican leadership in the House and Senate.\n  Without his help, deep cuts will be made to these programs. These \ncuts will not just hurt people overseas. They will hurt the United \nStates.\n  I want to briefly mention the issue of AIDS. Chairman McConnell and I \ndid the best we could to increase funding for HIV/AIDS in this bill, \nbut we simply did not have enough to get to the level that many \nSenators wanted.\n  We have to do more. This is the worst public health crisis in \nhistory. There will be an amendment on this issue later, and I will \nhave more to say on it then.\n  Again, I wish all my jobs and assignments in the Senate were as easy \nas working with the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky who is a \nclose personal friend. While we come from different political \nphilosophies, we join together in what we believe is in the best \ninterests of the United States in this area.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I checked with the Democratic side. \nThey have no objection to Senator DeWine being able to send an \namendment to the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeWine be permitted to send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1966\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Warner, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, and \n     Mr. Graham of South Carolina, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1966.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To increase asistance to combat HIV/AIDS)\n\n       Insert where appropriate:\n\n\n                         global aids assistance\n\n       Sec.--.For an additional amount for ``Global AIDS \n     Initiative'', $289,000,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2006, for programs for the prevention, \n     treatment, and control of, and research on, HIV/AIDS, \n     tuberculosis, and malaria, which may include additional \n     contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this morning, along with my friends \nand colleagues, Senators Durbin, Coleman, Warner, Daschle, Leahy, and \nGraham of South Carolina, to offer an amendment that would increase \nthis bill's current funding level for the global AIDS initiative by \n$289 million. This additional funding would bring the total fiscal year \n2004 allocation to $2.4 billion. This $2.4 billion would allow us to \nmeet our goal of providing at least $2 billion in bilateral aid, and it \nwould also allow us to meet our current matching commitment to the \nGlobal Fund. This money in this amendment would be distributed by the \nnew AIDS coordinator, Randall Tobias, for the prevention, treatment, \ncontrol of, and research on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  Mr. President, this clearly is the right thing to do. It is the right \nthing to do because AIDS is wiping out entire communities and, yes, we \ncan truly say that AIDS has the potential to wipe out entire countries. \nIt is the right thing to do because at least 8,000 people every single \nday--mothers, fathers, children, babies--are dying. And millions of \nothers who are not on treatment, drugs, are suffering the painful \neffects of this disease.\n  It is the right thing to do because we, thank heavens, because of \ngreat medical science and research, now have the ability and the \nresources to fight HIV/AIDS. We need to do it, we cannot delay, and we \nmust act.\n  We should be judged not just by what we do in society; I believe we \nshould also be judged by what we don't do. We should be judged by what \nwe are willing to tolerate. I say to my friends and colleagues in the \nSenate that we cannot tolerate inaction; we cannot, as a good and moral \nsociety, as a moral people, tolerate inaction. We, who have the ability \nto do something about this horrible crisis in the world today, must \nact.\n  With this amendment, we will be able to do so much good. So I say to \nmy colleagues that we should not and we must not tolerate a world where \nso many people are suffering from HIV/AIDS. We must not tolerate a \nworld where the suffering and dying occurs and we have the ability and \nthe tools\n\n[[Page S13191]]\n\nto help make a difference and to save lives.\n  As we have discussed on the Senate floor before--and so many of my \ncolleagues have talked about it--time is not on our side. People \nworldwide are dying this very moment. I have seen firsthand the \ndevastation of HIV/AIDS. I know my colleague in the chair has, and I \nknow so many of my other colleagues have as well.\n  My wife Fran and I have traveled to a number of the 14 countries that \nPresident Bush has named to be the primary recipients of the global \nHIV/AIDS fund money. I know many of my colleagues, such as majority \nleader Bill Frist, Senators Durbin, Chafee, Coleman, Enzi, Nelson, \nWarner, Alexander, and so many others, have also witnessed firsthand \nthe effects of AIDS in these nations. I have seen it in Haiti many \ntimes. I have also seen it in Guyana, Mozambique, Botswana, South \nAfrica, Namibia. I have held in my arms babies who were dying of the \ndisease. I have met mothers who have lost their children through AIDS, \nand I have met children who have lost their parents to AIDS. When you \ndo this, as other Members know, you then can put a face on it. It is no \nlonger just statistics; it is real people.\n  When you come back home from those trips, you continue to see in your \nmind's eye those faces, and you see those children, and some of those \nchildren, after you get back home, in a few days or weeks are no longer \non this Earth. When you put a face on it and you put names to this \ndisease, the moral imperative in fighting it becomes very clear.\n\n  There are things we can do right now, at this very moment, to fight \nHIV/AIDS. Fighting this global AIDS crisis cannot be business as usual, \nand it cannot be bureaucracy as usual. We cannot treat this crisis the \nsame way we have other problems. This is an emergency.\n  Truly, if there is anything that comes before us today on the Senate \nfloor, this is an emergency. We don't have the luxury of time, as \nPresident Bush has said so eloquently. For each moment we delay, people \ndie, and they die every moment.\n  In our travels, Fran and I have seen groups, organizations, and \nindividuals who are ready now to receive our money and our assistance, \nand that is the good news for us. There are people out there ready to \ngo to work and who are working now--organizations, doctors, and nurses \nwho have the ability to take the resources we can give them and get the \njob done. They are ready to go into action to deal with the HIV/AIDS \nproblem. It is heartwarming to see them and talk with them because they \nare already doing such good work. They have proven track records. They \nare ready to go, and we just need to get them the money and allow them \nto get about the business of saving lives.\n  As we do fight this disease, we cannot be timid. We cannot be afraid \nof failure. We need to take some chances. In doing so, the reality is \nthat there are going to be some mistakes made. This is a very big \nundertaking. No one has ever tried to do what we are doing in the \nworld. The truth is, the world has not faced such a crisis. We probably \nhave to go back in history to the bubonic plague or something in the \nMedieval period to see the world face such a medical crisis. The good \nnews is, unlike those times, we have the ability to do something about \nit.\n  There will be some failures and there will be some foul-ups, but the \nfear of failure must not hold us back. We must move forward because \nlives are at stake.\n  There are several actions we can take now because we know they work. \nWe talked about this on the Senate floor, but it is such a wonderful \nissue to talk about and such a wonderful thing to see in action, as I \nknow the Chair and other Members have. We have the ability today to \nprovide an HIV-positive pregnant woman with the care and drugs to \nensure that she will not give birth to a child who is also HIV \npositive.\n  The statistics are very simple, the facts are very simple, and the \nremedy is so simple. If a woman today is pregnant and she is HIV \npositive, the odds are 30 percent she will give birth to a child who is \nHIV positive. In sub-Saharan Africa or in Haiti or in Guyana, there are \nprograms today that will reduce those odds from 30 percent to 10 \npercent or as low as 5 percent or 4 percent. They can do that for as \nlittle as $3 or $4. I am not saying $3 or $4 a day, I am talking about \nthe total cost of $3 or $4. That is phenomenal. For as little as $3 or \n$4 and for a little treatment and a little expertise and getting that \nmother in for treatment, we can save a child from being born HIV \npositive. We can save a child from being condemned to die a very tough \nand horrible death. We can do it. It is a miracle. So we must act.\n  These are some of the simple activities we can do, and do now, so \nlong as the resources are available. This amendment will mean more \npeople can be saved. It is as simple as that. More people will be saved \nby this amendment. In targeting health investments to fight HIV/AIDS, \nwe can save lives. It is that simple. This amendment is an appropriate \nstep, and I ask my colleagues for their support.\n\n  We will have the opportunity next week to further debate this \namendment. As I conclude, I wish to thank all the cosponsors of this \namendment. I thank Senator Bill Frist who led our trip to Africa in \nAugust, which I think helped all of us fully understand not only the \ngravity of this crisis, but also it helped open our eyes to how many \ngroups are out there, how many doctors are out there who have the \nability to deliver the services and with whom we can work in the months \nahead.\n  Yes, it is going to be tough. Yes, it is going to be difficult. We \nknow the problems. We saw those problems. But it also showed us good \npeople are out there, organizations are out there, and it showed us \nthere is a path to get this work done.\n  I thank Majority Leader Frist for taking a number of Senators with \nhim to Africa and helping educate all of us. In this work against AIDS, \nhe is a medical doctor who truly understands this disease.\n  I also thank Senator Rick Santorum. Senator Santorum has been a true \nadvocate of trying to increase the dollars we are spending on this AIDS \ninitiative. It was his idea to come up with these dollar figures, to \nincrease this bilateral support. He worked these numbers and worked \nthese numbers. He and I have talked now for the last month, going back \nand forth. I thank him for his commitment, for his passion, and his \nwork in this area. We would not be where we are today without Senator \nRick Santorum.\n  Finally, I thank my colleague, Senator Dick Durbin, who could not be \non the Senate floor today but who will be back Monday. I talked with \nhim just a few moments ago by phone. He is someone who cares very \npassionately. Senator Durbin and I have offered two other amendments on \nthe Senate floor in the past, both of which we have been able to adopt, \nand we have seen them make a difference.\n  I traveled with Senator Durbin to Haiti. We worked on these problems \nin the past. He also cares passionately about this issue. He is someone \nwho is very results oriented and someone who has made a difference in \nthis field. I thank Senator Durbin for his commitment to the children \nand his commitment to this issue.\n  I conclude by thanking my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator \nLeahy, for bringing a very good bill to the floor. This is a bill that \na lot of people do not pay attention to, but it is a bill that does a \ntremendous amount of good around the world. It is an instrument of \nforeign policy, which is very important, but it is also a bill that \nsaves lives every year, and it is a bill that spends U.S. money well to \nhelp our commitment to the children of the world, as well as making \nsure the United States is well represented around the world. I thank \nSenator McConnell and Senator Leahy for working in a bipartisan way to \nbring this bill to the Senate floor.\n  We will be back in the Chamber next week to talk further about this \namendment. I thank my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwish to express my admiration to the Senator from Ohio for his passion \nand leadership on this issue, what is clearly the most important public \nhealth issue in the world today.\n  I listened carefully to his speech. It was quite moving, and I thank \nhim for\n\n[[Page S13192]]\n\nwhat he is doing in this area. It is extremely important to the world.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n            International Fund for Agricultural Development\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations \nbill includes $15,004,000 for a U.S. contribution to the International \nFund for Agricultural Development, IFAD. Congress has been a strong \nsupporter for IFAD since its inception, and these funds will enable \nIFAD to continue to expand its programs in the poorest countries.\n  Unfortunately, the Appropriations Committee report accompanying the \nbill neglected to address a concern which I suspect is shared by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who support IFAD. IFAD is the \nseventh largest multilateral contributor to the enhanced Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, HIPC DI. However, IFAD still \ndoes not have access to the core resources of the companion HIPC DI \nTrust Fund. Currently, IFAD has to absorb 87.2 percent of the cost for \nparticipating in HIPC DI, while other multilateral development banks \nwith full access absorb much smaller percentages. For this reason, I \nurge the administration to work with other donors to enable IFAD to \ngain access to the core resources of the HIPC Trust Fund.\n\n\n            Rule of Law and Human Rights Programs in Russia\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, page 45 of the committee report \naccompanying the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations bill, Senate \nReport 108-106, discusses rule of law and human rights programs in \nRussia. The report mentions the Russian American Judicial Partnership \nand the Russian American Rule of Law Consortium. The report failed to \nmention another important program, the American Bar Association's \nCentral and East European Law Initiative, CEELI, which is involved in \ntraining Russian lawyers in the adversary system, law school curriculum \ndevelopment, and improvement of gender equity in the legal system. Each \nof these organizations is doing important work, and we want to be sure \nthat despite the decline in our assistance program in Russia that \nfunding for these types of programs are continued. There is no more \neffective way for the United States to contribute to the political and \neconomic development of Russia than by strengthening the rule of law \nand respect for human rights.\n\n\n                Collaborative Research Support Programs\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, page 16 of the committee report \naccompanying the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations bill, Senate \nReport 108-106, discusses the Collaborative Research Support Programs. \nThese programs, which involve 52 U.S. universities, have made \nimmeasurable contributions in developing countries on a wide range of \nagriculture, environment, nutrition and development issues. USAID funds \nare leveraged with contributions from the universities and recipient \ncountries.\n  For fiscal year 2003, the committee recommended funding for the CRSPs \nat a higher level than in fiscal year 2002. However, despite that \nrecommendation, funding was essentially flat lined. For fiscal year \n2004, the committee expresses its strong support for the CRSPs and \nrecommends continued funding. I want to emphasize the importance of the \nCRSPs to the Congress, to the universities that participate, to the \ncountries that benefit, and to U.S. foreign policy. We want USAID to \nexpand its collaboration with U.S. universities that have research \nexpertise on these issues. By that I mean that funding for the CRSPs \nshould be increasing. An appropriate level for the CRSPs in fiscal year \n2004 would be $25 million. I also urge USAID to seriously consider \nallocating up to $2 million to fund and establish a CRSP focused on \nwater security.\n\n\n                American Universities in the Middle East\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to clarify a sentence in the \ncommittee report, Report 108-106, accompanying S. 1426, the fiscal year \n2004 foreign operations bill.\n  On page 38 of the report, under the heading ``Middle East Partnership \nInitiative,'' the committee expresses support for using a portion of \nMEPI funds ``for scholarships for needy Muslim students at the American \nUniversity of Beirut.'' We do support that, but we intended to also \nmention the American University in Cairo and the Lebanese American \nUniversity. Their omission was purely an oversight. I ask my friend \nfrom Kentucky, the subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, if he \nagrees with me about this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do. My friend from Vermont is correct that this was \nan oversight. We intended to express support for the use of MEPI funds \nfor scholarships for Muslim students at the other American universities \nin the Middle East, as well as at the American University of Beirut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13192-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post has a \nfront-page story entitled ``Inquiry Faults Intelligence on Iraq.'' The \nsubheadline says, ``The Threat From Saddam Hussein Was Overstated, \nSenate Committee Report Finds.''\n  Many of us who voted against going to war against Iraq believed it \nwas not in the national security interest of the United States to \nattack Iraq at this moment; that instead we ought to keep our eye on \nthe ball and keep the pressure on al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden because \nit was al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden who attacked America on September \n11, not Iraq.\n  I think this morning's report has increasing evidence that it was \nsimply a misplaced priority to attack Iraq rather than keeping our full \nresources directed at taking down al-Qaida and holding Osama bin Laden \naccountable for his vicious attack on this country.\n  If we look across the evidence, I believe in many ways the United \nStates simply made a mistake of judgment on what was most important. \nThe President and his advisers believed--and I believe they sincerely \nbelieved--that the priority was to go after Iraq. They believed there \nwas some link between Iraq and al-Qaida.\n  I think the evidence was always very thin for that and, in fact, the \nmore we know, the more clear it is there really were not any strong \nlinkages between Iraq and al-Qaida. In fact, it is unlikely that there \nwould be because Saddam Hussein was secular, Osama bin Laden is a \nfundamentalist. In many ways, they are enemies; they are at odds.\n  It is very interesting that if one goes out and tries to ascertain \nwhat people of the country think, the polling shows 70 percent of \nAmericans believe Saddam Hussein was behind September 11. Over half \nbelieve that Iraqis were the hijackers of the planes.\n  The fact is, not a single Iraqi was among the hijackers of the \nairliners that were turned into flying bombs. The vast majority of the \n19 hijackers were Saudi Arabians, as, of course, is Osama bin Laden. I \nthink 15 of the 19 were Saudis. Two were from the United Arab Emirates \nand there were other countries involved as well, but not a single \nIraqi. That is the fact.\n  Another thing, we have now the President himself saying there is no \nevidence of a Hussein tie to September 11. It is very important we get \nthe facts right when we make these judgments about going to war, \nespecially when we are going to go on a preemptive war, when we attack \nfirst, something we have never done in the entire history of the United \nStates. We have never attacked, without somebody attacking us first or \nattacking our allies first, but in this case we attacked first. As the \nIntelligence Committee report this morning suggests, we did so based on \nfaulty intelligence and faulty evidence.\n  Another assertion that was made repeatedly was that there was a \nterrorist camp in Iraq that members of al-Qaida went to, but we knew \nthen and we know now that that camp is in this\n\n[[Page S13193]]\n\nplace on the chart, which is the former Ansar al-Islam pocket. It is in \nIraq. As this line shows, that camp is in a part of Iraq that Saddam \nHussein did not control. In fact, this part of Iraq is controlled by \nthe Kurds. The Kurds are our allies. So once again, this is a \ndisturbing bit of information used in a way that I believe \nfundamentally misled people.\n\n  A second piece of intelligence was that Mohamed Atta, who was among \nthe hijackers, supposedly met with the intelligence chief in Prague, in \nCzechoslovakia. That charge was repeated over and over.\n  Our intelligence agencies believe Mr. Atta was not in Prague at the \ntime of that reported meeting. Instead, he was in the United States--\nagain, evidence that simply does not support the case.\n  What we do know is that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida organized that \nattack on the United States. That is who was responsible. That is who \nwe should be going after.\n  The other thing that was asserted repeatedly was that there were \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I do not fault the administration \nfor making that case because, frankly, I believed there were probably \nbiological and chemical weapons. I believed it because we know that the \nprevious U.N. inspectors had catalogued weapons of mass destruction, \nbiological and chemical weapons, but that was some years ago. Even \nthen, there was no evidence that those weapons had been destroyed. So \neven though now we have not found them, I think it is understandable \nthat people believed there were at least chemical and biological \nweapons.\n  The Soviet Union had biological and chemical weapons; we never \nattacked them. China had biological and chemical weapons; we did not \nattack them. North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, or at least \nthey assert they do. We have not attacked them. In every one of those \ncases, we used containment. We used patience. We did not attack first.\n  In the case where we were attacked, we know who did that. It was not \nIraq. It was not Iraqis. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden.\n  It has now been 775 days since that attack on our country, and Osama \nbin Laden is still broadcasting tapes threatening Americans and our \nallies. It has been 775 days, and we have not brought him to justice. I \nbelieve that is the priority. I believe that should be our top goal. I \nbelieve we ought to find Osama bin Laden and the rest of the al-Qaida \nleadership and take them out.\n  Newsweek ran a story in which they identified a possible location in \nthe Kunar Province between Afghanistan and Pakistan as a place where \nOsama bin Laden is reported to be hiding. This is a pretty small area \nof the country of Afghanistan, where they have narrowed it down through \ntheir investigative reporting as a place where Osama bin Laden is \nhiding.\n  What I find most disturbing is in that story, they said this:\n\n     . . . bin Laden appears to be not only alive, but thriving. \n     And with America distracted in Iraq, and Pakistani President \n     Pervez Musharraf leery of stirring up an Islamist backlash, \n     there is no large-scale military force currently pursuing the \n     chief culprit in the 9/11 attacks . . .\n\n  I am here today to ask why not? Why is there not a large military \nforce with an operation underway to find Osama bin Laden and to bring \nhim to justice? That ought to be our top priority. If we have been \ndistracted by Iraq, then that is exactly what this Senator feared when \nI voted against authorizing going to war against Iraq at this \ntime. That is exactly what concerned this Senator, that a preemptive \nwar against Iraq--a country that had a low level of threat against this \ncountry, according to our own intelligence agencies--has distracted us \nfrom going after the man and the organization that attacked this \ncountry. It was not Iraqis who attacked this country; it was al-Qaida \nthat attacked this country. Saddam Hussein was not the leader of that \noperation, Osama bin Laden was the leader of that operation. It has \nbeen 775 days since that vicious attack on this country and we still \nhave not brought him to justice.\n\n  What is far more disturbing to me is there is, apparently, no large \nscale military force currently pursuing the chief culprit in the 9/11 \nattacks. Why not? I think the American people deserve an answer to that \nquestion. I think the Members of this Chamber deserve an answer to that \nquestion. Why is there not a large-scale military operation underway to \nfind Osama bin Laden and to hold him to account? That ought to be the \npriority. That ought to be in the highest interests of the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Osama bin Laden engineered the attack on this country. I must say, \nlast weekend, to see him in another tape, bragging about the damage he \nhas done to this country--outrageous, absolutely outrageous. Let's go \nget Osama bin Laden and those who attacked this country. That ought to \nbe our highest national security priority.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate works well when it is served by \nvery competent and dedicated staff members--on our personal staff, the \npeople who operate the elevators, the security people, the policemen, \nbut most importantly our staff at the committee level and here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Over the past few years, I think most of the staff members know how \nmuch I have appreciated their good work because I have taken the time \noccasionally to say so and because I tried to make the Senate a family-\nfriendly place. Although they may look like just part of the furniture, \nthere are really some fine, dedicated people who spend long hours here \nwho really live outside this Chamber. Sometimes I see members of our \nfloor staff in other parts of the Capitol complex, or at Pentagon City, \nand I am shocked to see them out of the cave they work in. Far too \noften, we don't take the time to say ``thank you'' and ``job well \ndone'' because you have made us look good, because you have served some \nState in our great Nation well, and because you made America a better \nplace.\n  So I am here today to say thank you to one of our dedicated staff \nmembers who has now retired and is moving on to her next life--probably \nthe third generation of her very important life--one who has served us \nwell and one whom I will miss seeing on the floor of the Senate every \nday. That person is Denise Greenlaw Ramonas.\n\n  I first got to know Denise because she lives in my neighborhood, but \nalso because she was such a competent assistant to Pete Domenici. I \nnoticed her when Senator Domenici, one of the most able legislators in \nthis body, would come to the floor to handle a budget resolution or \npiece of legislation, perhaps from the Subcommittee on Energy that he \nserves on of the appropriations committee or something on behalf of New \nMexico. There was this obviously competent staff member working with \nhim in the Senate. I learned to talk to her and listen to her when she \nwas in the Senate with Pete Domenici.\n  Over the years, I got to know more about Denise. Denise is from Utah. \nShe graduated from the University of Utah College of Law, receiving her \njuris doctorate degree. She also graduated magna cum laude from \nundergraduate school. She has had a number of outstanding experiences \nin her life including serving as a law clerk in a Houston law firm, one \nof the best in the state, the Boswell, O'Toole and Pickering law firm. \nShe has been an instructor at the University of Utah College of \nBusiness. That clearly is an interesting experience. To be an \ninstructor you have to know your subject matter and you get to work \nwith young people. I have learned from personal experience, sometimes \nhard experience, students are tougher in their questioning than people \nyou might talk to at a chamber of commerce or civic club. Being a \nprofessor is a challenge, I am sure.\n  She has worked for the Department of Business Regulation for the \nState of Utah. She was an adjunct professor, City College of Chicago, \nin West Berlin and Weisbaden, Germany. She also has a business on the \nside selling a line of women's clothes.\n  Beginning in 1982, she served as legislative assistant to Senator \nPete\n\n[[Page S13194]]\n\nDomenici, as I noted. She was legislative director to Senator Domenici \nfrom 1985 to 1991. Obviously she developed and executed legislative \nstrategies on a wide range of domestic and international issues, \nincluding tax reform issues, the omnibus trade bill of 1998, the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and gained a lot of valuable \nexperience in that position with Senator Domenici. She was counsel to \nthe minority for the Senate Budget Committee where she worked the \nclosest with Senator Domenici but a lot of Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, learned to know her and respect her.\n  Finally, from 1992 to 1996, she was general counsel to the Senate \nBudget Committee, a committee that has played a huge part in what the \nSenate has done over the last 20 years. Keep in mind, we did not have a \nBudget Committee until the late 1970s because we never got around to \nhaving a process where we add up how much we take in and how much we \nsend out. Senator Domenici deserves a lot of credit for us eventually \nmoving for the first time in 30 years to balanced budgets in the late \n1990s and early in this century. Right there beside him, time and time \nagain, was Denise Ramonas.\n  As majority leader, you do have some staff turnover occasionally and \nwhen we had a retirement here on our floor staff in 2001, I stole, once \nagain from Senator Domenici, a great staff member. Over the years I \nthink I have acquired about three of Senator Domenici's former staff \nmembers, and Denise Ramonas became assistant secretary to the majority \nserving on the floor, keeping track of the flow of legislation, making \nsure Senators were properly notified, keeping track of the votes. It is \na demanding job with long hours, dealing with a clientele that is not \nalways pleasant. But she did it with a smile, with a radiant beauty and \nwith a high intellect. She served in that position from 2001 to October \nthe 10th, I believe, was her final day.\n  I wish nothing but the best for Denise as she goes forward into the \nrest of her life seeking other opportunities. I am sure she will find \nsome good ones and it will be rewarding to her.\n  I also thank her for her dedicated service over the years to this \ninstitution, particularly her years on the Senate floor. She did a \ngreat job. I personally appreciated it. So to Denise and her loved \nones, I say a fond adieu and a great deal of thanks for your service \nhere. I hope she will stay in touch with the Senate, with the Senators, \nand maybe even we will find a way to call on her services again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13194-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13194-S13205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE LATE SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished majority \nleader for setting aside time today for those of us who wish to share \nour tributes and thoughts regarding our colleague who, 1 year ago \ntomorrow, passed away in a tragic plane crash, Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Paul was a friend of mine for over 20 years and my colleague, mentor, \nand partner here for the first 2 years of my term. It is hard to \nbelieve it was a year ago now that he boarded a small charter plane to \ngo up to northern Minnesota and somehow, impossibly and horribly, it \ncrashed as it was trying to land there. It was demolished by the impact \nand by a fire that killed all eight people on board--Senator Wellstone; \nhis wife and partner of 39 years Sheila; his daughter Marcia; the \nassociate chair of the Minnesota Democratic Party, Mary McEvoy; and two \nof Paul's trusted aides, Tom Lapic and Will McLaughlin; as well as the \nplane's two pilots.\n\n  I have felt deep sadness and futile anger many times as I have \nentered this Chamber during the past year and as I walk by Paul's \ndesk--which to me will always be Paul's desk. I have always felt his \nabsence at caucus lunches, committee hearings, and policy debates. \nAlways I miss his courage, his eloquence, his passion, and his deep \ncaring for other people and their well-being, especially for all the \npeople who have most often been ignored or forgotten in the stampedes \nof the rich and powerful, which occur regularly around here.\n  Thousands of Minnesotans and other Americans have felt similar grief, \ndespair, anger, hopelessness, and profound loss during this past year. \nNo one in my lifetime has meant so much to so many people in Minnesota \nas Paul and Sheila Wellstone.\n  Paul once wrote that politics is not about left, right, or center; it \nis about speaking to the concerns and circumstances of people's lives. \nPaul practiced what he preached. He was both by gut instinct and by \nreasoned conviction a man of the people. The rich and the famous held \nno special sway over him. Senatorial trappings, perks, and offerings \ndid not appeal to him.\n  Instead, he was drawn to the real people, everyday Americans going \nabout their business in their homes, schools, farms, offices, and union \nhalls. They were the people who aroused his personal passions and \ninstructed his political purposes. Their misfortunes became his causes. \nTheir injustices forged his remedies. Their hopes and dreams inspired \nhis orations. He was their Senator, their champion, and their hero.\n  Paul liked to say he was the Senator for the little fellows, as he \njokingly pointed at his own height. He may have been short, but he was \nin every other respect a big, big man, with a big heart, big ideas, big \ncourage.\n  He became a towering political leader. His popularity and prestige \nwere enormous in Minnesota, and they were growing nationwide, \nespecially with people who were hungry for real leadership. Had he \nlived and had he won reelection, his star would be shining even more \nbrightly than ever before, which is why the darkness surrounding his \nabsence is so hard to bear for his family, his friends, and his \nfollowers.\n  His best was still to come. He understood, as he said, that people \nyearned for a politics that speaks to and includes them and that offers \nthem something real. As Paul admonished his colleagues, especially \nthose of us in his own caucus, the question is not how to communicate \nour agenda but whether we have an agenda worth communicating. Paul did.\n  Nothing illustrated better his greatness, his unfailing ability to \nrise up to the challenge, to summon his courage, and to act rightly \nthan one of his last votes in the Senate a year ago. The Senate was \nabout to begin its consideration of a resolution authorizing the \nPresident to initiate military action against Iraq. Paul was in the \nfinal weeks of a very tough reelection contest against my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota who is presiding at this moment, and many of \nhis friends and political advisers were urging Paul to support this \nresolution. Doing so, they said, would assure his victory. Voting \nagainst it, they warned, could seal his defeat.\n\n  Paul was still wrestling with this decision when an article appeared \nin one of the Capitol press reports which quoted an unnamed Senate aide \nas saying the Democratic caucus was trying to devise a political cover \nto help Paul and others in close reelections finesse this tough vote.\n  At a caucus meeting later that day, Paul was as furious as I had ever \nseen him. He wasn't seeking anyone's cover, he fumed. He had never \ntried to duck a difficult vote, and he refused to do so now. He \nfinished by saying: Whether Minnesotans agree with my decisions or not, \nthey know I am doing what I believe is right. If I lose that trust, I \nhave lost everything.\n  He left the meeting and went straight to the Senate floor and gave a \npowerful speech announcing he would vote against any resolution which \ngave the President complete and unilateral authority to start the war \nin Iraq.\n  In the following days, his last days on Earth, Paul was the most \nrelaxed and upbeat I had seen him since his reelection campaign began. \nHe was, of course, delighted with what he said were poll numbers which \nhad boosted his standing after making that speech but, more \nimportantly, he knew he had done what he believed was right. Principle \nhad again prevailed over expediency. His integrity, his courage to \nstand up for his convictions, and his inspiring eloquence in speaking \nthe truth were the essence of what he offered to the voters of \nMinnesota, and he knew\n\n[[Page S13195]]\n\nhe had reestablished that connection, that special bond that he and \nonly he had with so many Minnesotans.\n  He boarded that plane a year ago tomorrow, hopeful and optimistic of \na victory in 11 days. That we will never know. But I say: Paul, you \nwere right. You were and you always will be a winner.\n  Ernest Hemmingway, in his book ``Farewell to Arms,'' wrote:\n\n       Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their \n     fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their \n     society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in \n     battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential \n     vital quality of those who seek to change a world which \n     yields most painfully to change.\n\n  The Senate body recognized Paul's rare greatness last year by \nauthorizing $10 million for a project selected by Paul and Sheila's two \nsurviving sons, David and Mark Wellstone, the Neighborhood House in St. \nPaul. Mr. President, $8.9 million was appropriated for fiscal year 2003 \nthrough the good efforts of my colleague, Senator Coleman. He and I \nshare the hope that the remaining $1.1 million, to fulfill the Senate's \ncommitment, will be appropriated for fiscal year 2004. It is a \nwonderful project, and it will benefit many people in Paul and Sheila's \nname for many years to come.\n  We can do something even more significant, even more befitting Paul's \nmemory. We can pass the legislative initiative that was closest to his \nheart and to which he devoted himself in the last 5 years of his life, \nand that is mental health parity.\n  Senator Domenici, whose personal dedication to this just cause equals \nPaul's, has carried that torch forward. He has been joined by Senator \nKennedy who, like Paul, has also championed so many efforts to help \nthose among us who are most in need. Senator Domenici informed me this \nweek he is optimistic the bill will be considered by the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee within the next 2 weeks, and \nhopefully will be passed out of that committee and put on the Senate \ncalendar where it might even be taken up and acted upon this year.\n  That is incredibly good news for Paul and Sheila's families for whom \nthis means so much. It is incredibly good news to the many \norganizations throughout the country that have joined to help support \nand enact this critically important and needed legislation. It is most \nincredibly good news to the many Americans who will benefit from it, \nwho will finally have access to the health care they need at prices \nthey can afford.\n  Even then, however, the bill faces major obstacles. The House \nleadership is reportedly opposed to it; the White House is supposedly \nagainst it; the insurance companies hate it; and many health care \nproviders would also prefer that it just not be passed.\n  So nothing has changed down here, Paul. It is the same battle: \nProfits for the bigger fellows versus services for the little fellows. \nOnly this time, Paul Wellstone will not be able to champion the cause \nfor the little fellows. He cannot come to this Senate floor every \nmonth, week, or even every day, if necessary, to remind us, to \nchallenge us, to cajole us, to do what is best for most of our \nconstituents. So all of us must do it without him and do it for him. \nSurely we can find it within ourselves to vote once for something to \nwhich Paul gave his entire life, and his life itself.\n  So, my friend and colleague, we will go on missing you. We will do \nour best without you to advance the causes which you have championed.\n  Somehow saying ``rest in peace'' does not seem to fit your style. So \ninstead, I hope there is a great debating hall up in heaven, that you \nare seated with other great Senate voices such as Daniel Webster and \nHenry Clay. I hope your microphone cord is long enough for you to roam \nwhile you speak and that there are no time agreements limiting debate. \nPlease keep your eye on the rest of us down here and, if you can, send \nus a little of your wisdom and your inspiration, especially when we \nface the choices between principles and expediency, profits and people, \nbetween what is easiest for us and what is best for everyone else, the \npeople we are elected to serve. Keep reminding us, if you will, that as \nonce said, inasmuch as ye have done so unto the least of these thy \nbrethren, ye have done so unto me.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfriend and former colleague, Paul Wellstone. I know we have just heard \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, and I listened carefully \nto his message. He conveyed so much of what we all feel.\n  The Senator from Minnesota had the privilege of knowing Paul \nWellstone very well, and that was indeed a privilege because everybody \nwith whom he worked knew what an unusual and--I will use a trite word--\nfantastic fellow he was as a person.\n  It hardly seems possible that a year has passed since we received the \nterrible news that Paul and Sheila, his beloved wife--they were a great \nteam--their daughter Marcia, and loyal staff members Tom Lapic, Mary \nMcEvoy, and Will McLaughlin were also lost in that tragic plane crash. \nThe crash also claimed the lives of the two pilots, Richard Conry and \nMichael Guess.\n  This weekend marks the first anniversary of this immeasurable loss to \nour country, and we pause for a moment to honor the memory of these \nextraordinary individuals. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their \nfamilies and their loved ones.\n  Paul and Sheila Wellstone devoted their lives to giving a voice to \nthe voiceless. He saw his mission in the Senate and his life as \ncomforting the afflicted and, when necessary, afflicting the \ncomfortable. That was Paul Wellstone in a nutshell. In social justice \ncircles, it is called speaking truth to power.\n  Everyone admired Paul for the fact that he spoke from his heart. He \ncast his votes in this Chamber based on his deep beliefs. He had a \nstrong moral compass, unwavering in his convictions, never changing his \nmessage to please any particular audience. One of his favorite \nexpressions in that connection was an old Jewish proverb that you \ncannot dance at two weddings at the same time. He was always answering \nto the mission that he believed could mean something to most people.\n  He conformed his style somewhat after coming to the Senate, but he \nnever sold out. He always had that kind of impish look, a half smile on \nhis face, but often at the same time with a deeply furrowed brow. He \nnever joined the establishment. He just had diplomatic relations with \nit.\n\n  During his time in the Senate, Paul led legislative battles to make \nhealth care more accessible, protect seniors' pensions from corporate \nraiders, and authored historic ethics and lobbying reform legislation \nthat is now the law of the land. He has forever changed how we do \nbusiness here on Capitol Hill.\n  He and Sheila were leaders in combating the scourge of domestic \nviolence. Sheila was a working member of Paul's office and became a \nrespected national voice in her own right as she traveled the country, \ndedicating herself to this important cause. In the year 2000, Paul \nteamed with his colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pass \nhistoric bipartisan legislation to prevent the international sex \ntrafficking of women and girls, establishing the first ever penalty for \nthose so despicable as to enslave and traffic in other people.\n  He teamed with our colleague, Senator Domenici, to require health \ninsurance companies to provide more equitable coverage and benefits to \npeople suffering from mental illness. It was the right thing to do, it \nwas the fair thing to do, and he prevailed.\n  It is my hope that before the end of this Congress we are going to \nhonor Paul Wellstone's fighting, fair-minded spirit by passing the Paul \nWellstone Mental Health Parity Act into law. It would also be the right \nthing to do.\n  Paul Wellstone deeply loved his country and, speaking from my view of \nPaul Wellstone, his country loved him. Many people who did not know him \nas we had the privilege of doing, would so much respect him from \nhearing his\n\n[[Page S13196]]\n\nfiery oration about what was right. And he stood up to anybody. He was \nwilling to be the odd person out when it came to issues of \nsignificance. He wanted them always to be right.\n  He demanded that we be the best that we can be and was never more \npassionate than when he was trying to right a wrong, holding up a \nmirror to a government that has not always kept its promises--\nespecially to its veterans. Paul worked tirelessly on behalf of \nveterans, helping to pass legislation to aid homeless veterans and to \nsecure compensation for atomic veterans suffering from cancers due to \nradiation exposure during their military service.\n  In Paul's words:\n\n       I am very proud that atomic veterans and their families \n     will finally get the VA benefits and compensation they \n     deserve, and also the recognition of the terrible personal \n     sacrifices that they made on behalf of the nation, so long \n     denied to them.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       This has been a long fight, but one that was well worth it. \n     This was a victory, not only for atomic veterans, it was a \n     victory for justice, and for all of our Nation's citizen-\n     soldiers. America is a safer place because of it.\n\n  One of the last votes Paul cast in this Chamber was for a \nmultilateral approach to our situation in Iraq. During the debate, he \nargued as follows:\n\n       Acting now on our own might be a sign of our power. Acting \n     sensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our allies, \n     with bipartisan congressional support, would be a sign of our \n     strength.\n\n  Paul Wellstone will long be remembered for his strength: for his \nstrength of mind, strength of spirit, and the steely tenacity and \nstrength of his convictions. What gifts he gave to us all. He will \nforever be missed.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the life of \nSenator Paul Wellstone and to urge the Senate Republican leadership to \npave the way for the expeditious passage of the Paul Wellstone Mental \nHealth Parity Act.\n  Earlier this week, I joined a number of my colleagues in sending a \nletter to the majority leader, urging him to set aside other business \nyesterday so we could take up and pass this very important legislation. \nI regret that could not be accomplished yesterday.\n  This Saturday, October 25, marks the 1-year anniversary of the tragic \ndeath of our dear colleague, Paul Wellstone, his lovely wife Sheila, \nand six others: his daughter Marcia; Mary McEvoy of St. Paul, a \nprofessor of educational psychology at the University of Minnesota and \nalso the associate chairwoman of the State Democratic-Farmer-Labor \nParty; Tom Lapic, of Eden Prairie--Tom was Senator Wellstone's deputy \nState director and long-time associate and aide, and William \nMcLaughlin, a 23-year-old who was Senator Wellstone's personal \nassistant and driver.\n  All of these individuals were dedicated, passionate public servants \nwho shared Paul Wellstone's vision, his dedication and commitment to a \nbetter America, a place where opportunity was the heritage of all. For \nanyone who had the honor to serve with Paul and to see him here, his \nimage and his memory still linger in this Chamber. To see him \npassionately and fearlessly fight for people--and not the wealthiest, \nbut poorest, those who needed an opportunity to move ahead--that image \nof him stays with me and stays with so many of my colleagues.\n  Many times we would not agree. Many times we would differ. But no one \nin this Chamber doubted his passion, his commitment, and his selfless \ndedication to this country. He challenged us. In fact, Paul probably \nchallenged his colleagues more than any other Member.\n  He would speak here when it was inopportune and inconvenient for him, \nbut he would do it because he felt a commitment and a need to speak, to \ngive voice to those who were voiceless in this country.\n  He believed the Government had not only the obligation but also the \nability to help people--not just to cradle them from birth through \ntheir lives but to give them opportunities and skills so they could use \nthese skills to better themselves and better the Nation.\n  He was enthusiastic about helping people lift themselves out of \npoverty, about bringing justice to those who had been victimized, and \nhope to those who were desperate.\n  He cared about all the issues that are before us in the Senate. But \none issue he cared so much about, for which he advocated so strenuously \nand which he articulated so passionately, was the fact that our mental \nhealth system needs additional improvement; that there is disparity \nbetween the treatment given to those with physical pain and treatments \ngiven to those individuals with mental anguish.\n  He also was passionate in denouncing the stigma we attach to mental \nillness too often in this country. He fought effectively, and his \nefforts culminated in 1996 with the original Mental Health Parity Act. \nIt was thought that this historic bill that would put mental health \nservices on the same level as physical health services by essentially \ntelling insurers whatever you do in terms of physical health problems \nyou must also do in terms of mental health problems. However, it was \ndiscovered after passage of the Act that insurance companies and others \nwere able to find ways to circumvent the law, so additional efforts \nwould be necessary.\n  He stood up, along with our colleague and our friend Senator Pete \nDomenici of New Mexico, to lead the fight to make the parity law of \n1996 even better, more effective, and stronger.\n  Last summer it appeared we were on the verge of a breakthrough when \nPresident Bush indicated he supported this concept of a mental health \nparity standard. Yet we are still without effective action.\n  I was very pleased to join Senator Domenici, Senator Kennedy, and \nothers to sign on to the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act in honor of our esteemed colleague. But today, despite \nhaving 66 cosponsors, this legislation has not been brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. We are indeed seeing tremendous strains on our \nhealth care system, but this is one of the most critical problems. \nThere are those who say it is going to cost too much if we address \nmental health parity seriously. My argument is the costs today are \nimmense, and if we don't deal with these mental health issues, it will \ncontinue to grow.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, we have a very active community mental \nhealth system. I suggest we probably have saved dollars over the course \nof the last couple of decades. But we can't do this unless we have a \ncommitment to parity between physical health issues and mental health \nissues.\n  The majority leader has indicated that his preference is to do this \nthrough the committee process. We have a markup scheduled for next \nWednesday on health care issues. That would be the ideal opportunity to \nschedule the Paul Wellstone legislation and do our best to pass it. \nWorking with the majority leader and the chairman of the HELP \ncommittee, I hope we can do that, or certainly at the earliest possible \nopportunity have committee action to take up the Paul Wellstone bill.\n  There is one other area which Senator Wellstone was passionate about. \nIn fact, I can hear him now. His desk was right behind me. He would \nprowl up and down the corridor, and go as far as the cord would let him \ngo. He would speak out. One issue on which he spoke so eloquently was \nthe issue of funding education--the No Child Left Behind Act. He was \none of the few dissenters. He said prophetically this might be a good \nplan, but without resources it wouldn't work. Ironically, today we \nstruggle to get those resources. He would say, we can't reform \neducation on a tin cup. Unfortunately, we still seem to be passing \naround that tin cup rather than funding education robustly as we must.\n  I hope we can move aggressively on the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nParity Act. I hope also we can find those resources to fund education \nand the No Child Left Behind Act. In doing that, we will pay tribute to \na Senator who honored us and honored his country with his public \nservice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n[[Page S13197]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I join with my colleagues here on the \nSenate floor today to mark the 1-year anniversary of the tragic death \nof our friend and beloved colleague, Paul Wellstone, and his wife \nSheila.\n  As I look around the Chamber here in the Senate today, I see men and \nwomen of remarkable talents and ability. It is kind of a family here in \nthe Senate. Regardless of our ideological beliefs or party preferences, \nwe all understand what we went through to get here and how we work and \nwhat we have to do. We have our differences. We meet, we argue, and we \nvote. But underneath it all, the Senate is kind of a family. That is \ngood. Like all families, we may have our squabbles, but like a family, \nI have a strong sense there is kind of a void in our midst. A very \nspecial Senator, a Member who played a unique role in this body, is \nmissing. It is as though we are suffering from the phantom-limb \nsyndrome. The phantom-limb syndrome is when a person loses a limb, and \neven as time goes on, sometimes it feels like it is there. When an \nissue of moral urgency and an issue of conscience comes to the Senate \nfloor, I still expect to see Paul standing over there chopping the air \nwith his hands, speaking with his own unique special passion, and \nurging us to do the right thing. Yes, it is like we have the phantom-\nlimb syndrome. Once in a while, you expect to hear Paul speaking out \nhere. He was truly the soul of the Senate.\n  No one wore the title of Senator better or used it less. He loved \nordinary folks. Strangers would come up to him and call him Paul. I \ncan't tell you how many times I would walk off the Senate floor and \ndown the steps with him. We would go together back to the Hart Building \nor someplace. Policemen would come up. They might say Senator Harkin, \nbut they always called him Paul. People working on the grounds called \nhim Paul. He took that as a sign that ordinary people knew he was one \nof them; that he was approachable; that he cared, all of which was Paul \nWellstone to the core.\n  Paul had so many friends in my State of Iowa. Iowans knew him \npersonally, and many more Iowans felt they knew him personally. I often \nsaid before his death and after that he was one of my best friends in \nand out of the State. But in truth, Paul Wellstone was one of those \nrare souls who so many saw as their best friend.\n  He had a powerful authenticity about him that made a miner on the \nIron Range know he was as important to Paul as the President of the \nUnited States. Paul never had to proclaim his decency. It shone forth \nin great acts of political courage and in small acts of human kindness. \nHe never had to say he cared. He never had to proclaim his compassion. \nWe saw these qualities in him every day in dozens of ways--from his \npassionate speeches here on the Senate floor, standing up for those who \notherwise had no voice, to the countless people he reached out to hug \nand to hear and to help all across Minnesota and all across the Nation.\n  Thirty years later, he retraced Robert Kennedy's journey to places of \nhunger and hurt in the heart of America. The hard-working folks he \ncared about most didn't have lobbyists or influence or money. But they \nhad Paul Wellstone, and he truly was their best friend.\n  Paul always had a great sense of humor and a sense of perspective. He \nnever took himself too seriously. One of his favorite stories, which I \nheard him tell many times, was the story of one of his early Senate \nspeeches which he thought was rather eloquent and passionate. You can \nread about it in his book, ``Conscience of a Liberal.'' Our friend, the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina, who sits across the aisle from me, \nFritz Hollings, approached him after the speech and said, ``Young man, \nyou remind me of Hubert Humphrey.'' Paul, as he told the story, swelled \nup with pride and thought this was wonderful until Senator Hollings \nsaid, ``You talk too much.'' Paul would love to tell that story. He \nwould get that big grin and his eyes would squint and he would roar \nwith laughter. As I said, he never took himself seriously.\n  Paul may have talked a lot, but he meant every word. He showed us \nthat way to lead is by following your conscience. When injustice was \nproposed or unfairness was advancing or selfishness was on the march, \nPaul would go into battle. It was OK with him if he went into battle \nall by himself. Paul Wellstone may have suffered from a bad back, but \nhe had a spine of steel.\n  Paul was the soul of the Senate. He believed politics could truly be \na noble profession, putting principle above polls. Sometimes he cast \nvotes that even some of his friends disagreed with--on war, welfare, \neducation. And when he did, he was the mirror in which we, his \ncolleagues, looked at ourselves and searched our own hearts as to the \ncorrectness of our own positions.\n  So 1 year later, we remember this political science professor whose \nmeasure of truth was never in political theory but in the impact our \ndecisions have on real people. We remember the community organizer, the \nfarm organizer, who understood how to bring people together, rural and \nurban, environmentalists and labor, Republicans and Democrats and, as I \nhave often said, even Minnesotans and Iowans. We remember a leader, a \nproud Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, a liberal who constantly reminded \nthose who are Democrats that the real center of gravity of our party, \nthe progressive ground of our being, is everyone should have a chance \nto reach their full potential.\n  We remember a man of principle who for all his convictions also had \nthe rarest of gifts in politics: Paul actually sometimes came to the \nconclusion that the other person was right. He could partner with Ted \nKennedy or Pete Domenici. He could fearlessly oppose Senator Jesse \nHelms' views yet become Jesse Helms' friend. It was all perfectly \nconsistent with his guiding star. The decency Paul Wellstone demanded \nof society was the decency he lived out in his own life.\n  Paul once said politics is about what we create about what we do, \nwhat we hope for, and what we dare to imagine. Paul Wellstone did not \njust dare to imagine a better America, he helped to build one. Sure, he \nwas willing to fight the lonely fight if he thought it was the right \nthing to do, but he also knew how to turn idealism into ideas and ideas \ninto actions to improve people's lives: investing in education, \nexpanding health care, fighting killer diseases like Parkinson's, \nhelping homeless veterans and veterans exposed to radiation. Thanks to \nhis hard work in the Senate, farmers have a better future. Because of \nwhat he demanded, mental illness will some day be treated equally in \nour health care system. Because of who he married, Sheila, and because \nof Sheila's passionate charge, more women and children will find safe \nharbor from the scourge of domestic abuse.\n\n  Paul was a hopeful man. His campaign colors were always green. I \nalways thought that was the color of springtime. It is also the color \nof hope. This picture captures Paul and Sheila Wellstone, standing on \nthat green bus with all kinds of people around him, smiling, with \nSheila standing by his side, and the American flag over his head waving \nproudly, with a big smile on his face. That was Paul Wellstone.\n  He bought this bus 13 years ago and used it in his campaigns time and \ntime again. I often said he got that bus on his journey to build a \nbetter America. But he never wanted to be on the bus by himself. He \nnever meant it to be a solo voyage. He wanted us all on board that bus.\n  Although Paul is no longer with us, we all must get on that bus, the \nbus of hope, the bus leading to a better America, a bus that is on a \njourney for justice, equality, a bus that is on a journey to ensure \nevery individual in our society, no matter the circumstances of birth, \nhas the potential to reach his or her full potential.\n  As we listen to the tributes this morning, it is clear our memories \nof Paul Wellstone remain rich and warm. His spirit is still very much \nwith us. He still inspires us. He still calls us to conscience. He \nstill makes us smile when we think of his puckish humor.\n  Today, 1 year later, let's agree that our period of grieving has \npassed. The darkness has dissipated. What remains is the light Paul \nradiated every day in this Chamber. He was truly the finest of human \nnature.\n  In addition to Paul and Sheila, six other wonderful people died in \nthat plane crash 1 year ago. Paul would not want us 1 year later to \njust remember him or to just remember him and Sheila, because as he \nalways said, we are all\n\n[[Page S13198]]\n\npart of his family, the campaign workers, the people who flew him \naround. So we remember them, too: Their daughter, Marcia; Tom Lapic, \nwho died, and was Paul's long-time trusted aide and served many years \nin Paul's Senate offices here in Washington and St. Paul. We remember \nand miss Tom today. He was also a member of our Senate family. We \nremember Mary McEvoy, a professor of early childhood education at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, always by Sheila Wellstone's side; Will \nMcLaughlin, 23 years old, Paul's driver. Again, Paul always reached out \nto bring young people into politics. We remember the two pilots, \nRichard Conry and Michael Guess, of that ill-fated plane.\n  Finally, there is one piece of Paul's legacy that is not complete, \nand it has been spoken of by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, \nand I just heard Senator Reed speak about it, and I know Senator \nLautenberg spoke about it: the issue of mental health parity. Paul \nworked tirelessly to overcome the barriers to mental health treatment. \nSpecifically, he championed legislation that would require group health \nplans to treat mental health benefits as generously as they do surgical \nor medical benefits. If Paul were here this morning, he would remind us \nhow crucially important this is to millions of Americans. He and Sheila \nnever faltered on this issue.\n  I can think of no better way to honor Paul's memory and to complete \nhis legacy than to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act in this Congress. This bill passed the Senate \noverwhelmingly in the last Congress. It was attached to the \nappropriations bill in Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nSubcommittee. We took it to conference and the conferees would not \nagree to adopt it, but we were given assurances this would be \naddressed. Paul Wellstone was given assurances this would be addressed, \nthat we would pass it in a form--maybe not in an appropriations bill--\nbut pass it in a form that would then go to the House.\n  The bill today is supported by an overwhelming number of Senators. \nMadam President, 67 Senators now are supporting this bill, Republicans \nand Democrats, including 18 Republicans--at least that is my count on \nit anyway. So with that many supporting the bill, you would think we \nwould not have much problem getting it through. The American people \nwant this bill desperately. They have waited too long for its passage.\n  According to the Surgeon General's report, mental disorders \ncollectively account for 15 percent of the overall burden of disease \nfrom all causes, and it is even more than the burden associated with \nall forms of cancer in our society. And yet, how many people burdened \nwith mental disorders cannot get the help they need because their \ninsurance carrier does not cover it and they cannot afford it?\n  We all know what happens. We know what happens when people have \nmental problems and they are not treated--things degenerate, families \nbreak up, domestic abuse happens, people lose their lives. Sometimes \npeople are thrown in prison for long periods of time because in the \nbeginning they did not get mental health treatment.\n  I have seen some figures that indicate that close to half of the \npeople serving long-term prison sentences today are there because they \nhave mental disorders--depression, schizophrenia, bipolar illnesses--\nwhich led them through a series of stages that culminated in probably \nsome heinous crime. But in the beginning they did not get the mental \nhealth they needed.\n  So we have waited too long. It is critical we find an opportunity to \nbring up this bill and pass it before we adjourn this year.\n  Next week, the HELP Committee, of which I am a member, will be \nmarking up legislation that will provide for parity in insurance \ncoverage for recreational activities, such as riding a motorcycle or \nskiing. In other words, your insurance carrier has to give you the same \ncoverage for any kind of injury that would happen to you if you were \nskiing or riding a motorcycle, or something like that, as if it \nhappened purely accidentally some other way. It begs credulity that \nsomehow we can cover that but cannot give mental health parity to \npeople who, through no fault of their own, are suffering from mental \nillness in our country.\n  It is this Senator's intention to try to attach this bill to this \npiece of legislation. We have waited too long. I have been hearing all \nyear that soon we are going to bring up this bill. We have 67 Senators \non it. We have waited too long. It is the legacy of Paul Wellstone. We \nare going to get it passed. And yet, days go by, weeks go by, months go \nby, and nothing happens.\n  Now, I am too respectful of the Senate and of the agreements that are \nreached here to ask unanimous consent that we bring it up and pass it \ntoday. Some have suggested we do that in honor of Paul Wellstone, but I \nknow that most Senators are not present. We are not voting today.\n  But I will say this. There will be some time before we leave this \nyear when I intend to bring up the Mental Health Equitable Treatment \nAct and seek a vote on it, either through committee or on the floor, \nand somehow try to get it into a conference with the House before the \nyear ends.\n  President Bush said last spring that he supported mental health \nparity. So if the White House supports it and the President supports \nit, and we have so many Senators and Members of the House support it, \nwhat is stopping us?\n  I know some of the big insurance companies and others are kind of \nopposed to it, but all of the studies we have seen show this is cost-\neffective. According to SAMHSA, undertreated and untreated mental \ndisorders are costing this Nation over $200 billion a year in lost \nwork, crimes, and incarceration. It is a huge impact on our society, \nand we have to respond. That is why we have to bring up this bill and \nget it passed.\n  I can think of no better time in which to talk about it--and to \nstate, unequivocally, we are going to have a vote on this bill this \nyear--than on this the first anniversary of the death of our beloved \ncolleague, Paul Wellstone, his wife, and those who were with them on \nthat tragic day.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, a number of us have come to the floor \ntoday to remember and celebrate someone most of us knew and many of us \nloved. Paul Wellstone believed that politics is about more than money; \nit is about more than power. As he said so often, in the last analysis \npolitics is what we create by what we do, by what we hope for, by what \nwe dare to imagine. Paul Wellstone dared to imagine so much.\n  There is a quote he loved from the famous abolitionist, Wendell \nPhillips. One day, after Phillips had given a speech, a friend told \nhim: Wendell, you were on fire.\n  Phillips replied: Brother, I'm on fire because I have mountains of \nice before me to melt.\n  Paul Wellstone saw good in everyone, including people whose politics \nhe disagreed with strongly and who disagreed just as strongly with him, \nbut Paul also saw injustice and he had the fire and the conviction to \nend it.\n  He used his wit, his charm, his astonishing organizing abilities and \nevery ounce of his hyperkinetic energy to fight for people with few \nchampions in places of power. He fought for family farmers on the edge \nof foreclosure. He fought for workers facing layoffs, for older people \ntrying to decide which prescription to fill this month. He and Sheila, \nhis indispensable partner, fought for women and children threatened by \nviolence. He fought for teachers and coal miners, for Vietnam veterans. \nHe fought for immigrant parents who work at less than minimum wage jobs \nand who worry about not being able to give their children what they \nneed. He listened to them and looked them in the eye, and when he did \nhe used to say he saw his own parents. He gave voice to the voiceless. \nHe demanded fairness for those to whom life had been unfair. He gave \npeople hope and courage.\n  He himself had that rarest sort of courage. It was a moral courage. \nEven when he knew the vote was likely to be\n\n[[Page S13199]]\n\n99 to 1, he was not afraid to speak and vote his conscience. It was a \nreflection of his respect for the people who elected him, that he \ntrusted they would respect him for doing what he believed was right.\n  Saturday we mark the 1-year anniversary of the plane crash on the \nIron Range that claimed the lives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, their \nbeloved middle child, Marcia Wellstone Marcus, their campaign aides and \nfriends, Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapic, Will McLaughlin, and their pilots, \nRichard Conry and Michael Guess.\n  To keep their parents' work alive, Paul and Sheila's other two \nchildren, Mark and David, have started a progressive democracy \norganization. Through their advocacy, which they call, appropriately, \nWellstone Action, the spirit of Paul and Sheila is very much alive.\n  If you go to the Wellstone Action Web site, you can read hundreds of \nmessages from people the Wellstones inspired. One is from John Nichols, \nthe editorial page editor of The Capital Times newspaper in Madison, \nWI, and the Washington correspondent for The Nation magazine. Mr. \nNichols was in rural Wisconsin at a conference of family farm \nadvocates. He had just finished giving the keynote address about the \nneed for activists to go into politics when the news came. When he told \nthe audience, he wrote:\n\n       Cries of, ``No'' and ``My God, my God'' filled the room. \n     Grown men felt for tables to keep their balance. Husbands and \n     wives hugged one another and everyone began an unsuccessful \n     effort to choke back tears. People wept in silence until \n     finally a woman began to recite the Lord's Prayer for the son \n     of Russian Jewish immigrants who had touched the lives and \n     heart of solid Midwestern Catholic and Lutheran farmers who \n     do not think of themselves as having many friends in \n     Congress.''\n\n  Another message is from a man who was a junior at St. Cloud State \nUniversity in Minnesota. When he volunteered to help on Paul's first \nand improbable Senate campaign in 1990, they met when Paul visited the \ncampus for a Fourth of July parade. He writes:\n\n       It was stifling hot that day in St. Cloud--at least 95 \n     degrees with stick-to-your-shirt humidity. The plan was for \n     the two staffers and me to hand out Wellstone literature \n     while Paul would walk along and wave to the crowd. Much to my \n     amazement, Paul proceeded to run--not walk, not even jog, but \n     to run from left to right, for the entire two-mile route, \n     which took about an hour to complete--trying to shake the \n     hand of every single parade-goer.\n       Almost no one knew who he was--and most probably weren't \n     likely Wellstone voters, anyway. Didn't matter. He even said \n     that to people . . .\n       ``Vote for me or vote for someone else. Just make sure you \n     vote in November.'' He was always moving, always smiling, \n     always talking.\n\n  This former campaign volunteer wrote that when he got back to his \ndorm room he called a few friends and told them: You wouldn't believe \nthe guy I just met. I don't think he has a prayer of winning but, by \nGod, it is not going to be for lack of effort.\n  In the last few years Paul didn't run much. He had that pronounced \nlimp that he and his doctors first attributed to old wrestling injuries \nbut that turned out to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis. Even though \nhe was in pain most of the time, his illness never dulled his sense of \nhumor. He joked that at least he had gotten a progressive disease.\n  His efforts never flagged. Until the end he gave every ounce of \nenergy he had to try to bring hope and help to others.\n  I have been told there is a tradition in Judaism, on the first \nanniversary of the death of someone you love, you pray his soul will \nfind proper rest. Well, I loved--I loved Paul Wellstone. But it is \nstill hard to imagine him at rest. I know, with absolute certainty, he \nwould not want us to mark this first anniversary by resting or by \ntalking. How many times did we hear Paul say:\n\n       Intentions are good. But it's not intentions that count. \n     What counts is action.\n\n  One of the injustices that made Paul Wellstone the most angry, that \noffended him the most deeply, was the stigma attached to mental illness \nand the discrimination and suffering people with mental health problems \nsuffer as a result of that stigma. He thought it was cruel that people \nwith mental health problems very often received lesser care than those \nwith physical health problems. He was outraged by the terrible toll \nsuch discrimination often takes on the people with mental illness, and \ntheir families.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 486\n\n  So, Madam President, now, in the name of Paul Wellstone, I ask \nunanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 486, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I am told at the request and on behalf of the majority leader and \nothers on the Republican side, there is an objection to this \nlegislation. I acknowledge that and I present that objection on behalf \nof the majority leader at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Words alone are just not a fitting tribute to Paul \nWellstone, It is the action that counts. I was deeply moved by Senator \nDomenici's beautiful eulogy for Paul last fall at the memorial for the \nWellstones in Washington. In that eulogy Senator Domenici vowed to do \neverything he could to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act this year. He has worked very hard to keep that promise \nand we thank him for it. He and Senator Kennedy introduced the Paul \nWellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act 8 months ago in the \nearly days of this session. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of \nSenators Domenici and Kennedy and many others, despite the support of \n66 Senators, two-thirds of this Senate, including the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, despite the fact that the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly last year to pass this measure as an amendment to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act remains stuck in committee today because of \nopposition from the insurance industry and its backers.\n  The insurance industry claims incorrectly that requiring insurers to \ntreat mental illness the same way as they treat physical illness will \ndrive up premiums so high that more people will lose their health \ninsurance. That is not true. Those are the same kinds of scare tactics \nwe have heard from that industry on other occasions.\n  As another of our departed friends, Senator Moynihan, used to say, \neveryone is entitled to their own opinion but they are not entitled to \ntheir own set of facts.\n  The truth is, two highly respected organizations have analyzed the \nPaul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act. The private \naccounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts the bill would \nincrease health insurance premiums by 1 percent--1 percent. That works \nout to $1.32 per month. I think most families would think that was a \nvery good deal. The Congressional Budget Office predicts an even \nsmaller increase, nine-tenths of 1 percent.\n  We also know from experience that requiring mental health parity in \ninsurance has a negligible, if any, effect on premiums.\n  In 1999, President Clinton signed an executive order giving the 8 \nmillion Federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan \nthe same protections the Wellstone bill would extend to others.\n  On the website of the Federal Office of Personnel Management, there \nis a list of ``frequently asked questions'' about mental health and \nsubstance abuse parity under the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan. This is what that website says:\n\n       Recent advancements in the treatment and management of \n     mental illness have left no justifiable rationale for \n     disparate treatment of mental illness. The National \n     Institutes of Mental Health informed us that most diagnoses \n     have well-established biological bases, diagnoses are \n     reliable, and treatment is effective and affordable.\n\n  The website goes on to say:\n\n       A growing body of research and actual industry experiences \n     indicate that parity can be implemented without substantially \n     increasing premiums, as long as it is coupled with efforts to \n     manage the benefits.\n\n  Those are the facts.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity Act, which was also \nsponsored by Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici. The 1996 act says that \ngroup health plans sponsored by employers with 50 or more workers \ncannot place annual or lifetime dollars limits on mental health \nbenefits that are more restrictive than their limits for physical \nhealth care.\n\n[[Page S13200]]\n\n  Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici may have seemed like unlikely allies \nto some, but they shared a deep bond. They had both seen close family \nmembers struggle with serious mental illness.\n  So have many others. Fifty-four million Americans suffer from mental \nillness.\n  They include Republicans, Democrats and people who don't care a whit \nabout party labels. No family is untouched by mental illness.\n  Four days ago I received an email from a man in Sioux Falls. His name \nis Jamie Snyder.\n  His wife Bonnie suffered severe abuse in her first marriage and, as a \nresult, she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Nine years \nago, her doctor and two other doctors--including the head of the \nAmerican Psychological Association in South Dakota--said she needed to \nbe hospitalized.\n  Unfortunately, a doctor who worked for Jamie Snyder's employer, which \nwas self-insured--a doctor who was hundreds of miles away in another \nState and who never laid eyes on Bonnie Snyder--ruled that she didn't \nneed to be hospitalized. So the Snyder's were left with an $8,000 \nhospital bill.\n  Jamie Snyder tried for years to resolve this dispute with his \nemployer. When that failed, he hired an attorney and went to court--\nonly to be told that he couldn't bring a claim because too much time \nhad passed.\n  Then he started getting calls from bill collectors. In desperation, \nhe signed an agreement with a collection agency that charges exorbitant \ninterest rates. If he misses a payment for any reason, the agency \ngarnishes his wages and adds huge penalties.\n  Since 1996, Jamie Snyder has paid $8,000 on his initial $8,000 bill. \nYet today, he still owes the collection agency $15,950.\n  Bonnie Snyder still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and \nnow, on top of that, depression and agoraphobia. But she doesn't want \nto get counseling because she doesn't want to add to her family's debt.\n  The irony is that she has been on full disability since 1992. The \ngovernment would rather pay her disability every month than see that \nshe gets the help she needs to return to work and a full life.\n  Another family in Sioux Falls has a daughter who was always outgoing, \nsocially active--a straight-A student. When she was a freshman in high \nschool, she won debate competitions.\n  When she was a sophomore, she told her mother, ``I'm a failure'' and \nadmitted she had thought about suicide. It took 4 months to get an \nappointment with a psychiatrist. Eventually, the young woman received \ntreatment in another State. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n  Despite that diagnosis, the insurance company refused to pay for her \ntreatment, so her mother was forced to take out a $20,000 mortgage on \ntheir home. After a long fight, the insurance company finally paid the \nbill.\n  Today, that young woman is a freshman in college. Medications help \nher control her illness. But they cost $3,000 a month.\n  She will probably need to take the medications for the rest of her \nlife.\n  She is covered under her mother's health plan--for now. But that \nwon't always be the case.\n  She and her mother worry about what will happen when she has to leave \nher mother's policy. Will she be able to get affordable insurance on \nher own?\n  If so, will it pay for the mental health care she needs to stay \nhealthy?\n  That young woman knows about the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act. She tracks its progress on the Internet.\n  She is counting on us to do the right thing and help end the stigma \nand discrimination that makes it even harder for her to live with a \ntough disease.\n  There is another young woman in college who is watching what we do on \nthis bill. I know her. Her name is Erica Gitis-Miles. She is a junior \nat South Dakota State University, my alma mater.\n  Erica's birth mother drank heavily during her pregnancy and Erica has \nfetal alcohol syndrome as a result. Erica was neglected by her birth \nmother and severely abused by her birth mother's boyfriend. She was in \nand out of 13 foster care placements by the time she was 4 years old. \nShe was adopted into a loving home when she was 7.\n  Fetal alcohol syndrome causes serious brain damage. Most people \nstruck with that illness also have serious mental health problems.\n  Erica suffers recurrent depression. A year ago, during a serious \ndepression, Erica cut herself. The doctors who treated her decided that \nshe might be a danger to herself, so Erica was ordered held in a mental \nhealth unit for 72 hours.\n  Her parent's insurance company refused to pay for the \nhospitalization. They said Erica chose to hurt herself, so it was not \ntheir responsibility to pay for her care. So Erica and her parents are \nstuck with the bill.\n  She says she is fortunate. Her father is a medical doctor. But she \nworries about all the families who aren't able to help themselves as \nthey helped her. Who, she asks, will help them?\n  The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 was an important step forward. \nBut we know that discrimination persists. Insurers have found new ways \nto restrict mental health benefits.\n  They continue to discriminate by limiting visits, and requiring \nhigher co-pays and deductibles. And some even continue to impose lower \nannual and lifetime spending limits for mental illness--and make little \neffort to deny it.\n  The results can be devastating: unemployment, broken homes, shattered \nlives, poverty, poor school performance--even suicide.\n  A report earlier this year by the GAO showed that at least 12,000 \nparents a year are forced to give up custody of their children because \nthey cannot get them the mental health care they need. What family \nvalues is that?\n  Wellstone Action has made passing the Paul Wellstone Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act its sole legislative priority for this year.\n  The Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act also has the \nsupport of 274 national organizations, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the Alzheimer's Association, the National PTA, the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America, Catholic Charities, The \nNational Association of Counties, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Nurses Association, the American Association of Pastoral \nCounselors, The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the National \nRural Health Association, the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome and many other groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete list be printed in the \nCongressional Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  274

More than a year and a half ago, in a speech at the \nUniversity of New Mexico with Senator Domenici by his side, President \nBush said:\n\n       Our country must make a commitment: Americans with mental \n     illness deserve our understanding and they deserve excellent \n     care. They deserve a health care system that treats their \n     illnesses with the same urgency as physical illness.\n\n  In the great consensus-seeking spirit of Paul Wellstone, I must say I \nagree with the President. I appreciate his words. But words alone will \nnot solve this problem. We urge the President to join us, help us take \nup and pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act \nnow, this year.\n  Paul was the champion of many causes, but no cause was more dear, \nmore personal to him than making sure people with mental illness are \ntreated fairly, are treated with dignity. Intentions are fine, but it \nis the actions that count. Millions of American families are counting \non us to act for mental health parity. Let us agree to do it now as a \ntribute to Paul Wellstone, and let us keep his spirit alive.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I come to the floor to close this week \nbut more importantly to address and continue the comments and remarks \nthat have been made with regard to the death on October 25th last year \nof Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Senator Wellstone's plane, the plane he was flying in, was lost in \nthe Minnesota wilderness on that day, October 25, with all eight \npassengers aboard, having lost their lives in a tragic accident: \nSenator Wellstone, his wife Shelia, his daughter Marcia, staff members, \nthe two pilots.\n  Today, on the eve of that sad anniversary, we pause to remember \nSenator Wellstone and his remarkable, his tremendous contribution to \nthis body and, indeed, to the United States of America.\n  I have tremendous respect for what he demonstrated both on the floor \nof the Senate and the many committee hearings we both attended, \nespecially the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, where \nhe focused so much of his attention and energy on mental health. I \nrespected his tenacity, his intelligence, his commitment, his humor, \nhis integrity.\n  He was a kind man, a gentle man, never mean-spirited or one to make \npersonal attacks.\n  In this body, you look and you categorize certain people in terms of \nimpressions. And the one word that summarizes my impression of Paul \nWellstone is that he was a real idealist in the very best sense of the \nword--principled and tough, a stalwart defender of his ideals.\n  In Minnesota and across the country, people will be celebrating Paul \nwith a Wellstone World Music Day tribute. Here in the Senate, I think \nit is fitting we also acknowledge Paul's tireless work on behalf of \nthose for whom he fought from early in the morning till late at night, \nthose people who suffer from mental illness. He was their unflagging \nchampion and mightily advanced the concept of the cause which, as a \nphysician, I cherish; that is, fairness and equity.\n  I share his commitment to this important issue, and I look forward to \nworking with Senator Domenici and Senators Daschle and Kennedy; the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Gregg; indeed, all of my colleagues to ensure that mental \nhealth is appropriately addressed in this Congress.\n  I do join with my colleagues and the people of Minnesota in a real \ncelebration of the life and the ideals of Senator Paul Wellstone. He \nwas a wonderful man, a remarkable man, and an outstanding Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Paul Wellstone was an extraordinary \nleader with a common touch. His dedication to the well-being of average \nAmericans was unparalleled in Congress. He believed that all of our \ncitizens, no matter how humble their beginnings or difficult their \nplight, had an equal right to happy, healthy, and full lives.\n  There was no issue more dear to his heart than ensuring access to \nhealth care for people with mental illness. He spent so much of his \ntime here in the Senate working to improve the care and treatment they \nreceive. For them, Paul Wellstone was their champion, their Senator. \nAnd in the Senate, Paul was our conscience, our guiding light.\n  Paul worked with Senator Pete Domenici on legislation to end the \nshameful discrimination in our society against mental illness. After \nSenator Wellstone's tragic death one year ago, Senator Domenici has \ncontinued with great diligence to urge the Senate to act. But the bill, \nthe Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act, is \nstill being held hostage by the insurance industry and their allies.\n  We know that large numbers of Americans across the country with \nmental illness constantly face stigma and misunderstanding because of \ntheir illness. Even worse, they are often denied the treatment that can \ncure or relieve their debilitating conditions because they are victims \nof discrimination too. It is unacceptable that we continue to tolerate \nactions by insurance companies that deny medical care for mental \nillness, even though the same insurers readily cover treatment for \nphysical illnesses that are more costly, less debilitating, and less \ncurable. Mental illnesses are often treatable and curable, and it's \ntime to end the widespread discrimination against them.\n  Equal treatment of the mentally ill is not just an insurance issue. \nIt is a civil rights issue, too. Mental health parity is an issue of \nsimple justice. The need for action is clear. One in five Americans \nwill suffer some form of mental illness this year--but only a third \nwill receive treatment. According to a report of the Surgeon General, \nat least 4 million children suffer from a mental illness that results \nin significant impairments at home, at school, and with other children. \nFamilies must often make impossible choices about how to pay for the \ncare their child needs to live a normal life.\n\n[[Page S13203]]\n\n  It is tragic when a child is diagnosed with any illness. It is heart \nwrenching for parents to watch their children suffer. The tragedy is \neven greater when insurance companies deny treatment for a child solely \nbecause the illness is a mental illness. It's wrong for insurance \ncompanies to apply modern medicine to physical diseases, but leave \nmental health in the dark ages.\n  Earlier this year, we received petitions signed by 30,000 young \npeople asking Congress to provide affordable coverage for mental health \ntreatment. The petitions were signed at concerts held across the \ncountry to raise awareness for suicide prevention.\n  It is long past time to end insurance discrimination, and guarantee \nall those with mental illness the coverage they deserve. The American \npeople should not have to wait any longer. Paul's committed family \nmembers should not have to wait any longer. The Senate should not \ncontinue to delay action on this bill. It is time to pass it, and bring \nfirst class medicine to millions of Americans who have been second \nclass patients for too long.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, exactly 1 year ago tomorrow, October \n25, our Nation lost Senator Paul Wellstone, a truly great American and \na hero to many. I remember that tragic day as if it were yesterday. The \ninitial shock and pain of losing Paul has been transformed into a \nprofound sadness akin to losing a parent--a brother. You never forget \nwhat they meant to your life. A year ago and to this day, millions of \nAmericans still grieve and share this deep sense of loss.\n  I served with Paul for only 2 short years, but in that brief time, he \nbecame one of my closest friends. His enthusiasm was infectious, his \nvalues, uncompromised and his honor, unquestioned. His loss was a \npersonal and painful one for me, and I miss him every day.\n  Indeed, Paul's loss was a tragedy for the entire United States \nSenate. As most would agree, there was no Senator quite like Paul \nWellstone. He was unique. He left a void in this body that no one will \never fill.\n  What was it about Paul that made him so unique? It's hard to point to \nany one thing.\n  Perhaps it was his sincerity. Paul was a real, genuine person who \nnever tried to be someone other than who he was. He said what he \nthought. He was the same man in the back rooms as under the glaring \nlights of the Senate floor. Paul was Paul.\n  Perhaps it was his humility. To say that Paul didn't put on airs \nwould be an understatement. There simply wasn't an ounce of pretense to \nPaul--none. He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He wasn't impressed \nwith himself. He should have been, but he wasn't.\n  Perhaps it was his empathy. Paul cared about other people, and he \ncared deeply. He spent his life helping others. It's what made him \ntick. It's what drove his politics. It's how he lived his life.\n  Perhaps more than his sincerity, more than his humility, and even \nmore than his empathy, what made Paul--Paul was his passion.\n  To this day, Paul Wellstone was the most passionate public servant I \nhave ever met. In a day and age when it is difficult to reconcile a \npublic servant's actions with their statements, Paul was truly unique. \nHis stirring words--``We should never separate the lives we live from \nthe words we speak'' were the compass by which he set his course. He \ndidn't just speak about helping others, he did it. He didn't just \npreach about righting wrongs, he did it. He wasn't just talking about \nthe need for social justice, human rights, civil rights, workers' \nrights, health care, education, environmental protection, and political \nreform. Paul was the most committed, compassionate, and tireless \nadvocate for these causes I have ever met.\n  Paul's passions defined him as a human being, and you could not be \naround this Chamber for long without witnessing those passions first \nhand. He would come to this Chamber to speak, and it wouldn't be long \nbefore his voice would rise, his fist would pound the desk, and his \nfinger would jab the air. When Paul spoke, he dominated the Chamber, \nand we listened.\n  No, we will not see another person like Paul Wellstone for a very \nlong time. And this body, and our Nation, will be the worse for it.\n  In many ways, Paul was the conscience and soul of the Senate. When he \nsaw something that wasn't right, he would speak out. He didn't wait for \na cadre of his colleagues to approve. Often, that meant he upset some \nof us. Frequently, it meant he upset lobbyists and special interests. \nBut, for millions of working Americans, Paul was the one voice on which \nthey could always depend. And, they were grateful for him. Sometimes, \nall it took was Paul Wellstone to raise a wrong--to bring it into the \nsunlight for all to see--for it to be made right. He truly was our \nconscience and our soul, and he made a difference.\n  That is why I wanted to come to the floor to honor Paul's memory. \nThese speeches are not what he would have sought. He probably would \nhave been embarrassed. That said, he would have hoped we would come to \nadvocate his causes--none more personal, none more passionate, than his \nquest for mental health parity.\n  Paul Wellstone was not only a hero. He was a model for all of us who \nare representatives of all the people. It's only right that we honor \nhim here in this Chamber--where he stood for so many. Remembering who \nhe was and what he stood for can only make us better Senators.\n  Sadly, unavoidably, it also reminds us of the terrible loss that this \nSenate and our Nation suffered on that heartbreaking day 1 year ago.\n  Paul--like all of us--I was blessed to know you and will always \nremember that you said, ``Politics is what we create by what we do, \nwhat we hope for and what we dare to imagine.'' Thank you for daring to \nhope and imagine. I miss you. We all do.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in honor of \nour late friend and colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, and to remember \nhis wife, Sheila, their daughter, Marcia, the campaign staff and the \npilots who died in a plane crash one year ago.\n  I speak today to praise Paul's work and to praise his passion, to \npraise his vision, and to praise his legacy. He was truly a great \nSenator and a great human being. His love of all people was his guiding \nprinciple. He is very much missed in the Senate, in this country, and \nespecially in the great State of Minnesota.\n  Born in Washington, D.C., Paul began a journey that would take him \nfrom Virginia, to North Carolina, to Minnesota, and back to Washington, \nD.C. to serve in the United States Senate. His life experiences along \nthe way back here developed and defined his political vision. Seeing \nhis father cope with Parkinson's gave him insight into the failures of \nour health care system, and the struggle with his brother's mental \nillness fueled his desire to raise awareness and expand care for mental \nillness.\n  From the beginning of his service in the Senate, Paul left an \nimpressive legacy. In his first Senate campaign in 1990, Paul was the \nonly candidate to beat an incumbent Senator. During this campaign, he \nwas the underdog. He was an unknown candidate challenging an incumbent; \nhe was outspent 6-to-1 and he had never held elected office in his \nlife.\n  Despite these odds, however, Paul battled, town by town, to be \nelected Senator from Minnesota. He traveled throughout the State on an \nold green school bus, making stump speeches and inspiring grassroots \norganization. In many ways, his campaign for Senate is an allegory for \nhis entire political life. He was often viewed as the underdog, \nfighting for the little guys, against moneyed and powerful special \ninterests, refusing to give up or accept defeat.\n  Paul once stated ``I still believe Government can be used as a force \nfor good in people's lives.'' A simple but profound statement, it \nguided him in his journey in public service. Whether he was advocating \nfor universal healthcare, or fighting for victims of domestic violence, \nhe truly believed that he, and the United States Senate, could do good \nin people's lives.\n  One need only listen to the tributes from the Members of this body to \ntruly see that Paul himself was also a force of good in people's lives. \nMany people that were opposed to Paul politically and philosophically \nstill respected him very much. Last year, Senator Domenici, an ally of \nPaul's in the fight for mental health parity, made a beautiful \nstatement when he found out Paul had\n\n[[Page S13204]]\n\ndied. Senator Lott, too, gave a wonderful tribute to Paul, praising his \ncompassion and his optimism. It is truly a tribute to the character of \nPaul Wellstone that he was so respected, even by people who disagreed \nwith him.\n  Paul loved the Senate and the Senators with whom he served. He was a \nmaster at delivering moving speeches, usually speaking when there were \nno Members in the Chamber to hear him speak. I remember that as he \nwould speak, he would start to speak at his desk, not far from my own \ndesk, and would walk back and forth behind the desks, up and down the \naisle. He could not contain his excitement or his passion.\n  In his book, ``Conscience of a Liberal,'' Paul wrote this about Diane \nFeldman, a member of his campaign staff:\n\n       She told me that Minnesotans did not agree with me on every \n     issue, but many of them admired my courage and integrity. I \n     hope and pray that Minnesotans will always feel this way \n     about me.\n\n  I believe that Minnesotans do admire and respect him for his courage \nand integrity. Most people that have met Paul Wellstone admire and \nrespect him for his courage and integrity.\n  Paul was called a number of things in his career as a Senator: ``the \nhappy warrior,'' ``the soul of the Senate,'' ``embarrassingly \nliberal,'' ``Senator softie.'' But I am truly honored to be able to \ncall him a friend, and I consider myself lucky to have served in this \ndistinguished body with such a great human being.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, 1 year ago the Senate, Minnesota, and \nour Nation suffered a great loss. I remember that day clearly. I was in \nGreat Falls attending the Montana Farmers Union Convention. I was in \nsuch disbelief.\n  Senator Wellstone, his wife Sheila, daughter Marcia, three of his \nstaffers Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapic and Will McLaughlin, and two pilots \ntragically lost their lives in a plane crash in northern Minnesota.\n  Senator Wellstone, known to everyone simply as Paul, served his state \nof Minnesota for 12 years. Paul was a special person for whom I had the \nhighest personal regard. Though I may not have always agreed with Paul \non all the issues, I always respected him as he expressed his views \nwith such passion and conviction.\n  Paul was frequently seen on the Senate floor giving impassioned \nspeeches on different issues. He was always fighting for the little \nguy, the underdog. Whether it was providing disaster assistance for \nfarmers and ranchers, working mental health parity, or helping the less \nfortunate in our society, Paul was always fighting for what he believed \nin. I was fortunate to sit with Paul on the Senate Agricultural \nCommittee. Though Paul may not have sat at the head of the table, he \nmade it clear that his message was important and that everyone heard \nit. I was proud and grateful to have Paul on my team fighting for \nnatural disaster assistance for farmers in 2001 and 2002. Minnesota, \nMontana, and our Nation's agriculture producers benefited from his \nfight throughout the debate.\n  Paul embraced his work the same way he embraced his life and \nrelationship with Sheila. With passion, dedication and conviction. I \nadmired him greatly.\n  Paul loved his State and he loved his job as Senator, but most of all \nhe loved his wife Sheila. And in order to understand Paul, one had to \nunderstand Paul and Sheila's relationship.\n  Paul and Sheila were a package deal. She was his world. I often saw \nthe two of them walking the halls of the Senate together. And Paul \nalways insisted that Sheila get credit for his successes. She was his \nrock. She was his life. She was his everything. It seems most \nappropriate that Paul and Sheila left this life together. He would have \nbeen lost without her.\n  On the 1-year anniversary of his passing, Paul is sorely missed. The \nSenate is not the same without him. The floor is a little quieter. The \nhalls are no longer filled with his enthusiasm and passion for life and \njustice. Paul was a good man, a good senator, and a good friend. Paul \nWellstone is deeply missed.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it has been a year since we heard \nthe terrible news of Paul Wellstone's death and trudged through, with \nbroken hearts, the days and months that followed. Kind, compassionate, \na voice for those without a voice, a bundle of energy, Paul Wellstone \nwas unique, he was priceless, he was irreplaceable. When we learned of \nPaul's death, our grief was magnified by the deaths of the two women he \nloved most--his wife Sheila and his daughter Marcia--and by the deaths \nof his devoted aides, Tom Lapic, Will McLaughlin, and Mary McEnvoy.\n  Their loss still cuts deep. I vividly remember flying back from \nCalifornia to speak in the Senate about Paul, and being overcome by a \nsense of profound loss seeing the black shroud and flowers over the \ndesk he loved, the launching pad for his extraordinary, impassioned \nspeeches.\n  I want to read some of the statement I made that day, as what I said \nthen remains true for me now.\n  ``Paul was never afraid to speak out when it might be unpopular, nor \nwas he afraid to be on the losing side of a Senate vote. He had \ncourage. And when you told him that, when you said: `Paul, you have \ncourage,' he shrugged it off. He would say something like: `What else \ncould I do? It's just not right!' He would say that--determined, brave.\n  ``Paul was a powerful man. His power did not come from his physical \nstature. He was strong but he was slight of build. His power did not \ncome from generations of family wealth. He was not a man of moneyed \nwealth. His parents were immigrants: Leon and Minnie Wellstone. His \npower did not come from political connections. His connections were \nwith regular people.\n  ``Let me tell you where his power came. It came from a fierce \ndedication to justice and truth and honesty and righteousness. He gave \ncomfort and he gave hope to those he touched. And he gave them some of \nhis power--the power to see the possibilities of their own lives. Paul \ndied on his way to give comfort and hope to those facing death. He was \nflying to a funeral service.''\n  As his staff wrote at the time of his death, ``He was a passionate \nvisionary who never gave up hope that we could make the world a better \nplace for everyone; a committed fighter for social justice who gave a \nvoice to the voiceless; a man with a huge heart who lit up a room--and \nthe hearts of others when he walked in. He was a man who valued others \nfor who they were, not where they came from, or what they wore, or \ntheir position or social status. He was dedicated to the little guy in \na business dominated by the big guys.''\n  You cannot speak about Paul Wellstone without speaking about the \ncenter of his life--his wife Sheila, his children and grandchildren. \nPaul and Sheila were partners in the truest sense, and shared almost 40 \nyears of love and affection for each other. They were inseparable, and \nit was obvious to anyone who saw them together, they were deeply in \nlove. They were also partners in public service, and in their shared \nsense of idealism, values, and purpose. They died as they had lived--\ntogether, even probably holding hands.\n  Paul and Sheila adored their daughter Marcia, whose radiant smile \ncould light up the darkness, and doted on her very special child and \ntheir grandson, Joshua. They reveled in their sons David and Mark, and \nwere enormously proud of David's entrepreneurial spirit and the gift he \nhad at being a good father, and Mark's skill with Spanish and his \ntalent as a teacher in the classroom. All of their grandchildren--\nJoshua, Cari, Keith, Acacia, Sydney, and Matt--delighted them and \nbrought boundless joy to their lives.\n  Today we say to Paul again: We will give comfort and hope to those \nyou left behind by doing all that we can to continue your legacy and \nyour dream. What a gift you gave us all. You are impossible to replace. \nWe will always miss you.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today in memory of my dear \nfriend and colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone. A year ago today, the \nSenate--indeed, the Nation--suffered the tragic passing of Senator \nWellstone. With his loss, his efforts to establish full mental health \nparity were cut short. It is now time to\n\n[[Page S13205]]\n\nbuild on Senator Wellstone's historic achievements in this policy area \nand put an end to the discrimination faced by individuals with mental \nillness once and for all.\n  I was a proud cosponsor of the landmark Mental Health Parity Act, \nwhich Congress passed in 1996 at Senator Wellstone's urging. This law \nestablishes parity for annual and lifetime dollar limit coverage for \nmental health treatment. While its enactment marked an important \nvictory in the fight to provide greater mental health treatment \nbenefits, it is time to take the additional steps needed to truly \nprovide mental health parity for all Americans.\n  The Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of \n2003 (S. 486) requires health insurance coverage to provide equal \ncoverage of mental health benefits as it does for medical and surgical \nbenefits. This legislation will improve access to care for individuals \nwho are living with mental illness by closing the loopholes used by \ninsurance companies to limit coverage. I am a proud cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation. It should be the law. I call on Senate \nleadership to bring this bill up for a vote without delay as a fitting \ntribute to the memory of Senator Wellstone.\n  I also urge the Senate to address the current discrimination in \nMedicare that seriously restricts seniors' access to mental health \nbenefits. Under Medicare, seniors and people with disabilities pay a 20 \npercent copayment for all Part B services except for mental health care \nservices, for which patients are assessed a 50 percent copayment. In \nother words, when seniors visit a cardiologist for heart disease, an \nendocrinologist for diabetes treatment, or an oncologist for cancer \ntreatment, they pay a 20 percent copayment for the cost of the visit. \nIf, however, a senior citizen or a person with disabilities seeks \ntreatment for a debilitating and possibly life threatening mental \nillness, they pay for half of the cost of care out of their own \npockets. Consequently, Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are on \nfixed incomes, face an insurmountable barrier in seeking treatment that \ncould substantially improve or prolong their lives because of a \ndiscriminatory policy that treats mental health services and medical \nservices differently.\n  We need to put an end to what is essentially discrimination by \ndiagnosis. I, along with my colleague Senator Snowe, introduced \nlegislation that phases down the 50 percent copayment for mental health \ncare services to 20 percent over 6 years. This legislation, entitled \nthe Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act (S. 853), will \nestablish parity in the Medicare program and improve access to care for \nour senior and disabled beneficiaries living with mental illnesses.\n  In the memory of my dear friend, Senator Wellstone, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider this legislation, in addition to the Senator \nPaul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2003. Together, \nthese two bills will eliminate the stigma of mental heath and establish \nmental health parity in both the private and public sectors. I ask for \nyour support and hope that together we can fulfill Senator Wellstone's \npassionate vision by ending mental health discrimination for all \nindividuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13205-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2004\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nclarify language included in the Transportation, Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. My distinguished \ncolleague, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Shelby, worked to ensure that important funding \nwas provided for the Federal Aviation Administration to address the \nproblem of runway incursions at our Nation's airports.\n  I share his concern about reports of runway incursions and surface \nincidents. It is my hope that the FAA will use the funding provided to \nthem to test new technologies that could significantly improve this \nsituation. Testing at one of the 90 ``hot spot'' airports identified by \nthe FAA should include accurate and reliable non-cooperative sensors, \nsuch as millimeter wave sensors, that can form a distributed radar and \noptical identification local network. The technologies tested should \nalso include synchronized 2D and 3D graphic displays.\n  I would ask the chairman to clarify the funding provided by the \nsubcommittee to address runway incursion prevention devices at our \nNation's airports.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Indeed, my colleague from Mississippi is correct. The \nSenate bill does include funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to address problems of runway incursions, and it is my \nhope the FAA will perform testing as the Senator from Mississippi \ndescribed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you for clarifying this issue and \nfor your leadership and support in addressing this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13205-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13205-S13206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAIR COMPETITIVE BID PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The House passed FY04 Transportation bill contains a \nprovision to assist the States in initiating a Fair Competitive Bid \nProcedure for State-assisted intercity rail passenger operations. The \nobjective of the provision is to allow States the option of providing \ncompetitive intercity passenger rail. The House provision\n\n[[Page S13206]]\n\nprovides limited funding that will permit the Secretary of \nTransportation to initiate a new Fair Competitive Bid Procedure that \nthe States can utilize. The Secretary will then monitor the progress of \nthis demonstration and make monthly reports to the House and Senate \nCommittees on Appropriations.\n  I believe this is an excellent idea and was considering offering a \nsimilar amendment to this bill. However, I do not wish to delay the \nproceeding today, and this is already an item to be considered in \nconference.\n  I would like to know if the chairman has an opinion on the House \nState-assisted intercity rail service provision.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I share my colleague's support of a procedure that will \nencourage the States to initiate passenger service through a \ncompetitive bid process. I believe it is important that Congress \nexamine whether a competitive process can preserve and expand intercity \nrail passenger service at reasonable prices. I pledge to the Senator \nfrom Kansas that I will work with the House conferees to pursue a \nprovision that would introduce a uniform procedure to allow the States \nthe option of providing competitive rail passenger service.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

I appreciate the Senator's support, and I thank her for \nher leadership.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to make my colleagues aware of a project of \ngreat importance, not just to my constituents in Maine, but to the rest \nof the country as well. The existing border crossing connecting Calais, \nME to St. Stephen, New Brunswick is heavily congested and therefore \ncauses significant traffic delays and creates serious security concerns \nfor U.S. and Canadian travelers and cross-border commerce. The current \ncrossing is the eighth busiest commercial crossing on the Canadian \nborder and has seen truck traffic double over the last 10 years. Since \n199 the Maine Department of Transportation, along with the Federal \nHighway Administration and the General Services Administration, has \nengaged in a comprehensive National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, \nprocess to determine the location for a new, modern, efficient border \ncrossing. As part of the overall project, the General Services \nAdministration is responsible for designing and constructing a new \nborder station. The Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency, CCRA, will be \nresponsible for the design and construction of the border station on \nthe Canadian side of the river. The Maine Department of Transportation \nand New Brunswick Department of Transportation, and the Canadian \nCustoms and Revenue Agency have funding in place for their portions of \nthe design. Therefore, it is crucial that funding for the GSA portion \nof the project be appropriated so that design and construction work can \nbegin as soon as possible. I would ask that the Senator from Alabama \nwork with me to ensure that this project moves forward as quickly as \npossible. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Madam President, I express my support for the Terrorist \nFirearms Detection Act, a bill introduced earlier this week by Senator \nKennedy. Originally passed in 1988, and sometimes called the ``plastic \ngun'' law, this Federal law makes it illegal for any person to \nmanufacture, import, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive any \nfirearm that is not detectable by walk-through metal detectors or the \ntype of x-ray machines commonly used at airports.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the Congress has worked hard to improve the \nsecurity of our borders, airports, government buildings, and \ncommunities. However, in just over 2 months, on December 10, this \nessential common sense gun safety legislation is set to expire. The \nTerrorist Firearms Detection Act would permanently reauthorize the \nplastic gun law. Plastic guns, whose production has been endorsed by \nthe National Rifle Association, should only be used by our military and \nintelligence agencies and must never find their way back into our \ncommunities.\n  This legislation has the support of every major gun safety \norganization in the country, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent \nViolence United with the Million Mom March, Americans for Gun Safety, \nand the Violence Policy Center.\n  The overwhelming majority of my colleagues would agree that plastic \nguns pose a clear and present danger to our nation's aviation security, \nas well as governmental targets across the country. In fact, Pete \nShields, the former president of Handgun Control, the predecessor \norganization to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence, said it well in \ntestimony before the House Judiciary Committee in 1988.\n\n       Weapons which evade security devices put us all at risk. \n     Every airport, every courthouse, every public building which \n     relies on screening devices for security will no longer be \n     safe. At a time when our Nation is committing vast resources \n     and energies to stopping terrorism and protecting our \n     citizens abroad, we should not even consider making it easier \n     for terrorists to operate in our own country.\n\n  I urge my colleagues in the Congress to act quickly to enact this \nlegislation, and I also hope that President Bush will soon sign this \nimportant gun safety legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13206-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Earlier this month, two men were slain in Stevens County, Washington. \nRussell Charles Markvardsen, 52, and Matthew Lee Raynor, 32, were shot \nto death at close range with a shotgun in their cabin in the Onion \nCreek area. The two men previously lived in a log home that was \ndestroyed in a May 2002 fire that authorities investigated as a \npossible arson. At the time, the men told the Spokesman-Review \nnewspaper in Spokane that they suspected arson because of possible \nprejudice against their homosexuality.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13206-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13206-S13207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WORLD POPULATION AND WATER SCARCITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the week of October 20-25 has been \ndesignated as World Population Awareness Week with the theme of \n``Water: Our Most Precious Natural Resource.''\n  Because the world's 6 billion people are dependent on 1 percent of \nall the water on Earth, many fear a future where water scarcity will \nundermine political growth and lead to political and social unrest. \nOver the next 20 years the world's population is projected to increase \nto 7.2 billion, yet the average water supply is expected to drop by \none-third in that same time period. World population is expected to \nballoon to 9 billion before leveling off.\n  Despite the looming future of water scarcity, consumption is \nincreasing. The world's population has tripled in the past 100 years, \nbut water use by humans has multiplied six times. Without a global \ncommitment to sustainable water management, the world will see a large \nmajority of its population living in areas where basic water \nrequirements for drinking, cooking, or sanitation will be difficult or \nimpossible to meet.\n  Acting on the global consensus that water scarcity must be a top \ndevelopment priority, the Population Institute has decided to dedicate \nthe 19th World\n\n[[Page S13207]]\n\nPopulation Awareness Week to the issue of water.\n  More than 80 nations, 165 organizations, 201 mayors, and 22 Governors \nhave dedicated proclamations of World Population Awareness Week to \nhighlighting the critical issue of water. Illinois Governor Rod \nBlagojevich has made such a proclamation and I wish to call it to my \ncolleagues' attention. I ask unanimous consent the proclamation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Whereas, the world's population of 6.3 billion is projected \n     to rapidly continue to increase to increase to nearly 9 \n     billion before finally slowing down, and\n       Whereas, the population of the United States currently \n     exceeds 291 million, and it is estimated to increase to \n     nearly 600 million by the year 2100; and\n       Whereas, the Population Institute, founded in 1969, is an \n     independent, educational non-profit organization, dedicated \n     to achieving a more equitable balance between the world's \n     population, environment and resources; and\n       Whereas, since 1985, the Population Institute has organized \n     World Population Awareness Week to create public awareness of \n     the startling trends in population growth, the detrimental \n     effects that rapid population growth has on our planet, and \n     the urgent need for action; and\n       Whereas, the theme of World Population Awareness Week 2003 \n     is ``Water: Our Most Precious Resource,'' and\n       Whereas, water is fundamental to sustaining life; and\n       Whereas, 20 percent of the world's population currently \n     faces a water shortage, a figure expected to rise to 30 \n     percent by the year 2025:\n       Therefore, I, Rod R. Blagojevich, Governor of the State of \n     Illinois, do hereby proclaim October 20-25, 2003 as WORLD \n     POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK, and urge all citizens to conserve \n     water whenever and whenever they can, and further reflect on \n     ways to ensure adequate safe water supplies for future \n     generations.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The week will be marked by events taking place at \nuniversity campuses, community centers and civic institutions \nthroughout the State to teach the residents of Illinois about the \neffects of a crowded planet.\n  In many hot spots around the world, there is simply a shortage of \nwater. Some analysts predict that a major war over water is possible \nsometime in the future. Experts often cite the Middle East as an area \nwhere many water disputes could derail peace efforts or lead to another \nwar. But there are critical water disputes the world over, and, as \npopulation increases, and potable water becomes yet more scarce, \nviolent disputes over water become increasingly likely.\n  It is estimated that water shortages plague 20 percent of the world's \npopulation in at least 30 countries, and, it is estimated by 2025, as \nmuch as 30 percent of the world's population in 50 countries will face \nwater shortages.\n  Even in places where there is enough water, it often is not clean \nenough to drink. An estimated 1.2 billion around the world lack an \nadequate, safe water supply, and 2.3 billion lack adequate sanitation. \nIt is estimated that as many as 5 to 7 million people die every year \nfrom water-related diseases, including 2.2 million children under the \nage of 5.\n  Former Senator--and my friend and mentor--Paul Simon, has been a \nleader in the Senate and beyond in highlighting the need for better, \ncheaper ways to desalinate salt water. This is an area where improved \ntechnology has the potential to benefit millions of people and to help \ndefuse brewing conflicts.\n  Many nations have begun to depend on desalinated water. For example, \na number of Middle Eastern nations have come to depend in part on \ndesalination, and the city of Los Angeles obtains a significant \npercentage of its water from desalination plants. But the technology is \nstill expensive and out of reach for many nations, States, and \nmunicipalities.\n  But there are many ``low tech'' approaches that could conserve water \nin to promote the sustainable use of underground water aquifers, \nincluding drip irrigation or other agricultural practices that conserve \nwater, water distribution systems that reduce leakage and evaporation, \nsewage systems that reduce water use, and many other solutions. Some of \nthese solutions are expensive, but others require more changes in \nthinking and habits and a commitment of political determination than \nmoney.\n  That is why I want to bring this critical problem to my colleagues \nattention today. It is not hopeless. Awareness of the issue is the \nfirst step to implementing solutions, small and large, to be sure our \ndescendants inherit a peaceful world with an adequate and safe supply \nof our most basic necessity--water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13207-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13207-S13208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET ACCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, while the pharmaceutical industry is \nthe most profitable industry in the world, millions of uninsured and \nunderinsured Americans continue to struggle to afford medicines they \nneed when prices are out of reach.\n  The facts paint a disturbing picture. According to a 2002 Families \nUSA report, the pharmaceutical industry has been the most profitable \nindustry in the U.S. for the past 10 years, being five-and-one-half \ntimes more profitable than the average Fortune 500 companies. A Public \nCitizen June 2003 report found that in 2002, the top 10 drug companies \nnetted profits of $36 billion, or more than one-half of all profits for \nFortune 500 companies. While drug companies claim that their high \nprices support research and development one study found that eight \nmajor American pharmaceutical companies spent more than twice as much \non marketing and administrative costs than on research and development.\n  And while powerful drug manufacturers continue to bring in high \nprofits, American consumers continue to pay the highest prices in the \nworld--three to ten times more than other developed countries pay. \nSouth Dakotans cross the border every day to go to Canada in the hopes \nof purchasing lower-priced drugs that will prevent them from having to \nmake the tough decision of choosing between buying groceries or life-\nsaving medications.\n  And the recent actions of many of our State leaders indicate that \nAmericans are fed up with paying by far the highest dollar prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs that often times their tax dollars \nhelped to develop. State governments have resorted to taking matters \ninto their own hands: Maine now allows the State to negotiate fairer \ndrug prices for all residents using the buying power of its Medicaid \nprogram, several States including Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota are \nexploring the possibility of importing prescription drugs from Canada \nfor State employees, and Minnesota's Attorney General filed a lawsuit \nagainst GlaxoSmithKline alleging that the pharmaceutical company is \nviolating antitrust laws by ``spearheading an industry-wide \nconspiracy'' to prevent U.S. residents from reimporting U.S.-made \nprescription drugs at a lower cost from Canada.\n  The American people are fed up. They are demanding that Congress end \nthe ``sweetheart deal'' that gives the powerful pharmaceutical industry \na captive market. A recent poll taken by the Washington Post and ABC \nNews found that two-thirds of Americans support the legal importation \nof FDA approved prescription drugs and I have joined several of my \ncolleagues to introduce the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act which will \ndo just that. I thank Senators Dorgan, Stabenow, Dayton, Pryor, Levin, \nFeingold, Snowe, Jeffords, and McCain for staying committed and working \nwith me on this very important issue.\n  This bill, which is the companion to House reimportation bill H.R. \n2427 that passed with broad bipartisan support, will finally provide \nAmerican consumers with immediate access to FDA-approved medicines in \nCanada, as well as other industrialized nations. It contains strong \nsafety protections that will ensure that the U.S. drug supply remains \nsafe. Innovative techniques such as counterfeit-resistant packaging and \ndrug wholesaler pharmaceutical shipment testing will ensure this \nsafety.\n  American consumers are already importing $500 million to $1 billion \nin prescription medicines from Canada and elsewhere. This is on top of \nthe already $13 billion U.S. made prescription drugs already being \nreimported by pharmaceutical manufacturers under the authority found in \nthe Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1988. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that the reimportation provisions found in this \nbill could provide approximately $40 billion over 10 years in savings \nto\n\n[[Page S13208]]\n\nconsumers. We need to bring these savings to the American people and \nfinally eliminate the price disparity experienced in this country by \npassing a strong drug reimportation law and ensuring that it is \nactually implemented. Please support this important legislation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise to express my strong opposition \nto S. 3.\n  This Senate is poised to criminalize a medical decision made between \na woman and her physician. Despite claims to the contrary, the \nlegislation before us today will ban many abortions routinely conducted \nin the second trimester because the simple truth is that ``partial-\nbirth abortion'' is a political term, not a medical one.\n  The conference report returned to us by the conferees is different \nfrom the legislation passed by the Senate back in March in one critical \nway--it is stripped of Senator Harkin's amendment affirming the law of \nthe land--Roe v. Wade. This resolution made it clear that the policy of \nthe Senate is for abortion to be legal, safe, and rare. And the \nconferees stripped out this language, making it clear that their true \nintent is to make abortion obsolete, regardless of the effects on \nwomen.\n  I remain perplexed--as I was in March--that this has risen to the top \nof our priority list. Back in March, we were about to send our troops \nto battle in Iraq, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month \nand long-term unemployment was climbing to the highest level in \ndecades.\n  Well, the more things change the more they stay the same. Long-term \nunemployment is now at the highest level in 20 years. The number of \nAmericans falling into poverty has increased for 2 straight years after \na decade of decline. Six hundred thousand more people are unemployed \nthan they were in March, and we have lost more than 200 U.S. soldiers \nsince the war began.\n  Yet, we have found time to ban what should be a private medical \ndecision between a woman and her doctor.\n  We also have to complete the most basic work of Congress--to pass the \nyear's spending bills. At this point, we have considered Defense, \nLabor, HHS, Energy, Homeland Security and the Legislative Branch. But \nwe still have left to consider Agriculture, Commerce-Justice-State, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Foreign Operations, Transportation, and VA-HUD. \nWe should bring these bills to the floor, debate them, modify them with \namendments and then send them to conference. As we get closer and \ncloser to our target adjournment date, I have to wonder why on earth we \nare not going full speed ahead to bring these bills to the floor?\n  We also have a Medicare prescription drug bill pending in conference. \nThis is an issue that all of us hear about every time we go home. It is \none of the most important issues to the American public--and has been \nso for years.\n  With so much uncertainty here at home, the Republican leadership has \nmade the choice to debate how best to criminalize a medical procedure \nfor women.\n  I have to ask myself: Why was this moment chosen for this debate? Why \naren't we debating the steps we could take to help the 8.4 million \nAmericans who are out of work? Why aren't we debating how we can \nbalance our Federal budget and begin to diminish these overwhelming \ndeficits and this increasing debt load we will leave on the backs of \nour children? Why are we not debating the necessity of our paying our \nbills? Why are we not debating how to provide an affordable, meaningful \nprescription drug benefit for elder Americans? Why aren't we debating \nhow to help the 34 million Americans living in poverty?\n  As I travel around, talking with people in my State, that is what \nthey talk to me about: What about this war, Senator Clinton? What about \nhomeland security? Are we as safe as we need to be here at home? \nSenator, what can we do about the jobs that are disappearing in the \nstagnant economy? How on Earth can we deal with this overwhelming \nbudget deficit? What about not funding No Child Left Behind and the \nburdens that are begin put on public education as a result? When are we \ngoing to get around to a prescription drug benefit for our seniors who \nare suffering and having to face these large bills? What are we doing \nto protect our environment? We are, after all, stewards of our natural \nenvironment for future generations.\n  Those are the questions I am being asked. Not the ones posed by this \nlegislation before us today.\n  But nevertheless we are considering this bill and little doubt that \nit will be approved. So, let us be very clear on what it is we are \nabout to pass. The way this bill is written, the choice of language \neliminates the distinction of trimesters. The vagueness makes this bill \napplicable to many other procedures in addition to the ones explicitly \nnamed. This bill is extreme, deceptive, and unconstitutional.\n  As my colleague from Pennsylvania stated back in March: This is the \nbeginning of the end. And that is absolutely what he means. If this \nbill passes, it is the beginning of the end of Roe v. Wade. It is the \nbeginning of the end of the right of women in this country to make the \nmost personal and intimate decisions that any of us would ever be \ncalled upon to make.\n  Why did we ever have to do Roe v. Wade to begin with? Some States \nlike mine, let abortion, as long as it was done safely and legally, \noccur under certain circumstances before Roe. Why did we have to have a \nSupreme Court decision? We have to have it because in many parts of the \ncountry these kinds of decisions were not permitted to be made by \nindividual women.\n  Look at the progress we have made. The U.S. abortion rate is now at \nthe lowest level it has been since 1974. When I was First Lady, I \nhelped to launch the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. We \nincreased education and public awareness. And since 1991, teen \npregnancy has also declined. We learned that prevention and education, \nteaching people to make good decisions, really did work. But that is \nnot what we are talking about here. We are talking about those few rare \ncases.\n  We are talking about those few rare cases when a doctor had to look \nacross a desk at a woman and say, ``I hate to tell you this, but the \nbaby you wanted, the baby you care so much about, that you are \ncarrying, has a terrible abnormality.''\n  I have to ask myself, why do we, as government officials, expect we \ncan make these decisions? We know that people of means will always be \nable to get any health care procedure they deem necessary. That is the \nway it was before Roe v. Wade. That is the way it will be after this \npasses the Senate.\n  We are facing a moment of historic importance, but not about what we \nshould be debating at this time in our history. I only wish this \nlegislation were not before us. But now that it is, we have to educate \nthe American public.\n  I will end by referring again to the young woman, Mrs. Eisen, who was \nin my office back in March. She is about 25 years younger than I am. \nShe said: I had no idea that the decision I made with my husband and my \ndoctor to deal with this genetic abnormality was something I could have \nnever had under the laws of where I lived before. And that if this \npasses, it will become illegal in the future.\n  I said: Well, you didn't have to think about that. That was something \nthat, thankfully, we took off the national agenda. But there are those \nwho, from very deeply held beliefs, which I respect, would wish to \nsubstitute the Government's decision for what should be a difficult, \npainful, intimate, personal decision.\n  This bill is not only ill-advised, it is also unconstitional. I \nunderstand what the other side wants to do. They are hoping to get \nsomebody new on the Supreme Court and to turn the clock back \ncompletely, to overrule Roe v. Wade.\n  Is this bill really about what the sponsors say, or is it, as they \ncandidly admit, the beginning of the end--to go back in this country to \nback-alley abortions, to women dying from botched, illegal procedures? \nI think you can draw your own conclusions.\n  It is up to the American public to determine whether they want \nmedical decisions being criminalized by this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13208-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13208-S13209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM REITER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I was back home in St. Paul a \ncouple weeks\n\n[[Page S13209]]\n\nago during our last recess, and on late Tuesday afternoon of that week, \nI met with my friend Randy Kelly, mayor of St. Paul.\n  Since I used to call his office my own, I look forward to these \nmeetings. They give me the chance to get a first-hand update of the \ncity. As my colleagues here in the Senate who also used to be in a \nmayor's office would attest, once you leave it's hard to not think and \ncare about what you used to pay attention to so closely. A former mayor \nwill always have an interest in the affairs and goings-on of his city.\n  On that note, the meeting I had with Mayor Kelly immediately began \nwith what was to us a situation of great sadness for the city of St. \nPaul--the passing of Jim Reiter earlier that afternoon, a friend of \nours and member of St. Paul's city council.\n  As you can imagine, this is unfortunate news to come home to. But \nduring times like this, I think home is the best place for a person to \nbe, surrounded by those who understand what it is like to lose the \nfriend we all had in Jim.\n  Being with my family and reflecting with others on Jim's time and \naccomplishments at the council were consoling, as was reading the Twin \nCities' newspapers the next two mornings and seeing their fitting \nrecognition of Jim as a caring family man and dedicated servant to the \npeople of St. Paul's North End and Como Park neighborhoods.\n  The papers reported that Jim ``represented'' these people at the city \nlevel, and that is true. But because I believe he did more than just \nrepresent the residents of these neighborhoods, I would use a different \nphrase to describe his efforts. I would say that Jim ``took care of'' \nthese people.\n  For neighborhoods, he knew what was important, and that includes \nhaving both a sense of pride in where you live and a sense of safety. \nAs a result, he saw to it that the housing conditions of his \nneighborhoods improved and that his residents had what all should--a \nlibrary and a community center. He also made it a point to have police \nofficers regularly patrolling the streets, and if they weren't present, \nJim would take matters into his own hands by driving around in his \n``Crime Watch'' car, a surplus police cruiser he bought with his city \ncouncil car allowance.\n  Jim and I shared the same vision for St. Paul, and I couldn't have \ndone what I did during my eight years as mayor without him. Jim \nunderstood my priorities to make St. Paul an even better place to live \nand work, and he made sure his ward measured up.\n  Not only has St. Paul's North End, Como Park area, and city council \nexperienced a loss after Jim's passing, but so has the city as a whole, \nwhich was noticeable the next day when I went to a field hearing and \nsaw flags lowered at half-staff throughout the city.\n  More importantly, he was my friend. I will miss his smile. I will \nmiss his humor. I will miss his independent speech. I will miss him.\n  Finally, my thoughts are with Jim's family: his wife Darlene; son Jim \nJr.; daughters Linda, Debby, Jean, and Kris; and his four \ngrandchildren. Their husband, father, and grandfather was a true civic \nleader and a great friend that I--and I know many others--will never \nforget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13209-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13209-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13209-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEASURE REFERRED\n\n  The following bill was referred by unanimous consent, as follows:\n\n       S. 1781.

A bill to authorize the operation of National Guard \ncounterdrug schools; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every day, police officers from \ndepartments of all sizes spend their days trying to make sure the \npeople under their protection have a safe and secure place to live, \nwork, and play. But those who wish to break our laws don't make this an \neasy task. The tactics, threats, and information available to the \nmodern criminal continue to grow. Just as developments in technology, \ntransportation, and communications have created new opportunities for \nbusinesses to enter new markets, develop new products, and discover new \nefficiencies, crooks have taken advantage of these same developments to \nfurther their personal desires.\n  Law enforcement has a responsibility to stay abreast of the latest \ndevelopments, and this means learning the latest technologies and \ntechniques used by criminals, as well as understanding and being able \nto effectively deploy countermeasures that have been developed. Staying \non top of the game demands learning new techniques, understanding new \ntechnologies, and employing new tactics to counter the latest criminal \nscam.\n  The challenge, then, is in identifying where this training should \ncome from. Most citizens expect cops to learn many of these skills on \nthe job--you never see the detectives on ``NYPD Blue'' or in ``Law and \nOrder'' take classes to improve their skills. But the truth of the \nmatter is what while on the job training is an essential part of any \nlaw enforcement organization, additional schooling is also increasingly \nprevalent and necessary. Some departments have funds in their budgets \nto bring in outside experts to provide training. Some depend upon \nclasses offered by State governments. But for a vast number of \ndepartments, particularly those serving smaller, rural populations, the \nonly training opportunities available are offered by the National \nGuard.\n  Operating under the authority of Title 32, United States Code, \nSection 112, the National Guard actively supports local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies and community based anti-drug \ncoalitions. Over the past several years, the Guard has supported the \nestablishment of five Counterdrug schools which facilitate valuable \ntraining for State and local law enforcement agencies. These schools \nare dedicated to teaching counterdrug-related skills to State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies and community-based organizations. The classes \nrange from specialties such as how best to search a loaded semi \ntractor-trailer for narcotics to generally applicable classes on \ninterviewing or surveillance techniques. They provide training to \nthousands of officers each year who would otherwise not be able to \nreceive it for a lack of resources.\n  These schools, located in Pennsylvania, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, \nand California, but serving law enforcement officers throughout the \nUnited States, have proved their effectiveness in developing training \nand educational opportunities for local law enforcement officials--\nopportunities that would not otherwise exist. The schools fill a need \nreadily apparent in conversations with State and local law enforcement \nofficers. The National Guard Counterdrug schools represent one of the \nfew opportunities available to State and local law enforcement officers \nto improve the skills they need to be as effective as possible in \nmaintaining the peace.\n  But in addition to law enforcement, community-based organizations \nalso receive valuable training from the National Guard Schools, which \nallows them to be much more effective in their efforts. Almost any law \nenforcement officer will tell you that they would rather have a \nsuccessful prevention effort, a way to convince kids that crime really \ndoesn't pay, rather than having these kids begin a life of crime. \nOrganized, motivated, effective community coalitions are a central, \nbipartisan component of our nation's drug demand reduction strategy.\n  The challenge the schools face is one of funding. They have been \nfunded to date by Sate Plans funds from the Defense department and line \nitems from Congress. The funding to each school has varied from year to \nyear, making it exceedingly difficult for the schools and the law \nenforcement agencies they serve to know how many of what classes will \nbe offered. And while I do not believe this should be an issue, there \nhave been some questions raised as to whether the operation of these \nschools should be conducted by the Guard.\n  Today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Harkin, Cochran, and \nNelson in introducing legislation that addresses these challenges. This \nlegislation will formally authorize the five schools, and create a \nseparate budget account for the schools. The establishment of a single \naccount for all five Counterdrug schools will stabilize the funding for \nthe schools so they can more efficiently and effectively plan, manage, \nand execute training for the law enforcement officers and the \ncommunities they serve.\n  In addition, a single line item supporting these schools will relieve \nthe need for each school having to depend upon a Congressional line \nitem for funding for their activities. It will provide easier \nmanagement, oversight, and the establishment of performance \nexpectations of the Schools by both the National Guard and Congress. \nWith better oversight, management, and creating a regular funding \nstream, the schools will be able to better serve the training needs of \nstate and local law enforcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13210-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1965.

Madam President, we will resume business on Monday \nafternoon. The two managers of the Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill will be here and available so that Members may come to the floor \nand offer amendments. As always, I encourage Senators to notify their \nrespective cloakrooms if they intend to offer an amendment to this \nbill. At this time there are only a few amendments that have come \nforward that are known. Therefore, I hope the Senate will complete the \nbill by early next week. I do remind my colleagues the first vote of \nMonday's session will be at 5:30. Under the order, that vote will be on \ninvoking cloture on the Leavitt nomination. I fully expect that cloture \nwill be overwhelmingly invoked, and the Senate will then be able to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the confirmation of this qualified candidate \nto the President's cabinet. We have provided time on Monday for \nSenators to speak prior to the vote. However, again, I hope once that \nvote is taken, we will be able to move quickly to a vote on the \nconfirmation of Michael Leavitt.\n  I want to also mention once again the very important issues that \nstill need to be addressed prior to the adjournment of this session. \nThere are a number of issues, including Healthy Forests, the Internet \ntax moratorium, the CARE Act, going to conference, gun liability--that \nis, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act--fair credit \nreporting, on which we reached\n\n[[Page S13231]]\n\nconsent to proceed yesterday. Hopefully this can be done quickly with \nno further delay. Obviously, we continue next week toward completing \nthe appropriations process. I was encouraged with yesterday's pace on \nthe Transportation-Treasury bill. With the cooperation of all Members, \nwe were able to complete that bill over the course of the day. I hope \nwe will be able to continue that trend and move expeditiously next week \non the remaining bills.\n\n  This week we also finally finished with congressional action on the \npartial-birth abortion ban. That bill will be presented to the \nPresident for his signature to become the law of the land. The Senate \nexpedited passage this week of the anti-spam act. The 97 to zero \npassage on that vote shows the importance and the need for this \nlegislation for which the American people have called.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr DASCHLE. Madam President, we have offered to go to the Healthy \nForests legislation with no limitation on amendments. I hope we can \nwork that out. We also have indicated we could send the CARE Act over \nto the House without going to conference and allow them to take it up \nimmediately. I hope we can do that next week as well. Next week \ncertainly can be a productive week.\n  I ask the majority leader if it is his intention to dual-track the \nschedule for the coming days to accommodate debate and hopefully \nresolution on appropriations bills for a certain period during the day \nand then the possibility that we could take up and debate some of the \nbills we have discussed as priority items later on in the day, to \naccommodate both authorizing and appropriations bills prior to the end \nof the session.\n  I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, through the Chair, as we have discussed \ninformally, it is our intention to address all of these issues and to \ndo so and at the same time handle the tremendous challenge of \naddressing these appropriations bills will require us to, so called, \ndual track which in essence means take the necessary time on the \nappropriations bills each day, using that as the focus, but at the same \ntime recognizing there is other very important business we will be \ndoing over the course of that day. Generally we will try to do it in \nthe evenings, but we can adjust that according to the schedules of the \nvarious managers.\n  Madam President, it will take patience on both sides of the aisle, in \npart because of the amount of time it will require all of us to be on \nthe Senate floor, but also from an organizational standpoint.\n  The intention will be to try to keep things as organized as possible \nand focused on the appropriations bills. If it looks like any time can \nbe spent more profitably on a dual track, we will do that.\n  Generally, I would like to do appropriations bills through the \nmorning and very late in the afternoon, and at that juncture be able to \ndual-track with these other issues.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate very much the majority \nleader's reply. The bills he has mentioned and the appropriations bills \nleft to be done are all bills that ought to accommodate a great deal of \nbipartisan effort. There is nothing on the list that he has proposed, \nif I can recall the list, that would generate divisive debate. There \nare going to be amendments.\n  I was just talking to my Governor, and he again expressed concern \nabout the current form of the Internet tax bill as it relates to States \nand lost revenue they could experience because the bill has been \nchanged. But on that bill and Healthy Forests, the fair credit \nreporting bill, and a number of other bills, I think there is ample \nbipartisan interest that could accommodate a very aggressive schedule, \nand I look forward to working with the majority leader to see how much \nwe can accomplish next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, one thing I did not mention over the \ncourse of the week is the vote on the Class Action Fairness Act. \nAlthough I was very disappointed in the outcome; that is, we were not \nable to proceed with that--I think it did focus the attention of both \nsides of the aisle. It was a bipartisan vote, but it wasn't bipartisan \nenough to be able to proceed to it this week. But I will add that on \nboth sides of the aisle people have come forward and said we are very \nserious about doing this in a way that is appropriate.\n  I think there may well be an opportunity, at the appropriate time, to \naddress that issue. The Democratic leader and I are both personally \ninvolved with asbestos. He has mentioned it and I have mentioned it. \nThat should send a strong signal to people that we are seriously \ncommitted, in a bipartisan way, to addressing an issue that is \naffecting families, the economy, and jobs; and I do hope that those \ndiscussions will continue to be productive as we go forward.\n  Having said that, next week is going to be a very busy week. I look \nforward to it being a very productive week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/24/senate-section/article/S13231-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
