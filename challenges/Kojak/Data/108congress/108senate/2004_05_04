I hope no later than the end of this week the \nSecretary of Defense can come to the Senate, as he does with some \nregularity, and explain to us what they know, what happened, and what \nis going to be done about it.\n  We must do everything we can to ensure that we understand the \ncircumstances surrounding these appalling acts. We must also be \nprovided with a very specific and detailed response that spells out the \nmeasures taken to discipline those responsible and outlines what steps \nwill be taken to ensure this never happens again.\n  Somehow, we have to say to the international community that this is \nnot the United States of America.

Mr. President, I want to use the remainder of my leader \ntime to comment on the Medicare temporary drug discount card.\n  For nearly a decade, Congress has been debating how to provide \nseniors with meaningful help when it comes to the skyrocketing cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  This temporary program represents the first tangible result of that \nlong debate. Until the Medicare prescription drug benefit takes effect \nin 2006, this is the only assistance seniors will receive.\n  The administration has introduced this program with great fanfare. \nUnfortunately, the hype masks the disappointing truth. This program \nprovides far more confusion than real savings. As a result, it \nrepresents yet another missed opportunity in our longstanding effort to \nbring the cost of medicine within the reach of seniors who need it.\n  Among the many shortcomings in the program are three critical flaws. \nFirst, the discount program forces seniors to go through a baffling \nnumber of calculations and decisions.\n  In order to decide whether the discount program is right for them \nand, if so, which card to choose, seniors need to ask themselves: \nFirst, will the card offer discounts on the drugs I need? Second, is my \nneighborhood among those where this card is available? Third, does my \npharmacist accept the card? Fourth, which of the several cards offered \nwill provide the best discount on the drugs I am personally taking? Are \nthe discounts offered worth the enrollment fee? Could I get a better \ndeal through a separate discount plan offered outside of Medicare? Will \nI qualify if I am in Medicaid?\n  The questions go on and on and on. The dizzying array of \npossibilities and permutations are shown in a number of the pieces of \nmaterial that have been offered by CMS. I must say the charts and \ninformation provided are equally as confusing.\n  One reason it is so confusing today is that seniors have nowhere to \nturn for reliable information. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices has built a Web site, but it has already been found to have \nincorrect prices on many of the drugs Medicare recipients rely upon the \nmost.\n  Unless seniors have faith in the information on which they are basing \ntheir decisions, the fact they are given options will mean absolutely \nnothing.\n  Second, the program unfairly locks seniors into their choices until \nthe end of the year, even though the card sponsors can change the rules \nanytime they wish.\n  Assuming that a Medicare recipient is able to get the information he \nor she needs to make a smart choice on a plan that could help, it may \nnot matter. At any time, card sponsors can withdraw the discount they \nwere offering on any drug. Meanwhile, even though the rules could \nchange at any minute, Medicare recipients are actually locked into the \nchoice they made until the next enrollment period comes. So they make \ntheir decision based on facts provided to them, and they are locked \ninto that decision for the coming year. But those facts can change at \nany time--the day after, for example--and the Medicare recipient is now \ncommitted. Those facts for that recipient could change. This is an \nextraordinary invitation for abuse. It puts seniors, especially those \nwith serious health conditions, in a very vulnerable position.\n  Last week, the Secretary of Health and Human Services suggested that \nseniors wait before enrolling because more information will soon be \navailable.\n  Because enrollment begins today and the administration has not \nincluded this warning in its widespread advertising, I have urged \nSecretary Thompson to allow Medicare recipients at least a 30-day grace \nperiod to enable them to change their decisions should it turn out that \nanother plan could offer a better discount.\n\n  In the wake of the confusing and contradicting information seniors \nare receiving about these cards, the very least HHS can do is to offer \nthem the flexibility to make the right choice once the right \ninformation becomes available.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the program simply doesn't provide \nmuch of a discount. A recent analysis found that prices under the new \ndrug cards would be no lower than prices currently available to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Furthermore, whatever discounts the cards may provide have already \nbeen factored into drug company pricing strategies.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that several of the drugs \nseniors use the most have actually seen prices increase more than three \ntimes the rate of inflation since this program was announced.\n  In fact, drugmakers have already raised prices so much that the so-\ncalled discounts offered by this program will do little more than \nreturn the drugs to their original price.\n  To add insult to injury, the new law only requires the card sponsors \nto pass along to beneficiaries a share of the discount that they do \nnegotiate.\n  That is not good enough, so I have introduced legislation that would \nrequire them to pass along at least 90 percent of the savings to \nseniors. Medicare should not be in the business of propping up profits \nat the expense of seniors.\n  After wading through the stupefying process, with its myriad \nquestions and calculations, the fact of the matter is many seniors will \nnot see their drug costs go down 1 penny.\n  Regrettably, this was entirely predictable. Instead of relying on \ncommonsense solutions we know could bring down the cost of drugs for \nevery senior, Congress created a mystifying maze of computations, \nreplete with new vendors, changing rules, shifting prices, and \nunreliable information. There is a better way.\n  Not long ago, I was contacted by a couple from Trent, SD, who, until \nJanuary, spent $525 every month to pay for 17 different pills the wife \nhad to take for her diabetes and high blood pressure.\n  As the cost of the drugs rose higher and higher, it became more \ndifficult to pay their monthly bills, much less enjoy the retirement \nthey worked and saved for. So in order to make ends meet, the husband, \nat the age of 84--at the age of 84--started a paper route. Once a week, \nhe spent a day delivering a weekly magazine to a number of small towns \naround Trent. He does not make much, certainly not enough to cover the \ncost of his wife's prescription drugs, but the added income relieved a \nlittle of the sting, and most of the urgent bills could be paid.\n  In January, the couple called a pharmacy in Canada. They had heard \ndrugs cost less on the other side of the border, and he was curious if \nthey could save a little money.\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\n  What they learned stunned them. The same drugs that cost $525 per \nmonth at their local pharmacy cost less than $100 in Canada. Over the \ncourse of the year, the couple will save over $5,000.\n  This couple's experience points the way to two commonsense steps \nCongress could take to guarantee lower drug prices for all Americans.\n\n  First, we must make it possible to safely and legally reimport drugs \nfrom countries with lower drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies charge \nAmerican consumers the highest prices in the world. Some medicines cost \nAmerican patients five times more than they cost patients in other \ncountries.\n  In effect, our citizens are charged a tax simply for being American. \nAs a result, millions of Americans are having trouble affording \nlifesaving medication.\n  Last month, Senators reached a bipartisan agreement to introduce a \nbill that would allow reimportation of prescription drugs. I want to \nthank Senators Dorgan and McCain for their extraordinary leadership, \nand also those who joined with us--Senators Snowe, Kennedy, and Lott, \nand others on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is the same medication, manufactured at the same facilities, and \ninspected by the same rigorous safety standards. It is absurd, even \ncruel, to force Americans to pay wildly inflated costs, driving \nhundreds of thousands of Americans into poverty, just to pad the \nprofits of pharmaceutical companies.\n  Second, it is time to give the Government the same negotiating \nleverage it has on every other product it buys. When the Government \nbuys computers or automobiles or equipment for our soldiers in uniform, \nit uses its purchasing power to get the taxpayer a better deal. We \nshould have the same ability to negotiate for drugs on behalf of 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The administration has repeatedly opposed this commonsense price-\nreducing measure and insisted on a provision in the Medicare law that \nexpressly prohibits the Federal Government from using leverage to \nbargain for lower drug prices.\n  Let's be clear, if we have the power to save taxpayers money and \nchoose not to use it, we are, in effect, throwing taxpayers' money \naway. This is foolish and irresponsible. It helps no one but the drug \ncompanies who can count on their bloated profits. By defending the \nsystem, the administration is merely showing whose side they are truly \non.\n  America's seniors deserve better. The question isn't how we bring \ndown drug costs for seniors. We know how. Rather the question we face \nis whether we truly want to bring down costs for seniors. The \nadministration and many of our Republican colleagues have given their \nanswer. Over the next several months, seniors are going to see this \ndrug card program is not up to the task of controlling the spiraling \ndrug costs.\n  Instead of helping seniors afford the drugs they need, it is designed \nto help drug companies reap the profits to which they are accustomed. \nSeniors need a real Medicare prescription drug benefit that puts their \nneeds first.\n  We are going to try to continue to work across the aisle, as we did \nwith the reimportation bill, to find a way to bring down these costs, \nto find a way to empower the Government to work on behalf of all \nseniors to negotiate better prices.\n  There is an answer to the high cost of prescription drugs. The \nprogram being introduced today and unveiled this week is not it. We can \ndo better than this, and I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4781-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, this morning I want to praise the work of \nElaine Chao and her staff on the final regulations to strengthen \novertime rules for all Americans. Elaine Chao worked with me when I \nserved as Secretary of Transportation, and I know her to be a public \nservant of the highest intelligence and integrity.\n  Secretary Chao has identified the problems with outdated regulations \nand has taken the action necessary to rectify them. I admire her \nprincipled stand on such a controversial issue, and I commend her for \nher foresight in recognizing and working to fix the problems.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act regulations have not been revised since \n1954, but labor forces, as well as employers, have changed dramatically \nover that 50-year period. These updates take into account the economic \ndemands of technological advancements, salary growths, and shifts in \nthe labor force that have occurred in the past half century, and they \nmodernize these regulations for a modern workforce.\n  Updating the rules is crucial to the 6.7 million Americans making \n$23,660 or less a year because until now only workers earning less than \n$8,060 annually were guaranteed overtime. The final rule provides a \ngreatly needed increase, and, in addition, 1.3 million white-collar \nworkers will benefit from their new earnings. The benefits do not stop \nthere. More than 5 million workers will enjoy an ironclad guarantee of \novertime rights, regardless of job duties, under this final rule.\n  As a woman well acquainted with labor issues across this Nation, I \nhave watched the increase of Fair Labor Standards Act class action \nsuits over the years with growing concern. To my dismay, the number of \nsuits has almost tripled--tripled--since 1997. Even worse, these \nlawsuits are estimated to cost our economy approximately $2 billion a \nyear. The vague language in the laws has allowed an opportunity for \nclass action attorneys to render a defense extremely expensive and \ndifficult to counter, regardless of how well the employer complies with \nthe law.\n\n  These suits have placed even greater pressure on our already \noverburdened judicial system, and they reinforce the need for these \nrules.\n  Certain groups out to prevent the Department of Labor from improving \nthe rules and making the necessary clarifications have greatly \nexaggerated the effects of the rule. Fortunately, their efforts were \nunsuccessful.\n  Critics expressed concern about who is and who is not potentially \naffected by the new rules--why, for instance, a first responder's \novertime is protected. There is no question that America has a profound \nsense of the significance of our first responders, especially following \nthe events of 9/11. This new protection extends to all of our first \nresponders, our police officers, firefighters, paramedics, nurses, and \nemergency medical technicians.\n  For those who feared team leaders could be unfairly disadvantaged \nunder the proposed rules, let me assure you the final rules make it \nclear blue-collar workers who are team leaders are guaranteed overtime \npay. Additionally, white-collar team leaders will enjoy greater \nprotections than they do today.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give careful \nconsideration to the clear benefits these final rules will afford our \nNation before voting. I believe these final rules are the product of \nconstructive feedback that is afforded to all proposed rules through \nthe public comment period. In this case, I am told 75,000 to 80,000 \ncomments were received and analyzed. With the new rules in place, \nworkers will clearly know their rights and employers their \nresponsibilities.\n  Again, I thank Secretary Chao for her extraordinary leadership and \nvision in making millions of low-income workers eligible for overtime, \nupdating the antiquated and confusing rules and regulations, and taking \nthis important step toward eliminating the billions of dollars in \nlawsuits related to overtime cases.\n  I quote from today's Washington Post:\n\n       What's needed now is not to block these regulations but to \n     ensure that they are vigorously enforced with an eye to \n     protecting the vulnerable workers the law was intended to \n     benefit.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this rule and vote no on the \nHarkin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4782-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity yesterday to be in \nEden Prairie, MN, at a senior citizens center to talk to people \ngathered there about the opportunity they now have to obtain a discount \ncard to lower the cost of prescription drugs. This is done less than 6 \nmonths after the law was changed. I want to applaud Secretary Thompson \nand the folks from CMS for moving so quickly.\n  What I find so troubling is I was on the Senate floor yesterday and I \nheard the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and today the \ndistinguished minority leader talking about how terrible this is and \nlambasting something that is just beginning. I ask that we put aside \nthe partisan rhetoric and see if we can work together to give seniors \nan opportunity to get prescription drugs at lower costs. The card in \nquestion is one, by the way, if one is a senior at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder and as an individual they have an income of under \n$13,000--I think it is about $12,500 for an individual and about \n$16,500 for a couple--that discount card has contained within it a $600 \ncredit. That $600 credit will cover the cost of prescription drugs from \nnow until the end of the year and then $600 starting again in January; \nso, in fact, it is $1,200 for 18 months. With this card, seniors have \nan opportunity to get a list of the pharmacies at which they shop, get \na list of the drugs they need, and then be able to price compare.\n  I am not very computer literate, but many of us have complained about \nthe complexity of the Medicare law. There is certainly a lot of debate \nabout the complexity of the statute, but there is very little debate \nabout the simplicity of the process that is involved in seniors \nfiguring out what their options are under this card. If seniors call 1-\n800-MEDICARE, they can speak with someone, tell the folks at Medicare \nwhere they live, what their income is, what drugs they need. They will \nbe given a list with a whole range of opportunities, and then they can \npick the program that is at the lowest cost to them.\n  If a senior is computer literate themselves or they have a kid or \neven a grandkid who understands how to work computers, or in our case \nwe had folks from AARP and from the Board of Aging--they were all there \nto work with these seniors--it makes it very simple.\n  For those who talked about mystifying phases of confusion, why do we \nnot just give it a chance to work. Can we not put aside partisan \nrhetoric and lambasting for a little bit of time and simply come \ntogether to say seniors deserve lower cost prescription drugs?\n  I would like to see an opportunity for seniors to get safe drugs from \nanywhere, and if we can figure out a way to do a pilot project to get \ndrugs from Canada, I would support that. We know that is not the \npanacea, that is not the cure all. We have passed a bill now that for \nthe first time gives seniors the opportunity to get prescription drug \ncoverage. Over 187,000 in Minnesota will get that coverage, and over \n119,000 will have this $600 benefit.\n\n  I was taken aback by the comments of the Democratic leader when he \ntalked about the Federal Government as a model in regard to military \nprocurement and getting things at low cost. Goodness gracious, we have \nall heard the stories of $500 wrenches and toilets. There is a better \nway to do it.\n  We have an opportunity now for seniors to be able to price shop. We \nhave urged our seniors and I urge seniors, do not get the card right \naway, do not make their choice right away. Window shop for a couple of \nweeks, 10 days, figure out what is the lowest cost, and do the price \ncomparison.\n  We have an opportunity, and I hope we take it, to put aside the \npolitical hits and being negative about things even before the program \nis given a chance to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4782-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4782-S4784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I do want to talk briefly about the economy and perhaps \nfrom the same perspective. I begin my remarks on the progress of the \nAmerican economy with an observation of H.L. Mencken in 1921. He said:\n\n       The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace \n     alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led safely) by menacing it \n     with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.\n\n  Much of the economic commentary we are hearing from the other side of \nthe aisle in the Senate and out on the campaign trail seems to fit this \ndescription very well.\n  Among the hobgoblins: that the President is encouraging companies to \nmove overseas; that his tax cuts are intended to primarily help his \nrich friends; and that this is the worst economy in who knows how long.\n  There is just one problem with these and other claims: The facts. \nThey are alarming for sure, but they are also imaginary.\n  The economy is strong and growing, posing annual growth rates of 8.2 \npercent, 4.1 percent, and 4.2 percent in the last three-quarters. Jobs \nare being created, 308,000 last month. The recalculation of job \ncreation the first 2 months in this year is another 200,000. I believe \nthe figure is 750,000 in the last 7 months. Housing sales are at an \nalltime high level, and so is home ownership. Inflation is low. \nMortgage rates continue to be low. I wonder which of these economic \nindicators the Senator from Massachusetts wants to be less positive.\n  The truth is, we should not be comparing our economy to perfection \nand asking: Why not? We should be comparing our economy to reality and \nasking: Why?\n\n  We had the tech bubble burst, a bubble that should never have been \nallowed to inflate so high. We had corporate scandals. We had corporate \ngreed. We had Enron and WorldCom. They were certainly nonpartisan, but \nthey were encouraged by the get rich quick ethic of the 1990s. They \nwere reprehensible and we have dealt with them.\n  We had the attacks on September 11. My colleagues across the aisle \ntalk about losing jobs and what a terrible economy. Every single time \nwe have to reflect, we remember September 11 and the devastating impact \nthat had both on our hearts, on our souls, on our confidence, and on \nour economy. Now we have the daily war on terror.\n  If that picture had been drawn for us 5 years ago, how many would \nhave predicted the economy would be in as good shape as it is? The \nreason is sound monetary policy and tax cuts that were extremely well \ntimed and sized to stimulate the economy when it needed it the most.\n  Talk to small business folks. They understand the importance of bonus \ndepreciation, increased expensing, cutting the top bracket, reinvesting \nin the business, and then growing jobs. That is what has happened.\n  As that stimulus is running its course, we in this body need to enact \na jobs bill, a transportation bill, and the Energy bill. We need to \nenact tort reform to build upon our current progress. We have to stop \nthe filibustering and get some work done.\n  Unfortunately, some in this body and on the campaign trail are \nobsessed with talking about and addressing the economic situation that \nexisted 2 years ago and administering medicine to a disease we are \nalready curing. The President deserves credit for economic policies \nthat weathered America through to better times.\n  Some may have political reasons for keeping the people alarmed, but \nthe mounting evidence of economic strength is convincing to the \nAmerican people, and the American people understand that reality is \npreferable to all those hobgoblins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his presentation \non the economy. I intend to continue in the same vein.\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\n  I begin with a headline that appears in this morning's Washington \nPost on the front page of the business section. I believe it belongs on \nthe front page, period. The headline reads:\n\n       Federal Deficit Likely to Narrow By $100 Billion. Tax \n     Receipts Pare Borrowing.\n\n  It goes on to describe how the amount of tax receipts coming into the \nGovernment are so much higher than those anticipated, that the present \nexpectation is that this year's deficit will be $100 billion less than \nthe amount that we were told when the year began.\n  To me, that does not come as a surprise. Yes, I am a little surprised \nthat the number is as high as it is. But the one thing I have said over \nand over again on this floor, and will continue to say because it seems \nnobody understands it, is that all of the numbers we have with respect \nto our projections around here are always wrong. I can't tell you \nwhether they are wrong on the high side or the low side in advance, but \nthe one thing I can always say with absolute certainty is that they are \nwrong.\n  Why? Because we are talking about an $11 trillion economy. In an $11 \ntrillion economy, even the slightest percentage change in our estimate \nproduces a big number, in terms of dollars. One hundred billion is not \nthat much money when you talk about $11 trillion. It is 1 percent. And \n1 percent, to use a term with which all politicians are familiar, is \nwithin the margin of error.\n  But the fundamental truth that comes out of this headline and the \npredictions that preceded it is this: Worry less about the numbers than \nyou do about the principal position of the economy that underlies those \nnumbers. If our policy is correct and the economy is thriving and \ngrowing, the numbers will take care of themselves. But if our policy is \nwrong and the economy is shrinking, then it doesn't matter what the \nprojections say that the income of the Federal Government might be. We \nare going to be in trouble.\n  I want to put this all in historical perspective so, if you will, I \nwill display a few charts. This first one, ``Historical Perspective on \nEconomic Growth'' goes back to the 1970s. The green bars above the line \nrepresent quarters in which our economy grew. The red bars below the \nline represent quarters in which our economy shrank. As you can see, we \nhad a very serious economic problem in the late 1970s and early 1980s, \nas the red bars went down below the line repeatedly and very deeply. \nThis was the response to what some economists call the ``great \ninflation.'' We hear talk about the Great Depression, but we sometimes \nforget that in the 1970s we had the great inflation during the Carter \nyears. And we had two quarters successive of red down below. Then it \nburst, and then an additional problem, as the economy went through the \ndreaded double dip; that is, we went into recession, recovered briefly, \nand then fell back into it again. Those were some of the worst economic \ntimes that I can remember. But to listen to the rhetoric around the \nSenate floor no one else remembers it because we are now being told our \npresent economy is the worst in 50 years.\n  Look at the historic perspective. You see when we came out of that \ndouble dip, Ronald Reagan was President and Paul Volcker was Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve and we established fiscal policy and monetary \npolicy that caused the economy to start to grow in dramatic fashion. We \nhad a period of nearly a decade where we had nothing but green above \nthe line. But as always happens--we cannot repeal the business cycle--\nmistakes are made, decisions are taken on the assumption that the \nfuture will be different than it really is, and the economy slipped \nonce more into recession in the middle of the Presidency of the first \nPresident Bush, and we had two successive quarters of red ink.\n  By comparison to what happened in the early 1980s, this was a happy \ntime. But, of course, for those who lost their jobs and those who saw \nthe economy shrink, it was not a happy time. It is never a happy time \nwhen we are in recession.\n  We came out of that recession and President Bush saw the balance of \nhis Presidency a time of solid growth. It slipped for one quarter and \nthen resumed again, and we had another period of green above the line. \nWe didn't really get into a robust recovery until about 1995. That \ntriggers all kinds of political debates. The Democrats said the reason \nfor the recovery was because Bill Clinton was elected President in \n1993. The Republicans say, no, the reason for the recovery is because \nNewt Gingrich was elected Speaker in 1995. Frankly, I don't think \neither one of those had that much to do with it. I think the economy, \non its own, with its own strength, created this period of great \nprosperity.\n  But as the Senator from Minnesota has noticed, as we got toward the \nend of this period, we had the dot-com bubble, we had 9/11, we had the \ncorporate scandals, we had geopolitical uncertainty, and the economy \nwas shaken and slipped back again into the red. But, once again, if you \nnotice, in a historic fashion the amount of red below the line in the \nrecent recession was nowhere near as serious as the amount of red below \nthe line in the 1990s, and not even close to the amount that occurred \nin the late 1970s and early 1980s. So that is the historic perspective \nof where we are. The economy is strong, it is resilient, and it is now \npoised for a significant period of growth that we hope will challenge \nif not exceed the periods that preceded it.\n  Let's go to the next chart that focuses entirely on the recent years, \nin the period where we are now. This shows the quarters that \nconstituted the last recession, and then the quarters since then. You \ncan see that since the last recession, the recovery, while initially \nfairly weak, has now become strong and robust and continues to grow.\n  In discussing that with Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, I \ntalked to him about how weak the recovery was, and he said one of the \nreasons the recovery has been weak compared to previous recoveries is \nbecause the recession was so mild. You don't have a strong booming \nrecovery unless you are coming back from a period of great and serious \ndifficulty. Because the recession was so comparatively mild, the \nrecovery was comparatively mild. But now it appears, starting in mid-\n2003, that it has truly taken hold.\n  The jobless claims peaked during the recession, stayed high for the \nfirst part of the recovery, and then began to get optimistic and \nstrong. That is the case here.\n  Let us look at the payroll jobs and how they are playing out, again \nin the historic pattern I have described.\n  This is the beginning of January 2003. Payroll jobs are being lost, \nbut the amount of loss keeps getting smaller and smaller as the \nrecovery takes hold. In August of 2003, the trend turns positive and \nthe jobs start to come back. Now you have 7 months in which jobs have \nbeen created--every month, with the strong figure, of course, occurring \nlast month of 308,000 jobs.\n  Once again, this follows the standard historic pattern; job are slow \nto come back in a recovery--every recovery regardless of who is \nPresident. People are slow to hire until they are sure the recovery is \ntaking hold. Now the recovery has taken hold and the jobs are coming \nback.\n  The next chart shows us why this recession was as mild as it has \nbeen. It gives us an indication of what we can look forward to. It is a \nlittle hard because the colors are not as contrasting as they should be \nfor television, but the green bars are consumer spending.\n  One of the interesting characteristics about this recession--it is \nunique indeed of any recession we have followed--is consumer spending \nstayed positive throughout the entire recession and then turns more \npositive, of course, during the recovery. That would indicate no \nrecession at all. But, of course, there was a recession. What caused \nit? Go to the dark blue bars. This is business investment. We can see \nthe response to the dot.com bubble. The bursting of that bubble was \nthat businesses decided they had overinvested in a number of areas \nduring that bubble. You see that in the very strong dark bars that are \nup here in 2000. In the middle of 2000, business investment starts to \ndrop.\n  That was the signal. This was the beginning of the recession, the \nmiddle of 2000, and they slip into strong negative territory in 2000, \nstayed there during 2001, and do not come back to positive territory \nfor nine quarters.\n  That is why we had a recession and that is why the recovery was \nsluggish.\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nConsumers were still buying but businesses were not investing partly \nbecause they had overinvested and thereby overspent during the period \nleading up to the recession, partly because they didn't have the \nincentives that were created for business investment by the tax cuts \nthat we passed in Congress.\n  But, in late 2002, the trend turned. Business investment started to \ngo up and became very strong and remained in strong territory, which is \nwhy the recovery remains strong.\n  But let us look at the area we have so much spoken about on the floor \nwith respect to manufacturing. Once again, putting it in a historic \nperspective, going back to 1999, manufacturing spending was up and \nstarted down in 2000.\n  I keep emphasizing the fact that this started down in 2000, because \nduring the election of 2000 we were told this was the strongest economy \nanybody could ever imagine, and if one only kept the incumbent party in \npower in the White House this would continue. In fact, during that \nperiod while President Clinton was in the White House and Vice \nPresident Gore was campaigning, it had already started down.\n  Economic activity is not that responsive to political activity; it \nhas a life of its own.\n\n  It started down during 2000, slipped below the line that indicates \nwhether it is growing or shrinking in the middle of 2000, it hits \nbottom in 2001, and then, while it comes up briefly, stays in a period \nand an attitude of difficulty until you get to the middle of 2003.\n  Again, the red arrow shows when it was going down, the green arrow \nshows when it is starting up, and the manufacturing activity has now \ncome up very strong--stronger than it was before the recession started, \nand every indication is that it will continue.\n  On the floor yesterday, the senior Senator from Massachusetts talked \nabout wages and how terrible wages are. His colleague who is running \nfor President has said: Well, maybe the economy is coming back but we \nare in a wage recession and wages are terribly low.\n  Once again, putting this in historic perspective, we find that the \npresent situation is not without precedent and not without indication \nas to what will happen in the future. Hourly earnings figures, which \nthe two Senators from Massachusetts used to make their claim, do not \ninclude benefit costs. That is a component of compensation that every \nbusiness man and woman knows you have to include.\n  I have run a business. I have realized, as every businessman does, \nthat you cannot just compute the amount of money that an employee \nreceives on his W-2 form as the cost that employee represents to you. \nYou have to add to that the cost of his health insurance, the cost of \nhis retirement benefits, the cost of any other benefits you give him in \norder to come up with the total amount he is going to cost you. If he \ncannot return to your company enough economic value to cover that total \ncost, you can't afford it.\n  To those who say, well, let us ignore the total cost and just talk \nabout the wages, I say you are ignoring economic reality. If you look \nat the total benefits and wages combined in total cost to an \nenterprise, you realize we are not in a wage recession. We are in a \nsituation that has very careful precedent very close to what has \nhappened in the past recessions.\n  When Alan Greenspan appeared before the Joint Economic Committee, I \nasked the question: Are we in a wage recession? He said no.\n  I close the way I began. It is the economy that produces money--not \nthe budget. It is the economy that determines how well we will do and \nnot necessarily our laws.\n  I go back to the headline that I held up at the beginning of my \npresentation in today's paper, the Washington Post. On the front page \nof the business section, it says ``Federal deficit likely to narrow by \n$100 billion.''\n  Do you know what it would take for us to create a $100 billion \nreduction this year in spending in order to get that kind of an impact? \nThere it is--an additional $100 billion into the Treasury by virtue of \nthe strength of the economy rather than anything we do.\n  It is very important for us politicians to understand that and \nrealize that our first responsibility is to adopt policies that will \nkeep the economy strong and growing. I believe this administration and \nCongress have done that. The information that is now flowing in to us \nfrom the economic world demonstrates that our policies are the correct \nones.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4784-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4784-S4786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Medicare \nlaw that we passed and the newly announced Medicare discount card.\n  I, first, raise deep concerns about a recent report that has come \nforward from the Congressional Research Service which was made public \nyesterday. I read from an AP story and report made public on Monday by \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that efforts to keep \nRichard Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, from giving lawmakers his \nprojections of the Medicare bill's costs--$100 billion more than the \nPresident and other officials were acknowledging--probably violated \nFederal law.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Foster testified in March that he was prevented by then \n     Medicare administrator, Thomas Scully, from turning over \n     information to lawmakers. Scully, in a letter to the House \n     Ways and Means Committee, said he told Foster ``I, as his \n     supervisor, would decide when he would communicate with \n     Congress.''\n\n  Congressional researchers chided the move. Such gag orders have been \nexpressly prohibited by Federal law since 1912, Jack Maskell, a CRS \nattorney, wrote in the report.\n  I hope we are going to pursue this. We have a specific report \nindicating the administration may have violated a law that has been in \nplace since 1912 that relates to information not given to us about the \nMedicare bill and about an employee, a Medicare actuary, who was told \nhe could not share information, even though that was his job, even \nthough he was asked to do so, another very troubling part of the whole \nMedicare saga as we look at this legislation.\n  Sadly, our seniors now must endure another major disappointment as \nthey cope with the implementation of last year's flawed Medicare bill. \nSince the final agreement was hashed out in the middle of the night \nlast year, seniors across this country have heard more and more \nfrustrating news about the new Medicare law. The latest is the new \nMedicare discount card or, as some would say, nondiscount card.\n  Prior to the launch of the prescription drug card Web site last week, \nseniors discovered one outrage after another. First, they found out \nthis bill had an undesirable benefit. For example, if you have $5,100 \nin prescription drug costs in a year, you still have to pay 80 percent \nof that--over $4,000. That is not the kind of benefit people in \nMichigan desire. When the benefit is explained to them in public forums \nwhere I have been participating, people are very upset. This is not the \nkind of benefit they have been asking for.\n  Second, they began to understand this legislation will undermine \nprivate health insurance and almost 3 million retirees will lose their \nprivate prescription drug coverage. About 183,000 people in Michigan, \nas a result of this bill, are predicted to lose the private coverage \nthey worked for their whole lives and count on now in retirement.\n  Third, they realize approximately 6 million low-income seniors will \nhave to pay more under this new plan than they did under their existing \nMedicaid coverage or their coverage will be more restrictive. Think of \nthat for a minute. For the folks who are lowest income seniors, whom we \nall speak about having to choose between food and medicine, under this \nnew law they will have to pay more--maybe only a little bit more, but \nevery dollar counts when you are choosing between food, medicine, \npaying the electric bill, or cutting pills in half or taking them every \nother day. It is astounding the bill that was passed actually increased \nthe costs for our poorest seniors.\n  Fourth, our seniors discovered there were no provisions to actually \nlower the prices of prescription drugs. That is amazing. Despite the \nHouse of Representatives overwhelmingly passing a bipartisan \nprescription drug reimportation bill to open the borders and bring back \nlower priced prescription drugs--\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nin most cases, American-made or American-subsidized drugs--instead of \nthat, which would lower the costs of some drugs up to 70 percent, it \nwas summarily dropped in conference committee under pressure from the \nWhite House and the pharmaceutical lobby.\n\n  Fifth, at the last minute, the pharmaceutical companies pressured \ntheir allies in Congress to put in a provision that actually prohibits \nMedicare from negotiating bulk prices. Amazing. We are not even using \nthe full leverage of Medicare to negotiate group prices. As a result, \nthe Medicare Program cannot use its market power to get lower prices \nfor prescription drugs, unlike the VA. We all know the Veterans' \nAdministration negotiates deep discounts on behalf of our veterans. We \nactually have a situation now in the case of a husband and wife who are \nretired. The husband is a veteran and he is getting a major discount, \npossibly up to 40-percent discount in his prescription drug prices, and \nhis wife, who is on Medicare, has to pay higher rates. That is not fair \nand it is not right. It needs to be fixed.\n  Sixth, a month after the bill was signed, all Americans discovered \nthe administration deliberately hid certain cost estimates from \nCongress and the American people. These figures contain what some \nthought all along, that this bill would cost more than the $400 billion \nprojected. Perhaps the lack of any provisions to help lower prices led \nto its higher cost. And now we hear from the Congressional Research \nService that, in fact, the administration has likely broken the law in \nkeeping that information from us.\n  Finally, to add insult to injury, our seniors are now seeing \npolitical television commercials promoting the new Medicare Program, \npaid for by American taxpayers, during the middle of an election \ncampaign, and the ads are not accurate. The ads are not accurate and \ncomplete and they leave out some of the biggest problems with our new \nprivate card.\n  Let me speak now specifically to the card. First of all, this chart \nis not meant to be a joke. This demonstrates 50 different steps in the \nprocess of getting a Medicare prescription drug card. You do not \nnecessarily have to take all 50 steps, but it is a very confusing \nprocess to wade through over 30 different cards to determine whether \none of them is best for you. Your region may have access to other \nregions and may be able to apply for very complicated low-income \nassistance. I should say the low-income assistance is the one positive \nin this card. If you do manage to move through the complexity and a \nsenior or a disabled person does qualify, it does provide $600 to help \nthem pay for medication. This is very positive.\n  The Families USA study looked at this and indicated the application \nprocess for low-income drug subsidies is unusually cumbersome and is \nbuilt on an untried application infrastructure. As a result, they \nestimate of the 7.2 million low-income seniors who would actually be \neligible for the extra help--and we want each and every one of them to \nreceive it--only 4.7 million will actually receive it because of this \ncomplexity.\n  The latest development is misleading. These so-called discount cards \nmay actually mean higher prices also for seniors than they would \notherwise get now without any new Medicare Program.\n  For example, seniors can get lower prices for prescription drugs by \nsimply getting their prescriptions filled through a number of sources \nthey have right now. There are a number of very good county programs in \nMichigan that I encourage seniors and families to take a look at that \ncost less than the Medicare discount card and actually provide more \nbenefit.\n  We also found by a study just completed in the House of \nRepresentatives that purchasing through the Internet can be a less \ncostly way to receive discounts. Let me give an example. Go to a Web \nsite for the top 10 most used drugs by our seniors, for example, at \ndrugstore.com. The yearly cost is $959. There is no annual fee. The \ntotal cost would be $959. Two other Web sites, the same thing: $990 and \n$993. If you go to one of two of the over 30 different private Medicare \ndiscount cards, one is called RXSavings, to get the same 10 drugs, \nsupposedly at a discount, would cost more--$1,046, and you have to pay \nan annual fee of $29.95 in order to have the privilege to pay more. The \nend result would be $1,075.95. The same is true with Pharmacy Care \nAlliance. It costs you more than what is out there right now as \ndiscount cards, but you have to pay $19 to get the card, and in the end \nyou are paying more. This is not a good deal for our seniors.\n\n  Let me give another example and actually suggest what we ought to be \ndoing. I should mention that the average discount card is $30 for a \nsenior. You have to have it for a year, and even though you cannot \nchange your card for a year, the company giving you the card can change \nthe list of the drugs that are discounted every 7 days. So you look at \nall the complexity, through all the cards, you pick the card that \ncovers the drugs you use because you need that discounted amount, you \npay your $30, and then 7 days later the drugs you need are not on that \ncard anymore. This is not a good deal for our seniors.\n  What is a good deal for our seniors is legislation we have in front \nof us right now to allow us to open the border to safe FDA-approved \nprescription drugs coming back to our local pharmacy from Canada or \nother countries with similar safety precautions where we can literally \ndrop prices in half. That is a good deal.\n  We have a bipartisan bill in front of us. A very large coalition of \nSenators has been working together. It is time to bring that bill \nforward to the Senate floor and to pass it.\n  Now, why is that better? Well, as an example, under one of the \nprivate cards, after you purchase your private card, Lipitor is listing \nat $71.19. It costs you $74.72 to get it under another card. But if we \nsimply passed that bill, it would allow us to bring back those lower \nprices from Canada to the local pharmacy. You could pay $49.85. That is \ntrue over and over.\n  The real way to lower prices is to allow us to get the lowest price, \nwhether it is in Canada or the U.S. or other countries where we can \nmake sure that the safety is there, and bring back the prescription \ndrugs to our local pharmacy. The other way is to give Medicare the \nclout to truly negotiate, as the VA does, to be able to lower prices \nfor our seniors.\n  This law has so many flaws. I believe we ought to go back to the \ndrawing board. We need to pass a meaningful prescription drug benefit. \nWe can do so before the law takes effect in 2006. We can do better. I \nencourage our seniors to think very carefully and cautiously before \nproceeding with one of these private discount cards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan who has \nbeen tireless in her efforts to educate the Senate as well as the \nAmerican people about the prescription drug issue. I don't think there \nis another Senator who has dedicated herself or himself to this issue \nas much as Senator Stabenow. I thank her. She has done a lot in terms \nof letting us all know what is at issue.\n  We all understand the basic problem: Prescription drugs cost too much \nmoney--not just for seniors, but for almost everyone. Unless you are \none of the fortunate few who has some sort of prescription drug \ncoverage that takes care of the cost, you have to reach into your \npocket, pay out substantial sums of money for drugs and medicines that \nthe doctor tells you are absolutely necessary for your health. For some \nwho are in strong income positions, this is not a hard choice; you just \nwrite the check or hand over the credit card and don't think twice. But \nfor a lot of people living hand to mouth, trying to count the pennies \nand get by from month to month, it becomes an impossible choice. To be \ntold that it is your money or your life is the worst possible choice, \nand that happens over and over again.\n  Forty million seniors on Medicare end up paying higher drug prices \nthan any other group of Americans. Let me repeat that. Forty million \nseniors under Medicare pay higher drug prices than any Americans. How \ncan I say that? I can say that because these are people on fixed \nincomes, many of whom don't have insurance protection for prescription \ndrugs. They find themselves in a position where they have to pay the \nfull price while someone--their son or daughter who is fortunate to\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nhave a plan at work--may have a lower cost or a reduced price for \nprescription drugs. Someone who is disabled and on Medicaid, for \nexample, has the benefit of the Government bargaining to bring in lower \nprices. Right on down the line you see that person after person has \nprotection, but for the senior citizens, they end up paying the highest \nprices.\n  I have heard colleagues repeatedly say, that is just the price you \nhave to pay in America. We have to have somebody pay inflated prices \nfor drugs so the companies have enough money for research.\n  Keep in mind that pharmaceutical companies are the most profitable \neconomic sector of our economy. They make a lot of money. Though they \nneed to make a profit--that is why they exist--though they need money \nfor research, the fact is most of these companies pay more money for \nadvertising their product than they do for research to find new cures \nfor diseases.\n  We tried to pass a prescription drug bill that would have finally \ngiven Medicare the power to bargain down prices and make them \naffordable for seniors. It was rejected by the overwhelming majority of \nthe other party and even a few on our side of the aisle because the \npharmaceutical companies don't want to face any customer with \nbargaining power. Forty million seniors under Medicare would be the \nstrongest bargaining unit possible. Instead, we passed a bill which, \nfrankly, is going to delay the implementation of a very poor \nsubstitute, a Medicare drug program, until long after the election. \nConveniently, this disastrous bill will not go into effect until long \nafter the election. In the meantime, though, the Bush administration is \nanxious to tell the seniors that we haven't forgotten you.\n  Yesterday they rolled out a discount card to give seniors a break on \nthe cost of drugs. Take a look at what that discount card means when we \nactually compared it to the town of Evanston, IL, to what people are \npaying at the pharmacy.\n  Lipitor, the largest selling drug in the world, $10 billion in annual \nsales, $6.5 billion in the United States, lowest retail price is \n$68.99. With this great new discount card the Bush administration \nrolled out yesterday, $67.07--a savings of 3 percent. Celebrex, savings \nof 2 percent. Norvasc, it turns out the discount card price is higher \nthan the price of the pharmacy.\n  The bad part about this new Medicare drug discount card is, once a \nsenior signs up for it, they are stuck for a year. That means they pay \nthe annual fee and can't go to another private discount card. \nMeanwhile, the company offering the discount can change the number of \ndrugs covered and the price of the drug on a weekly basis. So you are \nstuck having paid your membership fee with a situation where the drug \ncompanies can keep raising prices way beyond what you think they are \ngoing to be.\n  Are they likely to raise prices? Take a look at what has happened to \nthe increases in prices since we started debating this: Celebrex has \ngone up 23 percent in cost; Coumadin, very common, 22 percent; Lipitor, \n19 percent; Zoloft, 19 percent; Zyprexa, 16 percent; Prevacid, 15 \npercent; and Zocor, 15 percent.\n  So when you are saving 2 or 3 percent on the card today and no \nguarantee that it will be there tomorrow and prices are going up in \nthis fashion, is it any wonder that seniors are skeptical of this \nadministration's commitment to lowering drug prices?\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said last week: \nI want to warn seniors; on May 1 we are going to roll out this new \ncard, but hold back. Don't commit yourself early. There is still more \ninformation coming in.\n  There certainly is. The information is troubling. These discount \ncards being offered by the Bush administration, frankly, could be a \nbait and switch for seniors. They could end up with a discount today \nthat disappears tomorrow. They are stuck with it. They could end up \nsigning for a discount card for a drug that is discontinued by that \nsame company offering the card next week.\n  Take a look at what we could be doing instead of these bait-and-\nswitch phony discount cards. Take a look at what we could be doing on \nLipitor: With the Medicare discount card, $67.07. Do you know how much \nthey pay in a veterans hospital for that same drug? Thirty-six dollars \nand 48 cents. Why? Because the VA bargains with Pfizer and it brings \nthe price down dramatically. This Senate passed a bill prohibiting us \nunder Medicare from bargaining with pharmaceutical companies to get the \nbest price for seniors. They specifically prohibited it. Why? So the \ndrug companies could make more money and seniors would pay more money. \nIf you have to go to Canada for that same Lipitor, it is about $50. \nLook at this. America's seniors are paying the highest prices, even \nwith the discount card, in comparison to veterans and the price of the \nsame drug in Canada. Prevacid is $111 under the Medicare card; it is \n$53.90 in the VA hospitals; it is $56 in Canada. Zocor is $101 under \nthe Medicare card; it is $69 in a VA hospital; it is $63.98 in Canada.\n\n  Seniors understand this. I met with them in Chicago yesterday. They \nunderstand what is happening here. This is an election year push to \ntell seniors across America they are going to get a discount. But they \nknow better. They are wise in their years. They have seen a lot of \npoliticians come and go. They are not going to be swayed by a discount \ncard that offers little or no hope to bringing down the cost of these \nexpensive drugs.\n  I have written a letter, along with a dozen colleagues, to Secretary \nThompson, saying, For goodness sake, give seniors a grace period here. \nDon't tie them down with a card that could be disastrous for them and \ntheir families. With a grace period, if they find out it is not a good \ndeal, that would be fair to seniors--something the Medicare discount \ncard is not.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to now discuss my concerns \nabout the ads we are seeing regarding the new Medicare drug discount \ncard. I think the ads are misleading, and I am getting a lot of \ninquiries from people at home about is this good for me or not. I think \nthere is a fundamental mistrust about whether this is an idea whose \ntime ought not yet come, because the citizens are saying it is starting \nin 2006, and this is obviously a lead-in to that. I think it can be \ndescribed as a placeholder.\n  The card became available yesterday, but the administration is \nkeeping seniors in the dark about the real benefits and weaknesses of \nthe program. They have produced a television commercial that is hyping \nthe card and are spending $18 billion to show it across the country.\n  In this ad, there is a group of seniors in line at a pharmacy and the \nannouncer says: ``Good news for those with Medicare. You can get \nsavings on prescriptions.'' They do it in the right mellifluous tone, \njust for those on Medicare. That is really all the announcer says about \nthe card--``good news . . . you can get savings.'' That's it--all hype \nand no substance.\n  The television ad is almost a cruel joke on our Nation's seniors. \nInstead of providing real, needed information about the drug card, the \nadministration has launched a PR campaign to boost the image of the \ncard.\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\n  HHS should have spent less time focusing on hype and more time \nproviding seniors with critical information about the card program.\n  We have to look at what is missing on the card. I urge the \nadministration to include something else in their mailing. This is \ncalled a magnifying glass. Everybody knows what it is. It ought to be \nsent so you can read what this small type says. It says, ``Scene from \nthe HHS `shine' ad, featuring the `strange, blue, magical glow of \nlight.' ''\n  It goes further--and we have enlarged the type. The magnifying glass \nwould be a nice accompaniment for seniors who are getting this, because \nthey should read this small type. It says: ``Savings may vary. \nEnrollment fee, deductibles, and copay may apply.''\n  And here they say ``certain exclusions apply.''\n  We need the magnifying glass to see that.\n  What we are looking at is some fairly deceptive advertising. It is \nshocking that the administration would once again run ads that leave \nout these important details, especially in light of the findings by the \nGAO that earlier Medicare advertisements had a political tone and \ncontained ``notable omissions and other weaknesses.''\n  Many seniors watching this commercial could reasonably believe the \ndiscount card is free. In reality, there is an annual enrollment fee of \nup to $30.\n  Many drugs would be excluded from the program. Seniors could be stuck \nwith a Medicare drug card that provides no discount for the \nprescription drugs they may need. For example, seniors using the \nMedicare discount card offered by the Pharmacy Care Alliance would get \nno discount for Celebrex. Celebrex is a common, apparently very \neffective drug used to treat arthritis. With the card, you can buy the \ndrug for $121.80. But if you don't have the card, you can get the same \nmedication for only $76.99 at drugstore.com, so there is a savings of \nover $40. The card is useless for this drug.\n  Another example: Seniors on the Rx Savings Medicare Card Plan would \npay $147.01 for Prevacid, a common drug used to treat acid reflux. But \nthere is no discount at all when you consider that you can buy the same \ndrug for $120.99 at drugstore.com without any card. That is a savings \nof over $25 if you do not use the card. That is a good idea. Don't use \nthe card.\n\n  Lipitor is used to treat high cholesterol. If you have the Pharmacy \nCare Alliance Medicare drug card, it costs you $71.19. But if you want \nto buy it at drugstore.com, that $71.19 product cost only $62.99. So \nthere is $8 worth of savings right there at drugstore.com without any \ncard. The savings are haphazard at best.\n  These Health and Human Services television ads do not provide any of \nthese details except, once again, in the tiny type on the bottom of the \nscreen, and you ought to get a magnifying glass if you really want to \nunderstand what is taking place.\n  Look at this placard. It shows actual scenes from HHS's \nadvertisement. I point out as I did before:\n\n       Savings may vary. Enrollment fee, deductibles, and co-pay \n     may apply.\n\n  They are saying: Hey, hold on to your pockets because we are not \nreally telling you what the outcome is going to be.\n  What little substantive information is included can only be found at \nthe bottom of the screen in print so small that you need a magnifying \nglass to read it. They make sure the type is in a color that is very \nhard to read. If this was an automobile, people would be hollering that \nthis is flimflam. Only in its barely visible fine print are seniors \ninformed there is an enrollment fee for the discount card.\n  It also reveals that ``certain exclusions apply.'' That exclusion \ncould very well be the prescription drug you need.\n  Rather than educating seniors about the drug discount card, HHS is \ntreating the Medicare drug card like dishwashing soap--just make the \npublic think it is a great thing. These are not educational ads. They \nare propaganda. The GAO already told HHS that its previous Medicare \nmaterials were misleading, but rather than clean up its act, the \nadministration continues to hide the fact and trick seniors.\n  I call on HHS and the administration to stop using taxpayers' dollars \nto mislead seniors and start providing real needed information to \nMedicare beneficiaries. One should not have to have a magnifying glass \nto understand what is being offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Schumer is not here; therefore, I \nyield back his time.\n  Does the other side yield back their morning business time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                        New York National Guard\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee for allowing me to speak for 5 minutes \non this issue.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to recognize the important and \nsignificant role that New York's 2nd Battalion 108th Infantry Regiment \nrecently played in the rescue of Thomas Hamill, the civilian contractor \nheld captive for 3 weeks in Iraq.\n  Seeing this unit in the area surrounding the farmhouse in which he \nwas kept gave Mr. Hamill the courage to stand against his captors and \nescape to freedom. That is why I wish to recognize the 2nd Battalion \n108th Infantry Regiment today.\n  I know it must be of great comfort to Mr. Hamill's family and friends \nthat when he first stepped in the light of freedom, he was greeted by \nthese fine New Yorkers. This is what it is all about. A man from \nMississippi escaping bravely, and there were New Yorkers. They are \nheadquartered in Utica, NY, with companies in Whitehall, Morrisonville, \nGloversville, Rome, and Glens Falls. The unit has served this country \nsince 1898 at home and abroad, and there they were in exactly the right \nplace at the right time to help Mr. Hamill.\n  The bottom line is that after the attacks on September 11, many of \nthe men and women of the 2nd Battalion were activated and came to New \nYork City to protect our citizens. They are aware, better than anyone \nelse, that this war on terror is a war we must fight both at home and \nabroad, protecting us at home and protecting us abroad.\n  A full 11 of these National Guardsmen have such love for their fellow \nNew Yorkers and for America that they are fighting in Iraq as new \ncitizens, having been sworn in at a send-off celebration in February. \nThe 2nd Battalion is fortunate to have guardsmen hailing from Africa, \nSouth America, the Ukraine, Japan, and across the world now serving as \nAmerican citizens. What an extraordinary first act as an American to \nserve and protect the Iraqi people and lead Mr. Hamill to freedom.\n  Family, friends, and neighbors from Albany to New York City, from \nWestchester to Plattsburgh, Syracuse and Buffalo all gathered together \nat that send-off celebration to show their support and honor their \nbravery.\n  In the 2 months they have been in Iraq, these men and women have been \nserving under the leadership of LTC Mark Warnecke, having truly served \ntheir country in the true tradition of the National Guard. Today I \nrecognize the efforts of the 2nd Battalion 108th Infantry Regiment. \nWhen they return home to their families, they will do so as heroes.\n  Mr. Hamill is now safe and recovering in Germany and looking forward \nto a reunion with his wife and his return to Mississippi, after his \ncourageous ordeal. I look forward to the day when the men and women of \nNew York's 2nd Battalion 108th Infantry Regiment can return as heroes \nto their own families. May God grant them safety and security as they \nfinish out their tour. I hope their example will bring courage and \npride to all those serving in Iraq, resiliently going about their task \nof bringing peace and freedom to the Nation.\n  All New Yorkers and all Americans congratulate the 108th Infantry \nRegiment of New York today, and we say two words to the 108th Infantry \nRegiment: Thank you.\n  I yield the floor. I ask unanimous consent that the time on the \nquorum call be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may I know what the parliamentary state of \naffairs is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between the two \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the Harkin amendment is being debated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Harkin amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nDepartment of Labor's revisions to the Fair Labor Standards Act--FLSA--\nto protect and extend overtime benefits to hardworking Americans. I \nwish to thank Labor Secretary Elaine Chao for her leadership and vision \nin bringing about this important reform for American workers. Overtime \nprovisions in Federal labor law are meant to safeguard low-income \nworkers from employers who would take advantage of them, but the \ncurrent regulations that implement the law are muddy, outdated, and \nhave led to countless law suits, some of which are frivolous and \nfruitless. Truly, Secretary Chao has recognized that it is long past \ndue to reform our nation's antiquated overtime regulations.\n  The new regulations replace long-standing regulations which the \nDepartment of Labor has characterized as ``confusing, complex, and \noutdated.'' I agree. Consider the fact that the Federal overtime \nregulations were last overhauled when Harry Truman was in the White \nHouse. That's more than 50 years ago. We are relying on a half-century \nold law to protect overtime rights for workers with job duties that \ndidn't exist in 1949. Yet, there are some among us who are determined \nto push legislation to block these rules. Some Members of Congress see \na chance to score political points by acting as if something oppressive \nis occurring. This could not be farther from the truth.\n  Under the current regulations--these are the regulations Secretary \nChao is trying to improve--some low-income workers haven't been \nprotected at all, while some high-income workers and professionals have \nused the law to make sure they are paid the overtime rate, time and a \nhalf per hour for any work exceeding 40 hours in a week.\n  For example, under the current regulations: Only workers earning less \nthan $8,060 were guaranteed overtime pay because the minimum salary \nlevel had not been updated for nearly 30 years; the descriptions of job \nduties required for overtime exemption had been frozen in time for \nnearly 50 years, resulting in confusion and uncertainty for both \nworkers and employers; and, the previous regulations were outdated, \nconfusing and complex, and have led to an explosion of law suits. That \nseems to be the history of our country. Everything is coming down to \nlitigation.\n  For a year, the Labor Department has been trying to update these \ncumbersome regulations to benefit the American workforce. The new \novertime regulations were not simply conjured up overnight. On the \ncontrary. Nearly 80 stakeholder organizations, including 16 employee \nunions, were invited to participate in meetings with the Department of \nLabor.\n  Over 40 of those organizations attended stakeholder meetings and \nprovided input on the proposed regulations. The Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking was published in the Federal Register on March 31, 2003. \nAfter a 90-day comment period, the Department of Labor received 75,280 \npublic comments.\n  I was supportive of the Department's overtime regulations proposed \nlast\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nMarch; however, some argued that the $22,100 annual minimum salary \nlevel for exemption was too low; the middle-income workers would be \nharmed because workers earning more than $65,000 per year might not be \nentitled to overtime pay; and, too many workers would be denied \novertime protections.\n  In an effort to be even more inclusive and respond to the criticisms \nfrom Administration opponents, the Labor Department revised its \nproposal--that is after all of the comments--which is the way the \nsystem is supposed to work.\n  Under the final rule, workers making less than $23,660 a year are \nautomatically eligible for overtime--this means that 1.3 million low-\nincome workers will be eligible for overtime pay for the first time in \nhistory.\n  The new regulations will preserve eligibility for most white-collar \nworkers making up to $100,000 a year. However, workers making more than \n$100,000 who regularly perform some administrative, executive, or \nprofessional duties will no longer automatically be eligible for \novertime. This change will affect 107,000 workers. It doesn't take a \nparticularly clever politician to see that you might win votes if you \nfight to make these high earners higher earners and otherwise carry on \nas if a Republican, business-friendly Administration cannot be trusted \nto do right by employees.\n  The final rule strengthens overtime protections for licensed \npractical nurses and first responders, such as police officers, fire \nfighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians, by clearly \nstating for the first time that these workers are entitled to overtime \npay. Plain and simple, under the new overtime regulations, 6.7 million \nworkers are guaranteed overtime status.\n  I am aware that a week before the Department of Labor's revised rule \nwas finalized and made publicly available, the AFL-CIO began attacking \nthe overtime regulations. These tactics reflect a greater interest in \nplaying politics than in protecting America's workers. Fortunately, the \nunion movement is not entirely opposed to the regulations. Take for \nexample the Nation's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, whose National President, Chuck Canterbury, recently hailed the \nDepartment of Labor's final regulations as an ``unprecedented victory'' \nfor America's first responders. The International Association of Fire \nFighters has said they support the rule going forward. You also won't \nbe hearing voices of opposition from the Ironworkers, Carpenters, or \nOperating Engineers, because they know that the new rule expressly \nprotects construction workers.\n\n  Suing employers about overtime has become very lucrative for trial \nlawyers. Why is this the case? Because the current overtime regulations \ncontain so many ambiguities when applied to the modern workforce, \nlawsuits naturally follow. Without a doubt, the Fair Labor Standards \nAct is the new playground for plaintiffs lawyers--they are going after \neverybody: companies; school districts; local governments; you name it. \nSome argue that these lawsuits benefit workers, particularly since they \nmay win some cases. But, spending an average of 2 years in court to \nrecover wages workers should have had in their pockets on pay day is \nnot a benefit. Not surprisingly, workers are getting a few thousand \ndollars from these settlements, while trial lawyers are walking away \nwith millions. These lawsuits are a terrible drain on the economy for \nemployers and worker groups alike to be spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars on such litigation. We ought to be spending these resources \nto create new jobs.\n  I am amazed that the Department of Labor's changes haven't been \nenough to satisfy all critics. Presumptive Democratic presidential \nnominee Senator John Kerry asserts that the new overtime regulations \n``strike a severe blow to what little economic security working \nfamilies have left as a result of historic policies.'' That is pure \nbunk, and he ought to know it. Somehow, opponents have conveniently \noverlooked the Department's good faith efforts in creating today's \novertime regulations.\n  Are the new rules perfect? No, but they have been welcomed by many \nbusiness owners because they will, finally, provide some certainty on \nthis issue. Contrary to the propaganda being disseminated by its \nproponents, under the new overtime rules: ``Blue collar'' workers are \nentitled to overtime pay; employers are not relieved from their \ncontractual obligations under collective bargaining agreements; the \n``highly compensated'' test applies only to employees who earn at least \n$100,000 per year and who ``customarily and regularly'' perform exempt \nduties; the special rules for exemption applicable to ``sole charge'' \nexecutives are deleted, strengthening protections for workers under the \nexecutive duties test; a requirement is added that employees who own at \nleast a bona fide 20 percent equity interest in a business are exempt \nonly if they are ``actively engaged in its management''; and the \nprevious requirement that exempt administrative employees must exercise \ndiscretion and independent judgment is maintained.\n  The department's intent not to change the educational requirements is \nclarified for the professional exemption, and defines ``work requiring \nadvanced knowledge'' as ``work which is predominately intellectual in \ncharacter and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of \ndiscretion and judgment;'' and, terms used in the previous regulations \nare retained, but it makes them easier to understand and apply to the \n21st Century workplace by better reflecting existing Federal case law. \nIn addition, the overall length of the regulations has been reduced \nfrom 31,000 words to just 15,000.\n  Just yesterday, I received a phone call from Cheryl Lake of Draper, \nUT. Cheryl has been a human resources professional for over 20 years. \nShe called my office yesterday in strong support for the Department of \nLabor's new overtime regulations. She explained to me how helpful these \nnew regulations will be for employees and companies alike. Cheryl \nexpressed major concern about Senator Harkin's amendment, and explained \nhow complicated and confusing his amendment would make her job. The \nHarkin amendment is easy to describe in a brief sound bite, but \nimpossible to defend on legal, procedural, or economic grounds. The \namendment presumes facts that do not exist and assumes there are no \nconsequences for its folly.\n  To anyone who looks at this issue objectively, the decision is a no-\nbrainer. Reforming the regulations is the right thing to do, and we \nneed to let the Department of Labor move forward. There is nothing in \nthe latest revisions that appears either unreasonable or counter to the \nspirit of the law. It is possible to argue with some particulars, but \nextremely difficult to make the case that the new regulations are \nunfair to workers.\n  The workplace is far different from a half-century ago. Overtime \nrules should reflect that.\n  Workers will be better off. Companies will be better off. I actually \nbelieve trial lawyers will be better off because there won't be any \nmore of these phony lawsuits where they reap the benefits in comparison \nto what the workers themselves get. I think trial lawyers who have \nlegitimate cases will be able to prove them with more specificity and \nwill be able to do a better job with their clients than is currently \nbeing done by the abuse of the process because of the ambiguities of \nthe law. This goes a long way toward getting rid of those ambiguities \nand making the law extremely functional compared to the current \nregulations.\n  I want to personally compliment the distinguished Secretary of Labor \nfor being willing to take this on. This is a type of job that will \nalways be attacked by those who do not understand these regulations. \nThis will always be attacked by those who want to keep going the same \nsystem of overlitigation in our society. This will always be attacked \nby those who basically don't understand labor law. This will always be \nattacked by those who do not want to get things straightened out so \nthat the system works in the best possible way it can, in the most \nefficient and economically sound way, while at the same time expanding \nall of the benefits and expanding all of the laws to embrace even more \npeople than have ever been embraced.\n  These are very important regulations. I hope our colleagues will \nreject the Harkin amendment, which I believe will cause further damage \nand harm to our system while not doing anything substantively important \nfor the workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          The Federal Deficit\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reading the Washington Post this morning, \nI came across this headline which I think is probably the most \nmisleading headline I have seen in the Washington Post, or, for that \nmatter, any other publication. The headline in the Washington Post \nbusiness section today reads: ``Federal Deficit Likely to Narrow by \n$100 Billion.''\n  Boy, what good news, if only it were true. I think you have to ask \nyourself the question: Are they talking about the deficit last year? Is \nthe deficit this year going to be $100 billion less than the deficit \nlast year? No. That is not what this story is about. In fact, if you \nread this story carefully, what you find is the deficit is going to be \nat least $50 billion more than the deficit last year--not $100 billion \nless.\n  The Washington Post has constructed a headline that is about as \nmisleading as anything I have ever seen a major publication put out. \nThey have basically fallen hook, line, and sinker for the line put out \nby the White House.\n  Why do I say that? Last year, the deficit was about $370 billion. \nAccording to this story, the deficit this year is going to be $50 \nbillion more--a new record deficit. The headline should be ``Record \nDeficit.'' Instead, they are suggesting the deficit is getting smaller.\n  What are they talking about? They are talking about how the latest \nestimate is $100 billion less than the administration's previous \nestimate. In other words, they are comparing estimate to estimate--not \nwhat is actually happening, but projection.\n  When the administration put out their earlier estimate, I said at the \ntime they were overstating the deficit to set up a story just like this \none. They don't want the headlines to read across America ``Record \nDeficits.'' What they did was overstate the deficit in terms of their \nestimates so they could come back later and say we are making a big \nimprovement. There is no improvement, except in estimates.\n\n  The fact is, the deficit this year is going to be bigger than the \ndeficit last year, and the deficit last year was a record.\n  Unfortunately, all of these estimates understate the true seriousness \nof the fiscal condition of our country because they don't count in \naddition to this $420 billion, which they now estimate the deficit to \nbe for this year, and that doesn't include the $160 billion they are \ngoing to take out of Social Security, every penny of which has to be \npaid back, and they have no plan to do so. This doesn't include the $50 \nbillion to $75 billion of extra money the Pentagon is going to want for \nthe war in Iraq and Afghanistan that we now know they are going to have \nto ask for.\n  There are some who suggest they will wait until after the election to \nask for it, but that doesn't change the fact that the money is needed, \nthat the need is being created now.\n  If you add all of that together, and the money they are taking out of \nthe Medicare trust fund, which is another approximately $20 billion, \nwhat you find is they are not going to add $420 billion to the debt \nthis year. They are going to add close to $700 billion to the debt this \nyear, by far the biggest in our history--nothing anywhere close to it.\n  For the Washington Post to fall for this kind of tired old trick--you \nknow, you overinflate the deficit so that when it comes in somewhat \nless than your overestimation you can claim great credit, is a \ndiscredit to the Washington Post. It is a discredit to trying to inform \npeople of the true fiscal condition of the country. This isn't it. Even \nif you accept the premise of this story, the deficit is going to be \nabout $50 billion more than last year, which was a record. That is \nexactly the headline the administration seeks to avoid by having put \nout an overestimation of the deficit in order to now claim credit when \nthe deficit, although a record, is not as large as their earlier \nforecast.\n  I hope the American people are not fooled by this kind of reporting. \nI hope the American people are not fooled as to the true fiscal \ncondition of the country. The truth is, the debt of the United States \nis being increased by a record amount.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I am now in a \nposition to set aside the pending amendments, offer my amendment, and \nthen they will be voted on in sequence. Are we agreed on that?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is the understanding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \ntemporarily set aside so the Senator from New Hampshire may offer an \namendment; and after he has spoken on his amendment, the amendments \nwill be temporarily set aside so that Senator Graham may offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Harkin amendment, \nwhich was pending. It has been set aside by unanimous consent so I may \noffer an amendment which can be juxtaposed to the Harkin amendment.\n  The issue of overtime has been discussed at great length in the last \nfew days. The debate has been excellent. The Harkin amendment, as it \ncomes forward, is an attempt to address what the Senator from Iowa sees \nas a continuing problem with the regulations as proposed by the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  We need to review the history of what has happened so we can \nunderstand where we actually are in this process. The rules and \nregulations we are dealing with are over 50 years old and have evolved \nthrough a lot of litigation, court decisions, and regulatory activity \ninto what is a fairly Byzantine and complex set of regulations relative \nto who does and does not get overtime in our society.\n  Under today's law, if you make $8,000, you are guaranteed overtime. \nOnce you get over $8,000, you do not know what will happen. It depends \non how your job is classified. There is a lot of arcane classification \nwhich comes from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. For example, still in the \nlaw we have things such as straw man and a variety of different titles \nwhich have no relationship to reality in the marketplace as it is today \nand the workplace as it is today.\n  We need to update the regulations. The Department of Labor has done a \nvery conscientious job in trying to accomplish this and have offered a \nset of regulations as a proposed set of regulations. That proposed set \nof regulations received 80,000 comments, which is a huge amount of \ncommentary.\n  In the Senate, regrettably, it received a lot of hyperbole and attack \nas if it were a final regulation versus a proposed regulation. There \nwere significant misrepresentations that occurred in the process of \nattacking these regulations, including representations that under these \nregulations there would be a loss of a number of people who would have \nthe right to receive overtime, something like 8 million people, which \nnumber was arrived at in a totally spurious and inappropriate analysis \ndone, regrettably, by a couple of folks who either did not understand \nthe rules or decided to pervert the rules and which led, regrettably, \nto a lot of misrepresentation as these rules were said to be affecting \nthe overtime of over 8 million people.\n  I return to that argument because it was so bogus and so inaccurate \nthat it is important to understand how misleading it was as it \nrepresents sort of a theme of inaccuracy relative to the initial \nproposed regulations.\n  That 8 million number, when it was actually analyzed, included 1.5 \nmillion individuals who worked part time for less than 35 hours a week \nand therefore were not even covered by overtime issues. It included 3.8 \nmillion people who were actually technicians or administrative workers \nwho were already exempt as professionals from this rule. And it \nincluded 1.1 million workers who were paid on an hourly basis and \ntherefore would continue to be nonexempt under the proposal. It \nincluded 800,000 people who did manual blue-collar work and were \ntherefore completely exempted from this proposal. And it included \n200,000 cooks with 6 or more years of experience who clearly would\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nremain covered because cooks are not a category which would be impacted \nunder this regulation.\n\n  So the actual number of that 8 million number, when you actually \nanalyze it in honest terms, ends up being dramatically less. In fact, \nusing the analysis and using accurate factual applications to the \nanalysis as proposed, the number actually comes in below what the \nDepartment of Labor stated their original proposal might be impacted by \nthis event.\n  The number was bogus, as has been a lot, regrettably, of the debate \non this issue. The regrettable holding up and obstruction of various \npieces of legislation which have come to the Senate on the theme that \nthese proposed regulations were basically final regulations and that \nthey would do massive harm, which harm could not be defended on the \nfacts.\n  Now the Department of Labor has taken a look at the 80,000 comments \nwhich it has received and met with innumerable stakeholders, and \nlistened to all the input of organized labor, from the various other \ninterests that have a major role in this undertaking, and they put out \nfinal regulations. Interestingly enough, those final regulations are an \nextremely aggressive attempt to respond in a positive way to all the \ninput, the 80,000 items of input, comments which they received.\n  They have done such a good job in this area. It should be noted that \nthe Washington Post today, which had opposed these regulations when \nthey were initially proposed, or at least suggested significant changes \nthat should be made, has said, and I quote the Washington Post \neditorial, not a paper which carries the water of this administration:\n\n       What's needed now is not to block these regulations but to \n     ensure that they are vigorously enforced with an eye to \n     protecting the vulnerable workers the law was intended to \n     benefit.\n\n  The editorial points out what a good job the Department of Labor is \ndoing in the enforcement area. That is a simple and accurate reflection \nof what the Department of Labor did. They looked at the comments that \ncame in and they made the significant changes which have now made this \nregulation more appropriate and much more effective.\n  What is the goal of this regulation? The first goal of this \nregulation as proposed is to make sure people earning not a significant \namount of money are going to get overtime. So they raise the threshold \nfrom $8,000 to $23,000-plus. If you make in the $23,000 to $24,000 \nrange, you are guaranteed overtime. It does not matter what type of job \nyou have. If you are considered to be management or whatever, you are \ngoing to get overtime under this piece of legislation in a white-collar \nposition. That means that 6.7 million people who do not have an \nabsolute guarantee to overtime today under the present law are going to \nhave an absolute guarantee to overtime under the new regulation. That \nis a major step in the right direction.\n  It also says if you make more than $100,000 and you are in a white-\ncollar position--not a blue-color position; you are exempt in a blue-\ncollar position; you get overtime, even if you make more than \n$100,000--if you are in a white-collar position and earn over $100,000, \nyour overtime may be at issue. It depends on what you do.\n\n  Potentially there are 100,000 people, approximately, who may be \nimpacted by that regulation. In fact, if they are making more than \n$100,000, they may be in a management supervisory position so their \novertime may be impacted.\n  So 6.7 million people who do not get it today or may not get it today \nor may be at risk today will be guaranteed overtime. They will get it \nfor sure. People making more than $100,000 who are in certain job \ncategories, potentially 100,000 people, their overtime may be impacted, \nbut it is not absolutely sure. That is what it does as a practical \nmatter.\n  What it does, as a more significant point--and this is the whole \npurpose of the regulation besides making sure we raise that threshold \nfrom $8,000 to $23,400--what it does is try to put certainty and \ndefinition into the law.\n  Unfortunately, the law as it has presently evolved over the last 50 \nyears with all this regulation, regulatory changes, and all the court \ndecisions has really become a Byzantine morass. It is not clear. There \nis gray area everywhere and everything is getting litigated. It is the \nfastest area of lawsuit growth in the area of labor law. Class action \nsuits are being brought left and right. The practical impact of that is \nemployers and employees are suffering because of it. Resources which \nshould be used to give employees better benefits and to expand \nbusinesses so more people could be hired are being used to defend \nlawsuits to try to figure out whether this person's job is a job that \ninvolves overtime or is not a job that involves overtime, fending off \nlawsuits left and right, and, as a result, we end up with the \nmisallocation of resources, fewer jobs being created and fewer benefits \nbeing paid because the dollars are going out to attorneys who are \npursuing these lawsuits because the law is not clear. I don't say the \nlawsuits should not be brought but they are brought because the law is \nnot clear.\n  The Department of Labor has said they will clarify that and put \ncertainty in here. That is exactly what they have done with this \nregulation. They have made it clear and more certain as to who has the \nright to overtime and how those rights evolve. They have done such a \ngood job of eliciting 830,000 comments that even the Washington Post \nhas decided this regulation should go forward, or thinks this \nregulation should go forward.\n  Now the Senator from Iowa comes forward with another amendment to try \nto stall these regulations. I am not sure what the momentum is behind \nthat because, as I just mentioned, the practical effect of stalling \nthese regulations will mean that 6.7 million people who are going to \nget their overtime issue clarified and are going to be guaranteed \novertime will have that put at risk, although his amendment tries to \naddress that. To the extent this remains uncertain through this \nlegislative process, obviously things aren't going to happen as \neffectively as they should.\n\n  Secondly, his amendment essentially goes back to a situation where we \nare looking at the old law. We are going to go back to the old law to \ndefine how an individual's overtime is paid or whether they have a \nright to it. It juxtaposes the old law and the new law. So now an old \nlaw, which was already grossly Byzantine, complex, and unclear, is \ngoing to be brought back into play on top of the new regulations. The \npractical effect is, we will have even more litigation, and we will \nhave to do it by individual jobs.\n  There is no attempt to address the overall issue in a comprehensive \nand systematic way. Instead it says, here is a jump ball. You, the \nindividual, are going to have to look at the old law, the new law, and \nthen you the individual and you the individual employer are going to \nhave to figure out what you are doing with the old law and the new law \nbefore you can figure out what your overpayment is going to be.\n  The practical implication will be you are going to see a class \nceiling. You are going to have a ceiling because no employer is going \nto be willing to move anybody into any position of any responsibility \nfrom where they are already because they aren't going to know what \neffect that is going to have on that individual's overtime. They are \ngoing to be buying a lawsuit.\n  If you are a clerk working in a business somewhere and you suddenly \nstart to be promoted into a position of maybe taking over some \nresponsibility and making decisions on who gets what or who doesn't get \nwhat in the area that you have your responsibility within your activity \nwithin that business, you are going to immediately be putting that \nbusiness and that company into the issue of whether you have a right \nany longer to overtime. It is going to be an individual decision that \ncompany has to make on you, the person who is getting more \nresponsibility. What is the practical effect of that?\n  That business, that company is going to say, we don't need that \nlawsuit. We are going to go out and hire a new person to do these new \nduties who we know won't be subject to any sort of issues relative to \novertime. And you, the person who maybe worked your way up through the \nsystem and have gotten to a point where the people you work with have \nconfidence in you, they are not going to give you that promotion or \nadded responsibility because they are not going to want to risk the \ncost of a lawsuit that may come with it.\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\n  You are going to create a class ceiling in the whole system as a \nresult of basically throwing into play again this whole concept of \nindividuals and old law, which is totally gray, and the new \nregulations. It will be chaos in the area of who is and who is not \nexempt from overtime, if the Harkin amendment is passed.\n  So we are offering an alternative. If there is an issue as to any \ngroup as to whether they get overtime, we are going to try to clarify \nit once and for all. There have been about 55 groups who have come \nforward and said they feel they may be an issue. We don't think most of \nthem are because we think the regulation is pretty clear for most of \nthese groups that they basically retain their right to overtime. But \njust so there can be no question about it, this amendment specifically \nnames every one of those groups and says they have the right to \novertime at a minimum. They have the right to their present overtime \nsituation. If the new law gives them better, puts them in a better \nposition, they have a right to that. In other words, they either win or \nthey win more.\n\n  I want to list some of these groups because this has been the issue. \nWhen the rubber hits the road is when each group of people who are \ngoing to be impacted get impacted. Some of them have come forward and \nsaid, we have concerns. Firefighters had concerns. Cooks had concerns. \nPeople who were nurses had concerns. In our opinion, the regulations \nnever impacted those groups, but it is going to be unalterably clear \nwhen this amendment passes.\n  Let me list some of the 55 groups. These occupations or \nclassifications will either get what they get now or they will get \nanything they might get that is better under the new regulation: Any \nworker paid on an hourly basis--that is a pretty broad group, a lot of \npeople; blue collar workers--that is a lot of people; any worker \nprovided overtime under a collective bargaining agreement--that would \nbe true anyway, but we are making it absolutely clear; team leaders; \ncomputer programmers; registered nurses; licensed practical nurses; \nnurse midwives; nursery school teachers; oil and gas pipeline workers; \noil- and gasfield workers; oil and gas platform workers; refinery \nworkers; steelworkers, shipyard and ship scraping workers; teachers; \ntechnicians; journalists; chefs; cooks; police officers; firefighters; \nfire sergeants; police sergeants; emergency medical technicians; \nparamedics; waste disposal workers; daycare workers; maintenance \nworkers; production line employees; construction employees; carpenters; \nmechanics; plumbers; ironworkers--these people are all covered anyway, \nbut we are going to list them--craftsmen; operating engineers; \nlaborers; painters; cement masons; stone and brick masons; sheet metal \nworkers; utility workers; longshoremen; statutory engineers; welders, \nboilermakers; funeral directors--we may want to stick embalmers under \nthat--athletic trainers; outside sales employees; inside sales \nemployees; grocery store managers; financial services industry workers; \nroute drivers; assistant retail managers.\n  So this amendment basically, once again, goes to the fundamental goal \nof this regulation, beyond expanding the people who have an absolute \nright to overtime, which, by raising the minimum from $8,000 to \n$23,400, this amendment goes to getting clarity, clarity in the law so \nthat instead of having a lot of lawsuits and a lot of churning in the \nmarketplace, we can use resources to pay people overtime and to create \nnew jobs, which is the goal and the purpose of the regulations as they \nwere proposed by the Department of Labor. I think rather than having \nthe Department of Labor out here on a whipping post over the last few \ndays, which it has been regrettably from some Members of the other \nside, they should be congratulated for doing exactly what they are \nsupposed to do.\n  They put out a proposed regulation. The regulation was a concept \nbuilt out of a lot of study and effort. Granted, it wasn't as well \nthought out as it might have been. I had reservations about the \nregulation. But at the time I said, let's wait until we see the final \nregulation before we make any final calls.\n  Then they listened to the commentary, 80,000 comments, hundreds of \nmeetings with stakeholders. They had lots of input from organized \nlabor. They significantly pared back, sifted off, sugared off their \nproposal and have designed a regulation which makes basic good sense, \nwhich is that people with low incomes will be guaranteed overtime up to \n$23,400, and people who fall above that income level will have a much \nmore defined understanding of whether they have overtime. We will not \nhave all this lawsuit confusion and activity which is so draining on \nthe efficient use of capital.\n\n  But to make it absolutely clear, beyond question, that any of the \ncategories who were in issue and who had a concern during the comment \nperiod will get the best treatment possible, either under the old law \nor the new law, we have added this amendment as collateral to the \nexercise.\n  I think with this amendment, people can vote with absolute confidence \non the regulations and support the initiative of these regulations, \nwhich is to make the marketplace fairer for workers.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3111.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify \n                  provisions relating to overtime pay)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3112\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I will soon be offering an \namendment which, it is my understanding, will be debated later today. \nAs I look at the JOBS bill before us, it seems to me that it has \nseveral purposes. At least two of those purposes are, one, to repeal \nthe current law which has been found by the World Trade Organization to \nbe in violation of its standards and, as a result, has caused \nretaliatory tariffs to be applied against certain of our American \nproducts.\n  A second objective of the JOBS bill is to encourage the maintenance \nand creation of jobs in the United States of America. The amendment \nwill strike certain provisions of this proposed law. It will strike the \nmanufacturers' deduction and changes in the international tax law. Then \nit uses the funds that are released by that action to provide for a \nmanufacturing employers' credit on income tax, based on the payroll tax \nof those manufacturing employers.\n  In my judgment, this alternative better targets the tax incentive to \njobs in the United States of America. The incentives in the underlying \nbill are based on corporate profits, not American employment, which I \nbelieve makes them less efficient, less effective, and significantly \nless likely to fulfill its title, ``JOBS.''\n  I will have more to say about this amendment and the concerns we have \nabout the underlying proposal later today when we debate this amendment \nin detail.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3112.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, with the understanding that I will work to get more time \nfor him. For the time being, I yield him 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to support \nthe amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire when we come about \ndoing this. I want to say it is not much to bargain, because one of the \nprincipal arguments the Senator from New Hampshire has made is by \nlisting these 55 new categories, that will provide clarification. To \nthe contrary, it will provide additional litigation because the test in \nthe Department of Labor refers to the duties and not to the \nprofessional names that are being used.\n  So if you have a cook or a chef, does that apply to somebody just \ncooking the food or someone at the salad bar who also considers \nthemselves to be included? Plus, there are additional people who have \nnot been included as well.\n  This is a continuation of a misguided policy. We heard in March of \nlast year from the Department of Labor, under the guise they were \ntrying to streamline the process and procedure. They issued their \nregulations and said only 644,000 people would be affected. Then we \nfind there were going to be 8 million who would lose overtime. So the \nadministration retreated on that. Then they promulgated their recent \nlegislation. Just this morning, Tammy McCutcheon from the Department of \nLabor said nobody will lose overtime between $23,660 and $100,000. That \nis this morning.\n\n  Then we have the Senate Republicans' alleged position to make sure 55 \ncategories, which are basically categories above $23,660 and below \n$100,000, will be protected. We are not sure what this is all about. We \nknow there is going to be a cut in overtime for hard-pressed working \nfamilies in America. That is what will be the result.\n  Let's look at where the record is with regard to middle-income \nworking families. We know there has been a loss of some 2 million jobs \nunder this administration. It is not only the loss of jobs, it is the \nfact the existing jobs have lost income over the last 2 years. We have \nseen the loss of real income in those jobs that exist by about $1,300.\n  Let's look at this fact. The new jobs being created are paying 21 \npercent less. This chart shows between 2000 and 2002, we have had a \nreal loss in wages for existing jobs. If you look at the new jobs being \ncreated, they are paying, on average, 21 percent less. In New York, it \nis 38 percent less. So workers are working longer, working harder, and \nthey are making less income even today.\n  The cost of the things they are purchasing is going right up through \nthe roof. If you look at the squeeze for middle-income families, this \nchart illustrates it. There is an increase in childcare of 100 percent. \nIn recent years, an increase of 60 percent in health insurance. In the \nlast 5 years, mortgage payments have increased 69 percent. Here we find \nmiddle-income, working families, with a loss of 2 million jobs. Those \nwho are still working have a loss of income. For individuals who are \nable to get jobs, they are seeing new jobs paying 21 percent less.\n  Look what is happening to them in terms of the expenses for middle-\nincome America. Childcare is going up through the roof, health \ninsurance is going up through the roof, mortgages are going up through \nthe roof, and education for their children is going right up through \nthe roof.\n  During the Bush years, the middle-class family squeeze has tightened. \nThis is a net loss of 2 percent in real purchasing terms in wages \nbetween 2000 and 2004. Home prices are up 18 percent; health and other \ninsurance, as I mentioned, is up 50 percent; tuition, in 5 years, has \ngone up 35 percent; utilities have gone up 15 percent.\n  Everything has been going up except the income of working families. \nAnd we have an administration that is opposed to an increase in the \nminimum wage, which has not increased in 7 years; an administration \nthat is opposed to extending unemployment compensation, and 85,000 \nAmerican workers are losing their extended unemployment compensation \nevery week.\n  Now the administration is taking away overtime at the direct request \nof a number of industries. We know what this is all about. We have the \nrequests from the various industries. The National Restaurant \nAssociation requests the Department of Labor include chefs under the \ncreative professional category as well as the learned professional \ncategory. Look what happens when DOL puts out their regulation:\n\n       The Department concludes that to the extent a chef has a \n     primary duty of work requiring invention, imagination, \n     originality, or talent, he will be considered exempt from \n     overtime.\n\n  Thank you very much, National Restaurant Association.\n  How dare those opposed to this proposal say this is for \nsimplification. We know what this is all about.\n  For example, in the insurance industry, here is what this says:\n\n       The National Association of Insurance Companies supports \n     the section of the proposed regulation providing that claims \n     adjustors, including those working for insurance companies, \n     satisfy the administrative exemption.\n\n  That is the what the National Association for Mutual Insurance \nCompanies wrote to the Department. Sure enough, look at what happened \nwhen the administration promulgates its regulation:\n\n       Insurance claims adjustors generally meet the duties \n     requirements for the administration exemption.\n\n  Thank you very much to the insurance companies.\n  You talk about simplification--we know what is going on. These are \nspecial interests that are trying to enhance the bottom line.\n  We can go on with industry after industry. Let's look at what has \nhappened now in the period of the last 4 years. Here we find a Wall \nStreet recovery that leaves Main Street behind. Here it is. Corporate \nprofits. There has been a 57.5-percent increase in corporate profits, \nbut in workers' wages, it was 1.5 percent.\n  Do we understand that? Here we have corporate profits of 57.5 percent \nand workers' wages of 1.5 percent. Now the administration says workers \nare getting paid too much. We have to do something about overtime.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  I do not know what middle-income working families have done to the \nBush administration. I really do not understand why they declare war on \nthe working families in this country, but it is war. It is a clear \npriority that they are not going to be attended to.\n  We saw recently when we had the whole issue of providing pension \nrelief for multiemployers, the 9.5 million workers who are working, \nsmall business, and also those in the building trades and others, 9.5 \nmillion who were looking for a similar kind of relief that we were \nproviding for single employers, the administration said no. Those were \n9.5 million workers, basically middle-income working families. They \nsaid no to them with regard to retirement; no to increasing minimum \nwage; no to unemployment compensation; no overtime. That is the record.\n  We have the list the administration talks about. They have 55 \ncategories on that list which has been included in the Gregg amendment, \nbut I do not see the insurance adjustors on that list, I do not see \ncashiers on the list, I do not see bookkeepers on the list, and the \nlist goes on.\n  Yesterday, when we raised these questions, we were assured: Oh, no, \nyou just don't understand; you don't really understand. We really \nprovided the protection.\n  We have the Department of Labor speaking out of one side of its mouth \nin testimony this morning saying one thing, and now we have something \nelse on the floor of the Senate. Let's get it right, Mr. President. \nLet's get it right. Let's adopt the Harkin amendment and make sure we \nare going to say to those Americans who are going to have to work \novertime that they are going to be adequately compensated. That has \nbeen the law since the late 1930s: a 40-hour workweek, and if you are \ngoing to work overtime, you are going to get time and a half.\n  There are some industries that do not have that protection. I remind \nworkers out there who may be watching this morning that under this \nadministration, you are going to find out you are no longer provided \nwith overtime protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair remind me when I have 1 minute remaining, \nplease.\n  This chart shows what happens when you do not have overtime \nprotection. In industries today that do not have overtime protection, \nthe chances of workers working more than 40 hours a week is 44 percent. \nIn companies that have to pay time and a half, it is down to 19 \npercent. For 50 hours a week, we find out it is 15 percent versus 5 \npercent.\n  Once we take leave of overtime protections, workers beware. They are \nsending a message to you. They can say it is simplification and they \ncan say it is modernization. We know how to do that. The Harkin \namendment does that. But if you are talking about working longer, \nworking harder, and making less, you are talking about the \nadministration's position.\n  Now we are taking a third bite at the apple. First, the \nadministration came out with a proposal, and it was defeated in the \nSenate and defeated in the House of Representatives. Then they went \nback. They took weeks and months to redefine it; then they came back \nand made representations, as the Department of Labor spokesman said, \nthat it was not going to affect anyone between $26,000 and $100,000. \nNow we have a third introduction on the floor of the Senate just before \nnoon today to make sure that the 55 categories, many of which have been \nmentioned in the course of the debate, are going to be protected.\n  Let's just do the job right. Let's just say: Look, American workers \nare working longer and harder than any other group of workers. This is \na chart that shows that workers in the United States of America work \nlonger and harder than any other industrial nation in the world. They \nare already working longer and harder. They are having a harder, more \ndifficult time making ends meet, as I just pointed out, with the cost \nof health care, education, mortgage, utilities, the threats to their \npension systems, and the outsourcing of jobs across this country. Let's \nnot take away from them the one part of their pay which has been there \nsince the 1930s, and that is the overtime pay. Let's not take that away \nfrom them, too.\n  That is what the administration is attempting to do. The Harkin \namendment will resist it. I hope when we have that opportunity--I will \nvote for the Gregg amendment because it mentions the 55 different \ncategories, even though I think it probably opens up greater litigation \nin terms of defining what is a ``cook'' and what is a ``chef'' and what \nis a newspaper person and how that is going to be defined. It is going \nto open up litigation. Nevertheless, it is an attempt at least in those \n55 areas to make sure they are protected. I am going to vote for that \namendment, but Tom Harkin has the right amendment. It is the right way \nto go, and I hope the Senate will follow his lead.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4794-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \nallowing me to have this time. I have been trying to get some time on \nthe floor and sometimes it is difficult.\n  I am very encouraged by the way the JOBS bill is moving. I am a \nstrong supporter of the bill. I support it in particular because I have \nbeen working in four areas. One area is to stop runaway film \nproduction, and we have good incentives in the bill to help us with \nthat, which is very important to California. Another area is to \nencourage the bringing back of capital that has been parked overseas \nfor a 1-year experiment to see if jobs will be created. It is a very \ngood provision, and I hope my colleagues will support it as it was \nwritten. That was done in conjunction with Senators Ensign and Smith. \nThird, there is a provision to give farmers a tax credit for water \nconservation. Fourth, there is a good provision in there to help our \nlocal governments that have been paying the salaries of National \nGuardsmen and reservists to help them with that financial burden. So I \nam pleased about that.\n  I am also hopeful we can get the highway bill, the transit bill, \nmoving because the Senate bill is excellent and I think if the two \nparties can reach some accommodation, we should be able to get that \nmoving. So between the JOBS bill and the highway bill, we are looking \nat a tremendous number of jobs. Certainly, regardless of what State one \nis in jobs are wanted. These are good jobs and I am very hopeful.\n  I came today primarily to talk about the situation in Iraq. There are \nmany casualties of this Iraq war. Above all are the soldiers who will \nnever return--so far, more than 753 of them. There are the wounded who \nwill need our help to heal physically and mentally--so far 3,864 of \nthem. Then there are the families who, along with their pride, will \nbear the losses and the scars forever.\n  There are the innocent Iraqi civilians who are the ones our President \nsays we are fighting for, and others caught in the middle, the press, \ncontractors, diplomats. When the President landed on the aircraft \ncarrier 1 year ago, he told us major combat was over. That was wrong \nand our casualties have grown. For the sake of the troops, for the love \nof the troops, we must not add yet another casualty to this war. We \nmust not let truth be a casualty of this war.\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\n  The American people need to know the truth. The American people need \nto see the truth. In a democracy, letting the people know the truth is \nthe essence of what it means to be free. The President says we are \nfighting for freedom in Iraq, and that is the current mission. Let us \nnot stifle those precious values in our own country that we love so \nmuch.\n  There are some disturbing events going on. Why would we be told by \nthis administration that paying respect to flag-draped coffins of our \nfallen soldiers is somehow a violation of privacy and the American \npeople would be violating privacy rights if they see those coffins? I \nthink by now all of America has seen those photographs, photographs of \nthose coffins draped with the American flag and the care that is shown \nto those coffins and those flags by the military. Those pictures we did \nsee were anything but a violation of privacy. They were a moving \ntribute to our troops. How shocking it is that we only saw those \nphotographs after a Freedom Of Information Act request. We could not \nget those photographs. How shocking is it that the woman who actually \ngot those photographs out to the public was fired, those dignified \npictures.\n\n  No one's identity is known when you look at those pictures. All we \nknow is our brave young troops are making the ultimate sacrifice. As \none grieving parent said when she saw those pictures, she was consoled \nat the way her son was treated, with love and respect--and the flag. It \nwas comforting to her. It wasn't a violation of her privacy. Those \ntroops didn't have their names put in those pictures or their faces \nshown.\n  Some will say when they view those coffins that we must stay the \ncourse. Others will say change the course. That is what I say: \nInternationalize this, have an exit strategy and a clear mission. Our \ntroops are carrying 90 percent of the burden. So are our taxpayers. So \nI believe, yes, we need to change this course. It is not working. But \nwe need to give the Iraqis a chance to build their own future. It \nshould be in their hands. It must be in their hands. That is what \ndemocracy is all about. We can teach it, we can explain it, but they \nmust want it enough to make it work for them.\n  The idea of internationalizing this war is not partisan. I am proud \nto serve on the Foreign Relations Committee where we have agreement \nbetween Senators Biden and Lugar about internationalizing. We have \nSenator Hagel who is on that side, Senator Chafee, myself, Senator \nDodd, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Kerry, and really most of the \ncommittee--not all, but most of the committee. So we have a chance to \nget out of this morass in a bipartisan way.\n  Backing up a little bit, this administration didn't want us to see \nthe pictures of the flag-draped coffins. Seven stations from Sinclair \nBroadcasting Group barred viewers from hearing the names of our fallen \nheroes. The Sinclair Broadcasting Group is a big supporter of this \nadministration.\n  I asked them why shouldn't the faces of our fallen sons and daughters \nbe seen? Why shouldn't their names be heard? This is America. This is \nthe greatest democracy in the world. But we could lose it as sure as I \nam standing here if our people are kept from the truth. Yes, in every \nwar people die. In my years in the Congress I voted for two resolutions \nto use military force. If you vote for war, you need to see the face of \nit, and so do the American people.\n  There are many faces to war. There is the face of courage, of \nbravery, of fellowship. There is the face of fear. Above all, there is \nlove of country.\n  As we are learning, sometimes the face of war is brutal. Sherman \nsaid, ``War is hell.'' Clearly he saw it.\n  The sickening images of the past few days from war prisons in Iraq do \nnot match with the values and ethics of our country and our people and \nour military. Something went terribly wrong, and the people at the very \ntop are responsible. There was no talk from the very top about getting \nto the bottom of this until those pictures made it into the press, \nthose brutal pictures from the prisons. I know we will fix this. We \nwill fix it now because some people in the military had the strength of \ncharacter to blow the whistle, to tell the truth. I am asking our \nCommander in Chief to do more than he has done so far, to speak out \nmore, to hold some people at the very top accountable because this \nscandal has unfortunately hurt our country. It has hurt our cause. It \nis undermining the thousands of acts of compassion and caring of our \nmilitary during this rough time.\n\n  To win the cause we all believe in, the spread of true democracy all \nover the world, we need to win by example, not just with speeches but \nby example; not just with military might but by gaining the respect of \nthe world. To win the respect of the world, truth must never be a \ncasualty of war. Let's hear the names. Let's see the faces. Let's see \nthe courage and the fear and the bravery and the failings. The American \npeople are wise. They will decide from all the evidence whether the \ncourse we are on should be continued or whether we need a fresh start, \na new plan--whether it is all worth it.\n  According to a newspaper report, the Army investigative report \npainted a picture of a prison in Iraq completely in disarray. To me, \nthat is a metaphor for the aftermath of our initial military success, \ndisarray. There is no plan. There is still no plan. And the problem is \nnot with our brave military but from the highest civilian leadership.\n  We need to measure the dollar cost of this war. So far we have spent \n$133 billion on the Iraq war, while we struggle to find the means to do \nwhat we must at home, for our children, for our health, for our \nenvironment. I have a quick list. We have spent $133 billion on this \nwar since March of 2003.\n  Look at all we spend in a year on drug enforcement, $2 billion. Look \nat all we spend on education for our children, $58 billion. Look at all \nwe spent for a year on afterschool programs, $1 billion. We spent $6.8 \nbillion on Head Start; total highway spending, $34 billion; the \nTransportation Security Administration, so important in a war against \nterror, $4.6 billion; Coast Guard, $6.8 billion; veterans' health, $28 \nbillion; National Institutes of Health, to find the cures for cancer \nand heart disease, $27 billion; total environmental spending, $8.4 \nbillion; and to clean up the most toxic Superfund sites, $1.3 billion.\n  This administration is telling us we don't have the money, even \nthough highways and transit is a dedicated tax. Yet we have spent $133 \nbillion in Iraq. It is time for a timeout, to step back from this \nmorass, to hold people accountable, to change course.\n  I am going to finish up now because I, too, want to move ahead with \nthe bills we have on the Senate floor. But I thought it was worth it to \ntake a few minutes to reflect on where we are.\n  We have lost 168 Californians to date in this war. I have read their \nnames and will continue to do that. If anyone says I have no right to \ndo this--and no one has--but if anyone does want to shut out my words, \nI will tell them: This is America, and I love my country because my \ncountry is based on freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Gregg amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Harkin amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order to either amendment prior to the votes; \nprovided further that all time from 2:15 to 3:30 be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say this prior to not objecting. This \nis the first significant movement we have had on this bill. We are \nanticipating moving forward to another couple of amendments and maybe \nhaving two other sets of votes prior to our adjourning for the night. I \nthink this is good progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use whatever time I may consume.\n  Before the Senator from California leaves the floor, I want to \ncommend and applaud the Senator from California. No one can ever \nquestion her right and her experience in speaking about the military. I \ncan remember\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nwhen we served together in the House of Representatives. This new \nCongresswoman from the State of California raised issues that became \nknown throughout the country, such as the toilet seat which cost $600, \nand other things. For the first time in this era of Congress somebody \nlooked at abuses taking place with the spending in the Defense \nDepartment. No one is more qualified to do that than the Senator from \nCalifornia, especially in light of the fact that almost 200 men and \nwomen from the State of California have been killed in the war. This \ndoes not take into consideration the hundreds of people who have been \nmaimed, who have lost eyes and limbs and have been paralyzed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. More than 3,000.\n  Mr. REID. Certainly no one can question the Senator from California \nraising this as an issue. I commend and applaud the Senator from \nCalifornia for doing this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, actually we are debating the JOBS bill right \nnow. There is a lot of conversation that takes us in another direction. \nI suspect that is for a very specific purpose--actually to get into \nPresidential elections. What we ought to be concentrating on is making \nsure there are jobs in this country. Some of those jobs are at stake \nright now because the WTO said we violated international law and they \nplaced a 5-percent penalty on companies from the United States, and \nthat penalty grows at 1 percent a month.\n  While we delay on this bill, the price is going up for American \nbusiness, and when business declines, the jobs decline. Perhaps that is \na point one side would like to make. Maybe that is what they want to \nhave happen. I don't want jobs to decline. I don't care who is \nPresident or what the race is. It is very important we get jobs.\n  Part of the discussion we have entered into under this JOBS bill has \nbeen one about the overtime rule the Secretary of Labor has published. \nWe have heard a lot of comments about overtime from our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. I want people to know the rest of the \nstory. I want people to be aware of the smokescreen that covers \nelection year politics with misleading rhetoric about overtime pay. It \nis time to strip rhetoric from reality, look through the smokescreen, \nand see who is really helped and hurt by Senator Harkin's attempt to \nblock the Department of Labor from updating the rules governing \novertime eligibility for white-collar workers. That is right, the word \nis ``updating.'' The Department was told by GAO the rule needed to be \nupdated. The rule was outdated. The rule referred to things people \ncannot possibly comply with because nobody knows what they are anymore. \nIt is confusing as well.\n  The Senator from Iowa has proposed keeping the trial lawyers' dream. \nHe wants to keep the gray area in the bill as an addition to the rule. \nYes. There is a gray area. I can tell you this mostly affects small \nbusinesses. I can tell you small businesses realize it is going to cost \nthem about $375 million a year in overtime. I don't know how we can \ntalk about a decrease in overtime when it costs them $375 million more \nin overtime, but to have the gray area cleared up they are willing to \ndo that. Why are they willing to do that? Because right now that $375 \nmillion potential is for lawyers' fees to decide gray areas. Who needs \nthat? We would rather put the money in the workers' pockets.\n  This clarifies who gets overtime, but it clarifies it more broadly \nthan anything we have ever done before. Do you know right now the only \npeople who know for sure they will get overtime are those who make less \nthan $8,060 a year? Yes. If you earn over $8,060 a year, you move into \nthis gray area where you may have to hire an attorney to help you \nfigure out whether you get overtime. The small businesses have to do \nthat.\n  This rule the Department of Labor has issued is going to raise that \n$8,060 to $23,660--pretty much triple the amount. It is long overdue. \nIt needs to be done, and it was willing to be done from the very \nbeginning.\n  The Department also put in there that white-collar workers earning \nover $65,000 were not assured of overtime. They listened to 75,000 \ncomments and said, We picked the wrong number. It should be over \n$100,000.\n  You notice I mentioned white-collar workers. Blue-collar workers are \nexempt and assured of the overtime. It doesn't have the $100,000 limit \non it.\n  Another thing that disturbs me about the debate we are having is the \nimplication that without a rule, without a law, there would be no \novertime. I want you to know there are businesses--particularly small \nbusinesses--out there that are not only paying overtime for some \nspecial tasks, but they are paying double time and triple time to be \nsure they have the workers they need to do the job.\n  There needs to be a rule. The rule needs to be one that is newer than \nthe 50-year-old one so we can understand the jobs that are being talked \nabout.\n  Last March, the Department solicited public comments on a proposal to \nupdate these regulations. They received more than 75,000 comments on \nthe proposal. I happen to believe public comment plays a critical role \nin the regulatory process. We want the public to comment on any new \nrule being written. We then want the Department to review these \ncomments and to respond to them. That is how the process is supposed to \nwork. This is the regulatory process Americans expect and deserve. I \nhave seen times before when agencies did not pay attention. Then it \nbecame critical for us to do something. That is not the case in this \ninstance. They listened to the 75,000 comments that were sent in \nwriting. It is obvious they listened to the comments on this floor, and \nthey made those revisions in the rule before they published the final \nrule. The Department of Labor carefully considered those 75,000 \ncomments. They listened to the concerns of the American people, and \nthen they did the final overtime rule and they made substantial changes \nto the proposal.\n  I have my own concerns with the proposed rule. In fact, I wrote a \nletter to Secretary Chao, along with Senator Collins, asking the \nDepartment to pay particular attention to protecting the overtime \nstatus of public safety officers, veterans, and nurses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2004.\n     Hon. Elaine L. Chao,\n     Secretary of Labor, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 \n         Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chao: We want to take this opportunity to \n     applaud the Department of Labor's efforts to update and \n     clarify the rules Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for \n     Executive, Administrative, Outside Sales and Computer \n     Employees. The proposed rule revises the definitions of \n     ``executive,'' ``administrative,'' and ``professional,'' \n     employees considered exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     overtime compensation requirement.\n       The workplace has dramatically changed during the last half \n     century. However, the regulations governing the overtime \n     exemption for such employees remain substantially the same as \n     they were fifty years ago. As our economy has evolved, new \n     occupations have emerged that were not even contemplated when \n     the current regulations were written. The Department of Labor \n     has undertaken the difficult but necessary task of updating \n     the rules to reflect the realities of the 21st Century \n     workplace. In so doing, the Department will extend overtime \n     protection to an estimated 1.3 million low-wage workers.\n       The Department of Labor has received approximately 80,000 \n     comments to the proposed rule. We happen to believe that \n     public comments play a critical role in the regulatory \n     process. The Department of Labor has the responsibility, and \n     must be given the opportunity, to review these many comments. \n     We urge the Department to carefully consider all of the \n     public comments in crafting the final regulations.\n       We ask the Department of Labor to pay particular attention \n     to concerns that have been raised regarding the overtime \n     status of public safety officers, veterans, and nurses. The \n     final rules should clearly reflect that the overtime rights \n     of public safety officers, veterans, and nurses will not be \n     restricted. These individuals have devoted their lives to \n     protecting the lives of Americans. They deserve our \n     protection as well. We also ask the Department of Labor to be \n     responsive to the needs of small businesses in finalizing and \n     providing compliance assistance on the rule.\n       We look forward to the Department of Labor publishing its \n     final rule that is responsive to the public comments received \n     and the concerns we mentioned.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n     Susan M. Collins.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we asked the final rule clearly ensure the \novertime rights of these workers would not\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nbe restricted. I am very pleased the Department made the changes to \nclearly reflect the overtime rights of public safety officers, \nveterans, and nurses would not be restricted.\n  Let me highlight some of changes that were made in the final rule to \nbetter protect the overtime rights of workers and many others.\n  The final rule states first responders such as police, firefighters, \nparamedics, and emergency medical technicians are eligible for overtime \npay. No question; no gray area, it clears it up.\n  The reference to training in the Armed Forces has been deleted and \nclarifies that veteran status does not affect overtime. The veterans \nwill get their overtime regardless of the training received in the \narmed services.\n  The final rule also states licensed practical nurses do not qualify \nas exempt learned professionals and are therefore eligible for overtime \npay.\n  The final rule retains previous law regarding registered nurses which \nassures them of overtime.\n  The final rule provides blue-collar workers are eligible for overtime \npay.\n  To be considered exempt from overtime, the salary level for highly \ncompensated employees is the final rule which has been increased from \n$65,000 to $100,000.\n  The final rule clarifies the contractual obligation under collective \nbargaining agreements is not affected.\n  The final rule maintains the previous law requirement that exempt \nadministrative employees must exercise discretion and independent \njudgment.\n  The final rule clarifies there is no change to current law regarding \nthe educational requirement for the professional exemption.\n  Significant changes were made to address the concerns raised about \nthe proposed rule. This is exactly how the public comment period is \ndesigned to work and exactly how it did work in this situation. The \nregulatory process worked, and we have a final rule that is better for \nboth workers and employers.\n  Again, we are talking about the small businessmen who do not have \ntime to go through a lot of this or have the ability to hire attorneys \nto figure these things out. We need to keep it simple and \nunderstandable. The rule does that.\n  Before the final rule was published, my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle stood in the Senate and blasted the proposed rule on the \nvery issues that the final rule corrects. The Senator from Iowa still \nwants to block the Department of Labor from updating the rules \ngoverning overtime pay for white collar employees. This would, in \neffect, tell the American people that the public's role in the \nregulatory process means nothing. This would say those 75,000 comments \nmean nothing. This would leave complex and confusing rules that have \nnot been significantly changed in 50 years. We owe all our constituents \nmore than that.\n  When I am back in Wyoming, I like to hold town meetings to find out \nwhat is on the minds of my constituents. At each town meeting there is \nusually someone in attendance quite concerned about government \nregulations. I am often told to rein in big government and keep rules \nsimple, keep them current, keep them responsive, keep them \nunderstandable for small business, and make sure they make sense in \ntoday's ever-changing workplace.\n  My colleague on the other side of the aisle would take the opposite \napproach. Instead of keeping it simple and current, he wants to keep \nall of the gray areas from before and impose them on a second set of \nregulations. That is what we need--multiple sets of regulations; now a \nmisunderstandable set with a new set imposed on it, protecting the old \nset so the trial attorneys' dream still exists. He wants to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Labor from updating the outdated rules regarding white \ncollar employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime \nrequirements. Simply put, it is an attempt to reject the new, turn back \nthe clock, and look to yesterday for the answers to tomorrow's \nproblems. The amendment keeps the confusion. It is an approach that is \ndoomed to failure. I am opposed to it.\n  There is no question the workplace has dramatically changed during \nthe last half century. The regulations governing white collar \nexemptions, however, remain substantially the same as they were 50 \nyears ago. The existing rule takes us back to the time when workers \nheld titles such as straw boss, keypunch operator, leg man, and other \noccupations that no longer exist today. Our economy has evolved. New \noccupations have emerged that were not contemplated when the \nregulations were written. A 1999 study by the General Accounting \nOffice, GAO, recommended that the Department of Labor comprehensively \nreview current regulations and restructure white collar exemptions to \nbetter accommodate today's workplace and to anticipate future workplace \ntrends. This is precisely what the Labor Department has done.\n  What will Senator Harkin's effort to block the final rule do? It will \nset the clock back to 1954 and try to force a square peg--the 21st \ncentury jobs--in the round hole of the workplace 50 years ago. Worse, \nit keeps the gray areas of the past rule instead of clarifying. This \nobstruction will undermine the Department of Labor efforts to extend \novertime protection to an additional 1.3 million low-wage workers. \nUnder the old rule, only those workers earning less than $8,060 a year \nare automatically protected for overtime pay. The Department's new rule \nwill raise this threshold to $23,660 a year. The final rule provides \nlower income workers with the protection they deserve.\n\n  By undermining the Department's efforts to better protect lower \nincome workers, who is this amendment going to protect? The Department \ndetermined that few, if any, employees earning between $23,660 and \n$100,000 will lose their overtime pay under the new rule. The \nDepartment estimates that 107,000 employees who are earning over \n$100,000 could--could but not necessarily would--lose their overtime. \nCould our colleagues be willing to deny overtime pay for an additional \n1.3 million low-wage workers in order to protect the overtime for the \n107,000 workers earning above $100,000? Is Congress going to undermine \nthe purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is to protect low-\nwage workers?\n  The Senator from Iowa and his effort to block the final overtime rule \nwill not protect first responders, veterans, blue collar workers, or \nnurses. The final rule has been improved to clearly protect the \novertime rights of these workers. Therefore, the opponents of updating \nand clarifying the white collar overtime rule had to come up with new \nobjections. No lawsuits necessary, it is very clear. That is what the \nDepartment intends.\n  On April 13, the AFL-CIO released and began soliciting contributions \nfor a political TV ad attacking the Department of Labor final overtime \nrule. Here is what is interesting about that: That attack came a week \nbefore the final rule was publicly available, before they knew what was \nin it. Such tactics suggest a greater interest in playing election year \npolitics than in protecting workers.\n  Let me respond to some misleading claims about the final rule. Some \nhave claimed that team leaders will lose overtime pay under the final \nrule. In fact, the new rule will guarantee overtime protection for blue \ncollar team leaders and is more protective of overtime pay for white \ncollar team leaders. Furthermore, there is no change to current law \nregarding the overtime status of computer employees, financial services \nemployees, journalists, insurance claims directors, funeral directors, \nathletic trainers, nursery schoolteachers, or chefs.\n  It is time to get beyond the election year rhetoric and misleading \ninformation about who is supposedly harmed by the Department's new \novertime requirements; therefore, I am supporting the amendment offered \nby Senator Gregg of New Hampshire to require the final overtime \nrequirements to safeguard the overtime rights of workers earning less \nthan $23,660 and certain categories of workers that some erroneously \nclaim would lose overtime rights. His amendment very specifically names \nthose and assures those rights. It is in the rule as well. I am \nconfident the final regulations published by the Department of Labor on \nApril 23 already do that, too.\n  The Gregg amendment serves to make it clear that it is the intent of \nCongress to ensure that the overtime rights of 55 listed occupations \nand job classifications are not weakened. These occupations and job \nclassifications include the team leaders, registered nurses, the \nlicensed practical nurses, oil and gas workers, refinery workers,\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nsteelworkers, shipyard workers, journalists, firefighters, police \nofficers, nursery schoolteachers, and financial services workers, to \nname a few.\n\n  The Harkin amendment effectively blocks the Department from extending \novertime pay to low-wage workers and updating confusing overtime \nrequirements. In contrast to the Harkin amendment, the Gregg amendment \ndoes not undermine the Department of Labor efforts to update and \nclarify the overtime requirements and extend overtime protection to 1.3 \nmillion low-wage workers and clear up these gray areas that just help \nthe attorneys. The amendment offered by Senator Gregg will ensure that \nthe overtime rights are guaranteed to those 1.3 million low-wage \nworkers, strengthened for another 5.4 million workers, and clarified \nfor all workers and employers.\n  The antiquated and confusing white collar exemptions have created a \nwindfall for trial lawyers. Ambiguities and outdated terms have \ngenerated significant confusion regarding which employees are exempt \nfrom overtime requirements. The confusion has generated significant \nlitigation and overtime pay awards for highly paid white collar \nemployees. Wage and hour cases--this is important--now exceed \ndiscrimination suits as the leading type of employment law class \naction. The amendment assures those gray areas will stay, causing court \naction right now. The new rule clarifies and requires these areas be \ncleared up, but more clearly states the people who will absolutely get \novertime. It states who will be entitled now. It protects the workers \nand puts the money in the workers' pocket, not in legal action. If \nthese rules are clear, employers will know when they are complying with \nthe law. This is important, particularly and especially for small \nbusiness. That is for whom I always make my pleas.\n  Small businesses are the only ones being punished by the rules. They \ndon't have the specialists to determine the gray areas. So they wind up \nin court having to solve the gray areas after the fact. It is much \nbetter to solve it before the fact. We have to worry about small \nbusinesses which should not have to rely on lawyers or accountants to \ntell them how to pay their employees.\n  The Department of Labor has estimated these new regulations are going \nto cost employers an additional $275 million on an annual basis. \nHowever, the new overtime rule will provide much needed clarity.\n  As a former small business owner, I know employers want to be able to \npay their workers, not their lawyers. The Harkin blocking amendment \nwould only add to the current state of confusion. Instead of preserving \novertime rights, which the Harkin amendment purports to do, it will \ncreate even more complexity and litigation, piling rule on rule.\n  The blocking amendment creates a two-tiered scheme which would \nrequire two different tests to determine a worker's overtime status. \nThe present gray area and the other one would have to be worked to be \ncombined. So anything that would have been a gray area before will \nstill be a gray area. It will freeze workers in jobs they have \noutgrown. The blocking amendment will mire the final overtime \nregulation in years of litigation, likely preventing them from ever \ntaking effect.\n  The only clear winners for the effort to block the new rule will be \nthe trial lawyers who will benefit from a continued state of confusion. \nMost people would prefer to live in a different state than that. We are \nspending taxpayer dollars sorting through cases that could be solved \nwith clarity.\n  Under the blocking amendment, workers will still have to wait years \nfor a court to act before they could receive the overtime pay they \ndeserve. Why should the United States stand in between workers and \ntheir overtime pay? We need to defeat the blocking amendment that would \nblock the final rules from taking effect. We need to ensure that \nAmerican workers deserving of overtime pay will see their hard work \nreflected in their paychecks, not in litigation.\n  Today's Washington Post editorial urges lawmakers to hold off \nblocking the new overtime rules from taking effect. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print the editorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2004]\n\n                          Overtime Improvement\n\n       Last year the Labor Department drew widespread criticism \n     for proposed changes to overtime rules for white-collar \n     workers. We agreed with critics who said the new rules tilted \n     to employers and risked depriving too many workers of pay to \n     which they are entitled. Now Labor has revised its proposal, \n     and the new rules, while still worrisome in some respects, \n     are substantially improved.\n       Unions and their allies, with some basis for being \n     suspicious of this administration's attitude toward workers \n     in general and the overtime question in particular, argue \n     that the regulations still would unfairly jeopardize the \n     overtime rights of millions of workers. They are pressing for \n     a Senate vote, expected today, that would block the rules \n     from taking effect. We think lawmakers should hold off. If \n     the regulations are inconsistent with the federal law \n     designed to protect the right to overtime pay, they can be \n     challenged in court. And if employers exploit the regulations \n     to unfairly deny overtime pay to workers, they, too, are \n     subject to being sued. In the meantime, the new rules offer \n     some significant benefits for workers.\n       At issue is the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act, \n     which guarantees time-and-a-half overtime pay for those who \n     work beyond the standard 40-hour week. That 1938 law makes an \n     exception for white-collar workers--those in executive, \n     administrative and professional positions. Figuring out who \n     falls into this category has become a particularly byzantine \n     area of labor law, and the regulations outlining the \n     exceptions haven't been updated for 50 years.\n       The Labor Department's changes would guarantee overtime \n     rights for workers who earn less than $23,660 a year, even if \n     they are ostensibly white-collar. That's up from the current, \n     woefully outdated level of $8,060 and a slight increase over \n     the original proposal. It would have been even better to \n     adjust the salary level to keep pace with inflation (bringing \n     it to about $28,000) and --given that it took three decades \n     to make this change--to build in indexing for inflation. At \n     the higher end of the income scale, the new rules would make \n     workers who earn more than $100,000 largely exempt from \n     overtime eligibility, a significant increase from the \n     original proposal, which would have capped overtime rights at \n     $65,000.\n       The more complicated issue involves changes in determining \n     which workers fall into the category of executive, \n     administrative or professional employees not entitled to \n     overtime pay. The department says it expects that few, if \n     any, workers would lose overtime protections; labor groups \n     insist otherwise.\n       Opponents point to such provisions as the ``concurrent \n     duties'' rule, which would permit workers to be considered \n     executives ineligible for overtime even if they perform non-\n     managerial jobs. For example, assistant managers could stock \n     shelves, cook food, serve customers and still be \n     ``executives'' if their ``primary duty'' is management. \n     Another provision would allow workers to be considered exempt \n     ``administrative'' employees if they lead a team on a ``major \n     project,'' including improving workplace productivity.\n       Depending on how they are implemented, these exemptions, \n     and others, could be reasonable reflections of a modern \n     workplace, or they could be abusive incursions on workers' \n     overtime rights. What's needed now is not to block these \n     regulations but to ensure that they are vigorously enforced \n     with an eye to protecting the vulnerable workers the law was \n     intended to benefit.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. The Washington Post states:\n\n       What's needed now is not to block these regulations but to \n     ensure that they are vigorously enforced with an eye to \n     protect the vulnerable workers the law was intended to \n     benefit.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment which will allow \nthe Department of Labor to provide clearer and fairer overtime rights \nfor workers. I also urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Harkin's \nreform blocking amendment which will only line the pockets of the trial \nlawyers.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, last year, the administration proposed rules \nthat would force millions of workers to work longer hours for less pay. \nFiremen, nurses, policeman, factory workers faced 50, 60, even 100 hour \nwork weeks at 40 hour-work-week rates of pay. Two years of technical \ncollege education, military training, or even a few administrative \nduties would have been enough to deny workers overtime--permanently.\n  In response to majority votes in both Houses of Congress--and public \noutcry throughout the Nation--the administration recently issued a \nmodified rule governing overtime. And that's good, but not good enough.\n  While the new rule is an improvement, it still comes up short. \nThousands, maybe millions, will be left working more for less--and that \nis just wrong.\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  The law governing overtime, the Fair Labor Standards Act, FLSA, was \ndesigned in the 1930s to encourage companies to stick to a 40-hour work \nweek. At that time, employers routinely required workers to put in 7 \ndays a week, 10, 12, even 15 hours a day. That left the workers with \njobs no time for rest, family, or even their own health. And it left \nmany others in those tough times without jobs at all. The choice was \nharsh--work yourself to death in order to feed your family, or starve \nyour family and yourself trying to survive jobless during the Great \nDepression.\n  In passing the FSLA, Congress hoped that the required ``time and a \nhalf'' for overtime work would be an incentive to employers to stick to \na 40-hour work week. Today, that goal is still distant as companies \nroutinely require workers to work more that 40 hours. American workers \nwork more hours than any other industrialized nation, except South \nKorea. And the overtime pay, rather than being a disincentive to \nemployers, has become a necessary income source for many American \nfamilies.\n  That overtime comes at a high price for most American workers. It \nmeans less time with family, fewer school events attended, and soccer \ngames missed. Like in our past, the worker's choice is a harsh one--\nearn the extra income needed to meet a family's material needs, but \nsacrifice the family time that meets their emotional needs. If the \nAdministration prevails, thousands, maybe millions, of hardworking \nfamilies will see their sacrifices seriously devalued.\n  The administration argues it needs to make these changes to make it \neasier for business to correctly classify its workers. But this rule is \nunlikely to clarify anything for small business. The rule, with all the \nsupport material, is over 500 pages. We have not simplified anything. \nNew court cases will be brought, and new guidance will be written. \nEmployers will still struggle with the issue of who their professional \nemployees are, and who is management. The very people that the \nadministration is trying to help are unlikely to find this easier to \nunderstand.\n  The new rule also contains troubling exemptions of entire jobs and \nindustries. It exempts from overtime ``team leaders,'' even though \nthese employees may have no supervisory role, or any real authority \nover the people they are supposed to be leading. Other groups of \nworkers are classified as exempt by the Department of Labor, with \nlittle discussion. Certain industries have worked for years to get out \nof paying overtime to their workers--and the rule's list of exemptions \nreads like a roll call of those that succeeded. For reasons unclear, \neven after 500 pages of explanation, journalists, personal trainers, \nfinancial services workers, and computer industry workers--to name just \na few classes--are summarily ineligible for overtime.\n  The current overtime rules are not perfect; they were written many \nyears ago in a different industrial age. They should be updated; the \nwage thresholds should be changed. But the administration's rule--even \nin its more moderate incarnation--does much more than update. It \nchanges the fundamental nature of the overtime portions of the FSLA--\nfrom rules designed to fairly compensate workers for onerous overwork \nto a system where certain favored industries can return to a \ndepression-era policy of more work for less pay.\n  We all believe that hard work should be rewarded. Our country \nachieved greatness through the sacrifices and sweat of our working men \nand women. Today, sadly, these workers are not celebrated, but \nsqueezed--forced to work more for less by harsh international \ncompetition from countries with few or no labor standards and faceless \ninternational conglomerates with no concept of family or community. We \nhave a choice in this matter. We can let unfettered economic pressure \nlower wages in this country and around the world, or we can work to \nuphold standards here, and demand them around the world. Any weakening \nof the overtime rules is a step down on the ladder of economic \nprogress.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last year the White House proposed \nredefining the job descriptions of millions of workers and thus \neliminating their right to Federal overtime protection.\n  After several in this Chamber raised serious concerns over such a \nchange, the administration released final rules that make significant, \nbut insufficient, changes to those draft rules. Left alone, these rules \nwill take affect later this year.\n  I support the Harkin amendment because it is sensible and protects \nhardworking employees. The amendment simply prevents the White House \nfrom implementing changes in existing overtime laws that reduce the \nnumber of jobs protected by those laws.\n  The stated objective of the administration is to increase worker \nprotection. This being the case, I would think this amendment would be \nan easy accommodation for the President to make.\n  However, if the numbers of the Department of Labor are correct, then \nmore the 117,000 individuals could lose overtime protection. If they \nare wrong, it could be millions.\n  These rule changes would wipe out overtime pay protections and \nincrease work hours. In California alone, several hundred thousand \nworkers could lose their Federal overtime protection. However, State \nlaw will continue to protect most workers from the deleterious effects \nof this rule change. But some public employees and many in the film \nindustry won't be so lucky.\n  Although most workers in California will maintain their right to \novertime through protections granted by State law, the rule change \nrepresents a movement in the wrong direction when it comes to enhancing \nworker protections.\n  As we all know, losing overtime pay protections would also result in \nhuge pay cuts for many workers. This is an issue of fairness. Our \nworkers are more productive then ever and yet President Bush feels that \nit is necessary to penalize those very individuals who have literally \nbuilt this Nation.\n  Those hurt most will be disproportionately women and minority. They \nwill be mostly middle and lower income. They will be struggling to make \nends meet and they will be worrying about paying the mortgage.\n  Given the still high unemployment rate and the uncertainty still \nplaguing our economy, this is not the time to be making it harder for \nworkers; rather, it is a time when we should be helping all workers \nachieve fairness in the workplace.\n  It is well known that by requiring companies to respect the 40-hour \nwork week, we encourage businesses to hire additional workers. With \nmore than 8 million people still out of work, we should continue to \nencourage companies to maximize employment while respecting the \nworkforce they have.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is appropriate on a trade bill such as \nthe one now pending before the Senate, that we, at long last, engage in \na debate about the standard of living for American workers.\n  The establishment of the 40-hour work week and a worker's right to \novertime pay in 1938, fulfilled President Franklin Roosevelt's promise \nto workers to end starvation wages and intolerable working hours.\n  That same year, President Roosevelt called it ``the most far-\nreaching, far-sighted program for the benefit of workers ever adopted \nhere or in any other country.'' It is unsettling to watch, 55 years \nlater, as a successor to President Roosevelt seeks to limit the scope \nof that far-reaching legislation.\n  President Bush's overtime rule promotes a thoroughly un-American \nnotion of fair compensation for some, but not for all.\n  Through its overtime rule, the Bush administration has sought to \ndictate who will receive overtime pay and who will not. It has sought \nto dictate whose extra work will be recognized and valued and whose \nwill not.\n  While guaranteeing overtime pay for some workers, the Bush \nadministration rule would take it away from registered nurses, nursery \nschool teachers, cooks and chefs, and employees of the financial \nservices industries. It would take overtime away from insurance claims \nadjusters; sales representatives; and computer network, Internet, and \ndata base administrators. It would take overtime pay away from so-\ncalled ``team leaders'' in factories, refineries and chemical plants; \nfrom employees who perform administrative, management or professional \nwork; from television, radio and newspaper journalists.\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n  The President cannot explain why some workers should be entitled to \novertime pay and others should not. The Labor Secretary cannot explain \nwhy. I doubt that anyone can explain why.\n  This rule threatens the overtime pay of millions of workers earning \nmore than $24,000 per year. I hope that workers listening, even if they \ndo not receive overtime pay, won't be fooled into believing that this \nissue does not apply to them. If workers are suddenly no longer \neligible for overtime, what's to stop their bosses from working them 60 \nhours per week? Or 70? Or 80?\n  We are told by some that the economy is improving, and workers are \nstrong enough to endure the loss of their overtime pay.\n  Whether we call it an economic recovery or the worst job market since \nHerbert Hoover; it makes no difference.\n  The fact is that millions of workers have lost their jobs or have \nseen their friends or members of their families lose their jobs. They \nhave had their work days scaled back from a full work week to half-\ndays, to half-weeks. They have had to accept cuts in their health care \nbenefits and pension benefits to keep their employer out of bankruptcy.\n  These workers have little patience for election-year hyperbole that \nprosperity has returned, that wages are adequate.\n  Workers read about an alarming trade deficit and the outsourcing of \njobs overseas, and they wonder if their job will be next. They see \ntheir health care premiums rising, their savings being depleted, the \nspecter of unemployment on the horizon, and want to know why their \ngovernment cannot do more about it.\n  Workers wonder if their President understands these fears. Time and \ntime again, this administration has shown that it does not.\n  Little by little, the Bush administration is chipping away at the \nrights and protections due American workers. It has blocked action on \nthe minimum wage. It has blocked an extension of unemployment benefits. \nIt has furthered the erosion of pension and health care benefits. It \nhas curtailed the safety and health protections won by the labor \nmovement in the 20th Century.\n  This is not the record of an administration that understands the \nplight of American workers. To the contrary, this is an administration \nthat has demonstrated a callous--almost smug--disregard for their \nplight. This is an administration that has abandoned the very American \nideal of inspiring other nations to improve working conditions and to \nlift their working class.\n\n  We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by temporary employment \ngains which depend on the wasteful exploitation of resources and which \ncannot last. Workers should not be satisfied with present conditions.\n  One worker need not sacrifice his overtime pay to guarantee it to \nanother. One worker need not forgo his retirement security or health \ncare security to provide it to another.\n  In one of his renowned fireside chats to the Nation, President \nRoosevelt told workers: ``Do not let any calamity-howling executive . . \n. who has been turning his employees over to the Government relief \nrolls . . . tell you . . . that [a minimum wage] is going to have a \ndisastrous effect on all American industry.'' President Roosevelt's \nmessage to workers is unmistakable. Don't let any business lobby, any \nelected representative, any President, tell you that a fair wage for \nyour labor is too much to ask.\n  After 52 years of public service in Washington, serving in 26 \nCongresses and with eleven presidents, I am still convinced that the \nAmerican people retain a sincere respect for the promise that extra \nwork should yield extra benefits. Overtime is a means for workers to \nsecure for their children a chance at a better life, to ensure for \nthemselves a secure retirement.\n  It is an essential part of our social economy. It has the \noverwhelming support of the American people in every walk of life, and \nthe Senate would do workers a disservice by allowing to stand the Labor \nDepartment's thoroughly egregious misinterpretation of Franklin \nRoosevelt's promise to them.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nHarkin amendment because I believe it is the right thing to do for New \nYork's working families.\n  The Harkin amendment is very simple. It says that not a single worker \nwho is currently eligible for overtime pay should be denied that right. \nAnd I have yet to hear a compelling reason that some workers currently \neligible for overtime should lose that eligibility. In fact, the \nDepartment of Labor argues emphatically that few if any workers will \nactually lose eligibility. Well, if few if any workers will lose \novertime eligibility then I see no reason why the Department of Labor \nshouldn't support the Harkin amendment wholeheartedly.\n  Of course, the reality, as those at the Department of Labor well \nknow, is that plenty of workers will lose eligibility for overtime. \nLet's look at the facts. Registered nurses will be in danger of losing \ntheir eligibility because, for the first time, it will be easier to \nclassify those who are paid hourly as ``salaried employees.'' It will \nalso be easier to classify them as ``team leaders.'' Journalists will \nlose their automatic overtime protection. Veterans who do not have a 4-\nyear degree will be much more easily classified as professional \nemployees and denied overtime eligibility. Workers in the financial \nservices industry--and I represent many of them--will lose their \novertime protection if they do not exercise independent judgment and \ndiscretion. Chefs. Funeral Directors. Embalmers. Insurance Claims \nAdjusters. Salespeople. Software engineers. Computer programmers. All \nwill be vulnerable to the loss of overtime--and therefore face \nsignificant pay cuts.\n  The list goes on and on and on. And these are just the consequences \nanalysts can foresee. What does the loss of overtime mean? Let's put it \nin human terms. It's a 25 percent pay cut. It is $161 a week on \naverage. And--as importantly--it's time with your family. This is not \ntrivial. At its very core, this issue is about our American values of \nwork and family. Workers stripped of their overtime protection would \nend up working longer hours for less pay. That translates into less \ntime with their children, less time with their parents, their spouses, \nless time to volunteer and contribute to the fabric of our community. \nMore work hours, for less pay, and less family time--that is not the \nAmerican way.\n  This regulation would make unpaid overtime a household word and make \nit easier for bad-faith employers to coerce other workers into \naccepting time off instead of overtime pay.\n  Now, I know there is strong support in this Chamber to protect the \nrights of workers to receive overtime because we've done it before. \nBack in September, we passed a very similar amendment to prevent the \nDepartment of Labor from promulgating any amendment that denied \novertime from any worker currently eligible. Republicans in my State \ncrossed party lines to block this regulation in the House--and I \napplaud them for doing so. They know how many New Yorkers rely on \novertime pay--not as a luxury, as a necessity.\n  Back then, despite strong bi-partisan votes in the House and Senate, \nthe extremist right wing leaders in the House and Senate neglected to \ninclude the language in the final appropriations bill. They made a \nmockery of the democratic process.\n  But with this vote today we prove that we will keep fighting for the \nrights of working people. We may be overruled--as we were before--but \nwe will not back down.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support the Harkin and to reject the Bush \nadministration economic policy of tax cuts for wealthy; pay cuts for \nthe workers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Harkin \namendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  The Bush administration's final overtime regulation is much the same \nas its proposed regulation. The largely cosmetic changes that the \nadministration grudgingly made at the eleventh hour did not change the \nrule's result: the loss of overtime benefits for millions of American \nworkers, many of whom rely on overtime to help support their families. \nMaking a bad proposal a little better does not mean a good result for \nAmerican workers. As a recent editorial in the Milwaukee Journal \nSentinel rightly pointed out, ``. . . why hurt anybody? Gain for some \nworkers\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nshouldn't mean pain for others.'' I could not agree more. And this rule \nwill lead to uncertainty for millions of hard-working Americans and \ntheir families who rely on overtime pay to get by.\n  It is true that the new rule increases the minimum salary threshold \nto $23,660, thereby ensuring that workers who are earning less will be \nguaranteed overtime pay. While this is a positive step, it is \nregrettable that this increase does not keep up with inflation, \nespecially since it has been 29 years since the last adjustment.\n  In addition, this rule exempts so-called ``highly compensated'' \nemployees who earn more than $100,000 per year and have one job duty \nthat can be classified as administrative, executive, or professional. \nThis is a new exemption which is not indexed for inflation, thus \nleaving even more workers open to a loss of overtime benefits in the \nfuture.\n  But those who are in the most jeopardy of losing their overtime \nbenefits may be those workers whose salaries fall between $23,660 and \n$100,000. These workers are not guaranteed overtime, and the new duties \ntests included in the final rule could strip overtime pay from millions \nof these low- and middle-income Americans.\n  The final rule changes the process by which a worker can be declared \nto be exempt from the wage and hour protections of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act (FLSA), thus opening the door to denial of overtime \nbenefits to millions of workers who currently are entitled to this \nextra pay for working more than 40 hours per week.\n  In essence, this rule, which we will allow to move forward if we do \nnot pass the Harkin amendment, will create a larger force of employees \nwho can be required to work longer hours for less pay. This could also \nmean fewer opportunities for paid overtime for the workers who would \nremain eligible for it.\n  Who are these workers? They are veterans, registered nurses, \njournalists, financial services employees, assistant managers, team \nleaders, chefs, insurance claims adjusters, and computer employees, \njust to name a few. And several industries successfully lobbied the \nadministration to include specific exemptions for their employees--\nexemptions that have been pending in Congress for a number of years and \nthat have not been adopted. And the rule contains a roadmap for \nemployers who wish to find ways around paying overtime to those workers \nwho are still eligible for it.\n  The administration's public relations campaign on this rule does not \nreflect the reality of this rule. It will deny overtime to millions. It \nwill, despite the administration's claims to the contrary, have a \nnegative effect on veterans, on blue collar workers, and on union \nmembers. I find it interesting that the Department of Labor's materials \nfor this rule call it ``Fair Pay: Overtime Security for the 21st \nCentury Workforce.'' There is little that is fair about this rule for \nthe millions of workers who are poised to lose their overtime pay if \nthis rule takes effect as scheduled in August.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the process by which this rule was \nfinalized. A small number of Members of Congress and the administration \nwere able to run roughshod over the will of a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate and the House to resuscitate this proposal by deleting \nlanguage that would have blocked it from the omnibus spending bill. I \nregret that the administration resorted to veto threats and backroom \nnegotiations to save this proposal, which is the latest in a series of \nassaults on working Americans that have been perpetrated by this \nadministration. Right out of the gate, the President made it his first \nlegislative priority to overturn a federal ergonomics standard that was \nmore than ten years in the making. In addition, this administration has \nlaunched a campaign to aggressively contract out Federal jobs, \nsystematically dismantle the Federal civil service system, gut worker \nprotections, and undermine collective bargaining rights. And this \nadministration contends that outsourcing jobs to other countries is \ngood for the American economy.\n  With so many long-term unemployed workers and others working more \nthan one job and depending on overtime just to make ends meet, it is \nunfortunate that the administration dug in its heels on a proposal to \ndeny overtime to many of those who need it most. And it is unfortunate \nthat the final rule does so little to improve the proposed rule, which \na majority of the Senate and the House are on record against.\n  I urge support for the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent each side be allowed \nan extra 3 minutes. So the vote, instead of being at 3:30, would be at \n3:36 or thereabouts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the time on this side be allotted \n8 minutes to Senator Harkin, 7 minutes to Senator Kennedy, 7 minutes to \nSenator Dodd, and 5 minutes to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe I have been yielded 5 minutes \nby the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator has 5 minutes on this side and 5 minutes on \nthe majority side, a total of 10.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it true that I have 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we will find it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I wish to put on the record \nmy concerns about not being protected on time. Through my deputy, I had \ncalled the cloakroom to advise that I wanted to speak on the bill. I \nhad intended to come to the floor and to ask some questions of the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and the proponent from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg. I would have objected to a time agreement had I been \nnotified, if I have to be on the floor to protect my rights at all \ntimes. My deputy asked for 10 minutes, which was not my instruction, \nbut that is my problem. But then I didn't even have 10 minutes.\n  When I came out I found there was time allotted, but to get 10 \nminutes I had to negotiate with Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley \ndidn't want to give me time because I would end up with Senator Harkin, \nalthough I had intended to try to find out a little more about the two \npending amendments. So I think we have to be a little more considerate \nabout Senators who notify the cloakroom that they want time so their \nrights are protected so that every Senator does not have to sit here \nall day long.\n  The Appropriations subcommittee which I chair, the Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education, had a hearing this \nmorning. This is a very complicated regulation. I had intended to try \nto have a colloquy with a number of Senators to find out a little more \nabout what this regulation really means.\n  On the face of it, as we had discussed at the hearing this morning, \nthere is very little change between current regulation on \nadministrative employees and the proposed final regulation. For \nexample, the current regulation defines administrative employees as \n``customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent \njudgment.'' Compare that with the final regulation on administrative \nemployees: ``Primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and \nindependent judgment with respect to matters of significance.''\n  So in both instances they are talking essentially about exercising \njudgment and exercising discretion and independent judgment.\n  When we questioned the Department of Labor representative at the \nhearing this morning, there was very little added by the additional \nphrase ``with respect to matters of significance.'' That is so \ngeneralized as hardly to clarify anything to avoid litigation. In the \ncontext where the principal complaint for having a new regulation is to \navoid litigation, it hardly changes or clarifies anything.\n  A similar situation exists with the definition of professional \nemployees where it is stated on the current regulation, professional \nemployee is defined ``primary duty of performing work requiring \nknowledge of an advanced type\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nin a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged \ncourse of specialized intellectual instruction and study.''\n  Contrast that with the new proposed final regulation defining \nprofessional employees: ``Primary duty of performing work requiring \nknowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning \ncustomarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized \ninstruction.'' It is virtually identical, hardly going to clarify \nmatters to eliminate litigation.\n  Then on the proposed final regulation, defining customarily can mean \nthe employee has attained the knowledge through ``a combination of work \nexperience and intellectual instruction.''\n  The point is, the new proposed regulation adds virtually nothing to \nthe regulation which is pending. It is true that it has been a long \ntime since the regulation was amended. I subscribe to the generalized \nview that if we could make the regulation clearer to avoid litigation, \nthat would be a very important objective. But in the course of an \nextended hearing this morning, where we heard from the representative \nof the Department of Labor and two witnesses who were for the final \nproposed regulation and two against, there is no indication that this \nnew regulation is going to clarify anything at all.\n  One of the issues raised this morning was how many workers would be \naffected. The sum and substance of the testimony in an exchange among \nthe witnesses was that the 1.3 million workers who were supposed to \nhave additional overtime is an inflated figure. I don't have time in \nthe 10 minutes allotted to go into greater detail on that particular \npoint.\n  There has been added to the proposed regulation a new concept of a \nteam leader which is not in existing law and would allow employers to \ndeny overtime pay to workers who ``lead a team of other employees \nassigned to complete major projects,'' even if there is no direct \nsupervisory responsibility.\n  Now, in addition, this term ``team leader,'' I think, is going to \nprovide additional complexity, so that a proposed final regulation \nhere, instead of simplifying and directing and being an effective \ninstrumentality to eliminate litigation, appears to me to be no advance \nover the current regulation, and when you come down to the injection of \na new concept of team leader, it creates additional complications.\n  To repeat--something I don't like to do--I hoped to have a discussion \nwith the proponents of both measures to shed some light on it. This is \na very important matter, regulating overtime pay, which deserves a lot \nmore attention than it is getting on the floor of the Senate today. I \nwish my rights had been protected by the cloakroom, or I would have \nbeen here to object to a time agreement so I could have participated in \ndrawing out some of these important issues to try to achieve a result \nbased upon a fuller understanding of this proposed regulation.\n  On the current state of the record, I am opposed to the proposed \nregulation. I think the amendment offered by Senator Gregg is a step in \nthe right direction. I intend to support the Harkin amendment.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for scraping together a full 10 \nminutes for me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There is no time to yield. There is a consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend our colleague from \nIowa for his effort on the overtime pay issue. Clearly, he has \nattracted the attention of the administration and others. We in \nCongress have, on two recent occasions rejected the administration's \nproposals that would modify the overtime rules crafted back, as the \nSenator from Wyoming pointed out, in the 1930s, with the Fair Labor \nStandards Act.\n  Over the years, we have changed the Fair Labor Standards Act when it \ncomes to overtime. Those changes have historically expanded how \novertime could be used or under what job categories it could be used. \nThere has not been a single instance in the nearly 70 years since the \nact was written where there has been a constriction of the overtime \nprovisions.\n  This is a historic moment. The Senate will vote in 30 minutes as to \nwhether this Congress will, for the first time since the 1930s, limit \nthe ability of people who work to collect overtime in more than 800 job \ncategories. The Senator from New Hampshire said we apologize, we are \ngoing to take 55 job categories and we are going to exclude them from \nbeing adversely affected by the rules when it comes to overtime. As my \ncolleague pointed out, in fact there were some 889 different job \ncategories that could be affected by this rule.\n  Clearly, what we are talking about is restricting the ability of \npeople who work more than a 40-hour week to be able to collect overtime \npay. For people who do collect overtime pay, that money amounts to 25 \npercent of the income they take home. Who are we talking about? \nClerical workers, nursery school teachers, cooks, and nurses to name \nbut a few. These are the people who depend upon overtime pay in order \nto make ends meet.\n  You don't have to have a Ph.D in economics to know what is going on \nwith families and their incomes today and their abilities to make ends \nmeet. It was reported a few years ago how much of the income families \nearn can be put aside for savings, or that they could apply to college \ntuition for their children in the future. Today we know the ability of \nthe middle-income family to save, put money aside, and purchase \nnecessary items for their families has been severely restricted. This \nis yet one further attempt to make it more difficult for these families \nwho need the extra overtime pay to make ends meet.\n\n  People who are stripped of these overtime protections would end up \nworking longer hours for less pay. Does anybody believe this \nadministration's Department of Labor is trying to expand overtime pay? \nThat is not why the business community is supporting this rule change, \nbecause they want to expand overtime pay. The administration clearly \nwants to restrict it and redefine job categories that will allow them \nto do so.\n  Also, I suggest the rule works adversely in terms of job creation. \nThe Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted nearly 70 years ago to create \na 40-hour workweek and require that workers be paid fairly for any \nextra hours. Especially in times like these, it is an incentive for job \ncreation because it encourages employers to hire more workers, instead \nof forcing current employees to work longer hours. So it creates jobs.\n  Obviously, if you don't have to pay overtime, you can get that one \nperson to work longer hours for less pay. We should be trying to create \njobs in this country--instead, we have lost nearly 3 million in the \nlast 39 months; in fact, some 8 to 10 million people are out of work in \nthis country. Further, this is vitally important to the 40-hour \nworkweek. If employers no longer have to pay extra for overtime, they \nwill have incentive to demand longer hours, and workers will have less \ntime to spend with their families. People already know how difficult it \nis to balance work and family. Many single parents raising children, or \ntwo income earners are holding more than one job to meet the family's \nfinancial obligations.\n  This is a very important issue to working families and it is \nimportant for them to know this Congress will stand up for them on \nsomething as basic as the ability for them to earn overtime pay when \nthey put in the extra hours. I also want to add that the job \nclassifications being proposed by my friend from New Hampshire in his \namendment are too vague and will invite litigation. My friend from \nWyoming pointed out we ought to be trying to discourage litigation. I \nagree. But the adoption of the Gregg amendment, without the Harkin \namendment, seems to do nothing but open up that door to litigation.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Harkin \namendment and send a final message to the administration: Do not mess \naround with overtime pay. This Congress is going to stand up for \nworkers' rights to get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to be \ncharged equally against both sides.\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, in my 8 minutes let me try \nto clear up some points. A couple of Senators talked about my \namendment. I listened to them and wondered what they were talking \nabout, that somehow this is convoluted and problematic.\n  Let's be clear. The amendment pending, which I have offered, does \nwhat the Department of Labor says they want to do. First, there will be \ntwo steps in my amendment. You check the old regulations. If the \nemployee is required to be given overtime under the old regulations, \nthat employee will continue to get overtime under the new regulations \nbecause the Department of Labor says they do not want to take overtime \naway from anyone now making it. My amendment clarifies it.\n  Secondly, if the employee is not getting overtime under the present \nregulations, but the new regulations allow the employee to get \novertime, the employee gets overtime. So we expand it. They want to \nprotect and expand overtime, and that is exactly what my amendment \ndoes. It is very clear and very concise.\n  Senator Specter is right, the new rule, at least what we heard about \nin the hearing this morning, is not a clarification. What we heard in \nthe hearing is more ambiguous, and it is going to lead to much more \nlitigation.\n  Let me also talk about the pending Gregg amendment. First of all, I \nnote that the pending Gregg amendment is an acknowledgment, a real \nacknowledgment, that there is a long list of occupations and people who \nare in danger of losing their overtime. Obviously, why else would he \nhave listed those 55. So there is an acknowledgment that a lot of \npeople will lose their overtime. I thank him for that acknowledgment. \nBut he lists in his amendment 55 occupations.\n  Senator Dodd said there are 889 occupations listed by the Department \nof Labor. Senator Gregg has picked out 55 and said they will get \novertime. What about the other 800-some occupations? The Gregg \namendment sets up a two-tier system: The 55 who are in and the 834 who \nare out. That is a big problem with the Gregg amendment.\n  Secondly, it is definitional. For example, the Gregg amendment puts \nin team leaders, but we do not know what a team leader is because it \nhas never been defined. What is a team leader?\n  The Gregg amendment puts in refinery workers. Does that mean oil \nrefinery or does that cover ethanol plants in Iowa? That is a refinery. \nWho is covered by that? We do not know.\n  Technicians, what is a technician? There is no definition of a \ntechnician. The Gregg amendment covers funeral directors, but how about \nembalmers? We don't know. It looks as though the Gregg amendment was \nhastily put together. What they did was list 55 people we have talked \nabout on the floor, but they exclude 834 others. That is a real \nproblem.\n  The other point is what is missing. I just sat down and started \ndrawing up a list of people not in the Gregg amendment: Sheriffs \ndeputies--how about juvenile justice officers? How about correctional \nofficers? How about reporters, bookkeepers, retail clerks, police \nlieutenants, computer services employees? None of these are covered \nunder the Gregg amendment. I guess they are just out.\n  That is the problem with the Gregg amendment. It is a drastic change \nin the Fair Labor Standards Act. We have for 50 years said whether or \nnot you get overtime is based upon the job you do, not upon what you \nare called. Senator Gregg now wants to say you will get overtime or not \ndepending upon what you are called, not upon what you do. That is a big \nchange.\n  These 55 that have been listed, I don't mind listing them. That is \nall right. But it does not go far enough. It does not cover all of the \npeople who are out there. It narrowly excludes from exemption of \novertime 55 occupations, some of which are not even well defined and \nnot defined at all in the Gregg amendment.\n  I would say it like this: If you have a building and you have 10 \nentrances to that building and none of them are protected, but you want \nto protect the 10 entrances into that building, say, from terrorist \nactivities--let's say someone comes along and says: I can't protect all \n10 of them; I can protect 4. Fine, protect four, but I still have six \nothers I have to protect. That is how I see the Gregg amendment. He \nprotects 55, but there are 834 out there that are not listed.\n  My point is, you can vote for the Gregg amendment--in fact, I will \nvote for the Gregg amendment. I don't see it is that big a deal. It is \nkind of ridiculous to list 55, but I will vote for it and move the \nprocess along. But if you vote for the Gregg amendment, you can vote \nfor the Harkin amendment, too, because we come in and cover all 10 \ndoors in that building. We make sure all workers are covered, not just \n55, not a narrowly construed list of 55 workers. We cover them all.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Harkin amendment because it \ndoes, in fact, ensure that those who get overtime now will continue to \nget overtime, and it ensures if you don't get overtime now but the new \nrules allow you to get overtime, you will get overtime. The Harkin \namendment covers all workers, not just the narrow list of 55.\n  Mr. President, I reserve whatever time I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes is reserved for the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when there is 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let's look at exactly what this issue is \nabout. This issue is about pay for hard-working Americans. Overtime \nrepresents a quarter of the pay for those individual Americans who \nreceive overtime. It is a quarter of their pay; $33,000 is the average \nannual amount for the person who receives $161 a week in overtime--\n$33,000. That is the average. We can have higher, we can have lower, \nbut those are basically the kind of workers about which we are talking.\n  I do not know what the average worker making $33,000 a year did to \nthe Bush administration and why he is so opposed to them making a \ndecent wage. I know the administration is against the increase in the \nminimum wage. They are against the extensions of unemployment \ncompensation. And this is their third crack attacking overtime and \nreducing overtime pay. I say the average families, the working families \nare having a more and more difficult time than they have ever had in \ntrying to make ends meet.\n  If we look at what has happened to average wages for new jobs, \naverage wages for new jobs are down 21 percent. If we look at what the \npressure has been on middle-income families during the Bush \nadministration, the average income has gone down 2 percent; home prices \nhave gone up almost 18 percent; health and other insurance costs have \ngone up 50 percent; tuition, 35 percent; and utilities, 15 percent. \nTheir income has gone down, and this proposal and the Bush \nadministration want it to go down further. How are they going to make \nends meet?\n  What is on the other side? What is the relationship between \ncorporations and workers during this period of time? Corporate profits \nhave increased 57.5 percent during the period of the last 3 years, and \nworkers' wages have gone up 1.5 percent. Still, this administration \nwants to increase the corporate profits. That is not right, it is not \nfair, it is not just.\n  This is about special interests. We hear a good deal on the floor of \nthe Senate that we want to modernize the overtime rules. Let's look at \nwhat this issue is really about.\n  All we have to do is look at what has happened with the Restaurant \nAssociation. The National Restaurant Association in their letter to the \nDepartment of Labor says:\n\n       The National Restaurant Association requests that DOL \n     include chefs under the creative professional category as \n     well as the learned professional category.\n\n  So they will not be eligible for overtime. What comes out just 10 \ndays ago?\n\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\n\n       The Department concludes that to the extent a chef has a \n     primary duty of work requiring invention, imagination, \n     originality or talent, such chef may be considered an exempt \n     creative professional from overtime.\n\n  There is the Restaurant Association trying to look out and feather \nits own nest, and there is the Bush administration complying with it.\n  Look at another special interest. Let's take the National Association \nof Mutual Insurance Companies, which supports the section of the \nproposed regulation that provides that claims adjustors, including \nthose working for insurance companies, satisfy the FLSA administrative \nexemption. Sure enough, they make that request a little over a year \nago, and 2 weeks ago out comes the Department of Labor's answer:\n\n       Insurance claims adjustors generally meet the duties \n     requirements for the administrative exemption whether they \n     work for an insurance company or other type of company. . . .\n\n  The insurance companies ask for these changes in order to increase \nthe bottom line for the companies, and sure enough the administration \ncomplies. And they say this is about technical adjustments in order to \nmodernize it? It is about the special interests. That is what has been \nhappening right down the line with regards to the overtime. We \nunderstand what this is about. This is a blatant and flagrant effort of \nthe administration in order to increase the bottom line for corporate \nAmerica and to shortchange working families. These are workers who are \nworking hard. They work longer and harder than any other industrial \nnation in the world. They are finding they are having a difficult time \ntrying to make ends meet. This administration has been undermining them \nby denying them the unemployment compensation, they are denying an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and now they are going ahead and denying \nthem the overtime. It is not right.\n  Americans understand fairness, and we are talking about fairness in \nthe job market. For 60 years, overtime has been in place. For 60 years, \nwe have recognized the importance of paying overtime. The message that \nought to go out to workers all over this country is, if we do not pass \nthe Harkin amendment, workers beware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand I have 1 minute remaining.\n  Workers beware because without the protections of overtime, those \nworkers are going to be forced to work longer and longer without \ngetting the kinds of increases they deserve.\n  This is about fairness. This is about economic justice. This is about \nbasically middle-class families. This is about family values in order \nto provide for working families to provide for their children. That is \nwhat the issue is. I hope we will support the Harkin amendment.\n  I am going to vote for the Gregg amendment. I am not really sure how \nmuch protection it applies, but at least it is worthy of support. Let's \ndo what is really right for American workers and support the Harkin \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two seconds on the minority side and 12 \nminutes on the majority side.\n  Is the Senator seeking recognition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to vote. A lot \nof the debate has occurred, and I think it has been healthy and to the \npoint. I do believe we should reiterate a couple of points.\n  First off, the original regulations are not what are at issue. The \noriginal regulations have been fundamentally changed. When the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts says, as I take it to be a fact if he represents it \nhere, that $33,000 is the average income of people who have incomes \nwhich are overtime related, that is fine. Under this new regulation, \nthose people are not going to be impacted because this regulation, \nfirst, raises the minimum where one is guaranteed overtime from $8,000 \nto $23,400. So anybody making $23,400 is guaranteed overtime no matter \nwhat their job classification is.\n  People between $23,000 and $100,000 are also exempt under this \nlanguage because of the way the regulation has been proposed. The only \npeople who are at risk under this legislation are people earning more \nthan $100,000 who are working white collar jobs. Blue collar jobs over \n$100,000 of income are not at risk. There are potentially 6.7 million \npeople who benefit from this regulation, directly immediately, because \nthey are the people who are making up to $23,000. This is not even an \naccurate number--it may be much less--potentially 100,000 people making \nmore than $100,000 may be impacted as a result of holding white collar \npositions which are no longer overtime related.\n  What is important to remember about this regulation is that the \npractical implication of it, beyond allowing 6.7 million people to get \novertime for sure, is that it will clarify the playing field. Instead \nof having a litigious society where small businessmen and businesswomen \nespecially have to spend a lot of money on litigation to address \nwhether a person is getting overtime or is not getting overtime, that \nindividual will have those dollars which they were going to spend on \nlegal fees to give their employees benefits or to expand their \nactivities as an employer and create more jobs. That is what is \nimportant.\n  We are trying to make it a more understandable playing field. \nRemember, the Department of Labor put out a proposal which had some \nstructural problems. I admitted to that when it came out, but they \nlistened. Eighty thousand comments later, they changed it. They changed \nit substantively to the point where it is now receiving favorable \ncomment and favorable support from a broad range of different interest \ngroups, including, for example, The Washington Post as was quoted today \nby the Senator from Wyoming when he was making his presentation \nearlier.\n  So it is a major step in the right direction toward first \nenfranchising 6.7 million people with a guarantee that they are going \nto get overtime, who do not get it today, and in addition making sure \nother individuals earning up to $100,000 will be getting their \novertime, and in addition making it clear to the marketplace that \npeople do not have to litigate and participate in class action suits \nall the time to figure out who gets overtime, who does not get overtime \nbut, rather, there will be a clear path to making that decision which \nis so critical to the marketplace and creating certainty in the \nmarketplace, which is the goal. That is the purpose, to create some \ncertainty in the marketplace, which reduces the litigiousness and in \nturn converts the exercise to getting money into people's pockets \nversus creating lawsuits.\n\n  The problem with the Harkin amendment is it takes us back to the time \nof litigation. There is the old law. There is the new law. They are \nlayered on top of each other, rolled into each other, so all the \nproblems of the old law roll into the new law, and we are once again \nback into a litigation morass, a classic example of what will probably \nhappen under the Harkin amendment.\n  There will be what I call a class ceiling. Businesses and employers \nare going to have an employee who is moving up through their system, \nwho is doing well, who is starting to produce. That employee is \nsuddenly going to get to a position where if they are given more \nresponsibility it is going to draw into question whether they have to \nbe paid overtime. It is going to draw in all of these rules, \nregulations, confusions, and Byzantine structures that are put in place \ntoday.\n  The employer is going to say, hold it, I am not going to promote that \nemployee because there is just too much opportunity for lawsuits to \noccur. I am simply going to go out and hire a new employee to do that \nmanagement-related activity or that administrative-related activity \nthat may imply exemption from overtime rather than promote the up and \ncoming employee because I do not want to buy the lawsuits that come \nwith a promotion. A ceiling is going to potentially be created for \npeople who are in the process of improving their lives in the \nemployment structure. They are going to be frozen in place as a result \nof going the Harkin route.\n  What the new regulations as proposed by the Labor Department do is \njust the opposite. It gives certainty so\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nthat employers know when they can move people up, when they can give \nthem promotions, and what the impact of that is going to be on the \novertime rules as they apply to that individual as they are promoted. \nTherefore, it is going to give a lot of employees a lot more upward \nmobility, which is positive. That is the way we should approach this.\n  So the Harkin amendment may be well intentioned. Obviously, it is \nwell intentioned. Everything the Senator from Iowa does is well \nintentioned. As a practical matter, it is going to have very severe and \nunintended consequences, in my opinion, of limiting promotion within \nthe marketplace.\n  I hope people would support my amendment, the purpose of which is to \naddress all of the issues that have been raised over the last few \nmonths as we have debated this issue about specific areas of employment \ncategories that have been alleged to have been negatively impacted by \nthe originally proposed regulation. I listed them all. Every group that \nhas been allegedly negatively impacted in the last few months by the \nproposed regulation has been listed, and it has been said that those \nfolks in those categories will either get the best of the old law or \nthe best of the new law. It is a ``win'' or a ``win more'' situation \nfor those categories.\n  Why are there not more categories in here? Some people say there are \nonly 40 or 50 categories. Well, it is because those are the categories \nthat have been identified most often on this floor as being allegedly \nat risk under the old proposed regulation. This basically takes them \noff the playing field as being in play.\n\n  I happen to believe, and I think people who look at this with some \nobjectivity believe, that maybe much of this language is redundant. But \nwe want to make it absolutely clear that these people are not going to \nbe negatively impacted. So that list of 55 are picked off, are taken \nout of play completely, by name. Why do we choose those? Because those \nwere the ones who, it was alleged under the duties test, might be at \nrisk. We didn't think they were but we wanted to make it clear they \nwere not.\n  So the new proposed regulation, in our opinion, is a major step \nforward in giving certainty to the marketplace, in giving 6.7 million \nAmericans who do not have the guarantee of overtime today a guarantee \nof overtime, and making it clear to the businesspeople of this country \nthat they can invest in creating new jobs, they can move people up the \npromotion ladder, and they can spend more money on people's wages \nrather than having to spend more money on lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, at this time I am willing to go to a vote and yield \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think I have about 50 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Gregg has it all wrong. To respond, my amendment \nsays ``duties''--if your duties remain the same, you get overtime. But \nif your duties change, there is no glass ceiling. If you are a \nsecretary today but you become CEO next year, of course you won't get \novertime. That is what my friend from New Hampshire is missing. That is \nwhat is wrong with this amendment. He does it job by job. What I say \nis, if your duties are the same, you ought to get overtime. But there \nis no glass ceiling. If you go up a ladder, become manager, owner, or \nCEO of the company, of course you don't get overtime. That is a bogus \nargument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we vote, I have an unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please state his request.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the Collins amendment, No. \n3108, be modified with the changes that are at the desk and that the \namendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; further, I ask that there then be 45 minutes of debate in \nrelationship to the Wyden amendment, No. 3109, with 15 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Wyden and 30 minutes under the control of the \nchairman or his designee; further, I ask consent that following that \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote in relationship to the amendment, \nwith no second degrees in order to the amendment prior to the vote; \nfinally, I ask consent that following that vote, Senator Allen be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object--of course I will not--I \nthank all Senators for going the extra mile to help work out this \nagreement. We are taking steps. We are proceeding. I think we will get \nthis bill passed this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the request of the \nSenator from Iowa is granted.\n  The amendment (No. 3108), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 139, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Who yields time on the pending Wyden \namendment? The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly outline this \nbipartisan amendment. This is cosponsored by my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Coleman. We are joined by Senator Snowe and Senator \nBrownback, and on our side by the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Rockefeller. There is a strong bipartisan coalition \nfor this amendment because the fact is under our trade adjustment laws, \nmillions of our workers have been left behind.\n  This law has been of great benefit to those in the manufacturing \nsector for more than three decades, but for millions of our workers who \nwork in the service sector, who work, for example, in the high-\ntechnology sector, the safety net the Trade Adjustment Act provides has \nnot been there. So all of the benefits offered by the trade adjustment \nlegislation in terms of help with retraining, assistance with health \ncare, a bit of income to get by--all of the services that make it \npossible for one to use this critical law as a trampoline to get back \ninto the private sector economy have not been available in the service \nsector and in the high-technology sector, and that is what our \nbipartisan amendment would change.\n  In the last few hours apparently there has been one letter from an \ninsurance company that has been offered up as an argument against this. \nIt states that in some way our legislation would damage the opportunity \nfor private insurance companies to deliver health benefits under this \nlegislation. Senator Coleman and I would never support something like \nthat, and I wish to outline exactly why our amendment does not damage \nthe opportunity for private insurance companies to deliver health care \nunder our proposal.\n  Our amendment states that all current private sector health care \ndelivery systems would be continued in every State in America. So let \nme start with that.\n  Under our bipartisan amendment, in every State in America the private \nsector options that are offered now could be continued.\n  We do state in our proposal that if there is discrimination, say, on \nthe basis of genetic history or disability or other concrete examples \nof discrimination, then the Office of Personnel Management would be \ngiven the discretion--not required but they would be\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\ngiven the discretion--to step in and ensure that there is an affordable \nalternative.\n  Second, we protect the option of private health insurers \nparticipating in the system by stipulating that our amendment will not \noverride State decisionmaking. This is very important because, again, \nin every State in our country, State insurance law allows for private \ninsurers to be involved in the health care delivery system.\n  Third, apparently there was a concern raised that in some way this \namendment would encourage adverse selection and then there would be a \ndisproportionate number of those who are needy and ailing going to \nprivate insurers.\n  The fact is that the bipartisan amendment will reduce adverse \nselection. It will reduce adverse selection by increasing the subsidy \nthat is available for health care in America. It will expand outreach, \nwhich will be beneficial, and make it easier for people to sign up. So \nthe prospect that this will encourage adverse selection and damage \nprivate insurers is also incorrect.\n  So I want to be clear because there was one letter that was brought \nup recently in the last few hours opposing all of the good bipartisan \nwork that has been done on this for months and months, and I wanted to \nset the record clear that for the three reasons I have outlined our \nbipartisan legislation will do no damage to the important private \nsector health delivery options that are available now in every State in \nAmerica and will be continued under our legislation.\n  I believe I will have a bit more time later. I think Senator Coleman \ndid an incredibly good job yesterday of outlining the case for why it \nis so important to help these workers. I know in my home State, folks \ndo not understand why if one is hurting in Beaverton, OR, or they have \nlost their job as a result of trade they cannot be in a position to \ncompete against somebody in Bangalore. That is what this issue is all \nabout.\n  I see our friend, the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, is in the Chamber. He has done such good work over the years \nwith respect to the training and other programs that are essential. \nWith this legislation that has been produced by a bipartisan group, \nincluding Senators Coleman, Brownback, Snowe, Rockefeller, and Baucus, \nwe are giving a chance to that great bulk of workers in the service \nsector and in the high-technology sector to have a chance to use this \nprogram as a trampoline to get back into the economy. They are not \ngoing to get that chance under other programs. There is no other \nprogram that gives that same kind of opportunity to folks who are \nhurting in this way. We have done it in a bipartisan way. We have done \nit in a cost-effective way. We have done it in a fashion so as to not \ndamage the right of private health insurers in every State in the \ncountry to deliver the benefit.\n  I will have a bit more to say as we get into the debate, but I also \nconclude this portion by thanking my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota. He has been a great champion of a bipartisan \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nefforts in working in a bipartisan way and simply trying to do the \nright thing.\n  I happen to be a very strong supporter of trade. I understand that if \none does not trade, they do not grow and the economy does not grow. In \nthe end, I have always believed the best thing we can do as public \nofficials, moms and dads, is give people the opportunity to work. Trade \nhas been an opportunity for jobs. Trade has created those \nopportunities.\n  Along the way, there have been some casualties. Along the way, due to \npolicy choices we have made, not because of lack of productivity, not \nbecause of inefficiency but because of policy decisions regarding \ntrade, workers have had jobs impacted.\n  A couple of years ago, in 2002, my colleagues did a review and \nrelooked at this whole issue of trade adjustment assistance, something \nthat has been around since the times of John Kennedy, and said we \nshould strengthen this. In doing so, one of the things that was done is \nit focused simply on the production of goods on manufacturing. Now, \nwhen I talk to many of my colleagues and say if someone is providing a \nservice, if they are driving a truck to a facility that is no longer to \nbe manufacturing lawnmowers, then they are not eligible for trade \nadjustment assistance, they are not eligible for retooling, for \nretraining, for health insurance, for tax credits. If one is providing \nthe janitorial service for the lawnmower production facility, they are \nnot eligible for the kind of assistance that would allow them to train \nfor a job so they can be back in the workforce and taking care of their \nfamily.\n  As my colleague from Oregon has indicated, in the course of the last \nfew hours we received one letter from one insurance company raising \nsome concerns. Again, I am not going to repeat what my colleague has \nsaid, except to reiterate we are not changing the opportunity that \nexists now in any State. It is still there. There is a provision which \nprovides discretion for OPM, a Federal agency, to come in under limited \ncircumstances. They probably do not want to come in, but again this is \nnot the wholesale change that some have talked about.\n  There were two other issues that came up today that I want to make \nvery clear what the facts are to my colleagues. No. 1, there has been \ndiscussion about retroactivity. It has been mentioned along the way \nthat we are going to provide retroactivity for 10 years or 12 years. \nNo. TAA was established--if we go back, I believe it was 2 years in two \nlimited circumstances, service workers being the principal one, but it \nis not 12 years of retroactivity.\n  Then the other issue that has been raised that I want to make very \nclear is we are only talking about providing TAA, trade adjustment \nassistance, to folks who lose their jobs because of trade. This is not \nopen-ended, that if one loses their job all of a sudden they are going \nto be eligible for all sorts of Federal benefits. That is not the case.\n  Under current law, if one loses their job and it is with countries \nthat have a trade agreement with the United States, Canada and Mexico, \nthen one is eligible. Under this improvement, this modification, if one \nloses their job because of trade with China or India, they are now \neligible, as it should be. That is Minnesota common sense; that is \nAmerican common sense; but it is not an open-ended expansion of a \nFederal program. It is specifically focused on job loss that is related \nto trade, and I think that is important.\n  If my colleagues believe in trade, they should support this because \nwhat this does is it allows those of us who believe in trade to say \nthat workers who are harmed are going to have some opportunities for \nhealth insurance by way of a tax credit. They are going to have an \nopportunity for wage insurance which will get them back into the \nmarketplace quicker, get them back to being more productive, get them \nback to taking care of their families. That is the right thing to do.\n  Regardless of one's position on trade, the bottom line is we all \nshould agree that those who are negatively impacted should have access \nto the opportunity to be retrained and reschooled and get back into the \nworkplace, to be able to take care of their family, and it should not \ndepend on whether one is manufacturing a lawnmower or whether one is \nproviding a service, a call center, whether one is involved in a \nsoftware firm. The nature of the job should not be the difference. What \nis important here, common sense and I think consistency would say, if \njob loss is due to trade, we are going to make these opportunities \navailable.\n\n  We have identified an area in the budget which would offset the cost. \nIt has to do with the earned-income tax credit and the way that is \napplied. There is, I believe, $5.7 billion we have identified. By \ncorrecting and dealing with this issue of earned-income tax credit, who \nis eligible, we should more than offset the opportunity we are creating \nhere for folks who are involved in service kinds of jobs to get the \nkind of coverage that would allow them to take care of their families, \nget back into the workplace, be productive, and help move this economy \nforward.\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge them not to be \nswayed at the last minute by some arguments that, if you look at them \ncarefully, simply do not hold up to the light of day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much additional time, if any, do I \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent for up to 5 additional minutes. I \nask that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, would also have that additional time if my unanimous consent \nrequest was agreed to. We have 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. I ask that I \nhave up to 5 additional minutes and that the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee would also have up to 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to alert me after I have \nused up 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I hope the proponents of this amendment \nknow that as a conferee 2 years ago when health benefits were added to \ntrade adjustment assistance, I was a conferee and I worked to make sure \nthese health benefits were included. We have a program before us \nadopted 2 years ago but operational for about no more than 9 months. \nNow what we are doing is we are being asked to make a dramatic \nexpansion of these programs with only 9 months' experience.\n  It seems to me to be a little bit early to be making these sorts of \nchanges in a program that was a fundamental change in trade adjustment \nassistance 2 years ago. But of course it was a reasonable change to \nmake because we are always trying to find ways to help people who \npreviously had health insurance, who are unemployed through no fault of \ntheir own. We did that through the trade adjustment assistance \nexpansion before.\n  I would like to respond to the first point made by the Senator from \nOregon, and that is about the letter from BlueCross BlueShield \nAssociation that they have sent to all Members of the Senate voicing \ntheir concerns about this very dramatic expansion. I want to make it \nclear that it is legitimate for them to raise their concerns because it \nis their members, the Blues, who have stepped up to the plate to serve \nthose eligible for the credit. They are the ones out there serving the \npublic the way Congress intended. So if they have some concerns that \nthey are just 9 months into a program and having a very dramatic change \nin the program, yes, wouldn't you expect them to voice some concerns?\n  In addition, though, to the BlueCross BlueShield Association, I have \nhad expressed to me--not in letter form, but I hope my colleagues will \ntake this into consideration in voting--I have had expressed concerns \nabout this amendment from the America's Health Insurance Plans and the \nNational Association of Health Underwriters as well.\n  I have to say I reluctantly oppose this amendment. I was hoping we \nwould be able to work out further bipartisan agreement behind this \namendment than what has come out. While I am not opposed in general to \nmaking some service workers eligible for trade adjustment assistance \nand to making improvements to the Trade Act health tax credit, this \namendment goes too far too soon. I had hoped we could reach a more \nbipartisan compromise on TAA for service workers, and I am extremely \ndisappointed that we could not do that.\n  This amendment started out with a few pages as a simple and \nstraightforward idea to extend trade adjustment assistance to low-\nskilled service workers who might be displaced by trade. The original \nbill, S. 2157, reflected that idea. That idea appealed to me, I say to \nthe Senator from Oregon, and it is certainly something that merits \nserious consideration today. Yet at some point that idea mutated to \nsomething much more than adding service workers to the existing trade \nadjustment assistance plus the health benefits expansion we adopted 2 \nyears ago.\n  The original Baucus bill, S. 2157, was 10 pages long. In short, by \njust the number of pages, it was a limited approach but good in \nsubstance. This amendment, which purports to do the same thing as the \nBaucus bill, is, in fact, 57 pages long. Clearly it does not require 57 \npages of legislation to extend trade adjustment assistance to service \nworkers. So what happened? How did 10 pages grow to 57 pages? The \nanswer is quite simple. In the guise of extending trade adjustment \nassistance to service workers, the amendment makes numerous and \nfundamental changes to the current Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. \nThese changes go so far that I feel the very fabric of trade adjustment \nassistance for workers is at risk.\n\n  I will put the changes in context. Just 2 years ago Senator Baucus \nand I worked together in a bipartisan way to expand and reform trade \nadjustment assistance. We accomplished this through the Trade Act of \n2002. In doing so, we nearly doubled the program and took the \nunprecedented step of extending trade adjustment assistance to a whole \nnew class of workers called secondary workers. Secondary workers are \nthose whose job loss might not be directly related to imports, so it \nwas a major expansion.\n  We also made a number of other changes to the program, including \nconsolidating trade adjustment assistance programs, increasing the \nfunding cap for training, increasing the job search allowance, \nestablishing a new unprecedented wage insurance program for older \nworkers, and establishing a new Federal health subsidy, a health tax \ncredit to help dislocated workers and pension recipients get health \ncoverage.\n  Now, with these new programs barely up and running, some of them just \n9 months, supporters of this amendment want to stretch trade adjustment \nassistance even further, expanding the program to a whole new loosely \ndefined class of service workers and changing the tax credit in various \nways. I am afraid that trade adjustment assistance for workers is being \nstretched to the breaking point.\n  The definitions being proposed could provide 2 years of income \nsupport, health and training benefits to service professionals, \nincluding attorneys, accountants, engineers, as well as business \nconsultants and advertising agents.\n  Allowing upper-class highly skilled professionals access to trade \nadjustment assistance does not make sense. In fact, this could actually \nhurt the program by seriously slowing the provisions of assisting \nservices and benefits for lower skilled manufacturing workers who truly \nneed skills training under trade adjustment assistance.\n  Can you visualize a lawyer or an accountant with their job loss \nassociated to trade adjustment assistance going back and learning some \nnew skill after they have been through law school? I don't think so.\n  But perhaps what is even more troubling is the number of fundamental \nand permanent changes that are being made to trade adjustment \nassistance in the guise of extending the program to service workers.\n  I would like to give you some examples. The amendment expands the \ndefinition of downstream products to include testing as well as \nfinishing operations. The amendment creates a special eligibility rule \nfor producers of taconite pellets. It includes a special retroactive \nrule for producers of taconite pellets to November 4, 2002. It doubles \nthe authorization for training benefits to $440 million annually. It \nlowers the age for workers eligible to participate in the Wage \nInsurance Program, basically a wage subsidy for older workers, from 50 \nyears and older, to 40 years and older.\n  Let's look at that. Originally, we wanted to help people who were \nmaybe too old to get some job retraining to move into another industry. \nGenerally, that is 50 years and up. But are you going to offer this \nwage insurance to people who are 40 years old and have 25 more years to \nwork where the benefit of job retraining is a worthwhile investment? \nThis amendment does that.\n  It establishes a whole new trade adjustment assistance program for \ncommunities. It completely reorganizes the trade adjustment assistance \nfor firms by establishing an Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance \nwithin the Department of Commerce. It adds a new class\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nof firms--service firms--eligible for benefits under the program. It \nfurther relaxes current eligibility criteria for manufacturing workers \ndeemed eligible for trade adjustment assistance. It requires the \nSecretary of Labor to establish a new performance measuring system as \nwell as a number of other new data collection projects.\n  The program may be pushed to the breaking point.\n  That is the third time I have said it.\n  We have a program that was expanded 2 years ago getting underway 9 \nmonths ago. Here we are doing all these things I just mentioned, and \ndoing it on a bill that is meant to create jobs in industry. We are \nholding up a bill that should have been passed 3 months ago to get jobs \nin manufacturing.\n  If this weren't enough, the amendment would change the health tax \ncredit.\n  Again, because that program is young, the advanceable credit has only \nbeen running for 9 months. We do not know what issues may need to be \naddressed or the best ways to address them.\n  When is it going to reach the point around here when we pass a law in \none Congress, it is in operation one day, and we start changing it? \nWhen is enough enough? Or when, at least, is enough enough for a while?\n  Yet here we have an amendment that claims to have some sort of \ndefinitive solutions.\n\n  Changing the rules in a piecemeal fashion, especially now in the \nearly stages, will be unsettling for those at the Federal and State \nlevels who, along with private insurers, are working diligently to get \ntheir tax credit off the ground.\n  By accepting this amendment, we would be sending them a loud and \nclear message: Thanks for all your hard work, but we are going to \nchange the ground rules. By the way, do not be surprised if we come \nback tomorrow and tell you later that because we have better, more \ncomplete information, these changes being made and suggested today \naren't somehow the right changes. So we are going to give you more.\n  That information will be coming in the very near term.\n  The General Accounting Office will issue a report in early fall on \nthe health tax credit. I plan to hold a hearing in the Finance \nCommittee to discuss the General Accounting Office's findings and \nrecommendations. Treasury also has survey work underway. It will be \nimportant for us to judge the progress of this new program that was \nadopted just 2 years ago and which has been in effect for 9 months.\n  These reports--when we get them--will better inform efforts to \nimprove the health tax credit at the right time with some information \nthat is worthwhile so we can make a judgment that we will use the \ntaxpayers' money wisely.\n  Now is not the time. This amendment will destabilize the Trade Act \ntax credit and undermine the availability of affordable coverage \nchoices for people eligible for that credit--the exact opposite outcome \nthat anyone would want.\n  A number of Blue Cross-Blue Shield association members cover those \nwho receive the credit. They wrote:\n\n       This represents a major and problematic change in a program \n     that has been operational for less than one year.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Many Blue Plans would be forced to reconsider offering \n     their products if this amendment passed placing at risk the \n     coverage of many TAA eligibles.\n\n  Some would say that is a threat coming from somebody who is just \nlooking out for Members in this body who oppose your amendment. But you \nought to give some consideration, it seems to me, to people who are \noffering a service. When we passed this bill 2 years ago, we didn't \nknow we would be prepared to do it, but people have stepped up to the \nplate.\n  Let us be clear about what is at stake. If we weaken the \neffectiveness of the Trade Adjustment Program for manufacturing \nworkers, public support for that program will be lost and truly trade-\nimpacted workers may be hurt.\n  If we expand the Trade Adjustment Program and change the health tax \ncredit in a less than a thoughtful and deliberate manner, we could \njeopardize programs for current beneficiaries.\n  We should make sure proposals to further expand trade adjustment \nassistance and to change the health tax credit are done in a fiscally \nprudent way and that any changes made will work in practice. In other \nwords, approach this the same way that Senator Baucus and I did 2 years \nago when we got into the program.\n  What we have in this amendment is a bunch of ideas with no coherent \ndirection except being bigger and bigger, more and more, and higher and \nhigher.\n  Such an approach surely is good politics, but it certainly can result \nin bad policy. I figure that good policy is the best politics. I am \nafraid that is what we have in this amendment--bad policy.\n  The price tag for all of these special rules, retroactively, and new \nbenefits, comes to about a $5.3 billion price tag. Where I come from \nthat is a lot of money. I think we have an obligation to make sure it \nis spent wisely.\n  While well-intentioned, this amendment goes too far. It could weaken \nthe current program, and it could put the recently enacted health tax \ncredit at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much additional time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield 2 minutes at this time to Senator Coleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my colleague, the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, shares the same objective; that is, strong \nadjustment assistance.\n  I maintain that what we are trying to do in this amendment is to \nsimply strengthen what we have seen over 2 years has not been working. \nThat is what is going on here.\n  Fewer than 5 percent of eligible TAA workers are using the existing \ntax credit. That is not what we intended. I don't believe my colleagues \nintended that when it was originally passed. When this was originally \npassed, we focused on manufacturing jobs. We have all come to \nunderstand that about 80 percent of the jobs today in America are \nservice jobs.\n  We are simply looking at something with which we had experience over \n2 years, identifying those things that are not working, those things \nwhere folks are not taking advantage of the opportunities which were \nour intent to provide, and giving them that opportunity in a way which \nwill work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have enormous respect for the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. I will take a minute or two to touch on the \nissue being raised.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee has repeatedly said: The \nprogram would be stretched too far; the program is already at its \nlimits; when would enough be enough?\n  I say to my distinguished friend, when we are only covering 5 percent \nof the people eligible for the health care benefit, we have to do \nbetter. By any calculation, that is not something that reflects well on \nour bipartisan desires.\n  The chairman of the committee knows I have been supportive of these \ntrade agreements the Senator from Iowa and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana have championed. They have opened up the opportunity for \nU.S. companies to set up shops overseas and generate jobs and \ninvestment.\n  Senator Coleman and I want to open up the trade adjustment program so \nwhen our U.S. workers are hurt, they are not left behind. Senator \nColeman and I have said this is a question of bringing the law in line \nwith the times. It made sense more than three decades ago when it \nfocused on manufacturing.\n  The chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nhas hit the key question: When is enough enough? We believe, on a \nbipartisan basis, it is not enough when you are covering only 5 percent \nof the workers for health care and you are leaving four-fifths of the \neconomy, people in the service sector and the high-technology sector, \nbehind.\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\n  There is a reason why business and labor have come together to \nsupport our amendment. This amendment is supported by the Business \nRoundtable. It is supported by the Technology Industry Association. The \ntwo key business groups, the Business Roundtable, the Technology \nIndustry Association, and the labor sector, have come together because \nthey have seen a bipartisan effort that has gone on for months, led by \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana and the Senator from Minnesota, \nto bring the Senate together.\n  If Members vote against this amendment, I believe it is a vote that \nwill continue discrimination under law against those who work in the \nhigh-technology and service sector. It will keep the door closed to \nmillions of our workers in the technology and service sector. I know no \nSenator intends that, but that will be the practical effect.\n  We will have only one vote in this session of the Senate as to \nwhether we will have a chance to stand up for these workers who have \nbeen hammered as a result of unfair trading practices or simply \ncompetition, when we pay $40 or $50 an hour and competitors overseas \npay vastly less.\n  I am very hopeful the bipartisan efforts that have been made will not \nbe in vain. The distinguished Senator from Iowa has put his hand on the \nkey question: When is enough enough? We respectfully say, if we are \nonly covering 5 percent of the workers and leaving four-fifths of the \neconomy behind and the support of the Business Roundtable and the \nTechnology Industry Association, it is not enough. We can do better.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the committee, \nand the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Baucus, know I \nhave been very supportive of their policies in the past and expect to \nbe in the future, particularly with respect to these trade agreements. \nWhen the trade agreements open up the opportunities for our companies, \nwe have to open up the opportunity for the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram to help our workers when they have been left behind.\n  This will be the one chance to stand up for millions of workers in \nthe high-tech and service sector. I hope our colleagues will support \nthis bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 30 seconds, one to correct and one for \nthoughtful reaction.\n  The thoughtful reaction is this: When a new program has been in \neffect for only 9 months, is it unusual that only 5 percent of the \npeople would take part in it? No, they are learning about it. They are \ngoing to get involved over a period of time. Only 5 percent in 9 \nmonths.\n  Second, as to the Business Roundtable supporting this amendment, I \nknow the Business Roundtable has called some of the offices of various \nsponsors of this bill to tell them to quit saying the Business \nRoundtable supports this amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma whatever time he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for his \nstatement. I hope our colleagues paid attention to it.\n  I see my friend from Oregon. Before I make my statement, I have a \nquestion because I am trying to determine who is eligible. How many \nweeks does a worker have to work in a service industry before he would \nbe eligible for this trade adjustment assistance?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to asking a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am asking a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Same as current law.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is how many weeks?\n  I reclaim my time. If my colleague from Oregon finds an answer to \nthat, I appreciate hearing it. I have asked our staff the answer to \nthat question and it came back that a person only had to work 26 weeks \nof the previous 52 to qualify for the benefit.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is current law.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I wanted to make sure. We are saying if you work in \nservice, manufacturing, we will give you trade adjustment assistance. \nWhat is the benefit? The benefit is equal to 2 years of unemployment \ncompensation. For what? A person worked 26 weeks--one half of a year--\nand now under this proposal, we are expanding it.\n  It was too generous in the first place. We are expanding it to say a \nperson is entitled to receive very generous benefits, benefits equal to \n2 years of unemployment compensation, 26 weeks by the State, and a year \nand a half under the Federal program, all federally paid unemployment \ncompensation. That is more generous. All other States have 26 weeks.\n\n  We have debated that back and forth, but now we are saying for this \ngroup of employees, you get 2 years, mostly paid for by the Federal \nGovernment. That is too generous.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I want to make a few comments. Then I will be happy \nto engage in a dialog.\n  What is the cost of this proposal? I have heard somebody say it is \npaid for. It is not, according to the scoring rules we use in the \nSenate. The cost of it--and we got a copy of this from the \nCongressional Budget Office. The total budget authority over 10 years \nis $5.3 billion; estimated outlay is $5 billion, and a revenue \ndecrease, because of the insurance tax credit, of $669 million. So it \nis a total cost of 7.6 billion over 10 years.\n  Now let's look at a couple of other provisions in the bill. This bill \nsays we will take the present program and expand it. We will give \nbasically refundable tax credits for insurance. The present program \nsays the Federal Government will pay 65 percent of it, two-thirds. This \nbill says we will replace that and have the Federal Government pay 75 \npercent. That is three-fourths, if you are not real quick in math. And \nthere is no limit on the cost.\n  So a person in high tech, as I heard my colleague say, could maybe \nhave a very generous health care plan, maybe it costs $10,000 a year \nand the Federal Government will pay $7,500 because there is not a limit \nin the cost.\n  Wow. This thing is just growing. And maybe some people get some \nsupport from this union or that union, and it sounds good. But you \nstart looking at it and you say: What are we doing? It purports to make \nsome changes in the earned-income tax program. I am happy to make \nchanges in the earned-income tax program, but I don't think this gets \nit done.\n  Basically what I see this doing is expanding an entitlement, saying, \nif you happen to be unemployed, either through manufacturing or through \nservice workers, and somebody can say it is because those jobs went \noverseas--and that is somewhat discretionary in the assessment of it--\nthe Federal Government is going to pick up three-fourths of your health \ncare cost for the next 2 years and you are entitled to 2 years of \nunemployment compensation.\n  Unemployment compensation for most States averages about $260, $280, \nmaybe $300 a week. In some States it is up to $700 a week. Again, there \nis no limit. If you are looking at $700 a week, you are talking about \nreal money. You do that for 104 weeks, that is a pretty generous \nbenefit paid by the Federal Government.\n  Guess what, folks. We have a little deficit problem around here. This \nis going to add to it. In fact, this would add to it to the tune of \nabout $7 or $8 billion--$7.3 billion, I believe. At the appropriate \ntime, I am going to make a budget point of order.\n  Let me give a little facts on trade adjustment assistance. Again, for \nall of our fiscal conservatives who say we need to get a handle on \nFederal spending, trade adjustment assistance cost $350 million in the \nyear 2001. The year 2004, it cost $800 million. If we do this \nexpansion, it is going to grow dramatically.\n  There are lots of reasons to vote against this proposal. I urge my \ncolleagues at the appropriate time to vote against it, and at the \nappropriate time I will be making a budget point of order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will let the Senator from Montana ask a \nquestion, and then I have a minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 10 additional minutes.\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nThe Senator from Oregon controls 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Montana for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Isn't it true that under this basic law and also this \namendment, benefits only accrue prospectively; that is, no benefits \naccrue retroactively? That is, the only retroactive application is as \nto whether somebody qualifies, but the actual benefits only accrue \nprospectively. So it is not accurate to say there is a lump sum that is \npaid to a worker because of past employment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct. I believe you do provide trade \nadjustment assistance to workers in companies where it is 20 percent \nand you are looking backward to see whether they qualify.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. But, again, the payments--that is, the \ntrade adjustment assistance payments--would only be prospective.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is for persons, after today, for example, talking \nabout service employees, who are out of a job on account of trade.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I agree.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So it is true there is no lump sum payment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I didn't say there was a lump sum. I said the facts are \nthe benefits under this Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which was \nan amendment that was added to the fast-track promotion bill to maybe \nencourage some people to vote for it, in my opinion, is fatally flawed. \nBecause it has a tax credit where the Federal Government is going to \npay two-thirds of the health care costs, 65 percent of the health care \ncost if somebody is in this category. You only have to work 26 weeks \nout of the previous year and yet you can get your health care benefits \npaid for under current law 65 percent by the Federal Government. This \nmakes it three-fourths paid for by the Federal Government. That is a \nserious mistake. It benefits, frankly, those plans and those companies \nthat have very high health care costs. In some cases that would be \nunion plans that maybe overpromised, and they have very expensive \nplans.\n  It also would benefit those people who say: Wait a minute. I lost my \njob. I lost my job because now that job is being done in India. Maybe \nsomebody is a programmer or maybe somebody is a computer programmer or \nmaybe they are a telephone solicitor and now maybe that job is being \ndone some in the States and some overseas. But the company had a tough \ntime. Maybe it is a telecommunications company and they reduced their \nemployment. But there happens to be some employment overseas. You could \nsee a whole lot of people saying: My job was lost because it went to \nIndia, because it went to China. Therefore, even though I have only \nworked there for 26 weeks out of the last year, pay for my health care \nfor the next 2 years, Uncle Sam. And yes, I want unemployment \ncompensation for the next 2 years. Thank you very much. And \nincidentally, I want cash. Give me $5,000 cash for the next 2 years.\n  That is all in this system. It expands it greatly. That is the reason \nwhy the Congressional Budget Office says over the next 10 years it is \ngoing to cost $6 billion. At the appropriate time, I will be making a \nbudget point of order that it is not paid for. I am going to make a \npay-go point of order.\n  For the information of my colleagues who are very confused on budget \npoints of order, I have used committee allocation points of order. I \ncould use that on this one, or I could use pay-go. Most of the time I \nhave used committee allocation. I may start using pay-go so people \nbecome more familiar with it.\n  I understand people are in favor of pay-go. I would like for them to \nbecome more familiar with that particular budget point of order. We \nwill be making it.\n  This amendment also increases the wage assistance that Senator \nGrassley mentioned, which is supposed to be for older workers who might \nhave a hard time being retrained, down to 40 years. So all they have to \ndo is work for 26 weeks and then we are going to give them wage \nassistance, wage insurance.\n  How socialistic do you have to get? People come to this floor and \nsay, I believe in the free enterprise system, but if you have a change \nin jobs, we want the Federal Government to come in and give you your \nwage difference. We want to make up the difference. Oh, we are going to \ntake care of your health care for the next 2 years. Yes, we are going \nto give you unemployment compensation for 2 years. Everybody else in \nthe country has 26 weeks. But since you have determined maybe yours is \nbecause of overseas competition, we are going to give you 2 years. I \ndon't think it is affordable. I don't think it makes sense. I think it \nwas crafted in a way to maybe buy votes.\n\n  I look at these 57 pages and I am saying: Why don't we just call this \nan entitlement expansion? Let's expand all these programs. Let's tax \nand spend. How are we going to pay for it? It says we will do something \nwith the earned-income tax credit. We will get those undocumented \nworkers.\n  Joint Tax says that doesn't count. Joint Tax says that is a \ntechnicality, and so you don't get scoring for that. And we use Joint \nTax around here.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to respond very briefly, we pay for it as \nessentially outlined in the President's budget. According to OMB and \nthe Treasury Department, we would close the loophole that would save \ntaxpayers approximately $5.7 trillion over 10 years. That is the way we \npay for the program. The people who are going to be eligible for the \nprogram are going to get the same opportunities as those in the \nmanufacturing sector, the same number of weeks.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has talked about unemployment compensation. \nThis is about retraining people. This is about health care benefits.\n  If you think we are doing enough today when 5 percent of the people \nget access to the health care program, then I guess that is a rationale \nfor voting against this amendment. I would hope the bipartisan work \nthat has been done on this legislation by myself, Senator Coleman, \nSenator Brownback, Senator Snowe, and Senator Baucus would warrant the \nsupport of our colleagues.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I speak in strong support of the trade \nadjustment assistance amendment to the JOBS Act. I will keep my \ncomments short and to the point.\n  Although there continues to be a significant debate in Congress \nconcerning the efficacy of the administration's economic policies, I \nbelieve the majority of my colleagues agree on one thing: training for \nAmerican workers in critical technologies remains the key to our \neconomic security.\n  It is undeniable that the process of globalization has created \ndramatic shifts in the job opportunities available for American \nworkers.\n  It is unwise to assume the labor market will adjust by itself. I \nfirmly believe that Congress must look carefully at where we are going \nand what we should be doing to remain competitive in the future.\n  Two years ago the Senate passed an expanded Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program as part of the Trade Act of 2002. I introduced that \ntrade adjustment assistance legislation with Senators Baucus, Daschle, \nRockefeller, and a number of other colleagues as original co-sponsors.\n  Included in that legislation were a range of provisions that we \nconsidered to be essential to any effective TAA system--TAA for service \nworkers, TAA for shifts in production to all countries, TAA for \ncommunities, TAA data collection, wage insurance, significant health \ncare coverage for workers, and so on.\n  Unfortunately, all of these provisions were either outright deleted \nor seriously narrowed when the legislation went to conference.\n  The amendment today remedies that mistake. It recognizes that the \nUnited States does face an immediate problem related to negative \nimpacts from trade and we need to better prepare workers for the \nfuture. Significantly, it recognizes that long-term trade policies have \nshort-term costs for Americans and puts in place a coherent strategy to \ngive them the skills required for job security.\n  I have said this before and I say it again because it matters: \nContrary to the assertions of some of my colleagues, we cannot measure \nthe success of our trade policy only by the cost of\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nthe products we buy. We also have to look at whether our workers are \nmore economically secure.\n  By this I mean whether they have a high-wage job, whether they can \nbuy a home, whether they can afford an education for their children, \nwhether they can afford health insurance, and whether they have \nretirement security. Without these things, we are poor by any measure.\n  I have always argued that while strong trade agreements lie at the \ncore of a coherent trade strategy, an effective TAA program is \nessential for our country. It is a fair and appropriate approach for \nthose American workers who lose their jobs as a result of trade. \nAmerican workers are not looking for handouts. They are looking for a \nstep-up to something better. They are looking for a chance to provide \nfor their families and contribute to our country's economic welfare.\n  This amendment offers them a chance to do just that. It is common \nsense, and it is the least we can do for our neighbors and friends back \nhome.\n  It is time to do what has to be done to get this legislation passed. \nThere is too much at stake for American workers and communities to wait \nany longer.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Wyden, Coleman, Baucus, Brownback, and Rockefeller to offer an \namendment in recognition of the critical need to provide economic \ndevelopment assistance to Americans across this nation that have been \nnegatively impacted by trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance--TAA--\nprograms are essential in bringing short-term financial and retraining \nassistance to workers who have been displaced due to imports or shifts \nin production. I have long supported the TAA program as it has helped \nthose in Maine and across the Nation who are unemployed because of \ntrade to find new employment and gain the appropriate skills these new \njobs require, and this amendment builds upon this crucial program.\n  What we have before us is an amendment which recognizes that our \ndesire to trade should be balanced with our ability to assist those \nadversely affected by trade. Our amendment is a comprehensive package \nof TAA improvements and additions that further seeks to better the \nconditions for America's workers and communities who find themselves \nnegatively impacted in the wake of rapid international trade \nliberalization.\n  Our amendment contains provisions to assist trade-impacted \ncommunities similar to those included in my bill, The Trade for \nAmerica's Communities Act, which I introduced last year. My legislation \ngives the Department of Commerce the authority to use the revenue \ncollected from tariffs--which currently goes to corporations--to \nprovide technical assistance to communities that have been negatively \nimpacted by trade. The bill--and portions of this amendment--helps \ncommunities to develop strategic plans that would focus on the creation \nand retention of jobs and to promote economic diversification.\n  Our amendment also makes critical TAA changes in relation to the \nservice sector. We need to recognize that trade affects not just \nmanufacturing sectors of the economy, but service industries as well. \nCurrent TAA provisions cover manufacturing workers but exclude the 80 \npercent of American non-farm jobs in the service sector. Our amendment \nmakes existing TAA benefits available to service workers whose jobs \nmove overseas and increases training funds to match anticipated \nenrollment. This provision is sorely needed in places like Lewiston, \nME, where 84 service sector layoffs occurred at the ICT call center, or \n30 workers at Prexar in Bangor, ME--all service sector workers.\n  When you start adding these types of layoffs to that of production in \nsmall towns across the country, the impact is sizable, making the \ndistinction between service and production workers irrelevant. These \ndynamic changes that are outgrowths of trade are similar to \ntechnological advances in productivity that leave workers out of jobs, \nor plants out of operation.\n  Beyond these provisions, the amendment also provides important \nimprovements to the refundable health care tax credit for laid-off \nworkers and retirees that was originally created in 2002 as part of the \nTrade Promotion Authority Act.\n  Two years ago, I was proud to work closely as a member of the Finance \nCommittee with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley to create the HCTC \nas a means for displaced workers to continue receiving the health care \nbenefits they lost as a consequence of trade. I worked to bring this \nbenefit to fruition to help these displace workers get the health \ncoverage they need when faced with the loss of employment because the \nassistance option at that time, namely COBRA, was too expensive to be \nfeasible. I will continue my efforts to see that it is properly \nadministered and adequately received by TAA-certified beneficiaries. \nThere have been countless situations prior to introducing the HCTC \nwhere the workers were left without health care insurance, and this is \na situation that we have only begun to remedy by creating the HCTC.\n\n  Unfortunately, recent studies have demonstrated that the tax credit \nhas not been widely utilized by workers. Just last month, the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor reported that only about 10 percent of workers \ncertified under the TAA program have applied for the health care tax \ncredit since its enactment. In fact, according to Blue-Cross/Blue-\nShield, only about 100 people in Maine are signed up for the HCTC.\n  In 2002, the original Senate version that I worked on called for a 75 \npercent HCTC benefit. Unfortunately this benefit was reduced to 65 \npercent in conference. That is why I am pleased that our amendment \ntoday will restore this benefit to its originally proposed level. This \nadjustment to the HCTC will allow more TAA-certified workers to take \nadvantage of the tax credit by making health care more affordable as \nthey seek new employment. As many of my colleagues would agree, TAA-\ncertified workers may still find it difficult to cover 25 percent of \nthe cost of premiums, but it is surely a step in the right direction to \nmaking the HCTC more accessible.\n  This past February, I met with union members in my state who were \nlaid off as a result of the shutdown of the Eastern Pulp and Paper \nmills in Lincoln and Brewer, ME, to talk about their needs. During the \nmeeting, I heard first hand that the 35 percent of the cost of the \nhealth insurance premiums under the HCTC program is still too high when \nmost displaced workers are only receiving a maximum of $292.00 per week \nin unemployment insurance--and premiums can be as high as $559.91 per \nmonth for an individual and as high as $1,483.75 for a family. The \nunion officials also informed me that in the case of the Brewer, ME, \nmill, of the 350 employees affected by the shutdown, only 6 took \nadvantage of the HCTC. Frankly, if the credit is unworkable and \nunattainable, then there is no point in having it in the first place. \nThis cost is a real stumbling block for displaced workers, and we must \nlook at this program on a basic level of affordability for impacted \nindividuals.\n  Another problem that was identified to me during this meeting is that \nthe statute is unclear and too restrictive. This has made \nadministration of the credit difficult. For example, while the HCTC is \nrefundable, the IRS currently does not advance the first month's tax \ncredit, which means the displaced worker must pay for the entire health \ncare premium the first month--100 percent of the cost. This, in many \ncases, causes the worker to not take advantage of the HCTC because they \nsimply cannot afford that first payment. In the case of the Eastern \nPulp and Paper mills, a worker and his or her spouse would have to come \nup with $1,500 that first month. Clearly this would turn a prospective \nbeneficiary away right at the beginning. The need to streamline the \nadministrative process of the HCTC is paramount to making it more \naccessible.\n  We attempt to remedy this situation in this amendment by improving \naccess to the credit as well as making it more effective. Not only does \nthe amendment increase the credit percentage from 65 percent to 75 \npercent of the individuals' health care premiums, but it also instructs \nthe IRS to provide an expedited refund of the first month's tax credit. \nWorkers in my home state of Maine who are being laid off have told me \nthat they just cannot afford the cost of health insurance. This \namendment will make health care more accessible for this population.\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n  Beyond expanding the size of the credit, our amendment also provides \nimportant outreach initiatives to get the word out to eligible workers \nabout the existence of the credit. For example, the amendment allows \nstates, to use funds from a National Emergency Grant, to provide \noutreach and marketing to inform individuals of the available health \ninsurance options, including low cost options, that qualify for the \nhealth care tax credit. Maine has already done this with great success \nwhich is a testament to why we need to make this a viable option \nnationwide. While this may seem like a simple change, it is one of \ngreat impact, as too many eligible workers are unaware that these \nbenefits even exist.\n  Overall, these reforms to this vital health care tax credit are \ncritical to get workers and retires the information and the access they \nneed to ensure health insurance coverage.\n  The cost of this amendment is estimated to be about $5 billion over \nthe next 10 years for the expanded TAA benefits and the improvements to \nthe health care tax credit for TAA recipients. Our amendment proposes \nto offset this cost by closing a loophole in the administration of the \nearned income tax credit--EITC--that is allowing individuals to \ninappropriately claim refundable tax benefits.\n  Current, Social Security numbers are provided for to individuals for \nemployment and to obtain Federal and State benefits. Under current law, \nindividuals are required to have a work related Social Security in \norder to claim the earned income tax credit in every situation but one: \nindividuals who have attained a Social Security number solely in order \nto gain State benefits.\n  Currently, the IRS is unable to differentiate between an individual \nwho has a work or non-work related Social Security number. Therefore, \nindividuals who are not working but have a non-work related Social \nSecurity number are able to receive EITC without having been qualified \nto do so.\n  The offset provision in this amendment would require every individual \nclaiming the EITC to have a Social Security number that is valid for \nemployment. Thus, individuals with non-work related Social Security \nnumbers, regardless of why they were offered, would not qualify.\n  This provision was included in the President's budget and is \nestimated to raise about $5.7 billion over 10 years, by the IRS, \nTreasury Department and Office of Management and Budget and fully \noffsets the cost of this amendment by recouping the lost revenue from \nthis unintended loophole in the law.\n  I understand that there is technical discrepancy between Joint Tax \nand the Treasury on the scoring of this offset. While its clear that it \nwill provide billions in savings to the Government, I intend to work \nwith Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus to ensure that this \nentire bill meets the requirements of the Budget Act and is fully \noffset according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \nCongressional Budget Office; the official score keepers for Congress, \nas well as the Department of the Treasury.\n  The fact is trade results in both the formation of new jobs as well \nas the loss of others. These assistance programs recognize this reality \nand help give the American worker the education, training and skills \nthey need to find another job and continue in gainful employment--while \nat the same time assisting them with the financial means to sustain \ntheir families as they pursue the necessary retraining. Since 1997, \nover 10,000 Mainers have applied for TAA benefits. Clearly the need for \nthese programs is as strong as ever.\n\n  In small towns where the livelihood of the local economy depends on \none industry, one plant or one company that is suffering under trade \nliberalization, it can cause devastation when that steel mill, paper \nmill, or textile mill shuts down. I have personally witnessed time and \ntime again the hardship that trade liberalization policies can cause.\n  In towns like East Millinocket and Millinocket, ME, where Great \nNorthern Paper went bankrupt; in Waterville, ME, where Hathaway Shirt \nshut down as a result of shirt production being moved overseas; or most \nrecently the Eastern Pulp & Paper mills in Lincoln and Brewer, ME, \nlocal economies were sent into disarray. These closures have a ripple \neffect throughout the region. Efforts were made in these communities to \nform transition teams to assist the impacted workers find the \nassistance resources necessary to survive financially through these \ndifficult times. I helped lead the way to these assistance resources, \nbut I continue to recognize that these communities need much broader \nassistance. That is just part of the reason I have been so adamant in \nmy support for improvements in Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  With the momentum provided by the passage and implementation of Trade \nPromotion Authority, the President has moved aggressively on an agenda \nof bilateral, regional and global agreements that promote the \nliberalization of trade and seek to grow the U.S. economy. As the \nPresident has argued, this policy agenda creates new opportunities for \nprosperity and growth. But in order for this to work, free trade has to \nbe fair and we must be diligent in enforcing the rules to ensure we are \noperating on a level playing field.\n  At the same time, we must never forget that opportunities of market \naccess, improved consumer choice, and availability of manufacturing \ninputs come with the price of transitions, dislocations, and shifts in \nthe U.S. economy. America's workers--both manufacturing and service \nsector--and communities are often faced with difficult realities in the \nrapidly changing nature of international trade liberalization.\n  However, while technological advances are the initiative of private \nenterprise, trade liberalization and enforcement is the chosen policy \nof government. Change and progress can be good, but we must never \nignore or forget those Americans who find themselves unfairly treated \nin an era of global commerce. Congress must make the difficult \ndecisions to turn these challenges into opportunities for this Nation.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment and join my \ncolleagues as we continue to recognize and address the oft-ignored \nconsequences of international trade liberalization. At the end of the \nday, it is the people and communities of this nation that matter most, \nand when policies which hurt their economic livelihoods are promulgated \nby government, it is incumbent upon all of us to find ways to help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask how much time is left on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oregon has \nexpired. The Senator from Iowa controls 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both sides be \ngiven an additional 3 minutes on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLEN). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if we go into a quorum call, I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be divided proportionately.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will use my time.\n  Mr. President, the point is this. It is quite simple. We in America \nare faced with immense competitive pressure worldwide. We are concerned \nabout a lot of jobs being lost in America. Some are being lost within \nAmerica; some are being lost in other countries. It is an offshore \nissue. It is a big question in America.\n  There are a lot of Senators here who are trying to address this \nquestion but who are trying not to vote for so-called protectionist \namendments; that is, amendments which say a company cannot do this or \nthat. I agree with that sentiment. But I also think--and I daresay that \nmost Senators would agree with this next point--that we should do \nsomething for our employees who lose their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  We already have a very small program called trade adjustment \nassistance for manufacturing industry jobs that are lost on account of \ntrade. We do not provide for service industry workers who lose their \njobs on account of trade. Service jobs are lost by a larger margin than \nin the past simply because so much information in America\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nis now being digitized and because of the advance of broadband \ntelecommunications. So a lot of service industry jobs--analyzing \nprograms, reading x rays, and other jobs--go overseas from American \ncompanies. Orders come over at the speed of light and the product goes \nback at the speed of light.\n  What we are saying is this is a constructive, positive response by \nthe Congress to deal with and help those people who lose their jobs on \naccount of trade. It is not a massive program as has been described. \nOnly about 150,000 people qualify today for TAA. Only 5 percent of \nAmerican workers use it. We are saying just expand it to the service \nindustry. That is not a big expansion. A very small percentage is going \nto be able to use it.\n  It has not been pointed out by the other side that you have to be \nenrolled in a retraining program to use these benefits. The key is to \nhave enough of a benefit so people don't just run off and who want to \ngo into retraining to avoid taking a McDonald's job or some minuscule \nminimum wage job.\n  I urge my colleagues to put this in the context of what is really \ngoing on and not get sidetracked by a lot of arguments that get down in \nthe weeds but which really don't address the larger issue, which is \nthat this is the one opportunity--and it is very minuscule--to help \nAmerican workers who lose their jobs, and not only manufacturing but \nservice industry jobs. It is a positive, constructive response; it is \nnot a protectionist response.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this one chance we have this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I just spoke for 30 seconds to get in \nthe point that the Business Roundtable had called the offices of the \nvarious sponsors of this amendment saying that the Business Roundtable \ndoes not support this amendment. We were also told by the authors that \nthe Information Technology Industry Council supported the amendment. I \nhave had contact, through staff, with a Joe Pasetti of the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, who made it clear they have not taken a \nposition on the Wyden amendment. I think it would be incorrect to quote \nthem as saying they support this amendment.\n  There are a couple of points I want to make about the points the \nproponents have made. The proponents, in opening debate, were concerned \nabout the affordability of coverage. Yet their changes will make \ncoverage less affordable. The amendment creates a back door exception \nto a requirement to have 3 months of coverage. This requirement is \nconsistent with HIPAA standards and was agreed to when we adopted this \noriginal expansion of TAA in August 2002.\n  The changes to the rule will require health insurers to offer \ncoverage to higher risk individuals. Health insurers, like the \nBlueCross BlueShield plans, will either have to increase premiums or \nnot offer coverage. I have said many times that you ought to be \nconcerned about affordability. The authors of the amendment say they \nare concerned about affordability, but the amendment will make coverage \nmore unaffordable. Fewer people will be able to use the credit.\n  Proponents of the amendment also have made the claim that I have \nreferred to before where they said only 5 percent of the people are \nmaking use of this new program. Well, what do you expect after just 9 \nmonths being operational--just 9 months before the massive expansion of \nthis program? But they refer to this 5 percent. They would make it \nbroader and say we have a low uptake rate and that this signals failure \nof the program we adopted 2 years ago, which is now just being \nundertaken for 9 months.\n  Let me repeat that this program is a very young program. The \nenrollment numbers only reflect those who have signed up for the \nadvanceable credit. The numbers don't include dependents. The numbers \ndon't include people who claim the credit on their yearend return. We \nwould not even know that yet. Treasury is trying to analyze that data \nof the people who claimed the yearend credit. Just like I said, we \ndon't have complete data. What would you expect after only 9 months? I \nhope our colleagues will take this into consideration when looking at a \nmassive expansion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3 minutes 40 \nseconds. The time of the Senator from Oregon has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me the remainder of the time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, we \nare going to vote in a moment. I have two or three quick comments I \nwant to make. My very good friend from Oregon--and he is my good \nfriend--as he is trying to find another vote said, wait a minute, we \nshould not treat service workers differently than those in \nmanufacturing. I used to run a manufacturing company. Manufacturing, \nfrankly, in this country has been on about a 40-year decline, almost \nstraight, on the number of jobs. The service industry, on the other \nhand, has been quite volatile, but jobs are increasing--frankly, \nincreasing in lots of different and exciting ways.\n  But to say we are going to have a Federal benefit if somebody works \nin a job for 26 weeks and somebody says, I lost my job and I think I \nlost it because of overseas competition, therefore, I am entitled to 2 \nyears of unemployment compensation, I am entitled to a refundable, \nadvanceable tax credit, and basically to have the Federal Government \npay for my health care--three-fourths of it--for the next 2 years, and \nto get cash assistance of up to $5,000 a year for each year, I think is \ngoing over board. It costs a lot of money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored this. We just got this. You \nask, why? We just got the amendment, so we just got the score from CBO. \nIt says the outlays to this are $5.3 billion in BA, or obligation \nauthority. The tax credit would cost $669 million over the next 10 \nyears. The cost is about $6 billion. According to Joint Tax, it is not \npaid for.\n  I don't really think we should have the Federal Government using our \nresources, which are limited--and we have an enormous deficit--for \npaying three-fourths of the cost of a worker's health care costs for 2 \nyears because they happened to work for 6 months. I don't think that \nmakes good sense for a lot of reasons. I don't think it makes good \nsense to lower the eligibility on this wage insurance program and that \nwe are going to pay people $5,000 a year because they might take a \nlower paying job. I think that sounds so socialistic. Somebody says \nthat is better than unemployment comp. This is in addition to \nunemployment comp. So we are going to do unemployment comp, do your \nhealth care, give you cash in the meantime, and do your retraining.\n  I don't think the Federal Government can do it all. This program has \ngrown from 300-some-million dollars in 2001 to $800 million in 2004. If \nthis amendment passes, it would be a billion dollars plus. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor, of supporting the budget although there \nmay be a motion to waive this pay-go point of order.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment offered by my good friend, \nthe Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, increases mandatory spending \nand, if adopted, would cause an increase in the deficit in excess of \nthe levels permitted in the most recently adopted budget resolution. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 505 of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget \nfor fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 505(b) of House \nConcurrent Resolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2004, I move to waive section 505 of that concurrent \nresolution for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 80 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kerry\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3113.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide mortgage payment assistance for employees who are \n                       separated from employment)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n                  TITLE IX--HOMESTEAD PRESERVATION ACT\n\n     SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Homestead Preservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 902. MORTGAGE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall establish a program under which the \n     Secretary shall award low-interest loans to eligible \n     individuals to enable such individuals to continue to make \n     mortgage payments with respect to the primary residences of \n     such individuals.\n       (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a loan under \n     the program established under subsection (a), an individual \n     shall be--\n       (1) an individual that is a worker adversely affected by \n     international economic activity, as determined by the \n     Secretary;\n       (2) a borrower under a loan which requires the individual \n     to make monthly mortgage payments with respect to the primary \n     place of residence of the individual; and\n       (3) enrolled in a training or assistance program.\n       (c) Loan Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--A loan provided to an eligible individual \n     under this section shall--\n       (A) be for a period of not to exceed 12 months;\n       (B) be for an amount that does not exceed the sum of--\n       (i) the amount of the monthly mortgage payment owed by the \n     individual; and\n       (ii) the number of months for which the loan is provided;\n       (C) have an applicable rate of interest that equals 4 \n     percent;\n       (D) require repayment as provided for in subsection (d); \n     and\n       (E) be subject to such other terms and conditions as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate.\n       (2) Account.--A loan awarded to an individual under this \n     section shall be deposited into an account from which a \n     monthly mortgage payment will be made in accordance with the \n     terms and conditions of such loan.\n       (d) Repayment.--\n       (1) In general.--An individual to which a loan has been \n     awarded under this section shall be required to begin making \n     repayments on the loan on the earlier of--\n       (A) the date on which the individual has been employed on a \n     full-time basis for 6 consecutive months; or\n       (B) the date that is 1 year after the date on which the \n     loan has been approved under this section.\n       (2) Repayment period and amount.--\n       (A) Repayment period.--A loan awarded under this section \n     shall be repaid on a monthly basis over the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date determined under paragraph (1).\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the monthly payment described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall be determined by dividing the total \n     amount provided under the loan (plus interest) by 60.\n       (C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to prohibit an individual from--\n       (i) paying off a loan awarded under this section in less \n     than 5 years; or\n       (ii) from paying a monthly amount under such loan in excess \n     of the monthly amount determined under subparagraph (B) with \n     respect to the loan.\n       (e) Regulations.--Not later than 6 weeks after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations necessary to carry out this section, including \n     regulations that permit an individual to certify that the \n     individual is an eligible individual under subsection (b).\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, $10,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my good friend from Virginia, since \nhe has such a good amendment, is the Senator prepared to go to a vote \nin favor of this amendment? This Senator is inclined to vote for the \namendment, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the \namendment. Because we are going to accept this amendment, I wonder if \nthe Senator could agree to a voice vote on his amendment so we can get \nto the spouses' dinner more quickly.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I certainly wouldn't want to do anything to \nharm the ability of Senators to be with their spouses, and I certainly \nconsider that a pressing question. Yes, I would accept that offer and \nthat proposal. I will only make a few comments so people know what they \nare voice voting on. I will take no more than a few minutes. That is a \nkind offer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the Homestead \nPreservation Act. I filed this amendment to this underlying legislation \nto repeal the FSC/ETI tax regime.\n  I support the JOBS bill which should be focused on helping our \nmanufacturers here in this country and also help increase jobs. The \nefforts made in the prior amendment were very commendable in many \nregards. This amendment would provide displaced workers access to \nshort-term, low-interest loans to help meet monthly home mortgage \npayments while training for or seeking new employment.\n  This is a commonsense, compassionate amendment designed to help \nworking families who through no fault of their own were adversely \naffected or lost their jobs due to international competition.\n  We have seen across this country--whether in the Southeast, or the \nNortheast, or the Midwest--uneasy times for everyone. Many regions of \nthis country, from the Southeast, the Northeast and the Midwest and \nespecially in places like southwest Virginia where we see a lot of job \nlosses in the textile and apparel industry as well as furniture \nmanufacturing, which has been especially hard hit. Any time one of \nthese factories closes, it is a devastating blow to all the families \nand businesses in that community and in the region.\n\n  I was proud to actually see the response of close-knit communities in \nsouthwest Virginia where everyone came together to help those who had \nlost a job. When companies like Pluma, Tultex, Pillowtex and others \nclosed their doors and thousands of jobs were\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\nlost; not one or two, but multiples of thousands.\n  Most recently in Galax, VA--otherwise known as the home of the ``Old-\nTime Fiddlers Convention''--Webb Furniture Enterprises closed their \ndoors due to international competition. This amendment will help those \nfamilies--not just in Virginia but across this country. The proposal \nwould direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development--HUD--to \nhelp through these tough times.\n  I understand no government loan or government assistance will \nsubstitute for a job. But there are ways we can assist in this regard. \nWe ought to find ways to ease the stress and turmoil for people whose \nlives are unexpectedly thrown into transition after years of steady \nemployment with a company that suddenly disappears.\n  While they are looking for jobs and getting retraining, people are \nworrying about their homes. Often the biggest financial investment in \nsomeone's life is their home. They have a lot of equity built into that \nhome. Again, while they are getting training and looking for another \njob, those mortgage payments are still there.\n  When I saw this sort of economic disaster hit Martinsville a few \nyears ago, it struck me so much like a natural disaster as far as the \ndevastation. But in many regards it is worse than a natural disaster \nbecause after a natural disaster there is a buildup. There is hope for \nthe future. In an economic disaster with the loss of thousands of jobs, \nthere is no clear rebuilding process.\n  The point is the Federal Government, in my view, ought to make \nsimilar assistance available to homeowners in economic disasters as is \navailable when there is a natural disaster.\n  That is the rationale behind my amendment--the Homestead Preservation \nAct. This legislation will provide temporary mortgage assistance to \ndisplaced workers by helping them make ends meet during their search \nfor a new job. Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act authorizes \nHUD to administer a low-interest loan program at 4 percent for workers \ndisplaced due to international competition. The loan is for up to an \namount of 12 monthly mortgage payments--only 12, 1 year--for home \nmortgage payments only. The program is authorized at $10 million per \nyear for 5 years. The loan would be paid off.\n  These are not grants. They are loans to be repaid over a period of 5 \nyears. No payments, though, would be required until 6 months after the \nborrower has returned to work full time, or 1 year, whichever is \napplicable. The loan is available only for the cost of the monthly home \nmortgage payment, and covers only those workers displaced due to \ninternational competition. It requires individuals seeking to avail \nthemselves of this loan program to be enrolled in job training or job \nassistance programs.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act provides temporary financial tools \nnecessary for displaced workers to get back on their feet and to \nsucceed. It is logical and, in my view, a responsible response.\n  This measure garnered strong bipartisan support the last time it was \nconsidered by the Senate. I respectfully urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the value Americans place on owning a home, and support this \ncaring and needed initiative.\n  If no one has anything further to say about it, I urge adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3113) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                 Reform\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is another point that I would like \nto discuss with the chairman for the record, regarding a form of \nrestitution that is often authorized for rebates in the case of \nregulated utility providers whose rates to consumers are regulated. Due \nto a change of circumstances or other factors, the rates that were \ncharged for a particular period may be determined to be greater than \nshould have been charged if all relevant factors had been known and \nproperly accounted for. Due to the large number of customers and the \nrelatively small amounts involved, the regulatory authority frequently \npermits the utility to adjust rates to provide compensatory rebates for \nall current customers. This avoids, for example, tracing former \noccupants of an address served by the utility or otherwise tracing \nformer customers for relatively small amounts. It is my understanding \nthat this type of procedure would qualify as restitution because \nsubstantially all the payments are directed to the actual parties that \noverpaid.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have once again had a productive day. I \nthank all Senators. We adopted several amendments. First is the \novertime amendment, an issue which has occupied the Senate for some \ngood amount of time. The Senate also adopted the amendment of the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, her manufacturing jobs credit \namendment. The Senate has also addressed the trade adjustment \nassistance amendment.\n  We have a number of major amendments pending. In the morning, we hope \nto have debate on Senator Dorgan's runaway plant amendment which is \nalready pending. Senator Graham of Florida has an amendment already \noffered, as well as Senator Breaux's repatriation amendment. We hope to \nvote early in the afternoon on all those pending amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if my colleagues doubt that the pen is \nmightier than the sword, they need to take 5 minutes to read Rena \nPederson's May 2 Dallas Morning News column entitled ``Burma's Icon \nStill Needs World's Help.''\n  When it comes to continued repression in Burma, and a largely muted \nworld response, Ms. Pederson hits a bullseye.\n  She is right to demand the U.S. Congress to expeditiously renew \nsanctions against Burma, which I fully expect us to do over the next \nfew weeks, and to take the United Nations to task for its weak and \ntepid response to the State Peace and Development Council's, SPDC, \nrecalcitrance to implement U.N. General Assembly and Commission for \nHuman Rights resolutions.\n  I share Ms. Pederson's disbelief that the U.N. Security Council has \nyet to bring the Burmese crisis up for debate and sanction. We already \nknow that Burma poses an immediate and grave threat to its neighbors, \nwhether through refugees fleeing persecution, the spread of HIV/AIDS or \nthe proliferation of illicit narcotics.\n  Unfortunately, the U.N.'s misguided ``wait and see'' approach serves \nto further exacerbate a regional crisis that is a direct result of \nthese undesirable Burmese exports and that neighboring countries, out \nof political expediency, refuse to face. Thailand, China, India and \nother regional neighbors can only bury their heads in the sand for so \nlong.\n  As three Burmese were recently sentenced to death for merely talking \nto\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nthe International Labor Organization, a U.N. agency, one would think \nthat the Secretary-General would have publicly and forcefully condemned \nthese sentences as means to defend both the Burmese victims and the \nintegrity of his own agency. It is not too late for such an expression.\n  Further, Ms. Pederson's concerns with U.N. envoy Ismail Razali's \nbusiness dealings with the SPDC comes at time when the corrupt ``oil \nfor food'' program in Iraq is under investigation. It is only fair to \nask if principles are similarly being discarded in Burma for the sake \nof personal profit.\n  I suspect that the closer we get to the May 17 constitutional \nconvention, the louder the din from the SPDC and its advocates in \nThailand will become on ``progress'' being made in Burma. I have little \nhope that the convention will serve as a catalyst for anything but an \nattempt by the SPDC to bestow legitimacy upon itself and its abusive \nrule. The director of the Burma Fund, Zaw Oo catalogued these concerns \nsuperbly in an opinion piece entitled ``Don't Help Burma's Generals'' \nin the May 6 issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review.\n  My message to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for \nDemocracy could not be more clear: you are in a position of strength \nbecause of the principled stand you continue to make in support of the \nstruggle for freedom in Burma. The people of Burma should know that \nAmerica stands with them and will continue to do so until democracy and \njustice triumphs in Burma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Ms. Pederson and Mr. Zaw Oo's \narticles be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Don't Help Burma's Generals\n\n                              (By Zaw Oo)\n\n       As I write this, the Burmese military junta called the \n     State Peace and Development Council, or SPDC, is expected to \n     soon free pro-democracy leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo. \n     But it will do this solely for ulterior reasons. The SPDC is \n     seeking some measure of international credibility. Releasing \n     Suu Kyi will get Asean off its back. Next, by also pretending \n     to seek a road map towards some form of ``disciplined'' \n     democracy, the SPDC gives Asean the cover to accept Rangoon's \n     chairmanship of the group in 2006. But in a vicious circle, \n     the SPDC is strong-arming the democratic opposition by using \n     any legitimacy it gains abroad to force the opposition into \n     accepting its road map--which will only strengthen its \n     position as a regime. The generals don't plan to retire from \n     politics any time soon.\n       The SPDC is rushing to implement its seven-point road map \n     towards ``democracy'' by reconvening on May 17 a national \n     convention to prepare a new constitution. The original \n     convention was aborted in 1996 after the SPDC expelled the \n     National League for Democracy for complaining that the \n     convention was being manipulated. The new convention will \n     just as likely be manipulated. First, holding the meeting in \n     a remote town called Mhawbi is meant to isolate and \n     intimidate opposition delegates. Moreover, the convention \n     commission will be made up only of SPDC officials, who will \n     completely control the agenda and procedures. The junta could \n     also use its notorious military rule, ``Order 5/96,'' to \n     suppress those who oppose its wishes. Certainly, that was \n     what it did the last time around.\n       The junta's hand-picked delegates are expected to ram \n     through 104 constitutional principles laid down in 1996 \n     before the last convention was scrapped. Those principles \n     include setting aside 25% of parliamentary seats for the \n     military, indirect election of the president through an \n     electoral college, the requirement that presidential \n     candidates have military experience, and total autonomy for \n     the military. They are a comprehensive list of military \n     prerogatives that make a mockery of any modern notion of \n     constitutionality. Thus, through a ``guided'' convention, the \n     SPDC's road map will lead to a ``disciplined'' political \n     form: a constitutional military autocracy.\n       Clearly, the SPDC's version of ``reform'' will continue to \n     be a disaster for Burmese. Its vision of democracy with dual \n     power centres in the form of a military commander-in-chief \n     and the president could easily become unstable because of the \n     intermittent power struggles that emerge within the military. \n     Its economic model won't bolster investors' faith. (Even the \n     Chinese have become frustrated with Burma's appalling \n     economic policies.) Dreams of Thai industrialists relocating \n     manufacturing plants to Burma will remain just that: \n     fantasies. And the continuing gross neglect of Burma's social \n     capital and a likely failure to stem the lucrative drug trade \n     will export instability from Burma to its neighbours.\n       A year ago, at a gathering in Bangkok of like-minded \n     individuals from 10 countries, there was the promise of a \n     start to building an effective regional strategy towards \n     Burma. The gathering, called the Bangkok Process, could have \n     sent a clear signal to the SPDC that its intentions were \n     unacceptable Sadly, the meeting chose to build on the earlier \n     constructive-engagement policy. Still, the damage could have \n     been minimized if the process had crafted a larger \n     international strategy by inviting the participation of the \n     United States, and provided the United Nations a stronger \n     mandate to mediate and enforce a democratic settlement in \n     Burma.\n       Today, only a democratic breakthrough can stop the looming \n     confrontations in Burma. Suu Kyi has been consistent in \n     offering a reasonable role for military leaders in jointly \n     transforming Burma into a democratic country. In 1990, the \n     Burmese military organized an election and supervised it; the \n     NLD won but the military refused to honour the results. Now \n     is the time finally to resolve this impasse. The key is to \n     assist negotiations in Burma for implementing this as-yet \n     unrealized national mandate in a way that provides shared \n     responsibility between the NLD, the military and ethnic \n     leaders. Compromise is needed to allow for a sharing of power \n     and responsibility in managing a democratic transition. All \n     this is clear. But what would not be helpful is for Burma's \n     neighbours to help efforts by the SPDC to strengthen and \n     prolong its rule. This would not be in the interest of anyone \n     in Asia, let alone Burma.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Dallas Morning News, May 2, 2004]\n\n                 Burma's Icon Still Needs World's Help\n\n                           (By Rena Pederson)\n\n       Back in 1995, Madeleine Albright went to Burma to visit \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, who was being held under arrest. Though \n     jailed in her own home, the Nobel Peace Prize winner showed \n     her respect for visiting secretary of state in a touching \n     way. She scrubbed the walls and floor of her house by hand \n     and washed and ironed the curtains by herself.\n       It is a good bet that few Nobel laureates have had to do \n     the same.\n       But, then, there is no one quite like Ms. Suu Kyi, the \n     brilliant Oxford graduate who continues to risk her life to \n     bring democracy to Burma.\n       Last week, Ms. Albright returned the favor. She joined \n     Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona in calling for a \n     renewal of American sanctions on the Burmese junta because \n     the murderous generals are keeping Ms. Suu Kyi under heavy \n     guard in her house yet again.\n       Fourteen Nobel literature laureates--including Gunter Grass \n     and Toni Morrison--recently joined Vaclav Havel, former \n     president of the Czech Republic, in calling for the release \n     of Ms. Suu Kyi and other imprisoned writers in Burma.\n       Like Ms. Albright, Mr. Havel has been inspired by Ms. Suu \n     Kyi's astounding courage and has been pressing for her \n     release for more than a decade. What is little known is that \n     he was considered the shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1991 after the ``Velvet Revolution'' in Czechoslovakia, but \n     he threw his support to Ms. Suu Kyi and forfeited his own \n     chances. Hers, he explained, was the greater example.\n       What we need is similar gallantry from Congress, which \n     should waste no time extending economic sanctions. What we \n     need is similar courage from the United Nations, which has \n     stood by while the Burmese generals slyly have made a fool of \n     Secretary-General Kofi Annan by reneging time and again on \n     promises of reform.\n       If Mr. Annan doesn't have enough problems with corruption \n     in the ``oil for food'' scandal in Iraq (which may include \n     payoffs to his son), his credibility is going to be damaged \n     even more when people start investigating his see-no-evil \n     attitude toward the Burmese regime.\n       Some of the tough questions that need to be asked include: \n     Why did Mr. Annan send an envoy to handle the Burma crisis \n     who was doing business deals with the regime? Mr. Annan's \n     envoy, Razali Ismail, has a contract to provide microchips \n     for Burmese passports. Amazingly, Mr. Annan has ruled that \n     the sweetheart deal isn't a conflict of interest because Mr. \n     Ismail was only a ``part-time'' envoy.\n       That's the diplomatic equivalent of passing the canapes. \n     Pray tell, why doesn't Mr. Annan bring the Burmese crisis up \n     before the Security Council? why has he merely purred that \n     the junta may allow democracy in 2006?\n       While Mr. Annan blinks and purrs, the horrific crimes of \n     the Burmese dictators continue without relief. Reports of war \n     crimes continue to seep out of Burma: The rape and torture of \n     women. The destruction of villages. Forced relocations. \n     The laying of new land mines. The murder of Muslim \n     minorities.\n       To make matters even more disturbing, the Far Eastern \n     Economic Review has reported that North Korea may be selling \n     missiles or nuclear technology to Burma. A Christian cemetery \n     near the Rangoon Airport reportedly was bulldozed last fall \n     to make way for the missile base.\n       It isn't a good time to keep passing the canapes.\n       As Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison put it last week, ``The brutal \n     tactics adopted by Burma's military rulers are reprehensible. \n     The Free World must be unequivocal in demanding the junta \n     release Aung San Suu Kyl and change its ways.''\n       There was a slight flutter of hope last week that the \n     Burmese generals might be edging toward a transition because \n     they allowed the reopening of the headquarters of\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\n     the National League for Democracy, Ms. Suu Kyi's political \n     party. They also released a few party leaders from prison.\n       But 1,300 remain in prison. and the top two leaders, Ms. \n     Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, remain under house arrest.\n       The junta's recent charm efforts couldn't mask the fact \n     that behind the scenes, the generals slapped life sentences \n     on 11 league members who are in prison. That is tantamount to \n     a death sentence in the grim Burmese gulag. The nine weren't \n     allowed to speak in their own defense. Their only crime was \n     witnessing an attack on Ms. Suu Kyi by government thugs last \n     May 30.\n       Even if Ms. Suu Kyi is released, she may be in greater \n     danger outside her home if the junta imposes a constitution \n     at gunpoint that leaves it in power. Congress must keep \n     sanctions in place until there's certifiable change. As \n     Margaret Thatcher would say, this is no time to go wobbly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4824-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CENTENNIAL OF WASHOE COUNTY PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all understand that books are one of the \ngreatest things ever created by human beings. Books bring the world \nwithin our reach, and they open the door of knowledge. Our Nation long \nago recognized the importance of books and reading. That is why we \ndeveloped a system of universal education, where every child would have \nan opportunity to learn how to read. And that is why we have public \nlibraries. One hundred years ago this month, on May 31, 1904, the city \nof Reno, NV opened its first public library. The building was \nconstructed on donated land, with a gift of $15,000 from Andrew \nCarnegie. Mr. Carnegie believed so strongly in public libraries that he \nbuilt more than 1600 of them around the world. That original library \nserved the city of Reno for 26 years. But as the town grew and the \npopularity of the library increased, more space was needed. In 1930, \nthe Reno Public library moved into the old State building in Powning \nPark. It also became affiliated at that time with Washoe County. Two \nyears later, the county also opened a library in the nearby city of \nSparks.\n  After World War II, as Washoe County began to experience more growth, \nthe library system expanded to keep up with the demand. Under the \nleadership of Portia Hawley Griswold, the first library ``bookmobile'' \nhit the road in the late 1950s, bringing books to remote areas of the \ncounty. A new main branch opened in downtown Reno in 1966, thanks to a \ngift from the Max C. Fleischmann Foundation.\n  As the library system added more new locations throughout the 1970s \nand 1980s, it also employed new innovations. A Senior Center library \nmade books more accessible to retirees, with volunteers delivering \nbooks to the homebound. The Gerlach High School branch launched a \npartnership between the county and the local school system. The Sierra \nView library was the first to open in a shopping center. Today, the \nWashoe County library system has branches in 12 locations, plus a \nmobile library. Citizens can also use the library's Internet branch to \nlook for books and conduct research for school assignments, business \nprojects, or simply to satisfy their curiosity. Last year the people of \nWashoe County visited the library system 1.4 million times and checked \nout almost 2 million items. As it has for the last 100 years, the \npublic library is meeting the needs of the people of Reno NV, and \nWashoe County. It puts books and knowledge within the reach of every \ncitizen.\n  This centennial of success calls for a celebration. So a gala \nbirthday party for the Washoe County library system will be held on May \n21.\n  Please join me in congratulating Library Director Nancy Cummings and \nthe trustees of the Washoe County library system--Chairman Bud Fujii, \nLucille Adin, June Burton, Paul Theiner and Paul Davis. Along with the \nWashoe County Commission, the Friends of the Washoe County Library, and \nthe Washoe County Library Foundation, they have continued to advance \nthe worthy goal that Andrew Carnegie embraced a century ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4824-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Two men harassed a white lesbian in Colorado as she left a 7-11 \nstore; one of them yelled an obscenity and called her a ``faggot.'' The \nvictim got into her own pickup truck and drove away, but the offenders \nfollowed her and eventually drove her off the road. When she got out of \nher car, the two men assaulted her sexually and beat her unconscious. A \ndetective who later interviewed the victim about the incident was \nverbally abusive, calling her a ``liar'' when she said she could not \nprovide a detailed description of her attackers.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4824-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4824-S4825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MALTREATMENT OF IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the American people know about the strong \nand honorable character of the American soldier. Over the last 228 \nyears, the United States Army has rightly earned the reputation of a \nprofessional fighting force that is courageous in battle and benevolent \nin peace.\n  The United States Army has had centuries to earn the respect of the \nAmerican people. The White House expected our military to earn the \ntrust of the Iraqi people in only months. Despite the outstanding \nservice of countless thousands of our troops, the shameful and \ndisgusting abuse of Iraqi prisoners at the hands of U.S. soldiers is a \ntragedy that must be corrected immediately.\n  The photographic evidence that Iraqi prisoners have been humiliated, \nabused, and mistreated is absolutely shocking. One can hardly ponder \nthe technicalities of the Geneva Conventions when the most basic rules \nof human decency have been violated. The disgust expressed by many \nAmericans has been amplified a thousand times by outraged Muslims \naround the world.\n  How long might it be before Osama bin Laden uses these incidents to \nwhip up anti-American sentiment in other corners of the world? After \nthe bloodiest month of the occupation of Iraq, this is news our Nation \ncan ill afford.\n  It is not clear at this point who should be held to account for this \nstain upon the reputation of our armed forces. No one has stepped \nforward to take responsibility for the conditions in Iraqi prisons. \nInstead, fingers are being pointed in every direction. Soldiers are \nblaming superior officers, and generals are blaming subordinates. \nOthers blame our intelligence services, which blame contractors, who \nblame others still. Some military leaders claim that this is an \nisolated incident, others make ominous claims about patterns of abuses. \nWith whom does this buck stop?\n  The Armed Services Committee today had a closed-door briefing from \nthree Army Generals. No civilian official of the Department of Defense \nappeared at the briefing, nor did any member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. I did not attend that briefing. Secret, closed door meetings on \na subject of such enormous import smack of damage control and cover-\nup--and that is the last impression the Senate should be conveying. We \nmust ensure that Congress accedes to no ground rules in its \ninvestigations that could further taint this deplorable situation.\n  The time for public hearings on prisons run by the U.S. Armed Forces \nis now. We must leave no room for charges that investigations are being \nglossed over, pushed aside, sat on, or ignored. I have written to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee to urge \nthem to call public hearings with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \nDirector of Central Intelligence George Tenet, and Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers. The Armed Services \nCommittee should also seek testimony from outside experts on the laws \nof war and humanitarian affairs, such as the International Committee \nfor the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, and scholars of international \nlaw.\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\n  These hearings should take place as soon as possible, and examine all \ndetention facilities run by the U.S. military, including those in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere. The abuse of Iraqi prisoners was covered \nfor months until it was reported by the news media. Congress has no \ntime to spare to find out what went wrong and what is still wrong, and \ntake action to prevent further abuse of prisoners in our charge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4825-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                           SPC Dennis Morgan\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

These \nvisas are used by a wide range of industries throughout the Nation to \nfill temporary labor needs. In my home State of Vermont, they are used \nprimarily by the tourist industry.\n  Across the country, businesses in a wide range of industries had \ndeveloped plans that relied on the foreign employees who had always \nbefore been available to them. For years, these employers had applied \nin the spring for the employees they needed for the summer, filling \npositions for which they were unable to find American workers. The cap \nhad never been reached, and they had no reason to believe this year \nwould be different. I know that the March announcement came as a shock \nto many employers in my State, and dozens of them contacted my office \nto see what could be done. This setback fell equally hard on employers \nin other States.\n  In response to these requests, I joined with a substantial bipartisan \ncoalition in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of 2004. Senator \nKennedy is the lead sponsor of the bill, which has 18 cosponsors, \nincluding eight Republicans. Our bill would add 40,000 visas for the \ncurrent fiscal year, providing relief to those summer-oriented \nbusinesses that had never even had the opportunity to apply for visas.\n  The following day, Senator Hatch introduced S. 2258, the Summer \nOperations and Services Relief and Reform Act. I do not believe that \nthis bill, cosponsored exclusively by Republicans, is as effective a \nbill as S. 2252, but I would support it if it came before the Senate. \nDespite its sponsorship by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and \nby the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, S. 2258 has now been \nheld hostage in the Republican cloakroom for 5 weeks.\n  Obtaining these visas takes weeks, if not months, because the \nDepartments of Labor and Homeland Security must both sign off on them. \nI and others have repeatedly warned that we needed to pass legislation \nby May 1 if we were going to provide meaningful relief. That date has \ncome and gone, and now it is too late to help many, if not all, of the \nbusinesses that had relied upon the availability of H-2B visas. It is \nbeyond disappointing that at the Republican leadership in this body \nignored my pleas and the pleas of so many Senators. And it is \ninexcusable that the Republican leadership ignored the pleas of \nbusiness owners across the country asking for this emergency relief.\n  And so it is that a tiny minority of the Republican caucus has \nmanaged to frustrate the will of a substantial bipartisan coalition of \nSenators who have sought to raise the H-2B cap, thereby needlessly \nharming businesses throughout the Nation. Meanwhile, the Republican \nleadership has failed to make solving this problem a priority. Perhaps \nif the majority leader chose to devote floor time to issues that had \nsubstantial bipartisan support, instead of using the floor to set up \nsymbolic votes whose results are known well in advance, we would not be \nin this position.\n  These businesses contribute much to the economies of our States. They \ndeserve better treatment than they have received at the hands of the \nRepublican leadership of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4825-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4825-S4826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD ASTHMA DAY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, May 4 is World Asthma Day. Today people \nfrom across the globe will raise awareness of asthma and its impact on \nthe lives of those millions of people who suffer from it. It should \nalso be the day we in government recall our duty to safeguard the \nhealth of all Americans.\n  Asthma is a lifetime disease. It is triggered by a variety of \nfactors, including allergens, cigarette smoke, viral infections, foods, \nweather changes, and air pollution. Air passages become inflamed, \nmaking it difficult for sufferers to breathe, and sometimes resulting \nin critical emergency situations. It is dangerous, and it is costly. \nOur country spends around $3.2 billion every year just to treat \nasthmatic children.\n  That is why I am particularly concerned that asthma is on the rise, \nand that polluting industries and cars are making matters worse. \nSeventeen million Americans suffer from asthma. It is the most common \nchronic health problem among our Nation's children, causing missed \nschool days, restricted activity, and costly medical bills. According \nto the American Lung Association, 9,000 children and 42,000 adults in \nWashington, DC alone have asthma.\n  Scientific research has increasingly linked air pollution from power \nplants and tailpipe exhaust to asthma. For example, researchers at the \nUniversity of Southern California recently discovered that children \nliving in high-ozone areas and participating in outdoor sports were \nthree times more likely to develop asthma than less active kids in less \npolluted areas. The scientists explain that children who exercise \noutdoors take in more of the dirty air than other kids, leaving them \nmore susceptible to airway damage.\n  A new report by the Harvard Center for Health and the Global \nEnvironment at Harvard Medical School expands\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nupon such research by linking global warming gases to increased \nincidence of allergies and asthma in the inner city. The report states \nthat rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, due mainly to fossil \nfuel combustion, not only trap more heat, but they promote greater \npollen and mold growth and associated asthma.\n  On World Asthma Day, the air may not be clear, but the message is: We \nmust immediately and dramatically reduce smog- and ozone-forming \npollution and global warming gases in order to protect public health. \nThe President's Clear Skies initiative won't do the job, neither will \nthe EPA's new administrative rules that just postpone real pollution \nreduction for a decade or more.\n  I urge the administration and the Congress to put aside partisan \ndifferences and polluters' special interests to protect the precious \nlives of those we represent. To live is to breathe. Until all Americans \ncan breathe freely, our work is not yet done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4826-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MOTORSPORTS FACILITIES FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting S. 1524, the Motorsports Facilities \nFairness Act.\n  S. 1524 would clarify the tax treatment of motorsports facilities, \ncodifying the 7-year depreciation classification that track owners have \nused, in good faith, for many years. This classification went without \nquestion in numerous audits and reviews until very recently. Now the \nIRS wants to implement a new interpretation of the law that would \nresult in a retroactive tax increase for motorsports facility owners.\n  This new interpretation would penalize the owners of motorsports \nentertainment facilities who have invested hundreds of millions of \ndollars in these properties in order to meet the demands of sanctioning \nbodies and racing fans. Technological changes and enhanced safety \nrequirements can render even recent track repair and reconstruction \nobsolete. Tracks must also compete to host premier racing events, in \npart by drawing as many fans as possible. This is why facilities must \nconstantly renovate, rebuild, upgrade and expand.\n  Darlington Raceway in South Carolina typifies this reinvestment \nethic. The track that is ``too touch to tame,'' is undergoing \nsubstantial upgrades. Earlier this year, Darlington installed ``SAFER'' \n(Steel And Foam Energy Reduction) barriers. The track is currently \ninstalling lighting for night racing, which will be completed before \nthe next running of the NASCAR Southern 500 in November.\n  S. 1524 would not only cover large facilities such as Darlington. The \nlegislation would also clarify the tax law for hundreds of tracks \naround the country, including approximately 30 other facilities in \nSouth Carolina alone.\n  The government should not punish these track owners for making \ncapital investments in their facilities. These investments provide \nsubstantial economic benefits for the communities where these \nfacilities are located.\n  Congress should promptly enact S. 1524 to provide certainty and \nclarity to the Tax Code and to encourage motorsports facility owners to \ncontinue to make economically beneficial investments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4826-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4826-S4827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING GOVERNMENT WORKERS NATIONWIDE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the hundreds of \nthousands of civilian and military employees who have chosen to \ndedicate their lives to public service. This week, from May 3 through \nMay 9, we celebrate Public Service Recognition Week. Organized by the \nPublic Employees Roundtable since 1985, this week allows us to honor \nthose who have chosen to serve their country and to educate the public \nabout the broad variety of services government provides.\n  President Kennedy once said: ``Let the public service be a proud and \nlively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our \nNation's government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with \npride and honor in future years: `I served the United States Government \nin that hour of our Nation's need.' '' Our Nation is most certainly in \na time of need. Great uncertainty exists about the state of world \nrelations, the direction our Nation is headed, and the economic welfare \nof our society. Unfortunately, the pride and honor associated with \npublic service has been diminished by a lack of respect. Rather than \ncommending the important work Federal civilian employees do side-by-\nside with our military employees, society too often seeks to belittle \ntheir contributions; choosing instead to characterize the civil service \nas a large, inflexible bureaucracy.\n  At the Federal level, we are experiencing a disturbing trend. The \nranks of bright, active, and well-trained Federal employees are slowly \ndiminishing. Of our 1.8 million Federal civil servants, 50 percent will \nbe eligible to retire over the next five years. At the same time, a \nnational poll by the Partnership for Public Service found that only one \nin four college-educated Americans expressed significant interest in \nworking for the Federal Government. A recent survey by the Council for \nExcellence in Government said that young people, while eager to find a \njob that will allow them to help people, are less likely to choose \ngovernment jobs than work in the non-profit sector.\n  In my view, however, if our young people understood the expertise, \nthe sacrifice, and the dedication required to serve the public, they \nwould be less inclined to belittle this calling and more inclined to \nanswer it. Young people should know, for instance, that civilian \nemployees from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Capitol Police and \nthe FBI worked side by side with the Coast Guard and the Marine Corps \nChemical Biological Incident Response Force from Indian Head, MD to \nrespond to the discovery of ricin in the Dirksen Senate Office \nBuilding.\n  Without the civilian Federal researchers at the Human Genome Project, \nwe would know much less about the make-up of the human body and, more \nimportantly, be much further away from providing cures to genetic \ndisorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Their work--a \ncomplete description of the draft of the DNA sequence of the human \ngenome--was completed faster than originally planned.\n  Without the hard work done by the civilian employees at the National \nSecurity Agency, we would likely be without a few things that today we \nconsider basic necessities, such as computers and cassette tapes. \nFurther, the development of more advanced theories and technologies \nsuch as quantum mathematics, nanotechnology, biometrics, and \nsemiconductors--which are quickly changing our world's technological \nlandscape--would have been hindered or never started but for the \nefforts of NSA's dedicated and innovative employees.\n  The employees at the National Institute of Standards and Technology's \nBuilding and Fire Research Laboratory are about as inconspicuous a \ngroup of researchers as exist. But without them there would be no \nstandard coupling for fire hoses or hydrants. If you do not know why \nthat's important, consider the devastating fire that destroyed 2,500 \nbuildings in an 80-block area in the heart of Baltimore in 1904. \nResponders came from fire departments in D.C., New York, and \nPhiladelphia to help put out the blaze. But each department's hoses had \ndifferent threads, so they could not be linked to Baltimore's hydrants, \nmaking them almost useless. After the fire, the Building and Fire \nResearch Laboratory's predecessor, the National Bureau of Standards, \nworked with the National Fire Prevention Association to develop \nnational standards and codes for fire equipment, which departments \nstill use today.\n  Finally, thanks to scientists at the National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nand the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, women's chances of detecting \novarian cancer earlier and possibly recovering have increased. Working \ntogether, NCI and FDA discovered that patterns of proteins found in \npatients' serum may reflect the presence of ovarian cancer, even at \nearly stages. Currently, more than 80 percent of ovarian cancer \npatients are diagnosed at a late clinical stage and have a 20 percent \nor less chance of survival. This research may increase those chances.\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n  During this Public Service Recognition Week, I urge my colleagues to \ntake a moment to appreciate advances such as these that our Nation and \nsociety have made as a result of the hard work of Federal civil \nservants. When President Kennedy initially released his Peace Corps \nproposal, the reactions he received convinced him that ``we have, in \nthis country, an immense reservoir of such men and women--anxious to \nsacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace \nand human progress.'' Things have not changed. The American populace is \nstill full of men and women who want to serve. The challenge for us, as \na Congress and a Federal Government, is to convince more of those men \nand women that civil service is a laudable way to serve their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4827-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RESCUE COST ANALYSIS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nexecutive summary and recommendations of the following August 2001 \nReport to Congress titled: ``Analysis of Cost Recovery for High-\naltitude Rescues on Mt. McKinley, Denali National Park and Preserve, \nAlaska'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExecutive Summary--Analysis of Cost Recovery for High-Altitude Rescues \n  on Mt. McKinley, Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, August, \n                                  2001\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The following report addresses the requirements of Public \n     Law 106-486 enacted November 9, 2000, directing the National \n     Park Service to complete a mountain climber rescue cost \n     recovery study by August 9, 2001. This report describes the \n     role of the National Park Service and Denali National Park \n     and Preserve (DNP) in search and rescue activities and \n     analyzes the suitability and feasibility of recovering the \n     costs of high-altitude rescues on Mt. McKinley. It addresses \n     the three items required in the legislation.\n       (1) Recovering the costs of rescues on Mt. McKinley.\n       (2) Requiring climbers to provide proof of medical \n     insurance before the issuance of a climbing permit.\n       (3) Charging for a climbing permit and changing the fee \n     structure. This report was prepared with existing funds.\n       A variety of organizations and individuals were involved in \n     the development of this report. They included: the National \n     Park Service, Alaska Regional Office and Washington Office; \n     American Alpine Club; 210th Alaska Air National Guard; U.S. \n     Army at Fort Wainwright; Mountain Guide Concessionaires; \n     Access Fund; Alaska Mountain Rescue Association; Alaska State \n     SAR Coordinator; Providence, Valley, and Alaska Regional \n     Hospitals; Mountain Rescue Association; and the Alaska \n     Mountaineering Club.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       After a thorough analysis of the suitability and \n     feasibility of cost recovery, this report recommends the \n     following:\n     Part One: The Suitability and Feasibility of Rescue Cost \n         Recovery\n       1. Based on the relationship of DNP to the national \n     program for National Park Service search and rescue, the \n     relationship to the practices of other agencies, the \n     practices of the military, and the practices of the State of \n     Alaska, the Park Service recommends that the current policy \n     of not charging for search and rescue be continued. If the \n     other federal agencies and the military develop a policy for \n     the collection of search and rescue costs from participants \n     in high risk activities, the National Park Service should \n     also participate. This would best be done through the passage \n     of legislation that applies to all federal agencies and \n     branches of the military that currently rescue members of the \n     public in need.\n       2. To reduce National Park Service costs related to \n     evacuation of injured climbers, the park will work with \n     Providence Hospital in Anchorage regarding additional \n     operation by the hospital of its Lifeguard helicopter to \n     transport injured climbers from the 7,200-foot base camp on \n     Mt. McKinley. Like most ambulance services, the hospital \n     bills the patient directly for the service. This would reduce \n     the use of military and NPS helicopters for a service that \n     can be provided by a private entity.\n     Part Two: Suitability and Feasibility of Requiring Proof of \n         Medical Insurance\n       1. The review of incidents shows no information indicating \n     a problem of any magnitude. DNP, therefore, recommends not \n     requiring proof of medical insurance at this time. DNP will \n     continue to monitor with the hospitals and work with \n     insurance companies to determine if a need exists in the \n     future to require proof of insurance. If proof of medical \n     insurance were to be made a new requirement, it would be best \n     to set the precedent consistent across agencies and different \n     types of high-risk activities.\n       2. DNP will encourage climbers to carry medical insurance \n     and will provide information with registration packets and \n     pre-climb briefings about access to providers specializing in \n     climbing insurance.\n     Part Three: Climber Registration Fee Review\n       1. In order to help recover costs for the human waste \n     management studies, an additional $50.00 fee should be added \n     to the current $150.00 climber registration fee. The total \n     fee for climbing Mt. McKinley or Mt. Foraker would then be \n     $200.00.\n       2. Currently, only climbers of Mt. McKinley and Mt. Foraker \n     are required to register. Initiate required registration for \n     all other climbers in DNP This would help ensure all \n     climbers receive safety and waste management information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4827-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Christopher Hutcherson of Biloxi is accused of capital murder in the \nJanuary stabbing death of John Brown Smith III, 39, of Fort Walton \nBeach, FL. A detective testified that Hutcherson told investigators \nthat he stabbed Smith because the retired military man made sexual \nadvances while holding a gun on him. The detective said Smith and \nHutcherson were at an adult video arcade, known as a gay pick-up place, \nthe morning of the killing. Hutcherson told investigators that he left \nthe video store and went to Smith's nearby hotel room. The two men \ndrank alcohol before leaving the hotel in Smith's pickup. Smith's body \nwas later found on the rural road by a passerby.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4827-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WMD RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, speaking before the UN General Assembly in \nSeptember, President Bush asked the Security Council to take a firm \nstand against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, WMD. \nPresident Bush asked for a Security Council resolution that would call \non all nations to criminalize proliferation, enact strict export \ncontrols and secure these terrible weapons within their own borders.\n  Seven months later, on April 28, the UN Security Council unanimously \npassed Resolution 1540 fulfilling the President's goals. Those who have \nargued that this administration has turned its back on the \ninternational community need only look at the diverse group of \nnations--from Algeria to Angola, Chile to China, Pakistan to the \nPhilippines--that stood with the United States in this important battle \nin the war on terror to dispel such notions.\n  It is now up to the members of the United Nations to follow the \nSecurity Council lead and enact the provisions that will help stem the \nflow of dangerous weapons and technology.\n  This resolution is the culmination of the administration's hard work, \nled by Under Secretary of State John Bolton, to halt the proliferation \nof chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The President's \nproliferation security initiative, launched last March, embodies these \nefforts. It has brought together nations from North America, Europe, \nAfrica, and Asia to interdict shipments of WMD around the world. This \nresolution endorses such important collective action and I urge all \nnations to join in the effort.\n  I applaud the administration and the Security Council for helping \ntake an important step to building a safer, more secure world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4827-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4827-S4828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOMEFRONT HEROES\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize today as \nthe National Day to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and want to thank the \nNational Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy for sponsoring it. The \ncampaign is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to \nimprove the well-being of children and families by reducing teen \npregnancy.\n  Nearly 900,000 American teenagers become pregnant each year, and over \n10 percent of all births in the United States are to teenage mothers. \nWhile teen pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates are all going down, the \nU.S. still has the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the industrialized \nworld. Almost 35 percent of girls become pregnant at least once before \nage 20.\n  Many activities are happening across the country in recognition of \nthe National Day to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. In my home State of \nCalifornia, Pinch Me Films of Berkeley is organizing events to promote \nopen dialogue between young people, parents and educators. In addition, \nthe California Health Collaborative, Merced Rural Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention is hosting a health fair for youth, and the Children's \nHospital of Los Angeles--with over 6,000 employees--will have an \narticle about National Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month in its employee \nnewsletter, highlighting tips for parents to discuss pregnancy \nprevention.\n  On November 25, 2003, I introduced S. 1956, The HOPE Youth Pregnancy \nPrevention Act to address this problem. Specifically my bill would \nprovide additional resources to States, localities, and nongovernmental \norganizations for teenage pregnancy prevention activities targeted to \nethnic minorities and at-risk youth. Fifty-one percent of Latina girls \nbecome pregnant at least once by age 20. Fifty-seven percent of black \ngirls become pregnant at least once by age 20. I urge my colleagues to \nco-sponsor this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support activities that are taking place \nnationally and in their own States to reduce teenage pregnancy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4828-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JAMES AND SOPHIA TARABICOS' 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Jim \nand Sophia Tarabicos, who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on \nFebruary 28, 2004.\n  As Jim and Sophia celebrate this milestone in their lives, they will \nsurely reflect on the many changes, successes and accomplishments they \nhave experienced together over the last fifty years. Theirs is a \njourney of which they can be proud.\n  Jim is the son of the late Harilaos and Alexandra Tarabicos. Jim \nattended high school in his hometown of Nafpaktos, Greece. He came to \nWilmington, DE at the young age of 19 to work at his uncle's \nrestaurant, Presto, located at 817 Market Street in downtown \nWilmington. His wife, Sophia, is the daughter of the late Louis and \nGeorgia Liarakos. She is a native Delawarean who graduated from P.S. \nDuPont High School and studied at the University of Delaware.\n  Jim and Sophia met at a church event when they were 19 and 17 \nrespectively. They married two years later on February 28, 1954 at Holy \nTrinity Greek Orthodox Church in Wilmington in front of their friends \nand family.\n  For over 40 years, Jim and Sophia dedicated their lives to one \nanother and to their businesses. They opened their first store, a \nluncheonette named Jim's Place at 8th and Orange Streets in Wilmington \nin the mid 1950s. Several years later, they bought Presto Restaurant \nfrom their uncle. They later changed the name to Tarabicos. Jim and \nSophia were committed to the success of their restaurant. Owning their \nown business allowed them to spend valuable time with each other, while \nat the same time being devoted parents, and major contributors to their \nneighbors, community, and church. They retired a decade ago, and \ncontinue to remain active members of their community.\n  Jim and Sophia consider their church to be like a second family. Jim \nwas the president of the parish council for Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox \nChurch from 1971 to 1973. While Jim was president, plans were made to \nmove forward with approving the construction of the community center \nand the design, financing and use thereof. Sophia is a member of the \nPhiloptochos Greek Ladies Society and served as president from 1981 to \n1983.\n  In addition to the restaurants and church activities, Jim and Sophia \nwere also quite involved with political activities, committees, and \nfundraisers in the City of Wilmington and were active with the city's \nmerchants association. In their spare time, they enjoy taking walks \ntogether at Bellevue State Park, and traveling, especially taking \ncruises.\n  They are blessed with three children, Larry, Alexandra, and \nGeorgiean, and six grandchildren, Kristin, Sophia Alyssa, Maria, Sophia \nElaina, Michael and Dimitri. They are devoted to each other and to \ntheir families. Jim and Sophia are active in their children's and \ngrandchildren's lives, often traveling to visit family members and \nspending meaningful time with their grandchildren and passing on to \nthem valuable life lessons. They enjoy attending all of their various \nschool functions\n  Today, I rise to congratulate Jim and Sophia on their 50th wedding \nanniversary. Both have shown great service and commitment to their \nfamily and to their community. They serve as true role models. I know \nthat their years together hold many beautiful memories. It is my hope \nthat those ahead will be filled with continued joy. I wish them both \nthe very best in all that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4828-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4828-S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITY OF PADUCAH\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to pay tribute to the city of Paducah and their innovative and \nsuccessful Artist Relocation Program.\n  The program is a past recipient of a Kentucky Governor's Award for \ncontribution to arts in the State. The city has even been recognized by \nFirst Lady Laura Bush as part of the Preserve America Initiative. Most \nrecently, the city was honored by the American Planning Association at \ntheir April\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\n2004 national convention in Washington, DC. The Special Community \nInitiative award is given annually to a city displaying an innovative \napproach to improvement. This year there were over 200 cities competing \nfor this honor.\n  The City of Paducah Artist Relocation Program recruits artists--both \nlocally and nationally--to move to Paducah's downtown and historic \nLower Tower area. The city has a long history providing many buildings \nand facilities that, while they are in disrepair, offer significant \nopportunity for renovation and improvement. Artists who relocate to \nPaducah are given a network of resources to restore facilities.\n  The program is part of a long-term project to rejuvenate the City of \nPaducah's historic districts. Through the combined efforts of leaders \nin the city government, the Paducah Bank, Visitors' Bureau, PATS, local \nmuseums and businesses this program has seen tremendous success.\n  The city and Commonwealth are already enjoying the benefits as an \nestimated $12 to $15 million has been infused into the local economy, \nthanks to this program. Any visitor can see the construction and \nrevitalization underway in this Kentucky jewel.\n  I wish to congratulate the leadership and vision of the City of \nPaducah on these tremendous honors, especially Program Founder Mark \nBarone, City of Paducah Planning Director Tom Barnett, City of Paducah \nMayor Bill Paxton and McCracken County Judge Executive Danny Orazine. I \nlook forward to the continued success of this great program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4829-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ACADEMIC DECATHLON WIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise to \nacknowledge El Camino Real High School's championship win in this \nyear's national Academic Decathlon. El Camino Real High School is \nlocated in Woodland Hills, CA. This is El Camino's third win and marks \nthe most national titles any California student group has ever \nreceived. It is a wonderful record of which to be proud, and I extend \nmy heartiest congratulations to everyone who made this accomplishment \npossible.\n  The Academic Decathlon is highly competitive, testing the students in \n10 different subjects. The El Camino team headed to Boise, Idaho to \ncompete against more than 300 students from 39 other American high \nschools and one Canadian high school to clinch the national title.\n  Under the leadership and tutelage of three main coaches, Melinda \nOwen, Mark Johnson and Rebecca Gessert, the team of eight students \ncollectively spent more than 1,200 hours this year to prepare for the \ncompetition, including intense cramming sessions as the big event drew \ncloser. These students sacrificed much of their free time to represent \ntheir school, and it is clear that their work paid off.\n  I could not be happier for or prouder of the El Camino team, \nincluding Cassidy Ellis, Gary Fox, Jonathan Lin, Patrick Liu, Eric \nRasyidi, Adam Singer, Chris Taylor, and Adrian Wittenberg. They have \nmade their school, their district, and our entire State proud, and they \nhave every reason to celebrate their accomplishment.\n  The students could not have won their title without the help of their \ndedicated coaches. I also salute and congratulate all the teachers, \nfaculty, and students at El Camino who worked with this team and gave \nthem the support they needed to achieve their goals.\n  Congratulations again to El Camino Real High School on this wonderful \nwin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4829-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CAMILLE SCHMIDT\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

This honor is \nconferred on only one high school student and one mid-level student in \neach State. I applaud Camille's efforts to improve her community.\n  Camille has spent the past 2 years working to restore windows in her \nschool's library that were removed in the early 1980s. When Camille \nbegan attending Pocatello High School, she noticed 8-foot-tall indents \nin the school walls and realized they were once windows. She found \nyearbooks that contained pictures of the school before the windows were \ntaken out, and was inspired to restore them. She received approval to \nbegin working on the restoration from the superintendent, and met with \nan architect to discuss the project. So far, Camille has raised more \nthan $10,000 of the needed $15,000 for the project. To raise the \nnecessary funds, she has distributed brochures, spoken at class \nreunions and student assemblies, contacted the news media, and even \nobtained a grant. To date, four of the eight windows have been \nreplaced. Next year, the student government and the National Honor \nSociety will take over the project until all of the school's windows \nare restored.\n  Camille has demonstrated an extraordinary level of commitment and \naccomplishment and deserves our admiration and respect. She has played \nan important role in her community and serves as an example to her \npeers.

This honor is \nconferred on only one high school student and one mid-level student in \neach State.

When she was nine, Jacqueline noticed a \ngroup of children shivering in the cold outside of a rescue mission. \nMoved by the experience, Jacqueline packed up her winter clothes for \ndonation, along with her saved-up allowance of $275 to take to the \nshelter. With the help of her parents, she then placed collection boxes \nin her school and government buildings. She also solicited donations \nfrom her neighbors and appealed to her entire community for help \nthrough the news media. Jacqueline summed up my feelings well, when she \nsaid, ``I know that no matter what age you are, you can make a \ndifference.''\n  Jacqueline has demonstrated an extraordinary level of commitment and \naccomplishment and deserves our admiration and respect.

STEWART\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of a \ndistinguished civil servant, Bill Stewart, who passed away on Monday, \nFebruary 16, 2004. His long life was filled with acts of conscientious \nservice on behalf of his friends, his family members and the American \nwork force. The contributions he made through his work for the National \nLabor Relations Board, combined with the many lives he touched along \nthe way, leave behind a positive legacy that will not soon be \nforgotten.\n  Bill was born in Terre Haute, IN, and earned his undergraduate degree \nin government from Indiana University. As an ROTC student during his \ntime at Indiana University, Bill was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the Army shortly after his graduation. Proving at a young \nage that service and leadership were an inherent part of his life and \npersonality, Bill deferred his full scholarship to the Indiana \nUniversity School of Law to serve in Germany in an armored division \nwhere he was later selected to be the courts and boards officer and \nassistant adjutant of a combat command of more than 5,000 men. Bill \nexcelled in everything he set his mind to, including his work as an \nattorney for the Atomic Energy Commission and his efforts climbing up \nthe\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nladder from legislative assistant to president of the Professional \nAssociation for the National Labor Relations Board in only 4 years.\n  His talent and intellect earned him the respect and attention of \nmany. Bill was the first and only National Relations Board employee to \nreceive the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian \nService, which is the highest honor attainable through civil service. \nPresident Clinton recognized Bill's ``unparalleled'' professional \ncontributions, emphasizing that Bill was ``instrumental in winning \nnational labor law cases that have had a major impact on American \nworkers.''\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, I am told that Bill \nwas also a family man at heart. According to his friends and \ncolleagues, Bill cherished the company of his loved ones and always \nmade his parents and siblings a top priority. Undoubtedly, Bill will be \nremembered by all who knew him for his love of life and laughter.\n  Bill is survived by his two brothers, Stanley Stewart and Richard \nStewart.\n  Bill was a man who walked with kings but never lost the common touch. \nThe citizens of the State of Indiana and the United States of America \nwere well served by the life led by Bill Stewart. He touched many lives \nover the course of his career and will be remembered as a loving friend \nand an incredible leader and colleague.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of William R. Stewart in the \nofficial Record of the United States Senate. May God be with all who \nmourn his passing, as I know He is with Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING FRANK D.

Stimley leaves behind a legacy \nof accomplishments and contributions to the State and people of \nMississippi.\n  Frank was a native of Jackson, MI. Early in life, he turned down an \nopportunity to play major league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals \nto attend Columbia University, where he received a bachelors degree in \nelectrical engineering. He later joined his sister and older brother at \nHarvard Law School, where the Stimleys became the first family to ever \nhave three siblings attend that law school at the same time. In \naddition to his law degree, Frank concurrently obtained a masters in \nbusiness administration from Harvard Business School.\n  After graduation, Frank Stimley became the first African-American \nlawyer to be hired by a large majority white firm in Mississippi. He \nalso became the first African-American lawyer at Wise Carter Child \nStein and Caraway to make partner.\n  Frank was also a member of the 100 Black Men of Jackson, Deacon at \nthe Progressive Morningstar Baptist Church, and involved in providing \nlegal assistance to Stewpot Community Services, Catholic Charities, the \nFarish Street Redevelopment Project, and the Friends and Children of \nUnited Way. Additionally, Frank Stimley helped secure financing for \nmany churches, Head Start programs, medical clinics, the Jackson \nRedevelopment Authority, and various Mississippi development projects.\n  Frank Stimley was a successful lawyer and community leader whose \ncontributions were considerable. We extend to his wife Cynthia and the \nentire Stimley family our sincerest condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4830-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A DELAWARE, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL LEADER\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it gives me great pride and pleasure \ntoday to rise and honor a Delaware jurist who is a recognized leader \nnot only in his native State of Delaware, but throughout this country \nand around the world. His name is Randy Holland.\n  Justice Holland has served on the Delaware Supreme Court since 1986, \nwith the distinction of being the youngest person ever to serve on my \nState's highest court. And for the past four years, he has served as \nthe National President of the American Inns of Court. His second term \nends next week, and I rise today to commend his leadership to this \nprestigious legal society.\n  Justice Holland's stewardship of the American Inns of Court, with its \nroots dating back to England in the 1400s, has earned him an \nextraordinary, rare and high honor.\n  He is only the third American judge to recently receive this \nprestigious award. The other two are United States Supreme Court \nJustices.\n  Lincoln's Inn of London, England, announced that Justice Holland has \nbeen elected an Honorary Master of the Bench. The Honorary ``Benchers'' \nare persons of distinction selected from common law countries around \nthe world. The only American judges to receive this high recognition \nand distinction are Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens \nof the United States Supreme Court and now Justice Holland.\n  In commenting upon Justice Holland's election, William Blair, a \ndistinguished Barrister, President of the Commercial Bar Association in \nEngland, and brother of Prime Minister Tony Blair, stated ``We feel \nthat this is an important mark of friendship between the Inns of Court \nof England and the American Inns of Court. What is most gratifying for \nus is that the common aims of the organization are ethics, civility, \nprofessionalism and legal excellence--which are surely more necessary \nnow than ever. My fellow Benchers were greatly impressed by Justice \nHolland's distinguished judicial record.''\n  To put this honor in context, Lincoln's Inn is the oldest of the four \nInns of Court in London. Its formal records date back continuously to \n1422. For six centuries, the Inns of Court in London have educated \nEnglish trial lawyers, who are known as Barristers.\n  St. Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, joined Lincoln's Inn in \n1496. The chapel bell at Lincoln's Inn came from Spain in 1596 as part \nof the spoils of Cadiz. When Dr. John Donne was Preacher to Lincoln's \nInn in 1624, he wrote his famous poem ``for whom the bell tolls.''\n  Along with this international honor, Justice Holland has been \nrecognized by his fellow jurists and attorneys in this country. His \nnumerous awards include: the 1992 Judge of the Year Award from the \nNational Child Support Enforcement Association, the 2002 Alumni Award \nof Merit from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, the 2003 \nAmerican Judicature Society's Herbert Harley Award, and the 2004 \nWidener Law School Adjunct Professor Distinguished Service Award.\n  Ethics and mentoring are the hallmarks of Justice Holland's service \non the bench and his call to his fellow attorneys in the bar. He \nchaired the national Advisory Committee to the American Judicature \nSociety's Center for Judicial Ethics and currently he chairs the \nAmerican Bar Association national Joint Committee on Lawyer Regulation. \nJustice Holland is also a member of the American Law Institute and is \nan adjunct professor at several law schools.\n  In addition to these many accomplishments, Justice Holland has \npublished three books on the history of the Delaware Constitution and \nthe Delaware Supreme Court.\n  Of course, Justice Holland will tell you that he derives his greatest \npride from his family--his wife and friend since grade school, Ilona, \nand his son, Ethan.\n  Justice Holland deserves a tremendous thank you for his leadership on \nthe bench and bar--from Delaware, attorneys throughout this country, \nand indeed from jurists and barristers worldwide. \nCongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4830-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4830-S4831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     2003 PRESIDENTIAL RANK AWARDS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last week, 70 members of the Federal \nGovernment's Senior Executive Service and Senior Level and Scientific \nand Professional employees received the Nation's highest civil service \naward for their leadership accomplishments and long-term contributions \nto their country.\n  I believe it is fitting to honor these men and women during Public \nService Recognition Week, which began yesterday, May 3, 2004. As noted \nby the Office of Personnel Management, ``Winners of this prestigious \naward are strong leaders, professionals, and scientists who achieve \nresults and consistently demonstrate strength, integrity, industry,\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nand a relentless commitment to excellence in public service.'' To me, \nthese awards serve as a reminder that the federal civil service is made \nup of individuals who have chosen to work for the federal government \nand their betterment of their fellow citizens.\n  This year marks the first time that Senior Level and Scientific and \nProfessional executives joined those in the Senior Executive Service in \nreceiving awards. The winners, who were honored at a dinner sponsored \nby the Senior Executives Association Professional Development League \nlast week, have saved the Federal Government over $187 billion \naccording to SEA President Carol A. Bonosaro. At last week's dinner, \nMs. Bonosaro detailed notable achievements of the award recipients: \nincluding leading a deployment to Kosovo to gather evidence of war \ncrimes in support of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia; managing 15 nutrition assistance programs--with $40 billion \nin apropriations--which reach 50 million Americans annually; serving as \na Space Shuttle astronaut pilot and commander; directing the \nprosecution of international cartels with fines totaling more than $42 \nbillion and the convictions of corporate executives from the U.S. and \ntwelve foreign countries; and serving as the scientific leader of a $2 \nbillion telescope mission, to be launched in 2010, with the objective \nof seeing the first light in the universe released after the Big Bang.\n  There are two categories of rank awards; distinguished and \nmeritorious awards. For both awards, winners are chosen through a \nrigorous selection process which includes nomination by their agency \nheads, evaluation by boards of private citizens, and approval by the \nPresident. Distinguished rank award recipients receive a lump-sum \npayment of 35 percent of their base pay. Meritorious rank award \nrecipients receive 20 percent of base pay.\n  At a time when many young people are questioning the value of public \nservice, I urge them to explore the exciting and challenging employment \nopportunities with the federal government, as well as the benefits of \nserving their nation. As the Presidential Rank Awards demonstrated, the \ngovernment values those who seek public service.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the names and agencies of the 2003 \nPresidential Rank Award winners be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows.\n\n  2003 Presidential Rank Awards for Distinguished Senior Professionals\n\n\n                         department of commerce\n\n       Susan Solomon\n\n\n                         department of defense\n\n     Office of the Secretary of Defense\n       John A.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the State's military bases; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8039\n\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense's military installations \n     in Washington State play a vital role in the defense of the \n     United States of America and its citizens and residents, both \n     providing a power projection platform ideally situated \n     geographically and by providing leadership within the \n     military through innovation in transformational efforts; and\n       Whereas, the military installations in Washington State are \n     striving to perform their current missions as efficiently and \n     effectively as possible and to improve their ability to \n     contribute to the defense of the nation for the long term; \n     and\n       Whereas, the majority of major conflicts of the 20th \n     century have been in or around the Pacific Ocean, including \n     World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation \n     Desert Storm, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the emerging \n     threats of the 21st century are in that same area; and\n       Whereas, each of the military installations in Washington \n     performs vital strategic functions, including the only \n     homeport for Trident Ballistic Missile Submarines on the \n     Pacific Coast, the only torpedo manufacturing facility in the \n     nation, the only deep draft military shipyard on the Pacific \n     Coast, a major base for C-17 aircraft, the sole Air Force \n     Survival School in the nation, the only major Army \n     installation west of the Rocky mountains capable of large \n     scale troop deployment, and the base with the highest number \n     of VFR flying days of any Naval Air Station in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Washington State has an excellent working \n     relationship at both the state and local level with each of \n     the military installations, demonstrated in part by the \n     numerous partnerships among the military and local \n     governments and private and nonprofit sectors in providing \n     services to both military and civilian personnel, by \n     involvement of military installations in state and local land \n     use, transportation and other planning, and by the ongoing \n     community support to the military personnel and their \n     families; and\n       Whereas, the military's presence, in all forms, contributes \n     greatly to the economy, security, and social fabric of \n     Washington State as one of the largest employers in the \n     state, a significant purchaser of goods, services, and \n     construction from the private sector, and a source of \n     leadership in state, local, and community organizations; and\n       Whereas, Washington State consistently provides a high \n     quality of life to military personnel stationed in our state, \n     evidenced by the large number of terminal postings to bases \n     in Washington State, additionally, our state benefits from \n     the large number of skilled and talented military personnel \n     and their families who remain in or return to Washington \n     after leaving active duty; and\n       Whereas, the Washington State Legislature recognizes the \n     importance of the Department of Defense's military \n     installations\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n     within Washington State, both to the defense of the United \n     States and the vitality of Washington as an economy and a \n     people;\n       Now, Therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the President, Congress, and the Department of Defense will \n     recognize the strategic importance of these bases to our \n     Nation's security and not make them victims of this round of \n     the Base Realignment and Closure process.\n       Your Memorialists further pray that the military facilities \n     in Washington state will continue to serve in the defense of \n     our nation for many years to come; be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United State, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, the \n     President of the Untied States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from \n     the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-398. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to The 211 Act, HR 3111, and SB \n     1630; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4040\n\n       Whereas, tens of thousands of Washington State residents \n     have a need to access a variety of human and social service \n     needs each day, ranging from appropriate child care to \n     affordable housing, support for a homebound parent to food or \n     crisis counseling for teen parents; and\n       Whereas, thousands of different local, regional, and \n     statewide organizations in Washington State, both public and \n     private, provide services that respond to these needs; and\n       Whereas, it is often extremely difficult and time consuming \n     for residents to identify and access available services; and\n       Whereas, the process of connecting those living and working \n     in Washington State with needed services can be simplified by \n     the establishment of a 211 telephone dialing option; and\n       Whereas, the local, regional, and statewide providers of \n     human and social services would benefit from the more \n     accurate and timely information about needs and resources \n     around the state that is connected by 211 services; and\n       Whereas, seventy million Americans (23% of the United \n     States population) have access to 211 service in 83 \n     communities nationwide; and\n       Whereas, Washington Information Network 211 seeks to create \n     a statewide 211 system using existing information and \n     referral providers; and\n       Whereas, in 2003 the Washington State Legislature \n     overwhelmingly supported and passed an act supporting 211 \n     development and implementation for the residents of our \n     state; and\n       Whereas, 211 service will soon be available in Clark County \n     and King County, providing 211 access to over 2,000,000 \n     people in Washington State; and\n       Whereas, 4,000,000 residents in rural and economically \n     depressed areas of Washington State will not have access to \n     211 service until such time that sustainable public funding \n     is secured; and\n       Whereas, philanthropic contributions already support the \n     majority of costs associated with 211 development for \n     Washington State; and\n       Whereas, Congress recognizes the value and broad public \n     benefits of 211 through the inclusion of 211 service in the \n     Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and \n     Response Act of 2002; and\n       Whereas, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, \n     Representative Jay Inslee, Representative Jim McDermott, and \n     Representative Rick Larsen from our fair state of Washington \n     are cosponsors of Senate Bill 1630 and House Resolution 3111;\n       Now, therefore, your memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress immediately pass the Calling for 211 Act, HR 3111 \n     and SB 1630: be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the exemption of the \n     Passamaquoddy Tribe from certain provisions of the Marine \n     Mammal Protection Act of 1972; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-first Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the Second Special Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the Congress of the United States as follows:\n       Whereas, the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 \n     establishes federal responsibility to conserve marine mammals \n     and established a moratorium on the taking and importation of \n     marine mammals and marine mammal products; and\n       Whereas, the act gave certain exemptions to take marine \n     mammals to Indian, Aleut and Eskimo people who live in Alaska \n     and dwell on the coast of the North Pacific Ocean or the \n     Arctic Ocean, if the taking is done in a nonwasteful manner \n     and is for subsistence purposes or for creating and selling \n     authentic native handicrafts and clothing; and\n       Whereas, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, a federally recognized \n     Indian tribe in the State of Maine, the first to see the \n     rising sun each day, has the largest reservation in the \n     State, situated on the west branch of the St. Croix River, \n     which leads into the sea; and\n       Whereas, the Passamaquoddy Tribe has used marine mammals, \n     such as porpoises and seals, for cultural, subsistence, \n     ceremonial, medicinal and commercial uses in its long history \n     in the area, and still do to a certain extent today; and\n       Whereas, at the time the federal Marine Mammal Protection \n     Act of 1972 was written, the Passamaquoddy Tribe had not been \n     federally recognized and could not seek exemption from the \n     act. In the late 1970s, federal recognition came, followed by \n     the Maine Indian Land Claims Case, which defined a special \n     relationship between the State of Maine and the Passamaquoddy \n     Tribe and Penobscot Nation; and\n       Whereas, it was agreed that these tribes would have \n     authority over their own internal matters on the \n     reservations. At the same time, it was agreed that they would \n     continue the trust relationship with the Federal Government \n     that had been recognized during the 1970s; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That we, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people of the State, in view of the trust that the \n     Passamaquoddy Tribe has in the Federal Government, \n     respectfully urge and request that the Congress of the United \n     States give serious consideration to giving the Passamaquoddy \n     Tribe of Maine a cultural exemption from the federal Marine \n     Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as was done for the Alaskan \n     Indian, Aleut and Eskimo peoples; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate and to the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives and to each \n     member of the Marine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-400. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the use of 75-foot crib carrier log hauling \n     equipment; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 168\n\n       Whereas, in the logging industry, an important industry for \n     the state of Michigan, the crib carrier for log hauling \n     offers an advancement that can increase the stability of \n     loads with a new design for how the logs are arranged. In a \n     highly competitive industry like lumbering, the new equipment \n     represents significant progress; and\n       Whereas, current federal law places a 70-foot limit on the \n     length of trucks, although a waiver has permitted the use of \n     75-foot equipment over the past couple of years. Until \n     federal laws and regulations permit the use of a 75-foot \n     truck length, sanctions will prevent the use of safer truck-\n     trailer combinations; and\n       Whereas, the 75-foot equipment offers distinct safety \n     measures not available through the 70-foot limit currently in \n     place. Most importantly, the crib arrangement makes the load \n     more secure, with added protection against a shifting cargo. \n     This enhances safety along Michigan's roads; now, therefore, \n     bit it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the United \n     States Department of Transportation to permit the use of 75-\n     foot crib carrier log hauling equipment; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Department of Transportation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-401. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan relative to a \n     minimum rate of return of Michigan's Federal Transportation \n     Funding; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 198\n\n       Whereas, from 1956 to 2001 Michigan residents paid $1.71 \n     billion dollars more in gas tax money to the federal \n     government than they received in return. Only three states \n     have a worse return rate than Michigan for that period; and\n       Whereas, Michigan faces a difficult task in maintaining a \n     transportation network that meets the many needs of the \n     individuals and businesses of this state. This task is made \n     much more formidable by the continuing inequity of the \n     percentage of funds returned to the state; and\n       Whereas, the federal road funding act, the Transportation \n     Equity Act of the 21st Century (TEA-21), expired on February \n     29, 2004; and\n       Whereas, the House Surface Transportation Extension Act of \n     2004, signed by President Bush on February 29, 2004, extends \n     highway, safety, transit, and other programs until April 30, \n     2004; and\n       Whereas, the United States House of Representatives and the \n     United States Senate each have bills pending to authorize a \n     new funding system for the states; and\n       Whereas, in 2003, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1, House \n     Concurrent Resolution No. 5, and House Resolution No. 9 all \n     memorialized the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     minimum rate of return of 95 percent of Michigan's federal \n     transportation\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n     funding for highway and transit programs. As the federal \n     government works on the next budget, it is imperative that \n     this issue be kept before policymakers at every level to \n     achieve this long overdue measure of equity, now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     minimum return rate of 95 percent of Michigan's federal \n     transportation funding for highway and transit programs to \n     bring greater fairness to the federal funding of \n     transportation needs in Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we further memorialize Congress to act \n     before the beginning of the 2004 road construction season; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-402. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky relative to the Lewis and Clark National \n     Historical Trail; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson gained \n     approval to form an expeditionary group to explore the \n     Western territory of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the ``Corps of Discovery,'' led by Meriwether \n     Lewis and William Clark, embarked upon its epic adventure in \n     April, 1805, which at its conclusion returned invaluable \n     information relative to the peoples, wildlife, flora, and \n     geography of the Western territory; and\n       Whereas, 2003 marked the bicentennial celebration of the \n     embarkation of the Lewis and Clark Expedition; and\n       Whereas, Congress has seen fit to create the Lewis and \n     Clark National Historic Trail; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2327 introduced by United States \n     Representative Goode and S. 2018 introduced by United States \n     Senator Bunning, now pending in the 108th Congress of the \n     United States, seek to extend the boundaries of the Lewis and \n     Clark National Historic Trail; and\n       Whereas, the extension of the Lewis and Clark National \n     Historic Trail would make the trail the largest in the \n     national parks system; and\n       Whereas, an extended Lewis and Clark National Historic \n     Trail would serve to continue the celebration of the Lewis \n     and Clark bicentennial celebration; and\n       Whereas, the extension of the Lewis and Clark National \n     Historic Trail would provide enhanced educational \n     possibilities for all; and\n       Whereas, the extension of the Lewis and Clark National \n     Historic Trail would generate an increase in tourism and \n     tourism revenue in the states where the trail runs; and\n       Whereas, the proposed extension of the Lewis and Clark \n     National Historic Trail would include specific sites in the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the States of Ohio \n     relative to the Abandoned Mine Land Fund; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, since 1800, substantial mining has occurred in \n     Ohio, providing fuel for the United States' industrial \n     revolution and support for two world war efforts. The mining \n     industry also has been a major employer of the state's \n     citizens for many of the years since 1800. However, the \n     cumulative effects of past mining have caused significant \n     environmental problems; and\n       Whereas, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977 created the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program to \n     help protect public health and safety and to restore lands \n     and waters adversely affected by mining practices employed \n     prior to August 3, 1977. The Program is funded by fees on \n     coal production, which are deposited by the United States \n     Secretary of the Interior into the Abandoned Mine Land Fund. \n     As of March 31, 2003, more than $6.7 billion in fees have \n     been deposited into the Fund, of which more than $1.4 billion \n     remains to be appropriated to the states. The $1.4 billion \n     includes more than $938 million in state and Indian tribal \n     share funds. Ohio's state share is more than $22 million; and\n       Whereas, the expenditure of abandoned mine land funds on \n     various reclamation projects by the twenty-three states and \n     three Indian tribes that have federally approved abandoned \n     mine reclamation programs has significantly improved public \n     health and safety and the environment. In addition, that \n     expenditure has provided an estimated 6,000 jobs and $130 \n     million in economic benefits to the Appalachian region of \n     Ohio alone; and\n       Whereas, authority to collect the fee for abandoned mine \n     reclamation is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2004, \n     eliminating additional revenue for the Abandoned Mine Land \n     Reclamation Program. However, $6.6 billion worth of \n     identified health and safety problems remain nationally, \n     including 203 million in inventoried problems in Ohio such as \n     abandoned strip mines, mine openings, landslides, and \n     flooding. In addition to these nationally identified health \n     and safety problems, 1,300 miles of Ohio streams polluted by \n     acid mine drainage and potential subsidence from 6,000 \n     abandoned underground mines exist; and\n       Whereas, the people living in the country's mining regions, \n     including Ohio's mining region, have the right to a safe \n     environment, including clean drinking water and healthy \n     streams in viable communities; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that we, the members of the 125th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge Congress to reauthorize \n     abandoned mine land fee collection authority for a minimum of \n     twelve years, commencing October 1, 2004, to disperse state \n     and tribal shares of annual fee collections each year without \n     appropriation, and, in keeping faith with the goals of the \n     Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, to \n     provide eligible states and Indian tribes their lawful shares \n     of the unappropriated balance in the Abandoned Mine Land \n     Fund, after due consideration for the United Mine Workers of \n     America Combined Benefit Fund, so that they may further \n     protect public health and safety and enhance the environment \n     of their states and tribal lands; and to consider \n     reevaluating the administration of the Abandoned Mine Land \n     Reclamation Program and the Abandoned Mine Land Fund; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, to the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, \n     and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-404.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the Great Lakes Controlled Data Collection and \n     Monitoring Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 128\n\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes constitute a critically important \n     resource for our nation. The long-term health of this vast \n     and complicated freshwater network is fundamental to the \n     quality of life through its impact on public health, \n     commerce, transportation, and recreation; and\n       Whereas, the ongoing challenge of protecting the Great \n     Lakes is complicated by the many threats the lakes face, the \n     number of units of government within its basin, and \n     inconsistencies in how data on the water is gathered, \n     assessed, and acted upon; and\n       Whereas, in spite of the efforts of many public entities \n     committed to protecting the Great Lakes, there is \n     insufficient and inconsistent data on the impact that \n     restoration efforts are having on water quality. The lack of \n     data was confirmed by the General Accounting Office in a May \n     2003 report. Without reliable information, it is impossible \n     to determine to what extent the Great Lakes Water Quality \n     Agreement between our nation and Canada is progressing or \n     whether federal and state water quality standards and \n     programs are effective; and\n       Whereas, legislation is pending in Congress that would \n     directly address the issue of how data on the Great Lakes is \n     collected and assessed. The Great Lakes Controlled Data \n     Collection and Monitoring Act, H.R. 2668, would direct the \n     Great Lakes National Program Office of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to develop, implement, monitor, and report \n     on indicators of water quality and related environmental \n     factors in the Great Lakes. The legislation also authorizes \n     appropriations to carry out this much-needed work; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Great Lakes Controlled Data Collection and Monitoring Act; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-407. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the gap between services offered to children in \n     kinship care arrangements and services offered to children in \n     foster care situations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, the 2000 Census confirmed the trend that \n     increasing numbers of children are being raised by \n     grandparents. In many of these situations, a grandparent or \n     other relative is raising one or more children as an \n     alternative to foster placement. While such situations offer \n     many advantages to children and save the state a considerable \n     amount of money, public policies recognizing these realities \n     are inadequate; and\n       Whereas, there is a serious gap between the level of \n     services offered to children in kinship care situations and \n     those in foster care arrangements. While some children in \n     kinship care can be eligible for support through the TANF \n     program, the level of assistance through child-only grants is \n     notably lower; and\n       Whereas, the gap between assistance offered to poor \n     children being raised by a family member rather than a foster \n     family is especially evident in eligibility for food \n     programs, specifically school lunch programs. Indeed, the \n     potential for harm to children living in situations where \n     access to good nutrition is not assured represents a serious \n     threat in our society. Addressing this problem by increasing \n     access to school lunch programs for children living in \n     kinship care arrangements is most appropriate; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to address the \n     gap between services offered to children in kinship care \n     arrangements and services offered to children in foster care \n     situations, specifically by extending access to free school \n     lunch programs for more children living in kinship care; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-408.

The corporation's plant in Hodgenville, Kentucky \n     manufactures uniform trousers; and\n       Whereas, twenty percent of the Fechheimer Brothers \n     Manufacturing Company's annual production consists of the \n     postal service's purchases; the loss of the contract with the \n     postal service could result in massive layoffs at the plant, \n     possibly up to twenty percent of the company's 200 workers, \n     which would then put a crimp in the local economy; and\n       Whereas, plant manager Marc Lemacks describes Fechheimer \n     Brothers Manufacturing Company as the ``Cadillac of the \n     industry,'' a corporation that consistently provides its \n     clients and customers with quality products and service; and\n       Whereas, Mr. Lemacks is aware of no complaints from the \n     United States Postal Service in regards to the uniforms \n     produced by his company; instead, he fears the postal \n     service's decision to change suppliers is based on an attempt \n     to secure a lower price with an offshore company; and\n       Whereas, not only will transferring production of postal \n     service uniforms to another country rob the American people \n     of their jobs and livelihoods, but it will result in a \n     decrease in revenue to the American government through the \n     loss of taxes paid by American workers; and\n       Whereas, it is crucial that the production of uniforms and \n     equipment for United States government workers remain in \n     American factories, for the producing and wearing of \n     American-made products strengthens the morale of both \n     government and civil service workers, boosts the country's \n     economy, and manifests the pride of the American government \n     toward its citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Third General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That we respectfully urge the \n     Congress of the United States to resolve this important issue \n     and require that government uniforms and equipment be \n     manufactured in the United States, thus saving the jobs of \n     myriad Americans and strengthening the national economy: be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That appropriate copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted forthwith to the President of the United States, \n     the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President and the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate, and to each member of the Tennessee \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-410. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the protection of civil \n     liberties and the security of the United States; to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the State of Maine recognizes that the \n     Constitution of the United States is our charter of liberty \n     and that the Bill of Rights enshrines the fundamental and \n     inalienable rights of Americans, including the freedoms of \n     religion, speech, assembly and privacy; and\n       Whereas, each of Maine's duly elected public servants has \n     sworn to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United \n     States and the Constitution of Maine; and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine denounces and condemns all acts \n     of terrorism, wherever occurring; and\n       Whereas, attacks against Americans such as those that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001 have necessitated the crafting \n     of effective laws to protect the public from terrorist \n     attacks; and\n       Whereas, any new security measures of federal, state and \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and rights of any citizen of the State of Maine and \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, matters relating to immigration are primarily \n     federal in nature; and\n       Whereas, certain provisions of the ``Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001,'' commonly \n     referred to as the USA PATRIOT Act, allow the Federal \n     Government more liberally to detain and investigate citizens \n     and engage in surveillance activities that may violate or \n     offend the rights and liberties guaranteed by our state and \n     federal constitutions; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, the Members of the Maine State \n     Legislature reaffirm our sworn oaths to defend the \n     Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of \n     Maine and our solemn commitment to continue to protect and \n     champion the rights and liberties of Maine citizens that are \n     guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions, \n     including freedom of expression; the right to free access to \n     public information; freedom of association, including the \n     ability to attend meetings without being monitored or belong \n     to an organization without fear of reprisal; freedom from \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, including wiretapping and \n     monitoring of medical records and library records; due \n     process protections, including protection against detention \n     without charges or targeting based on race, religion, \n     ethnicity or national origin; and the right to property, \n     including protection against seizure or freezing of assets; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Maine State Legislature urges the \n     Federal Government to continue to exercise its jurisdiction \n     over immigration matters and encourages the Federal \n     Government to work cooperatively with the states to provide \n     assistance and training necessary to protect our country; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That laws passed by the United States Congress to \n     specifically combat the threat of international terrorism \n     should not be used in conducting domestic law enforcement; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Maine State Legislature implores the \n     United States Congress to review provisions in the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and other measures that may infringe on civil \n     liberties and ensure any pending and future federal measures \n     do not infringe on Americans' civil rights and liberties; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls upon our United States \n     Representatives and Senators to monitor the implementation of \n     the USA PATRIOT Act and related federal actions and, if \n     necessary, repeal those sections of the USA PATRIOT Act and \n     related federal measures that may infringe upon fundamental \n     rights and liberties as recognized in the United States \n     Constitution and its amendments; and be it further\n       Resolved, That official copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to a postage stamp commemorating \n     American coal miners; to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4007\n\n       Whereas, since the birth of this country, our nation owes \n     our coal miners a debt we could never begin to repay for the \n     difficult and dangerous job they perform so we could have the \n     fuel we need to operate our industries and heat our homes; \n     and\n       Whereas, the energy needs of communities throughout the \n     nation have been met due to the hard work and dedication of \n     American coal miners; and\n       Whereas, millions of workers toiled in the nation's coal \n     mines over the last century,\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\n     risking both life and limb to fuel the nation's economic \n     expansion, and through their manual labor made possible the \n     technological conveniences of modern American life, though \n     those contributions to the nation's welfare are generally \n     unknown to the public; and\n       Whereas, during the last century, over 100,000 coal miners \n     have been killed in mining accidents in the nation's coal \n     mines, and 3,500,000 coal miners have suffered nonfatal \n     injuries; and\n       Whereas, 100,000 coal miners have contracted Black Lung \n     Disease as a direct result of their toil in the nation's coal \n     mines; and\n       Whereas, coal provides 50 percent of the nation's \n     electricity and is an essential fuel for industries such as \n     steel, cement, chemical, food, and paper; and\n       Whereas, coal miners keep the nation supplied with an \n     energy resource that produces electricity for the lowest \n     cost, when compared to fuels other than nuclear, and which \n     makes possible the country's unmatched productivity and \n     prosperity; and\n       Whereas, coal miners provide a vital pool of labor with the \n     expertise to produce energy supplies from vast national coal \n     reserves, which serves to buffer the country from a dangerous \n     dependence on foreign energy fuels; and\n       Whereas, the United States has a demonstrated coal reserve \n     of more than 500,000,000,000 tons, with an estimated \n     275,000,000,000 tons of recoverable reserves which, at \n     current production rates, represents about 275 years of \n     recoverable coal reserves; and\n       Whereas, these coal reserves represent about 95 percent of \n     all fossil fuel reserves in the United States, about one-\n     fourth of the world's known coal reserves; and\n       Whereas, approximately two-thirds of all coal mined in the \n     United States is transported by rail, making coal the largest \n     single source of freight revenue for United States' \n     railroads; and\n       Whereas, transportation by railroad provided jobs for \n     thousands of workers who built the infrastructure, maintained \n     it, and loaded and unloaded coal; and\n       Whereas, it would be proper and fitting for our nation to \n     recognize our coal miners, both past and present, for their \n     contributions to this nation; and\n       Whereas, coal mining continues to be the economic engine \n     for many communities, providing jobs to areas with little \n     economic diversity; and\n       Whereas, coal mining provides an economic benefit far \n     beyond its direct revenue, including billions of dollars in \n     economic output and household earnings and hundreds of \n     thousands of jobs in other industries; now, therefore, your \n     Memorialists respectfully pray that the United States Postal \n     service issue a postage stamp commemorating American coal \n     miners, which would hold the promise of illustrating a \n     colorful and historically rich segment of society for the \n     benefit of school children, stamp collectors, educators, and \n     the public; be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe scheduled restrictions in the child tax credit, marriage penalty \nrelief, and 10 percent rate bracket, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Working \nFamily Tax Relief Act of 2004. I would like to thank my colleague, \nSenator Miller, for his support of this important legislation. His \nleadership has laid the foundation of bipartisan support that this \ncritical tax bill and working American families deserve.\n  Tax relief has contributed to economic growth throughout our economy. \nWe have successfully encouraged companies to create more jobs and \nAmericans to save and spend more. The President's tax cuts and our \nvotes here in the Senate helped to revive an economy that was sagging \nin 2000 and shocked by the tragedies of September 11, 2001.\n  We put a plan in place in 2001 to help the American family to keep \nmore of the money they work so hard to earn. In 2003, Congress saw fit \nto accelerate the effective date of some of this family tax relief in \norder to give these families this help as quickly as possible. As a \nresult, every American family who paid any income taxes during 2003 saw \na reduction in their taxes and they will enjoy those lower taxes for \nthis year as well. However, if we do not act this year, America's \nworking families will face a tax increase next year. We cannot allow \nthis to happen.\n  The lowest-income Americans have benefited dramatically from the new \n10 percent tax bracket. Today, thanks to this new bracket, working \nAmericans are keeping more of their hard-earned paychecks. But if we do \nnothing, taxpayers with as little as $7,000 in taxable income could \nface a tax increase next year. My legislation proposes to keep the \ncurrent 10 percent tax rate bracket in place rather than allowing it to \nshrink and increase taxes on the working families of America. This \nextension could bring relief to as many as 1.2 million people in \nKentucky and millions of others throughout the country.\n  And, if we do nothing, the child tax credit will be cut by 30 percent \nin 2005. We need to keep the $1,000 tax credit and not let it revert to \nthe old $700 credit. There are over 350,000 taxpayers in Kentucky who \nneed this tax relief and will benefit from this legislation. We can't \nask millions of Americans to pay an extra $300 per child next year. \nWill you ask the families of this country, who have worked so hard to \nraise our entire economy up, to pay more in taxes simply because they \nhave children? I know I won't, and I hope my colleagues won't either.\n  The accelerated marriage penalty relief will also lapse after this \nyear unless the Senate acts. I propose keeping the current tax \ndeduction in place, which we increased to twice that of an individual \ntaxpayer in 2003. Without this extension, married couples will see a \ncut in their standardized deduction--actually penalizing couples for \nbeing married. Over 465,000 Kentuckians benefits from this legislation. \nWe need to keep this important tax relief intact.\n\n  And finally we need to address an unintended consequence of the \nAlternative Minimum Tax. When the Senate passed the AMT, it was \ndesigned to ensure wealthier Americans paid at least some percentage of \ntheir income in taxes. Now that same AMT is hurting working families \nand middle-income America. In 2003, the Senate passed limited AMT \nrelief that is now set to expire. This legislation will keep the \ncurrent exemption levels of $40,250 for single and $58,000 for married \ntaxpayers in place for 2005. If we fail to act, an additional $7,000 to \n$13,000 of middle-income taxpayers' income will be subject to this tax. \nWe all know that the AMT is a serious issue and one that we must \naddress--the limited relief contained in this bill is not a final \nsolution to this large problem, but it will keep the problem from \ngetting even worse.\n  There are other important tax cuts that should be extended and there \nare other problems with the tax code that I would like to correct. But \nthe four provisions addressed in this bill have to be addressed today \nnot just to provide tax relief, but to prevent an immediate tax \nincrease. We owe it to the working families and low-income Americans \nwho rely on these tax cuts to act quickly and extend these four \nprovisions--the 10 percent tax bracket, child tax credit, marriage \npenalty relief and AMT relief. Working American families and lower to \nmiddle-income America were hit hard with the economic downturn--that is \nwhy we passed these tax cuts in the first place. And now, just as these \nindustrious Americans have started to find new jobs and spend a little \nmore money to grow the economy, we cannot hold them back with a tax \nincrease.\n  And I can't stress this point enough. Many Americans--especially low \nand middle income families--will have their tax rates increased and \nface cuts in their deductions and credits unless we act. My bill is \nabout extending the important tax breaks that we all agreed to in 2001 \nand accelerated in 2003. We made a commitment to the American family in \nthe midst of an economic downturn--offering them tax relief to help \nstimulate the economy. And now that these tax cuts are starting to \nwork, we can't afford to take them back. We must stay the course and \nsupport our Nation's families as we move the American economy forward \ntoward renewed prosperity.\n  I know how tight government finances are likely to be this year. And \nas my colleagues know, I have always taken a hard look at spending \nproposals. But we built about $80 billion into the Senate-passed FY \n2005 Budget proposal for these tax provisions. And there are similar \nprovisions in the House-approved budget. I am confident that we can \nsecure the amount we will need for this proposal over the next few \nyears.\n  We find ourselves in a unique position--we must be proactive to \nprotect the American family from an unjust tax increase. We need to \ntake a stand for low and middle income America. This Bunning-Miller tax \nrelief legislation will protect working Americans from what would be a \ndevastating tax increase in 2005. I urge my colleagues to get behind \nthis bipartisan legislation and support the Working Family Tax Relief \nAct of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. SARBANES):\n  S. 2377. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure that \nthe District of Columbia and States are provided with a safe, lead-free \nsupply of drinking water; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lead-Free \nDrinking Water Act of 2004 with my colleague Senator Sarbanes. We are \njoined by our colleagues, Congresswoman Norton, Congressman Waxman, and \nothers, who will be introducing the House companion bill today.\n  I was horrified, as I imagine we all were, when it was first reported \nthat lead levels in DC public water system was significantly higher \nthan Federal guidelines, and had been so for at least two years. I \nasked myself the same thing thousands of DC residents were asking \nthemselves--why weren't we told about this sooner. How much water did I \ndrink? How much water did my children drink? What are the effects of \nlead in our blood stream? What are the long-term effects? What are we \ngoing to do about it?\n  This is a pretty sad situation no matter where you live, but it is \nespecially upsetting when you live in the Capital\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\nof the free world. Clearly, mistakes were made and changes are needed--\nbecause if it can happen in Washington, DC or Boston, it can happen \nanywhere.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am the \nranking member, held a hearing on this issue last month, and we heard \nsome pretty compelling testimony from DC residents, health experts, \nrisk management professionals and government officials.\n  But we are going to do more than just hold hearings; today we are \nintroducing the Lead-Free Drinking Waste Act of 2004.\n  Our bill will overhaul the Safe Drinking Water Act to strengthen the \nFederal rules governing lead testing and regulations in our public \nwater systems to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens--infants, \nchildren, pregnant women, and new moms--are not harmed by lead in the \ndrinking water.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the EPA to re-evaluate the current \nregulatory structure to figure out if it really provides the level of \npublic health protection required.\n  The bill calls on the EPA to establish a maximum contaminant level \nfor lead at the tap, and if that is not practical given the presence of \nlead inside home plumbing systems, the bill requires EPA to re-evaluate \nthe current action level for lead to ensure that vulnerable populations \nsuch as infants, children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers receive \nadequate protection.\n  I look forward to working with EPA on this evaluation to determine \nwhich approach is most feasible and which provides the greatest level \nof public health protection.\n  EPA has three choices--keep current standard, an ``action level'' at \n15 parts per billion; lower the current action level below 15 parts per \nbillion; or establish a ``maximum contaminant load.''\n  For example, it is clear that a maximum contaminant level, which is \nmeasured at the water treatment plant, would do little to protect \npeople from lead-contaminated drinking water at their faucets. Our bill \nrequires that standards be measured at the top.\n  It is also clear that a low lead action level measured at the tap \ncould provide more protection than a high MCL measured anywhere in the \nsystem if there were extremely strong and effective public notification \nprocedures in place.\n  Public notice is the key to success of any lead regulation-parents \nsay to me, ``If only I had known, I could have protected my family.'' \nIt is our job to be sure the public notice system we have in place gets \npeople the information they need when they need it.\n  The bill will require that information such as the number of homes \ntested, the lead levels found, the areas of the community in which they \nwere located, and the disproportionate adverse health effects of lead \non infants, be made public immediately upon detection of lead.\n  In addition, the bill requires that, as part of routine testing \nconducted, any residents whose homes test high for lead receive \nnotification within 14 days, and appropriate medical referrals.\n  Finally, we don't want the day of an exceedance to be the first time \npeople have heard about lead in drinking water. The bill establishes a \nbasic public education program to ensure that people have a basic \nunderstanding that lead may be present in drinking water and what the \ncorrective actions might be even before their water system detects a \nproblem.\n  Right now, EPA can't say if we have a national problem or not. We \nneed one-time nationwide testing for lead in drinking water at all \nwater systems to determine if DC is an isolated case or if there are \nother ``sleeping giants'' out there.\n  The bill requires increased water testing and lead remediation in \nschools and day-care centers nationwide. This provision exists in law \ntoday, but it was affected by previous litigation. This bill corrects \nthe problem by requiring the Administrator to execute this program if \nStates choose not to. It is wholly unacceptable to do anything less \nthan provide a learning environment for our next generation that does \nnot degrade their intellectual capacity. Our bill provides $150 million \nover five years for this program. And we strengthen existing \nrequirements to ensure that ALL lead service lines will be replaced by \na public water system at a rate of 10 percent per year until they are \ngone. It provides more Federal funding to upgrade water distribution \nsystems to replace lead service lines.\n  This is common sense--let's get rid of the lead in our distribution \nsystems and get rid of the lead in our water.\n  Our bill makes the water systems responsible for replacing lead \nservice lines, including the privately-owned sections, once a system \nexceeds lead standards. Homeowners have the final say in whether their \nline is replaced. We provide $1 billion over five years for lead \nservice line replacement.\n  The EPA estimates that our Nation needs 265 billion dollars to \nmaintain and improve its drinking water infrastructure over the next \ntwenty years. If we don't address this, we will be facing more and more \nhealth and environmental issues as our Nation's water infrastructure \ndegrades.\n  Lead service lines are only one part of the picture. Leaded solder \nwas banned in 1987. However, ``lead-free'' plumbing fixtures are \ncurrently allowed to have eight percent lead. Our bill bans leaded \nplumbing fixtures and components.\n  It is time to get the lead out of our pipes, out of our water, out of \nour families and out of our lives. Safe drinking water is not a \nprivilege; it is a right--whether you live in Washington, DC, or \nWashington State or Washington County, VT.\n  We hope to move this bill this year. My Committee is scheduled to \nconsider water infrastructure legislation later this month, and I think \nthe ``Lead-Free Drinking Water Act of 2004'' would be an important \naddition to that bill.\n  I just want to say it has been an honor to work with Senator \nSarbanes, Congresswoman Norton, and Congressman Waxman on this vitally \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 2378. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public land \nin Clark County, Nevada, for use as a heliport; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. I arise today to introduce legislation to \nestablish a public heliport facility in Clark County, NV.\n  The purpose of my bill is simple: It would convey about a third of a \nsquare mile of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management to \nClark County for dedicated use as a heliport. The land is located just \nsouth of the Henderson city limits and east of Interstate 15.\n  The establishment of this heliport will help eliminate the ongoing \nconflict between air tour operators whose overflights of the Grand \nCanyon represent a classic component of the Las Vegas visitor \nexperience and residents in the west-central and southwestern parts of \nthe Las Vegas Valley whose every day lives are adversely affected by \nhelicopter noise.\n  For many months now, local officials have sought to establish a \nheliport on County or private land within the Las Vegas Valley. Their \nchosen site is currently a go-kart track near Interstate 15 near \nHenderson. If this site is developed as a heliport facility, helicopter \ntour operators will soon be flying over the Sloan Canyon National \nConservation Area. In fact, if Congress does not enact my bill, air \ntours will soon be flying over Sloan Canyon itself--one of the richest \npetroglyph sites in the Mohave Desert. That outcome would be entirely \nlegal, entirely predictable and entirely regrettable.\n  In 2002, I worked closely with Senator Ensign, Congresswoman Berkley, \nCongressman Gibbons and local advocates to ensure protection of the \nSloan Canyon area and its unique cultural resources. Through our \ncombined efforts we created the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area \nand the McCullough Mountains Wilderness. I am proud of these efforts \nand today I offer this legislation as a further effort to protect the \nprecious resources that we worked to safeguard in 2002.\n  The bill I am introducing in the Senate today would not prohibit \nhelicopter overflights of the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area \nbut it would ensure that such flights steer clear of the most sensitive \nand special cultural resources and minimize the impact on the majestic \nbighorn sheep and other wildlife that live in the McCullough Mountains.\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\n  My legislation stipulates that any helicopter flight originating from \nand/or landing at this heliport would be required by law to fly no \nfurther than 5 miles north of the southernmost boundary of the Sloan \nCanyon National Conservation Area and at least 500 to 1000 feet above \nground level while in the NCA. Further, it requires that every such \nlight contribute 3 dollars per passenger to a special fund dedicated to \nthe protection of the cultural, wilderness, and wildlife resources in \nNevada.\n  These provisions justify conveying the land to Clark County at no \ncost because they provide a stable, long-term source of funding in \nexcess of the market value of the land and because the conveyance and \nuse are in the public interest.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking member of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and my other Senate \ncolleagues to ensure swift passage of this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2378\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to issue posthumously to \nthe late William ``Billy'' Mitchell a commission as major general, \nUnited States Army; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor one \nof the Nation's great military visionaries, the late William ``Billy'' \nMitchell. My legislation would correct an injustice that has existed \nfor almost eight decades by calling on the President to posthumously \naward Billy Mitchell a commission as major general in the United States \nArmy.\n  I would like to first recognize the support this measure has received \nfrom the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense \nAppropriations, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, the Chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, who is a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. And \nI would also like to commend my colleague in the House, Mr. Bass, who, \nwith the support of House Armed Services Chairman Duncan Hunter, \nsteered identical legislation to unanimous passage in that chamber in \nthe fall of last year. I am pleased to join my colleagues as we \nrecognize the accomplishments of this important figure in our country's \nmilitary history.\n  Billy Mitchell joined the Army at age 18 in 1898. As he quickly rose \nin rank, he began to realize the incredible potential for air power in \nestablishing military superiority. After World War I, Billy Mitchell \nbecame a brigadier general and deputy commander of the Air Service, and \nin this position he began pressing senior military officials and the \nWhite House for increased funding for the development of a formidable \nair force. In fact, he conducted a test for senior Army and Navy \nofficials in the Chesapeake Bay in 1921 that bolstered his contention \nthat air power represented the future of combat, while embarrassing \nmany naysayers.\n  Although Billy Mitchell was long on vision and foresight, he was \nshort on tact. After the 1921 test, his relationship with his superiors \ndeteriorated as his very public battle for Air Service funding had \ntaken an increasingly bitter tone, and after an accident that took the \nlives of Navy sailors, Mitchell accused senior military leaders of \n``almost treasonable administration of the national defense.'' He was \ncourt-martialed for insubordination, found guilty, sentenced to 5 years \nloss of pay, and demoted to the rank of colonel. Yet to the surprise of \nno one, Billy Mitchell continued to be a strong and effective voice in \nsupport of air power after resigning his commission in 1926 until his \nuntimely death 10 years later.\n  Billy Mitchell sacrificed his career to help change the way our \ncountry defends itself and projects military force across the globe to \nprotect and preserve freedom. We have seen over time--most recently \nduring the war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq--how important air \npower is in achieving our military objectives. Mitchell's \nprognostications many years ago about the future of air power has been \nproven correct many times over, and it is now time for our nation to \nrecognize the enormous contribution Billy Mitchell has made to the \ncitizens and soldiers of the United States of America. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill to finally give the late Billy Mitchell \nthe rank of major general, United States Army.\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2381. A bill to provide for earned adjustment to reward work, \nreunify families, establish a temporary worker program that protects \nUnited States and foreign workers and strengthen national security \nunder the immigration laws of the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce the Safe \nOrderly Legal Visas and Enforcement (SOLVE) Act of 2004.\n  Much of the Nation's economy today depends on the hard work and the \nmany contributions of immigrants. Many industries depend heavily on \nimmigrant labor. These workers enrich our Nation and improve the \nquality of our lives. Yet millions of today's immigrant workers are \nundocumented. These workers and their families live in constant fear of \ndeportation, and are easy targets of abuse and exploitation by \nunscrupulous employers and by criminals. Many risk great danger, and \neven death, to cross our borders.\n  For important reasons--to strengthen national security, to guarantee \nsound economic and labor practices, and to ensure fundamental \nfairness--it is essential to reform our immigration system. We need \nimmigration policies that provide a safe, orderly system where legality \nis the prevailing norm. We need immigration policies that reflect \ncurrent economic realities, that respect the core values of family \nunity and fundamental fairness and that uphold our proud tradition as a \nNation of immigrants.\n  These are complex issues, deserving careful consideration and debate. \nBut they are also issues that demand immediate attention. Our bill \ncreates a genuine earned legalization program for undocumented workers \nand a revised temporary worker program with protections for both U.S. \nand foreign workers. It also creates a realistic path to citizenship \nfor all deserving immigrants, and takes clear steps to reunite \nimmigrant families.\n  The legislation will benefit both workers and businesses. It improves \nwages and working conditions, and provides an effective way for \nforeign-born workers to become permanent residents if they wish to do \nso. It benefits immigrant families by reducing the unacceptable \nbacklogs and obstacles that have separated families for too many years.\n  Family unity has always been a fundamental cornerstone of America's \nimmigration policy. Despite this fact, over three million individuals \nare awaiting immigrant visas in order to reunite with their families. \nThis bill will allow immigrant families to be reunited more quickly and \nhumanely. It also removes other obstacles in our current immigration \nlaws that are separating families, such as the stringent affidavit-of-\nsupport requirements and the bars to admissibility.\n  No immigration proposal is complete without an earned adjustment \nprogram. Hard-working immigrants living in the United States contribute \nto the economic growth and prosperity of our Nation. Immigrant workers \nare, and will continue to be, essential to the success of many American \nbusinesses. Our legislation will allow these long-term, tax-paying \nimmigrants to apply for earned adjustment of status, providing \nemployers with a more stable workforce and improving the wages and \nworking conditions of all workers.\n  A revised temporary worker program is a necessary component of any \nimmigration reform, but it cannot stand alone. It must be enacted in \nconjunction with earned legalization and family unity priorities, and \nit must avoid the troubling legacy of exploitation that has marred past \nguest worker programs.\n  This legislation strikes a fair balance. It will ensure that \nindividuals participating in the program receive the same labor \nprotections as those given to U.S. workers, including the right to \norganize, the right to change jobs between employers and economic \nsectors, and the protection of wages, hours, and working conditions. \nAnything else would subject migrants to abuse, and undermine the jobs, \nwages and working conditions of U.S. workers. The bill also provides \nparticipants with an opportunity to become permanent residents, and \neventually citizens, if they wish to do so. Without such an \nopportunity, we will be creating second class status for temporary \nworkers.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, we can no longer \ntolerate policies that fail to protect and control our borders. For the \nlast decade, Congress has invested millions of dollars to vastly \nincrease the number of immigration border patrol agents, improve \nsurveillance technology, and install other controls to strengthen \nborder enforcement, especially at our southwest border. Yet, almost \neveryone will agree that these policies have failed to stop illegal \nimmigration. The proof is in the numbers--several hundred thousand \npeople continue to enter the U.S. illegally each year.\n  Our border enforcement strategy has, in effect, diverted migration \nflows to the most inhospitable desert and mountain terrains, causing \ndramatic increases in deaths due to exposure to the elements. According \nto statistics from the U.S. Border Patrol, since 1998 nearly 2,000 \npeople have died making the treacherous journey across our southern \nborder. Desperate migrants are being drawn into criminal smuggling \nsyndicates, increasing the danger of violence to border patrol agents, \nborder communities, and the migrant themselves. As Stephen Flynn, an \nexpert on terrorism, noted at a recent Congressional hearing, these \n``draconian measures'' have produced chaos at our borders, which \n``makes it ideal for exploitation by criminals and terrorists.''\n  Our borders must be safe and secure. Although no terrorists have been \napprehended crossing the southern border, the conditions there are ripe \nfor abuse. Our present enforcement policies are not effective. Our bill \nwill replace the chaotic, deadly illegal crossings along our southwest \nborder with orderly and safe legal avenues for immigrant workers and \nimmigrant families. Substantially legalizing the flow of people at our \nborders will strengthen our security and substantially reduce criminal \nactivities, enabling immigration enforcement agents to focus their \nresources on terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the country. \nThe bill will strengthen national security by encouraging undocumented \npersons to come forward to become legal.\n  We have a unique opportunity to reform the current immigration \nsystem, and apply sensible policies that reaffirm our commitment to \nfamily unity, fundamental fairness, economic opportunity, and humane \ntreatment.\n  The bill we are introducing today will achieve the full reforms we \nneed. A good first step would be to enact two bills that are already \npending--the AgJOBS bill to reform the immigration laws for migrant \nworkers, and the DREAM Act, to enable undocumented high school students \nto qualify for legal status so they can attend college. The \nAdministration's wholehearted endorsements of these two bills would \nguarantee their immediate passage. Let's at least get these bills done \nnow. We cannot afford any more delays.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to reform our \nimmigration laws. It's time to make these long-overdue reforms happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2382. A bill to establish grant programs for the development of \ntelecommunications capacities in Indian country; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is long \noverdue and much needed in Indian country.\n  On May 22nd of last year, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a \nhearing on the status of telecommunications across Native America. \nTestimony received at that hearing and reports of Federal agencies that \nwere made part of the hearing record indicate that there is most \ndefinitely a vast difference in access to the most basic \ntelecommunications services.\n  For instance, telephone service to Indian homes is from 30 to 60 \npercent less than the national average, and only 10 percent of Indian \nhomes have Internet service.\n  The bill that I introduce today is modeled after the community \ndevelopment block grant program and provides authorization for the \nestablishment of two block grant programs in the Department of \nCommerce. The first block grant would enable tribal governments to \ndevelop the necessary infrastructure\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\nto support expanded telecommunications capabilities, to develop \ncomprehensive plans for enhancing telecommunications services in Indian \ncommunities, and to provide support for telemedicine.\n  The second block grant program would support the provision of \ntraining and technical assistance in the very complex field of \ntelecommunications.\n  The objectives of this bill can be rather simply stated. For too \nlong, when it comes to access to even the most basic telecommunications \nservices--telephone and Internet access--we have relegated Indian \ncountry to third world status. We must bridge this gap--it is that \nfundamental.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Connectivity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) disparities exist in the areas of education, health \n     care, workforce training, commerce, and economic activity of \n     Indians due to the rural nature of most Indian reservations; \n     and\n       (B) access to basic and advanced telecommunications \n     infrastructure is critical in eliminating those disparities;\n       (2) currently, only 67.9 percent of Indian homes have \n     telephone service, compared with the national average of 95.1 \n     percent;\n       (3) the telephone service penetration rate on some \n     reservations is as low as 39 percent;\n       (4) even on reservations and trust land, non-Indian homes \n     are more likely to have telephone service than Indian homes;\n       (5) only 10 percent of Indian households on tribal land \n     have Internet access;\n       (6) only 17 percent of Indian tribes have developed \n     comprehensive technology plans;\n       (7) training and technical assistance have been identified \n     as the most significant needs for the development and \n     effective use of telecommunications and information \n     technology in Indian country;\n       (8) funding for telecommunications and information \n     technology projects in Indian country remains inadequate to \n     address the needs of Indian communities;\n       (9) many Indian tribes are located on or adjacent to Indian \n     land in which unemployment rates exceed 50 percent;\n       (10) the lack of telecommunications infrastructure and low \n     telephone and Internet penetration rates adversely affects \n     the ability of Indian tribes to pursue economic development \n     opportunities; and\n       (11) health care, disease prevention education, and \n     cultural preservation are greatly enhanced with access to and \n     use of telecommunications technology and electronic \n     information.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote affordable and universal access among Indian \n     tribal governments, tribal entities, and Indian households to \n     telecommunications and information technology in Indian \n     country;\n       (2) to encourage and promote tribal economic development, \n     self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments;\n       (3) to enhance the health of Indian tribal members through \n     the availability and use of telemedicine and telehealth; and\n       (4) to assist in the retention and preservation of native \n     languages and cultural traditions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

BOARD OF \n                          EDUCATION OF TOPEKA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nCarper, and Mr. Biden) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 349\n\n       Whereas May 17, 2004, marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     Supreme Court decision in the case of Brown v. Board of \n     Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954);\n       Whereas in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. \n     537 (1896), the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of \n     ``separate but equal'', which allowed the continued \n     segregation of common carriers, and, by extension, of public \n     schools, in the United States based on race;\n       Whereas racial segregation and the doctrine of ``separate \n     but equal'' resulted in separate schools, housing, and public \n     accommodations that were inferior and unequal for African-\n     Americans and many other minorities, severely limited the \n     educational opportunities of generations of racial \n     minorities, negatively impacted the lives of the people of \n     the United States, and inflicted severe harm on American \n     society;\n       Whereas in 1945, Mexican-American students in California \n     successfully challenged the constitutionality of their \n     segregation on the basis of national origin in Westminster \n     School District of Orange County v. Mendez (161 F.2d 774 (9th \n     Cir. 1947));\n       Whereas in 1951, Oliver Brown, on behalf of his daughter \n     Linda Brown, an African-American third grader, filed suit \n     against the Board of Education of Topeka after Linda was \n     denied admission to an all-white public school in Topeka, \n     Kansas;\n       Whereas in 1952, the Supreme Court combined Oliver Brown's \n     case (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 98 F. Supp. 797 \n     (D. Kan. 1951)) with similar cases from Delaware (Gebhart v. \n     Belton, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952)), South Carolina (Briggs v. \n     Elliott, 98 F. Supp. 529 (E.D.S.C. 1951)), and Virginia \n     (Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 103 F. \n     Supp. 337 (E.D. Va. 1952)) challenging racial segregation in \n     education and determined that the constitutionality of \n     segregation in public schools in the District of Columbia \n     would be considered separately in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. \n     497 (1954);\n       Whereas the students in these cases argued that the \n     inequality caused by the segregation of public schools was a \n     violation of their right to equal protection under the law;\n       Whereas on May 17, 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of Plessy \n     v. Ferguson, concluding that ``in the field of public \n     education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no \n     place'' and, on that same date, in Bolling v. Sharpe, held \n     that the doctrine of ``separate but equal'' also violated the \n     fifth amendment to the Constitution; and\n       Whereas the decision in Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka is of national importance and profoundly affected all \n     people of the United States by outlawing racial segregation \n     in education and providing a foundation on which to build \n     greater equality: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors May 17, 2004, as the 50th \n     anniversary of the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n     decision in Brown v.

Res. 351\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge our students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 41 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas nearly 3,000 charter schools are now operating in \n     37 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico and serving 750,000 students;\n       Whereas over the last 10 years, Congress has provided more \n     than $1,000,000,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     through facilities financing assistance and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas charter schools improve their students' achievement \n     and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas nearly 40 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,000 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the fifth annual National Charter Schools Week, to \n     be held May 3 to 7, 2004, is an event sponsored by charter \n     schools and grassroots charter school organizations across \n     the United States to recognize the significant impact, \n     achievements, and innovations of charter schools: Now, \n     therefore, be it--\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges and commends charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening our public school \n     system;\n       (2) the Senate supports the fifth annual National Charter \n     Schools Week; and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to conduct appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities to demonstrate support for charter schools during \n     this weeklong celebration in communities throughout the \n     United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 103--HONORING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE \nWOMEN, SYMBOLIZED BY ``ROSIE THE RIVETER'', WHO SERVED ON THE HOMEFRONT \n              DURING WORLD WAR II, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, \nMs. Collins, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Landrieu, \nMrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Stabenow) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 103\n\n       Whereas during World War II, 6,000,000 women stepped \n     forward to work in homefront industries to produce the ships, \n     planes, tanks, trucks, guns, and ammunition that were crucial \n     to achieving an Allied victory;\n       Whereas women worked in homefront industries as welders, \n     riveters, engineers, designers, and managers, and held other \n     positions that had traditionally been held by men;\n       Whereas these women demonstrated great skill and dedication \n     in the difficult and often dangerous jobs they held, which \n     enabled them to produce urgently needed military equipment at \n     recordbreaking speeds;\n       Whereas the need for labor in homefront industries during \n     World War II opened new employment opportunities for women \n     from all walks of life and dramatically increased gender and \n     racial integration in the workplace;\n       Whereas the service of women on the homefront during World \n     War II marked an unprecedented entry of women into jobs that \n     had traditionally been held by men and created a lasting \n     legacy of the ability of women to succeed in those jobs;\n       Whereas these women devoted their hearts and souls to their \n     work to assure safety and success for their husbands, sons, \n     and other loved ones on the battle front;\n       Whereas the needs of working mothers resulted in the \n     creation of child care programs, leading to the lasting \n     legacy of public acceptance of early child development and \n     care outside the home;\n       Whereas the needs of women on the homefront led to \n     employer-sponsored prepaid and preventative health care never \n     before seen in the United States; and\n       Whereas in 2000, Congress recognized the significance to \n     the Nation of the industrial achievements on the homefront \n     during World War II and the legacy of the women who worked in \n     those industries through the establishment of the Rosie the \n     Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in \n     Richmond, California, as a unit of the National Park System: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the extraordinary contributions of the women \n     whose dedicated service on the homefront during World War II \n     was instrumental in achieving an Allied victory;\n       (2) recognizes the lasting legacy of equal employment \n     opportunity and support for child care and health care that \n     developed during the ``Rosie the Riveter'' era; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to take the \n     opportunity to study, reflect on, and celebrate the stories \n     and accomplishments of women who served the Nation as \n     ``Rosies'' during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4846-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3110.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 351, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 351) congratulating charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today my colleagues, Senators Lieberman, \nFrist, Carper, Dole, Sununu, Alexander, Domenici, Craig, Coleman, \nLandrieu, Durbin, DeWine, and Brownback joined me in submitting S. Res. \n351, a resolution to designate the week of May 3 through May 7, 2004 as \nNational Charter Schools Week. This year marks the 12th anniversary of \nthe opening of the Nation's first charter school in Minnesota. We have \ncome a long way since that auspicious moment when one teacher, \ncollaborating with parents, started a public school specifically \ndesigned to meet the needs of the students in the community.\n  Today, we have almost 3,000 charter schools serving nearly 750,000 \nstudents in 37 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. \nCharter schools are immensely popular. Forty percent report having \nwaiting lists, and there are enough students on these waiting lists to \nfill another 1,000 average-sized charter schools. Survey after survey \nshows parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with their children's \ncharter schools.\n  Charter schools are popular for a variety of reasons. They are \ngenerally free from the burdensome regulations and policies that govern \ntraditional public schools. They are founded and run by principals, \nteachers, and parents who share a common vision of education, a vision \nwhich guides each and every decision made at the schools, from hiring \npersonnel to selecting curricula. Furthermore, charter schools are held \naccountable for student performance in a very unique way--if they fail \nto educate their students well and meet the goals of their charters, \nthey are shut down.\n  Since each charter school represents the unique vision of its \nfounders, these schools vary greatly, but all strive for excellence.\n  For example, Summit Middle School in Boulder, CO is a charter school \nserving grades 6 through 8 in mixed-age classes grouped by interest, \nmotivation, ability, developmental level, and mastery of previous \nmaterial. Summit provides a choice at the middle school level for \nstudents interested in a more rigorous and individualized academic \nprogram, and its students--admitted without regard to past academic \naccomplishment or prior testing--have risen to the challenge. In 2003, \nSummit was one of 214 public and private elementary and secondary \nschools nationwide, and the only public middle school\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\nin Colorado, to be named a No Child Left Behind-Blue Ribbon School in \nrecognition of its students' outstanding performance on State tests.\n  Here in the District of Columbia, the Capital City Public Charter \nSchool serves 227 students and has more than 400 students on its \nwaiting list after only four years of operation. The award-winning \nschool uses an innovative approach to learning based on two research-\nbased, nationally recognized education models that promote rigorous \nacademic and character standards--and the results speak for themselves. \nStudents at Capital City are making significant, measurable academic \nprogress with solid gains in both reading and math. In 2003, Capital \nCity achieved all six goals outlined for District charter schools on \nacademic progress and excellence on the SAT-9 tests. Two new charter \nschools modeled after Capital City are expected to open in the District \nthis fall, further increasing options for students and parents.\n  These are but a few of the success stories in the charter school \nmovement, which includes a wide range of schools serving a variety of \ndifferent learning needs and styles, often at a lower cost than \ntraditional public schools.\n  I expect that we will see the popularity of charter schools continue \nto expand. Two years ago, the President signed into law the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, which gives parents in low-performing schools the \noption to transfer their children to another public school. No Child \nLeft Behind also provides school districts with the option of \nconverting low-performing schools into charter schools. I believe these \nprovisions will strengthen the charter school movement by creating more \nopportunities for charter school development. And as parents exercise \ntheir right to school choice and ``vote with their feet'', the demand \nfor charter schools will increase.\n  I commend the ever-growing number of people involved in the charter \nschool movement, from parents and teachers to community leaders and \nmembers of the business community. Together, they have led the charge \nin education reform and have started a revolution with the potential to \ntransform our system of public education. Districts with a large number \nof charter schools have reported that they are becoming more customer \nservice-oriented, increasing interaction with parents, and creating new \neducation programs, many of which are similar to those offered by \ncharter schools. These improvements benefit all our students, not just \nthose who choose charter schools.\n  I encourage my colleagues to visit a charter school this week to \nwitness firsthand the ways in which these innovative schools are making \na difference, both in the lives of the students they serve as well as \nin the community in which they reside.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nof this resolution to support the designation of May 3 through May 7, \n2004 as National Charter Schools Week. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution to recognize and honor the success of charters schools \nacross the nation. I strongly believe that charter schools enrich our \nnation and enhance our public education system by providing diverse and \ninnovative educational options for parents and their children.\n  Currently, nearly 3,000 charter schools are operating in 37 States \nand the District of Columbia and are serving about 750,000 students. We \nmust continue to sponsor and encourage the development of charter \nschools. The fact is that nearly 40 percent of charter schools report \nhaving a waiting list. Indeed, with these students, we could fill over \n1,000 new charter schools.\n  One of the many positive aspects of the charter movement is that it \nhas managed to bring together educators, parents, community activities, \nbusiness leaders, and politicians from across the political spectrum to \nsupport a common goal of better educating our children by offering more \nchoice and more accountability within our public schools. In many \ncases, charter schools are built from the ground up by educational \nleaders and thinkers, working with teachers, parents and local leaders, \nto reinvent the public school with fresh ideas and expanded options. To \ntheir credit, studies have shown that student achievement gains in \npublic schools are substantial and that charter schools are serving a \nhigher percentage of low-income and minority students than the \ntraditional school system.\n  Now, more than ever, we must continue to support and encourage the \ncharter movement to give parents and children meaningful public school \nchoices, particularly to children in low-performing schools. I am, \ntherefore, most pleased to join my distinguished colleague from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, along with Senators Carper, Durbin, DeWine, \nColeman, Landrieu, Dole, Sununu, Domenici, Craig, Alexander and Frist, \nin recognizing the success of charter schools and the value they add to \npublic education. I also commend the Charter School Leadership Council \nand express my full support for the activities planned this week to \ncelebrate charter schools, teachers and developers, and the parents and \nchildren they serve.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 351) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 351\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge our students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 41 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas nearly 3,000 charter schools are now operating in \n     37 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico and serving 750,000 students;\n       Whereas over the last 10 years, Congress has provided more \n     than $1,000,000,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     through facilities financing assistance and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas charter schools improve their students' achievement \n     and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas nearly 40 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,000 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the fifth annual National Charter Schools Week, to \n     be held May 3 to 7, 2004, is an event sponsored by charter \n     schools and grassroots charter school organizations across \n     the United States to recognize the significant impact, \n     achievements, and innovations of charter schools: Now, \n     therefore, be it--\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges and commends charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening our public school \n     system;\n       (2) the Senate supports the fifth annual National Charter \n     Schools Week; and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to conduct appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities to demonstrate support for charter schools during \n     this weeklong celebration in communities throughout the \n     United States.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4852-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2004\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on \nWednesday, May 5. I further ask that following the prayer and the \npledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings \nbe approved to date, and following the time for the two leaders the \nSenate then begin a period for morning business for up to 60 minutes, \nwith the first 30 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or \nhis designee, and the final 30 minutes under the control of the \nmajority leader or his designee; provided that following morning \nbusiness, the Senate then resume consideration of Calendar No. 381, S. \n1637, the FSC/ETI JOBS bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I further ask consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1637, the pending amendments be set aside and \nSenator Breaux be recognized in order to offer an amendment, which is \nat the desk, on repatriation; further, there be 60 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form and that following that time the amendment be \nset aside and the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment \nat a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with \nthe Democratic leader, with no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So tomorrow morning, following morning business, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the JOBS bill. We made good \nprogress on the bill today, disposing of five amendments. The chairman \nand ranking member of the Finance Committee will be here tomorrow \nmorning to continue working through the remaining amendments. Senators \nshould expect rollcall votes on amendments throughout the afternoon. \nHowever, I would announce there will be no votes prior to 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, and I appreciate the Senator \nyielding, after we finish with the Breaux amendment, there is an \nagreement that if there is a Republican amendment to be offered we \nwould deal with that. If not, the next amendment we would go to would \nbe to complete the amendment that has already been offered by Senator \nDorgan. Following that, if the Republicans want to offer an amendment, \nthat would be fine. If they do not, we would then go to an amendment \nthat has been filed by Senator Graham. We would complete those and \nperhaps have at least those three votes at or near 2 tomorrow \nafternoon. That is not a unanimous consent. That is just indicating \nwhat we have worked on with the managers of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/04/senate-section/article/S4852-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
