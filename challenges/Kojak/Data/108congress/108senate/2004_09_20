Mr. President, before I came to the Senate, I practiced law \nfor many years in my home state of Nevada. I was an attorney who went \nto court all the time, and I often went to Federal court. There is a \ntremendous difference between State courts and Federal courts. There is \nmore solemnity in the Federal courts. There are more procedures that \nare important to the establishment of justice and maintaining justice \nin our Federal court system. The main reason for this is that our \nFederal judges are appointed for life. They are not subject to the \nwhims of a political issue at any given time. They know that if they \nrule a\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\ncertain way, they are not going to be thrown off the bench in the next \nelection.\n  I am still a very proud member of the Nevada bar, and I have great \nrespect for the law. I appreciate everyone who is involved in the \npractice of the law and the judicial process.\n  In fact, the reason there has been so much debate about Federal \njudicial nominations is because we care deeply about these lifetime \npositions. They are vital to our system of Government.\n  The U.S. Constitution is such an important document. When we come to \nthis body, we swear we will uphold the U.S. Constitution. Framers of \nthis great document were visionary, in my opinion. They understood the \nimportance of the legal process. That is why they made the judiciary \none of the three equal branches of Government, separate but equal.\n  Our judiciary and our legal system are vital to this democracy. \nUnfortunately, some people only seem to recognize that fact when it is \nconvenient.\n  I am sad to announce that this administration wants the public to \nbelieve nothing is more important than filling vacancies on the Federal \nbench. Yet, this same administration refuses to fund the judicial \nbranch so it can function properly. This body, because of the numbers \nwe have gotten from the White House, is contemplating a budget \nresolution that would freeze the judiciary appropriations at last \nyear's levels. The funding for staffing and other expenses was below \nthe level of fiscal year 2001. That is, 2004 was below the level of \n2001.\n  While funding went down over that time, the workload of our Federal \njudiciary has increased by more than 10 percent. The budget crunch has \nalready forced the judiciary to fire 145 employees. Now if we freeze \njudiciary funding at these levels, again we will cripple the operations \nof our Federal courts. It will force early buyouts. They will come up \nwith gimmicks such as these early buyouts. They will have to do some \nlayoffs. They will have to do furlough days. They will limit the number \nof hours people can work, and there will be a loss of between 2,000 to \n5,000 probation officers and court staff alone.\n  What does this mean? Fewer probation officers means less supervision \nof Federal offenders and more danger on our streets. Do we want to do \nthat? By withholding the resources of our judiciary, which is so \ndesperately needed, we would threaten the ability of our legal system \nto function properly.\n  By next June, payments to court-appointed private attorneys in \ncriminal cases would be halted. Why is this significant? Because our \nFederal public defender system cannot represent defendants in cases \nwhere there are conflicts with other defendants these defendants have \nto be represented by court-appointed private attorneys. Without \nadequate funding, they are not going to be able to do that anymore. In \naddition, civil jury trials would come to a halt in June because there \nwould be no funds to pay the jurors.\n  The Constitution is the world's greatest blueprint for democracy, and \nour justice system is the fairest and the best in all the world. We \nshould not be running a second-class judicial system. The Senate needs \nto provide our judiciary the resources it needs to fund these functions \nproperly.\n  While the Senate committee-passed bill does appropriate funding for \nthe judiciary, it is not enough. At the very least, we must appropriate \nthe amount contained in H.R. 4754. Anything less than that will \njeopardize the judiciary's fundamental mission of providing justice.\n  I have spoken at great length with members of the Federal bench about \nsalaries for Federal judges, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices. We \nhave to pay our Federal judges better to continue to attract and retain \nthe ``best of the best'' in our Federal judiciary, but today we are not \neven asking for that. We simply want funding that will be better than \nthe 2001 level.\n  As in so many cases, this administration's rhetoric on judicial \nnominees is a flip side of reality. The President bemoans the supposed \nslow pace of the Senate's confirmation of his judicial nominees. Here \nis reality: The Senate has confirmed more than 95 percent of the \nPresident's nominees for the Federal court. I think the number is 203 \napproved and 9 or 10 turned down.\n  The pace of our consideration of nominees is faster than that \nafforded any President in modern times. The vacancy rate on the Federal \nbench is the lowest in many years. Yet the President argues that the \nSenate's objection to a small number of his nominees will slow the \nadministration of justice. Again, that is not reality. Here is reality: \nThe President proposes a budget that shortchanges the judiciary, \nensuring that the judges who serve today on the Federal bench do not \nhave the resources they need to do the job they were appointed to do. \nThat is the reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of a letter I received \nfrom Lloyd D. George, formerly the Chief Judge in Nevada, now on senior \nstatus, a man who has the support and approval of all Federal judges, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                           District of Nevada,\n\n                                   Las Vegas, NV, August 24, 2004.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: This is a brief summary outline of \n     critical points contained in Mr. Mecham's report on the \n     urgent judiciary funding needs. I've also attached his full \n     report. We would be most grateful, Senator, if you could help \n     bring Congress to an understanding of how the judiciary's \n     role in sustaining the rule of law will be severely damaged \n     if the current budget impasse on judiciary funding is not \n     resolved, and the judiciary's funding is included in a long-\n     term continuing resolution that would freeze overall \n     appropriations at FY 2004 levels. It is the operation of and \n     respect for the rule of law which sets our country apart from \n     most others.\n       A minimum current services funding level (sustained by a \n     6.1 percent increase over FY 2004 appropriations) would \n     maintain the current staffing and operating expenses.\n       A freeze of the juror appropriation would require the \n     halting of civil jury trials in July 2005.\n       The modest increase in the FY 2004 budget still required \n     the courts to terminate, buy-out or furlough employees \n     despite the 10% workload growth from the previous year. \n     Courts have also scaled back on technology, reduced \n     improvements and public hours access, and cut back on \n     probation officers' testing and aftercare of offenders.\n       The judiciary could be forced to fire or furlough the \n     equivalent of 2,000 to 5,000 probation, pretrial services, \n     and clerks' office employees--almost one-fourth of the \n     current staff. It is worth noting that once a skilled \n     employee is released, even if funding is eventually restored, \n     the employee usually does not return, resulting in the loss \n     of a significant investment in human resources.\n       A freeze of the defender services appropriations would \n     require halting panel attorney payments in June 2005.\n       Should the appropriations process become stalled, an effort \n     to exempt the judiciary from a long-term continuing \n     resolution at FY 2004 levels should be considered, and an \n     annual appropriation at least to the levels contained in H.R. \n     4754 should be provided. Such a course is not without \n     precedence, and was taken in 1996 when, at the request of the \n     Chief Justice, the judiciary was exempted, along with other \n     law enforcement agencies from a full year continuing \n     resolution, and an appropriations bill for the judiciary was \n     resolved within months. Although the Chief Justice rarely \n     calls upon the Judicial Conference to pass a resolution, this \n     year he made such a request in view of the critical budgetary \n     situation. The Judicial Conference unanimously passed the \n     resolution which I attach for your review.\n       As always, I respect your judgment and remain confident in \n     your commitment to the Third Branch and the constitutional \n     rights and privileges that it protects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lloyd D. George,\n                                                   District Judge.\n\n  Mr. REID. Judge George has served on many committees of the Supreme \nCourt. He is a great judge. I do not know if ``revered'' is the right \nword, but people like this man and look up to him. Lloyd George was \nappointed by a Republican President. He is a Republican, and he is not \ntrying to embarrass the President. He is a person who believes in the \nthree separate but equal branches of Government and he thinks what is \nhappening to the Federal judiciary is causing inequality in the \nseparation of powers doctrine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for up \nto 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9367-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9367-S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Steven D. Conover\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to honor and \nremember a young man from Wilmington, OH, a man who was taken from us \nfar too soon, a young man who lost his life in service to our country \nin Iraq, a young man who stands as a shining example of bravery, \ncourage, and who had a profound sense of faith.\n  Army SGT Steven Conover, a member of the 82nd Airborne Field \nArtillery, Charlie Battery, was killed on November 2, 2003, along with \n16 other brave Americans. When the helicopter they were riding in was \nshot down near Fallujah, he was on his way home to Ohio, on his way \nhome for a 2-week leave where he was going to surprise his childhood \nsweetheart, his wife Brooke, for their second wedding anniversary.\n  Steven was only 21 years of age. While the tragedy of his loss is \nundeniable, Steven's family and friends take comfort in remembering him \nas he was, as he always will be, frozen in time as an exuberant young \nman who tried very hard and succeeded in doing much good in the world.\n  Steven grew up in Wilmington, OH, and attended Wilmington High \nSchool, graduating in the year 2000. His friends remember him as laid \nback, shy, kind, and caring. He also attended the Laurel Observation \nVocational School where he was a member of the Air Force Junior ROTC. \nOne of his ROTC instructors, Howard Vosburgh, described Steven this \nway:\n\n       [Steven was a] very mature, genuinely nice guy [who] \n     automatically, when he spoke, other people listened. His \n     fellow students looked up to him. I admired him. He was just \n     a cut above his peers. He was that kind of person.\n\n  Throughout his short life, Steven would gain the admiration of so \nmany people. His hometown of Wilmington honored him with a story in the \nlocal paper about his service and the service of three of his relatives \nwho were also serving in Iraq. Not only did several of Steven's \nrelatives dedicate their lives and service to our country, but so did \nhis wife Brooke. While Steven trained at Fort Sill, OK, Brooke enlisted \nin the Army because she knew how Steven loved his career and figured \nthat they would both end up, as she said, ``lifers.''\n  Brooke remembered fondly how Steven would help ease her fears before \nshe started basic training. The two would spend as much time together \nas they could, fishing and walking the trails at the base. However, \nBrooke suffered a leg muscle injury during basic training that resulted \nin her honorable discharge.\n  Steven was forced to leave his soulmate when his unit was sent to \nIraq in April 2003. He always made an effort to write to his wife, as \nwell as his mother and stepfather in Wilmington. Additionally, Steven \nremained in contact with students from his alma mater. Wilmington High \nSchool created a trophy case that displayed the photos of 22 former \nstudents serving overseas in the military and students wrote letters to \nthe soldiers, including Steven. This contact brought Steven great \ncomfort as he dealt with the death of his best friend in combat, as \nwell as the suffering he saw in Iraq.\n  Steven was a devout Christian. He used his faith as a guide during \nmany difficult times while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. As \nSteven's step-father, Michael, recalled:\n\n       They were ambushed quite often, and Steven just said he \n     knew the hand of God was on him. He saw the hand of God in \n     Iraq.\n\n  According to Pastor Elizabeth Looney, who knew Steven since his \nbirth, his time in Iraq changed his beliefs and bolstered his faith. \nShe said of Steven:\n\n       The pain and suffering he saw increased his resolve to do \n     good and made him proud to serve his country.\n\n  Steven told her of his desire to return home and sit in the church \nwith her. His faith was strong, and he had a profound sense that he was \ndoing what was right--that it was, in fact, necessary.\n  Upon his death, at a memorial service at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, \nSteven and five of his fallen comrades were eulogized. The most \npoignant moment of the service was the final roll call. For those not \nfamiliar with the tradition, the Sergeant rises and calls the names of \nthe soldiers present in the audience. Each responds with ``here.'' A \ndeafening silence is the only response to the call for the fallen \nsoldier--the silence that reminds us all of the ultimate sacrifice they \neach have made.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Steven's family and friends at his \nfuneral service in Wilmington. During the eulogy, Pastor Looney \ndescribed him as ``a hero . . . mischievous . . . everything he did was \nfunny.'' Most profoundly, though, she described Steven as a watchman--a \nwatchman who protects all of us--who watches over us. She concluded \nwith these words:\n\n       We're going to miss his smile and his face and all the love \n     he gave. I know where Steven is.\n\n  We all know where Steven is. His faith guided him through life and \ninto his eternal resting place.\n  Left to cherish his memory are his wife Brooke; his mother Lorraine; \nstep-father Michael; brother Aaron; sisters Kaliegh and Corrie, as well \nas grandparents, nephews, nieces, aunts, and uncles.\n  I know they miss Steven deeply.\n  Steven Conover was an exceptional young man, who will never be \nforgotten.\n\n\n                    Army Specialist James Powell II\n\n  Mr. President, last October, at one of Saddam Hussein's palaces in \nTikrit, Iraq, two fallen United States soldiers were honored by several \nhundred of their comrades. The mood was somber as troops, in full \nbattle gear, stood in formation for the final roll call. When the call \ncame, Army SP James Powell II and SP Donald Wheeler did not respond.\n  With tears streaming down their faces, the troops paid their final \nrespects to these two brave men. As Battalion Commander, LTC Steve \nRussell told the soldiers:\n\n       We will finish their mission. As long as Regulars draw \n     breath, we shall not forget them.\n\n  We will not forget them either.\n  I come to the Senate Floor today to pay tribute to one of these men--\nfellow Ohioan, SP James Powell. James lost his life on October 12, \n2003, when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle struck an anti-tank mine in \nBaji, Iraq. James was serving as a member of B Company, 1st Battalion, \n22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Hood, \nTX.\n  James grew up in Columbus. He graduated from Linden McKinley High \nSchool in 1996. Lifelong friend Adam Warrix remembers James as \n``outgoing and always looking to help someone out.''\n  After graduation, James enlisted in the Navy and served from 1997 to \n2000, as a seaman apprentice on the USS Arctic. Though he was proud of \nbeing in the Navy, James's enlistment provided him with much more than \nservice to his country--it introduced him to his best friend and love \nof his life, Ruby Mann.\n  James became friends with Ruby's brother while the two men were \nserving in the Navy together. They went to Kentucky for a hunting trip \nin September 1998, and while there, James met Ruby for the first time. \nRuby says it was love at first sight. She was so taken by James that \nshe asked him out on a date the first night he was there. James joked \nthat he would have asked her, but he was afraid she would say no \nbecause of the four inches she had on him.\n  The two went out and fell head over heels for each other. Six months \nlater, James proposed. They married in October 2000. Ruby fondly \nremembers how much they loved doing the little things at their home in \nRadcliff, KY--sleeping in on the weekends, lying together on the couch, \nand drinking coffee in the morning.\n  James and Ruby considered the birth of their daughter, Lauren, as the \ngreatest moment in their lives. James loved his daughter as much as any \nparent could. Ruby remembers how her husband used to sneak Lauren ice \ncream and their peek-a-boo matches on the couch.\n  James cried when Lauren told him ``I love you'' for the first time.\n  Determined to make a better life for his wife and daughter, James \nenlisted in the Army in January 2001. He loved nothing more than being \nwith his family, but his enlistment took him away from them for \nextended periods of time. James dealt with the separation by throwing \nhimself into his work.\n  He was sent with his unit to Iraq as part of the 4th Infantry \nDivision; its\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nbase of operations was in Tikrit. James knew the danger--especially of \nworking in Saddam Hussein's hometown. But to James, it didn't matter; \nhe had a job to do. He wanted to make the world a safer place for his \nwife and his daughter, and for all of us.\n  SP Tim Moore, who served with James in Iraq, remembered James telling \nhim how much he missed his wife and daughter and how he also missed \nhunting and fishing. He remembers that James never complained. He did \nwhat he had to do.\n  Another comrade, Captain Matt Weber, recalled that James didn't just \nput on the uniform and go to work--he knew what it truly meant to be a \nsoldier.\n  James was killed just 8 days after he received notice that he would \nbe going home. He had called Ruby to tell her the news and how excited \nhe was. James was looking forward to seeing his family and joining the \nKentucky State Police.\n  Despite the news that he would be going home, Army superiors recalled \nthat James still volunteered for a dangerous combat--the very mission \nthat would ultimately take his life. Ruby said that even if James could \nhave known what would happen, he still would have gone on that mission. \nThat is the type of person he was. That is the kind of soldier he was. \nFor his service and bravery, James was awarded the Purple Heart, the \nBronze Star, and the Combat Infantry Badge.\n  James Powell defined bravery, honor, and love of country. Indeed, he \nwas a fine soldier. But more than that, he was a strong, loving, \nsupportive father, husband, and son. I had the privilege of meeting \nJames Powell's family at the memorial service held in his honor. I \nspoke to Debra Powell, James's mother, who told me how proud she was of \nher son--how much she loved him.\n  Our Nation lost a great soldier in SP James Powell. He is an American \nhero whose memory will forever be cherished in the hearts and minds of \nall those who were privileged to know him.\n\n\n                       Corporal Andrew D. Simmons\n\n  Mr. President, an ordnance facility at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq is \nnow called Brownfield Station. The significance of this cannot be \noverstated nor should the meaning behind it be forgotten.\n  Members of the Marine Wing Support Group 374 renamed the building \nafter one of their fallen comrades--fellow Ohioan Marine Corporal \nAndrew Simmons, who also went by the name of Andrew Brownfield. Andrew \nlost his life on March 18, 2004, while serving our Nation in Iraq. He \nwas 24 years old.\n  Andrew was an ordnance man with the task of hanging bombs on planes \nand helicopters. Major Steve White, Marine casualty affairs officer in \nAkron, OH made a poignant statement regarding the new name for the \nordnance facility. This is what he said:\n\n       [This] is a reminder to the Marines in Iraq and those \n     preparing to go there that freedom is not free. Marines never \n     forget the sacrifices that were made by those who have gone \n     before us.\n\n  I rise today to pay tribute to Andrew, whose life and sacrifice \nshould remind all of us that freedom isn't free.\n  Andrew Simmons was born on October 13, 1979. Known for his quick wit \nand sense of humor, family members and friends fondly recall his \nproficiency at imitating famous movie characters. Among his favorites \nwere Billy Bob Thornton's character in the movie Slingblade, Dustin \nHoffman's character in Rainman, and Tom Hanks character in Forrest \nGump. Andrew was always the one making everyone around him laugh.\n  Andrew also had a driving desire to succeed. He grew up in Akron, OH \nand attended North High School, where he was one of the first students \nto join a training program that allowed students to divide their time \nbetween school and studying a vocation. After graduating from high \nschool in 1999, Andrew held a number of jobs but decided that what he \nreally wanted was to join the military. He wanted to be Marine and was \nso proud to be one that after boot camp he persuaded three of his \nfriends to join as well.\n  Andrew's mother Melody remembers how Andrew's attitude changed after \nhe graduated from boot camp. She said that ``he walked proud. He had \nthe Marine look, even in civilian clothes.''\n  Following the tragedy of the September 11 attacks, Andrew knew that \nhe wanted to fight against terrorism. He volunteered to go to Iraq. His \nfiance, Michell Hackworth, remembered him saying that he wanted a piece \nof the action--that he wanted to prevent any more terrorist attacks in \nthe United States, and this was his way of doing the most he could.\n  On the day he left for Iraq, Andrew called his mother from \nCalifornia, where he was stationed. He left a message on her machine. \nIn it, he perfectly imitated Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump saying, ``I love \nyou Jenny.'' Andrew also told his mother and fiance; that going to Iraq \nwas something he had to do. He felt it was his duty.\n  Without question, Andrew was an exemplary Marine. His comrades knew \nthey could trust him--they knew they could depend on him. Navy \nLieutenant James A. Bradshaw, chaplain for the Marine Wing Support \nSquadron, had this to say:\n\n       [Andrew] took a personal interest in every Marine who \n     worked with him and spent extra hours mentoring them and \n     helping them earn their rank, as well as just helping them be \n     more motivated.\n\n  Andrew and Michell had big plans for the future. Andrew used to say \nhe wanted nine sons. He wanted to relocate to Northeast Ohio. He wanted \nto become an electrician, or a law enforcement officer. Tragically, \nthose dreams will not be realized.\n  Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, Ohioans have given their \nsupport to families and friends of fallen soldiers. They have \ncontinually come together to make sure that families know they are not \nalone in their grief.\n  More than 2,000 people lined the funeral route in Akron to show their \nsupport for Andrew's family. In a moving display, people dressed in \nred, white, and blue. Some carried flags. Others held signs reading, \n``Thank you for our freedom.'' Many could not stop the tears and still \nothers waited for over an hour to pay their respects.\n  With their hands over their hearts, mourners silently followed the \nprocession to Andrew's final resting place.\n  Veterans could be seen wearing their uniforms and medals. Tom \nBulanda, a Vietnam veteran, stood at the gate of the cemetery with his \nchest covered in the medals he had earned. He came to honor a fellow \nMarine--a Marine he considers to be one of his own.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to Andrew--a debt we can never fully \nrepay. Today, we honor his memory and remember his life.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9368-S9370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HURRICANE IVAN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts at this \ntime with the Senate concerning the damages we received from the \nhurricane, ``Ivan the Terrible.''\n  It was a major hurricane. It did tremendous damage to properties and \nhouses, timber, and agricultural crops throughout the State of Alabama \nand even into our region of the United States.\n  I had the pleasure yesterday to travel with President Bush as he went \ndown to Orange Beach, AL, and the Gulf Shores areas, and we examined \nthe losses that occurred there. They are quite significant. I had flown \nover the area earlier, and it already looked a little better to me \nyesterday than it did before. The tides are still high. The water level \nin the Gulf of Mexico remained higher than for the highest tide for \nmaybe 24 hours after this storm hit because the hurricane had pushed so \nmuch water in. The water went over the beachfront areas into the \nlagoons and flooded houses on the lagoons. It blew homes down. Some \nwell-constructed homes stood up well. Most of the condominiums that are \nmultistory condominiums seemed to hold up well, but the net effect was \na major loss for many people. The homes and buildings will have to be \nstructurally examined--all of them--to make sure there is not some \nstructural damage that is not anticipated today. I am proud of the \npeople there.\n  The numbers I have received indicate there were 70 deaths in the \nCaribbean as a result of Hurricane Ivan and that, according to the \nAssociated Press, there were 52 deaths in the United States. We had \nfour deaths in Alabama. That is a very large loss of life. It is \nsomething we need to think about, to\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nsee if we can anticipate in the future these kinds of problems and \nminimize the loss of life.\n  I want to say how proud I am of the people in Alabama, from the \nsheriffs, the fire chiefs, the emergency management people, FEMA, and \nevery agency of Government that participated in the preparations \nleading up to the hurricane for the success we have had to date in \nAlabama where the storm hit.\n  Governor Riley, early on, recognized the danger of this storm. He \ninsisted that we have evacuations from the dangerous areas. People do \nnot like to leave their homes. They think they can ride these things \nout. They may remember one several years ago that was not so bad. But \nwhen a major category 3 or category 4 hurricane hits, like Ivan was, \nnobody is safe on the beaches and the low-lying areas of our State. The \nGovernor pushed hard, and people listened and moved out. For that, we \nare most grateful and thankful. It could have been so much worse.\n  First of all, I want to say, President Bush made absolutely clear \nthat the Federal Emergency Management Agency will do whatever it takes, \ncomplying with the law, to help our people in the State of Alabama.\n  Mike Brown, the Administrator at FEMA, was down. He traveled with us. \nHe has been down several days. He is going back today, I believe, to \nvisit some of the smaller towns off the beach that suffered badly also. \nWe have had a good response from the Federal Government. We find there \nare some problems. Somehow we can't get things done quite as well as we \nwould like. Of course, FEMA is dealing now with its third major \nhurricane in just a matter of weeks, so they are stretched to the \nlimits, but they are responding well. Most people are pleased with \nthat.\n  We have to have ice. We need to have the electricity on wherever \npossible. Some areas need water, and making that available is critical \nto the health and welfare of these communities.\n  I want to mention a couple things I believe are worth noting.\n  Mr. President, our colleague, Trent Lott, called me Saturday and told \nme that he had an individual from Pascagoula, MS, who had two \ntruckloads of ice he was sending over. I tried to figure out how we \nwere going to pay for it, and he said he is not asking to be paid. He \nsaid: This is from Mississippi with love. We love you. We are sending \nthis ice to you because we care about you. We know you are hurting. It \ncould have been us. We are thankful for that. We want to give this to \nyou. So I salute Mark Mavar, an individual who cared enough to send a \nlarge and valuable amount of ice to the people of Alabama.\n  Groups have come from around the country to help. I was with the \nmayor of Atmore on Friday, and he talked about people coming there from \naround the country. Today, the mayor told me that Volunteers of America \nhad served 6,000 people in his small town, and I think then 10,000 \npeople yesterday, and that maybe they would feed as many as 15,000 \ntoday. As is the case with other towns, the whole town of Atmore for \ndays has had no electricity, zero, anywhere in town.\n\n  One farmer told me he had gotten his diesel fuel tank and filled it \nup with gasoline to go around town to provide gasoline for the power \nsaws. People could not get gasoline for their power saws. The gas \nstations that were opened had lines sometimes with 100, 200 cars. In \nMonroeville, where I went through Saturday, people were lined up with \nprobably 100, 200 cars at one of the gas stations there. They are just \nbeginning to get electricity in Monroeville. Just maybe a quarter of \nthe town had it, or less. One of the fast food restaurants had it, and \nthere were probably 100 cars out there.\n  Electricity is so important to these individuals and communities. All \nof the food in their refrigerators and freezers is spoiling. It will \nhave to be thrown out. In normal conditions, you would just go down to \nthe grocery store and buy more food or you would go down to the fast \nfood restaurant and get a hamburger. But when the whole town is out, \nand it may be 30, 40, 50 miles before you can find gasoline or fast \nfood--and the lines are so long you cannot afford to spend the time \nthere--it becomes a pretty serious crisis for the people.\n  I was able to go with my friend, Bob Sharp, who is a former president \nof the Alabama Forestry Association, and he showed me and explained to \nme how our timber stands have been damaged. That is a big deal. We had \nagricultural loss--cotton, peanuts, pecans--but I do not think anything \nis going to show the damage and losses as much as in the timber \nindustry. He had a stand of pines. He said he bought the property from \na paper company. The trees had been planted, and he had thinned them \nnot long before the hurricane hit. There were substantial losses. Trees \nwere down throughout that area. He was going to manage that timber, as \nhe knew how to do, and hopefully he was going to be able to, over time, \nmake payments on that, and it was going to be his retirement.\n  He talked about a friend of his, who is the same age, who had driven \nout and looked at his timber losses and just had to sit there and cry \nwhen he saw those trees, so many of them, down. It is a real economic \nhardship for a lot of good people, but they are responding well.\n  Mayor Shell, at Atmore, is such a fine leader. He was an engineer at \none of the companies there. He is now retired. He gives his time so \nwell to lead that community.\n  I met Mayor Anne Farrish in Monroeville. She is such a wonderful \nmayor. Eddie Everett is the fire chief, and Tommy Tate is the sheriff. \nWe sat down and talked about all the trees they had lost. It is not \njust power lines being down, but a tree on top of a tree on top of a \ntree, all on top of a power line. Power poles are broken. It is going \nto take some time for them to recover.\n  I have to say another bit of good news. Alabama Power Company today \nannounced they expected to have 99 percent of the power restored in the \nState of Alabama by Friday. That is better than I would have expected. \nThat is something to be proud of.\n  As I went through Monroeville, on up the road to where I grew up, to \nthe little family house I grew up in, trees were all across that road. \nThey had been cut and moved off the road to a degree. Sometimes you had \nto curve around them. This is a State highway, and the sheriff, Tommy \nTate, told me one of the people in the timber business there took his \nown equipment and spent the day going up and down that road clearing \nthat road so traffic could go through there.\n  It took a day or two to get that done. That is the kind of spirit of \nwhich I am proud. As I went through my community, I passed a company \nworking on the power line. I stopped to thank them and asked them where \nthey were from. They were from Indiana. They were a cable TV company. \nThey had a crew that could handle clearing and improving lines. They \nwere down in rural Alabama helping. From all over, Oklahoma, other \nplaces, these companies are there.\n  Nothing is more important to the recovery of a community than getting \nelectricity on. We should salute and thank the people who have come \nfrom around the country, as well as the Alabama Power Company employees \nwho are working their hearts out to get that power back on. We have \nelectric cooperatives that are also doing the same thing.\n  It is not just the Alabama Power Company. So many companies are \nhelping. I salute them. I thank them.\n  When I was talking to that company from Indiana, way out there in the \nrural areas of Alabama, I asked them: How long are you going to be \nworking today? They said: There is a substation down the road, and we \nare going to try to get there by midnight tonight. They are working \nuntil midnight.\n  That is the kind of hours people are putting in. There is no place \nwith electricity for them to spend the night or to get a hot meal, \nunless somebody in the community provides it. They are performing at an \nextremely high level which makes us all proud.\n  We are going to come out of this. We have a long way to go. People's \nhomes are damaged all over. At the home I grew up in, a big oak tree \ncrashed down on the little garage there and smashed it flat and knocked \na couple of holes in our house. That was small. If you go out further, \nyou see a huge pine tree cutting off a part of a house, and people are \nthanking the good Lord they were not injured. You see people there who \nhad 6 inches to 8 inches of water in their house and flooding during \nthe\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\nrain that came with this hurricane. You begin to count your blessings. \nThey were counting theirs. They weren't complaining.\n  People whose home flooded had a young child there. The tree hit their \nroof. They were thankful. I saw a person who was working in the yard, \nand I went up to him to speak and said: Do you live here?\n  He said: No, this is my friend, and we didn't have any real damage at \nmy house, just lost some shingles, so I am here helping him.\n  I saw people with power saws cutting trees. A timber company had \ncherry picker equipment that was lifting one of the logs off a house \nfor no charge, just to help a neighbor be able to seal up the house so \nthe rain won't do damage to it.\n  Those are the kinds of things that make this a great country. It does \nnot require the direction of somebody from Washington, DC. It does not \nrequire direction from Montgomery, AL, or even the counties. But in the \nvery communities and neighborhoods of our country live some of the \nfinest people the world has ever known. They know how to stand up and \nmake decisions, utilize equipment, take care of their neighbors, and \nhelp one another who are in need. They do that on a daily basis in this \ncrisis.\n  I am proud beyond words to represent them. Yes, the Federal \nGovernment has a role. We expect them to fulfill that. The State of \nAlabama has a role, and the county and city governments have a role. \nThey are working hard. I have talked to those mayors. I have talked to \nthe leaders in the communities, and they are working hard. They are \nintense. They are alert. They are insisting that things be done. They \nare insisting that if they need some equipment and it is available, \nthey get it. I am proud of that kind of leadership. That is perfectly \nlegitimate.\n  Fundamentally, the people are responding well. The power will be \nturned back on. FEMA will come around, under the supervision of the \nCorps of Engineers, and pick up all the limbs and trees that are there. \nThese are not just small trees. Some of them are huge, representing \nmany loads just to haul off the wood product of one major oak tree or \none big pine tree. It is going to take months to get all that done. But \nthe system has been proven. We need to refine it and make it better. \nBut it will work. This relief will apply not just to the people who \nhave houses on the beach but to every town and community in the State.\n\n  I was pleased to see Mr. Brown make that comment just today on the \nnational news media. I talked to him about it. It is not just the \npeople on the beaches who were hurt but in Atmore and Brewton and \nMonroeville, Frisco City, Evergreen, Greenville, and Camden, my \nhometown where I went to school.\n  I talked to Mayor Henrietta Blackmon there today. She is struggling \nto get some electricity. They just got a little bit in town, and they \nare excited about that. They will be able to have gasoline provided. \nSome of the restaurants have electricity so people can get a hot meal. \nThat was good news. That is the kind of thing they are doing.\n  They are worried about the nursing home. Generators are keeping that \ngoing right now so far. Her husband is a doctor there, and the hospital \nis getting by on a generator. Linden, Thomasville, Jackson, all these \ncommunities were hard hit. Birmingham, much further up the State, had \nsubstantial power outages, and the storm continued on north. We have \nhad flooding in West Virginia and many deaths.\n  Whatever else a storm such as Ivan teaches us, it teaches us that we \ndon't control our fate. We are just here a short period of time in this \nlife; our lives are but a vapor, the Scriptures say. We can't control \nthe winds and waves, as my daughter e-mailed me. That is controlled by \na higher power. We are called upon to love our neighbors, take care of \nour communities, and help one another. I believe that is happening in \nmy State to a degree that makes me very proud.\n  We are going to get through it. We are going to stay together. We are \ngoing to be a better State when it is over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9370-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9370-S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE SHOT ANTELOPE HUNT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes and talk \nabout a historic event that just reoccurred in Wyoming this last \nweekend. We just completed another weekend of the One Shot Antelope \nHunt. This is one of the earliest competitions in America. It is a \ncontinuing one. It has been done annually since 1939. I know about it \nbecause my grandfather told me about it. He considered it to be one of \nthe great competitions. They allow 2,400 hunters to be a part of it \neach year. It is tied in with some conservation efforts.\n  I would like to thank a few people for putting this on each year in \nLander, WY. The president this year was Scott Harnsberger. They are \nhelped by the Shoshone Tribe. Chief Norm St. Clair did the blessing of \nthe bullets. Medicine man Willie LeClair provided the medicine bags. My \ngreeter was Rick Fagmont.\n  He is a CPA, and I appreciated that since I am the only accountant in \nthe Senate. The sheriff, Skip Horneker, was my guide for the hunt.\n  As I mentioned, my grandfather had told me about this hunt, and I \nstarted hunting with him when I was about 6 years old. We would go out \nand take this rifle he had and sight it in. At that time, it was his \nintention for me to some day have that rifle. As we would sight it in, \nhe would take three shots and we would check the target, and then he \nwould say this is shooting 4 inches high and 4 inches to the right. As \nlong as that is happening, don't change anything. If you change it, it \nwill never be the same again. I am pleased to tell you that 54 years \nlater it has never been changed. It still shoots 4 inches high and 4 \ninches to the right. That is the rifle I took on this hunt.\n  When I sighted it in--and they have professionals there to make sure \nyou have it right--I told them it is 4 inches high and 4 inches to the \nright and that I would not change it. My first shot was 4 inches high \nand 4 inches to the right. After I compensated that, the second shot \nwas right in the bullseye.\n  Part of this organization provides water for wildlife. Many people \nwould not know that Wyoming is high desert. Most of it gets less than \n16 inches of rainfall a year. Yet we have a lot of wildlife. We have an \nincrease in the amount of wildlife because the hunters of the State \nhave been concerned about it, are working on it, and have provided \ndifferent methods that improve habitat for wildlife, none of which \nhelps it more than water. There are people who would claim that in some \nplaces in Wyoming, if you saw an antelope, it would be carrying a water \nbottle because it would be so far from water.\n  They worked very hard during the year to get contributions and \nplanned water projects in places to be particularly helpful to the \nwildlife. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Sportsmans Caucus, \nwhich is a group of sportsmen in the Senate and in the House that works \nall year long to watch out for legislation that helps conservation and \nthat provides greater access for hunters and sportsmen. It involves \nMembers of the Senate and House in the outdoor sports. So those who \nhave not had an opportunity to see them will have an opportunity to see \nwhat they can do.\n  A favorite quote of mine is that ``it is better to take your child \nhunting than to be hunting for your child.'' Fortunately, there are not \nonly parents involved in this activity, but there are a lot of people \nwho adopt kids for this kind of activity. It makes a great difference \nin Wyoming, and I expect it makes a great difference throughout the \ncountry.\n  It was a great pleasure to take part in this annual event and to see \nthe people who have participated for years. It was a great time for me \nto remember my grandfather and all of the lessons he gave me as I grew \nup, not only in the area of hunting or fishing, but the respect that \ngrew out of those activities that allows me to talk about absolutely \nanything. So while my grandfather passed away a number of years ago, in \na sense I just finished having a great weekend with my grandfather.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is on ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEDICATION OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, over the weekend, South Dakota honored \na debt long overdue.\n  With the dedication of the South Dakota Korean War Memorial on the \ncapitol grounds in Pierre, our State paid tribute to the extraordinary \nheroism of those men and women who defended freedom and democracy on \nthe Korean peninsula.\n  More than 1.8 million Americans fought in the Korean war, facing some \nof the fiercest fighting the world has ever seen.\n  More than 36,500 soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in this effort, \nincluding nearly 200 South Dakotans. Another 103,000 Americans were \nwounded.\n  The cause for which they fought, and the freedom they won, is clear \ntoday for all to see.\n  On the south side of the 38th parallel lives a prosperous, free \nnation, fully welcomed into the family of nations.\n  On the north side, 22 million Koreans live under tyranny and in \nhunger.\n  The regime is rightly condemned for its abuse of its own citizens and \ntheir fundamental rights, and is an international outcast due to its \nspreading of missile technology and weapons-of-mass-destruction \ntechnology throughout the world.\n  The map shows nothing more than a line separating the two. But in a \nreal sense, what separates North from South Korea is the heroism of the \nAmerican soldiers who fought there.\n  Several years ago, under the direction of Sheila Hansen, a teacher in \nthe Spearfish Middle school, the children of South Dakota set out to \ntell the stories of each of the 2,200 South Dakotans who gave their \nlives in World War II.\n  The project is called Fallen Heroes, and the stories of heroism these \nchildren uncovered taught all South Dakotans a lesson about the true \nmeaning of patriotism and service.\n  Recently, Sheila Hansen asked her class to do the same for those \nSouth Dakotans who gave their lives in the Korean war.\n  I commend and thank Sheila and her eighth grade class at Spearfish \nMiddle School, as well as Stanley County Middle School teacher Shirley \nSwanson, whose seventh grade class joined in the effort.\n  Together, the students prepared biographical profiles for those South \nDakotans who lost their lives in service to their country during the \nKorean war.\n  One of the young men and women profiled was Walter Baptist LaPointe, \nfrom Mosher, SD.\n  Walter was the youngest of eight children born to Albert and \nElizabeth Ringing Shield LaPointe.\n  Like so many Native Americans in South Dakota and across our country, \nWalter felt an obligation to serve his country.\n  Walter enlisted at the age of 19 and was sent overseas in 1951. Just \n4 months after arriving in Korea, Walter was killed in an intense \nfirefight near Homang-ni. He was awarded a posthumous Silver Star for \n``gallantry in action'' and I would like to read from his citation.\n  It says:\n\n       As Company F attacked Hill 347, Private LaPointe moved \n     ahead of the company line, seeking out and firing on enemy \n     emplacements.\n       Ignoring the intense fire the foe was directing on the \n     area, Private LaPointe displayed superb courage and \n     determination by advancing whenever possible and setting up \n     his weapon in unprotected but commanding positions.\n       He bravely continued in this manner, providing much needed \n     automatic weapons fire for his comrades, until mortally \n     wounded. Private LaPointe's gallantry reflects the highest \n     credit on himself and the military service.\n\n  Walter was buried at the Advent Cemetery near his home in Mosher. His \nmother Elizabeth was touched by the warmth local veterans displayed at \nher son's passing.\n  The following Spring, Elizabeth decided to serve lunch to the local \nAmerican Legion Post. She decided to make it a tradition, and each year \nsince the Legion Post in Mosher has enjoyed a luncheon served by the \nLaPointe family.\n  Even after Elizabeth's passing, the tradition continues, and still \ntoday the members of the local Legion Post know the enduring gratitude \nof the LaPointe family.\n  Many friendships have been built over the years and a special \nconnection between the family and Mosher's veteran community has grown. \nSpeaking of the tradition, a family member recently said:\n\n       In this manner, we will forever preserve [Walter's] memory.\n\n  Indeed, they have done much more than that. With their generosity, \nthey have strengthened the ties of friendship between the citizens of \nSouth Dakota and the men and women who fight to protect them. They have \nshown our veterans that their service will never be forgotten.\n  This, too, is the ultimate contribution of the Fallen Heroes project \nand the South Dakota Korean War Memorial dedicated this past Saturday.\n  Because our country was still war-weary from the end of World War II, \nfew returning Korean war veterans were greeted with the ticker-tape \nparades and community celebrations that were common after World War II. \nThe Korean war became known as the Forgotten War.\n  For the 12,000 Korean war veterans still living in South Dakota, and \nall those with whom they served, we have a simple message--you will \nnever be forgotten.\n  The statue that stands on the capitol grounds in Pierre will be an \nenduring reminder of your contribution.

Mr. President, every event memorable enough to be recorded \nbecomes a part of history. But some events define and shape history \nwith the force of plate tectonics, moving the world onto a new path. On \nSeptember 17, 1787, just such an event occurred when the Constitution \nof the United States was signed.\n  I hold this Constitution in my hand.\n  With the adoption of this document, a new and powerful nation was \ncreated. That Nation, our Nation, still guided by the powerful hand of \nGod in many ways and certainly still guided by the governmental \nstructure laid out in this Constitution, is the heavyweight champion of \nworld politics and the global economy. Actions of our Government \ninfluence world events with a speed and force of a category 5 \nhurricane.\n  The Declaration of Independence was historic. And I have it, too, \nhere in my little book which I carry in my shirt pocket--the \nDeclaration of Independence. The signers of that Declaration of \nIndependence committed treason against the king. And those brave men--\nand they were men--who signed the Declaration of Independence, any one \nof them, each of them, could have been arrested, thrown into prison, \nsent to England in chains, and executed.\n  So we ought to ponder those men, their lives and those documents that \nthey signed. We don't often enough think about the sacrifices they \nmade, the risks they were willing to take as they pledged their lives \nand their fortunes and their sacred honor.\n  The Declaration of Independence was historic, for without it and the \nevents that it set in motion there would be no fledgling United States \nof America.\n  The surrender at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, was also historic, \nmarking the successful conclusion of the War for Independence. Without \nthat surrender, there would be no United\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nStates. But the early days of our new Republic were difficult ones, \nburdened with war debts and hampered by the weak and ineffective \nstructure that was the Confederation Government. The Nation was \nindependent but not truly united. The central Government was weak, \nrelative to the State governments, dependent on whatever contribution \nthe States chose to make. The national Government could not speak \nconvincingly as the official voice of the whole Nation. It was not \nuntil the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia completed its work \nand constructed in less than 100 days a strong yet flexible \ngovernmental structure that our young Nation was ready to make a name \nfor itself on the world stage.\n  Our Constitution is a remarkable document--truly remarkable, this \nConstitution which I hold in my hand. It is remarkable for its \nsimplicity, and it is remarkable for its astute understanding of human \nnature. The governmental structure that was devised in Philadelphia did \nnot depend on extraordinary men in order to work but, rather, the \nsystem relied upon the ambitions of many ordinary men to check and \nbalance each other, keeping any one man or any one branch of Government \nfrom becoming another tyrant like King George.\n  The Framers of the Constitution put the greatest power where? In the \npeople and in their elected representatives--like you and you and you \nand me--and made those representatives responsible and responsive to \nthe people. That is why, every 2 years, the entire membership of the \nHouse of Representatives and one-third of the membership of the Senate \nface the people--face the people--in an election. The President, as \nwill happen later this year, faces the people every 4 years. Only \njudges, who must remain independent and free from such public \npressures, are appointed for life.\n  The Framers also put a premium on civilian control of the military. \nNow, we ought to remember that. We hear all these sayings about the \nCommander in Chief--the Commander in Chief. And some speak with awe of \nthe Commander in Chief. But the Commander in Chief is only the \nCommander in Chief of the Army, the Navy, and the militia, when it is \ncalled into service. But who creates an army? The Commander in Chief \nwould not have any army over which to be commander if the Congress--\nthis House and the other body--did not create an army and provide for a \nnavy and provide for the calling up of the militia. It is the Congress, \nyou see.\n  So the Framers put a premium on civilian control of the military. \nAgain, this reflected their desire to prevent a military dictatorship \nfrom arising. They did not want a President to act as a king, ordering \narmies to war in remote lands on his say-so alone. Nor did they want a \npowerful general to seize political power. In their day, and for the \nfirst century of our history, the United States did not have a large \nstanding army, only a small navy and marine corps. In the event of an \ninvasion, citizens were expected to grab their guns and form a militia, \nas was done in the Revolution.\n  The Congress would call up the militia, which only then would be led \nby the President in his role as Commander in Chief. The President is \nnot the Commander in Chief of industry. He is not the Commander in \nChief of the Senate. He is not the Commander in Chief of Congress. The \nCongress, under the Constitution, provides for the military. Congress \nis the paymaster, just as the Roman Senate was the paymaster in the \ndays of ancient Rome. No consul could pay his legions of Roman soldiers \nunless the Roman Senate provided therefore.\n  So Congress is the paymaster, the armorer, and the rulemaking body \nfor the military--not the President, not the Commander in Chief, nor \nhis generals. The President commands the militia only when the militia \nis called into action by Congress or when necessary to repel an \ninvasion. The Framers ensured that the people--the first three words in \nthe preamble of this Constitution, which I hold in my hand, are: ``We \nThe People.'' That is you; that is you; that is you; that is you; that \nis you, that is you. ``We The People.'' That is you, the people out \nthere over the broad hills and valleys and mountains of this great \nNation who are watching through these electronic eyes and hearing the \nwords that are being spoken on the floor of the Senate--the people. The \nFramers ensured that the people, through their elected Representatives \nin Congress would control the military so that it could not become a \ntool of Government repression against their own people or a way for \nPresidents to lead the Nation into foreign misadventures.\n\n  The Framers created a barebones governmental structure--a barebones \ngovernmental structure. All rights not expressly given to the Federal \nGovernment were to be left to the States and to the people. In the \ncourse of ratifying the Constitution, however, it became clear that \nmany people wanted to have these rights codified. And so from this \nsentiment came the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. How many \nwords are there in the preamble and the original Constitution? How many \nwords? There are 4,379 words in the preamble and the Constitution, as \nit was signed by the Framers. And then later came the first 10 \namendments, and they are known to us as the Bill of Rights. How many \nwords, then, are there in the preamble and the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights? There are 4,861 words. How few are those words, how \nfew.\n  And so the first 10 amendments, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, \ninclude the familiar freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of \nworship, the right to a speedy trial, the right to bear arms, and \nothers. These rights and freedoms, too, had their immediate roots in \nthe prerevolutionary treatment of the colonists by the tyrant king. If \nthe Constitution is the bones of our national body, then the Bill of \nRights must be its heart and soul. These rights are what the colonists \nfought for, the things for which they were willing to risk losing their \nlives and their property and their fortunes.\n  These rights are what set the United States above other nations, what \nmake the United States such a shining beacon--such a shining beacon--\nfor the peoples of other nations to aspire to and to establish for \nthemselves. Our ideals of freedom, set forth and realized in our \nConstitution, are our greatest export to the world. How about that. \nThose of you who are sharpest on foreign trade, those of you who pride \nyourselves on being trade experts, what is the greatest export? What is \nthe greatest export of the United States? Well, our ideals of freedom, \nrealized in the Constitution, are our greatest export to the world.\n  For more than 200 years, our Constitution has demonstrated its unique \nadaptability. The Nation has grown and changed in ways that the Framers \nwould not have imagined, whatever their greatest hopes and ambitions \nfor the Nation might have been. Our national interests and \nresponsibilities engage us in activities and places that span the \nglobe. We possess a military that is unmatched in size and capability. \nOur military spending outstrips most of the rest of the world combined. \nWhy? We wonder why. That is food for thought on another day.\n  Our technology, our culture, our humanitarian goodwill reach out into \nthe most remote areas of the world. But our Constitution, despite all \nthese societal changes, continues to provide a government structure \nthat allows us to manage these great enterprises while protecting the \nindividual rights that each of us is guaranteed in the Constitution and \nits Bill of Rights. Only we--not somebody out there from Mars, some \ndistant planet, only we can erode those rights or change that \nstructure. Our greatest enemy is not armed with guns, you see; our \ngreatest enemy is our own ignorance and our own inattention to the \nConstitution, this great legacy.\n  Last Friday marked the 217th anniversary of the Constitution's \nsigning. I doubt that many Americans celebrated or even took heed to \nthat occasion, and that is a mistake. For September 17 is more \nimportant to our everyday lives than Columbus Day, more important to \nour everyday lives than Thanksgiving, more important to our everyday \nlives than the Fourth of July. Our flag is precious to us. There it \nstands, majestic. How inspiring, that flag. Our flag is precious to \nus--and never more so than in the days after September 11, 2001. Our \nflag is celebrated every June 14, but our Constitution is more \nimportant than that flag by far.\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\n  The flag is a potent symbol of our Nation, but this Constitution \nwhich I hold in my hand is the soul of the Nation. The Constitution is \nthe foundation upon which each stone of our governmental structure is \nlaid. It is our bedrock. It touches every day of your lives, I say to \nthe pages on both sides of the Chair. This Constitution touches every \nday, every hour, every minute of your lives. Practically everything you \ndo is made possible by or is guaranteed or is protected by this \nConstitution. It is the prism through which each act of our Government \nshould be examined and judged. If such an understanding were in place, \nwe would not have to question aspects of the PATRIOT Act that might \nthreaten privacy and due process rights of Americans because those \nelements would not have been included. But in our fear of terrorism and \ndue to our inattention to the Constitution, we were stampeded into \nlegislation that erodes some of your rights, some of every citizen's \nrights. Every time the executive assumes powers that are not challenged \nby the Congress, and every time Congress gives up its powers to the \nexecutive, our Constitution is eroded, and we come one step closer to \ntyranny when that happens, one step closer to the dictatorship of the \nexecutive.\n\n  I believe the Constitution deserves greater prominence in our \nnational life. A survey conducted by Portrait of America in 2000 \nfound--now think of this; I just couldn't believe it until I read it \nmyself--that only half of Americans, just 51 percent, would vote for \nthe passage of the U.S. Constitution if it were presented in ballot \nform today. That is incredible. Some 22 percent of respondents would \nvote against the Constitution. I will tell you, that is about enough to \nmake your hair stand on end. And 27 percent were not sure if they would \nsupport it. Those are eye-opening findings. I say they are hair-\nraising, hair-curling findings. That ought to curl your hair. If you \ndon't have any, it ought to make your hair grow where there is none. \nTwenty-seven percent were not sure if they would support it. Those are \neye-opening findings, to be sure.\n  While some attribute this outcome to a general disaffection with \nGovernment, I believe that the survey findings are the result of \nignorance. Too many citizens do not know what the Constitution does. \nMany citizens revere the Constitution, but they don't know what is in \nit. Many Members of this body really don't know what is in the \nConstitution. They have read some portion. If they are lawyers, they \nmight be very familiar with this portion or that portion, this \namendment or that one, but to know about the Constitution, what is in \nit, what it does, many of us are ignorant. Even fewer know why the \nConstitution was designed the way it was.\n  Most people do not appreciate all of the safeguards created by the \nFramers to prevent our new government from becoming like a colonial \ngovernment, subject to the whims of a tyrant. They do not understand \nwhat the checks and balances in our governmental structure are meant to \ndo, nor the importance of maintaining those checks and balances.\n  Frankly, there are too many Members of Congress who do not appear to \nunderstand or appreciate those checks and balances. When it comes to \nthe Executive, too many Members of this body want to side with the \nExecutive. They are monarchists, I would say. They almost look upon the \nPresident as a king. As a result, over the years, the power of the \nlegislative branch has eroded, while the power of the executive branch \nhas grown. Congress has ceded much of its power, and it does so \nwillingly. It has ceded much of its power willingly to the Executive, \nto the point that we have few tools remaining with which to rein in an \nautocratic Executive.\n  When the Constitution was circulated for ratification in 1787, there \nwas active political debate. Pamphlets were written and essays were \nwritten. The Constitution was a topic of conversation around dinner \ntables and at public meeting places. The Federalist Papers were widely \nprinted, widely read, widely discussed. They were the centerpiece of \nthe debate over the form of this new government. I doubt that one could \ntoday find many people outside of collegiate American history and \npolitics majors who have read the Federalist Papers. In these days of \ntelevision, radio, and movies, we no longer have the quiet evenings of \ndiscussion that the Founders knew. We are too busy with pseudo \n``reality'' shows to spend time worrying about our own reality, our own \ngovernment.\n  Without such a national debate, the results of a similar survey in \n1787 might have been the same as in 2000. As a nation, we are fortunate \nsuch a debate took place. The 2000 survey shows unequivocally that \ngreater knowledge about our Constitution is needed.\n  I believe a necessary step in raising the profile of the Constitution \ninvolves giving it equal billing with Christopher Columbus, with Flag \nDay, and with the Fourth of July. September 17, the anniversary of the \nsigning of the Constitution, should be declared a national holiday. And \nso, Mr. President, on Wednesday of last week I submitted to the desk \nlegislation to do just that. That legislation would declare September \n17 ``Constitution Day'' and would encourage citizens to observe the day \nwith appropriate ceremonies, including a reading of the Constitution. \nCurrently, September 17 is designated ``Citizenship Day,'' recognizing \nall who, by birth or by naturalization, are citizens of the United \nStates. Citizenship in our great Nation is certainly a worthy topic, \nand it merits recognition. But more importantly, I believe, this is the \ndocument that establishes the duties and rights of citizenship, the \ndocument that establishes this Nation as one in which all people may \naspire to become citizens--the Constitution of the United States.\n  My hope is that observances of Constitution Day would encourage all \ncitizens to learn more about the Constitution and their government. An \ninformed public is our best defense against tyranny.\n  I know that it is late in the legislative session to introduce \nlegislation, but I hope the calendar will not deter the Congress from \ntaking up and adopting this legislation. It is not a partisan matter. \nThe Constitution is there for all Americans, regardless of their \npolitical party, irrespective of whatever political events might be on \nthe calendar. In fact, it might be more important because of the \nupcoming election.\n  During election years, it becomes even more vital that all Americans \nlook at the candidates and ask themselves which one will best support \nand defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. As \nAmericans exercise the fundamental right to choose their \nrepresentatives, they participate in the enduring system of government \nset forth in the Constitution. It is fitting and appropriate that we \nhonor the document that established this government, and that we as a \nnation take steps to ensure that our Constitution and our system of \ngovernment are known, understood, and cherished by the people they were \nestablished to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9373-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9373-S9377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to the vote on passage of the bill. The 5 \nminutes on the Democratic side has already been consumed.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 5 minutes. The minority \nside has exhausted its time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from California get 2\\1/2\\ minutes of the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a bill that is cut and dried. \nMy distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein, and I have worked very \nclosely on this bill. We are in agreement on its\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\npriorities. I think it is a good bill for the military construction of \nour country.\n  I don't need to go over the details of the bill. Here is the bottom \nline: We are trying to fund the necessary military construction that \nwill give a better quality of life and better facilities to those who \nare doing the job we are asking them to do. It is a pretty important \njob. They are protecting the freedom we enjoy today. It is that simple.\n  Our bill has prioritized housing, facilities where people will be \ntrained, and especially Guard and Reserve units. In the past, I think \nwe have shortchanged our Guard and Reserve. But we now see how \nimportant our Guard and Reserve are, how much they are doing for our \ncountry. They are being called in record numbers, and they are stepping \nto the plate and doing their job. So we have focused on a bill that \nwould give more of our Guard and Reserve better facilities, which they \nso richly deserve.\n\n  We have more child development centers because we have more families \nin the military than before. We have more hospitals and medical \nfacilities because, of course, we want to make sure we have proper \nmedical treatment for our young men and women who are in our Armed \nForces and for their families. So I think we have taken our allocation, \nwhich is $10 billion, and we have prioritized it to make a better \nquality of life for those who are giving their lives for our freedom. I \nthink it is a good bill, and I am proud to ask my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. It \nis always a great privilege for me to work with her. Her leadership has \nbeen superb, and I can easily say I agree with everything she has just \nso well stated.\n  The chairman mentioned that this is a $10 billion bill. It is up 2.5 \npercent over last year. It funds environmental remediation. There is \n$4.5 billion for Active-Duty military construction, $1 billion for new \nbarracks, and $814 million for Reserve component facilities. That is 31 \npercent greater than the President's budget request. It includes $361 \nmillion for BRAC environmental cleanup, including revenue from Navy \nland sales, and $188 million for medical and dental clinics and \nhospitals. The bill also includes $4.2 billion--more than 40 percent of \nthe total funding--for improved family housing for service members and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I would be very hopeful that the \nSenate would accept it unanimously. Again, I thank the chair for her \nleadership. I thank the majority staff and the minority staff as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the pending Military Construction \nappropriations bill for FY 2005--S. 2674--as reported by the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations, provides $10.003 billion in budget \nauthority and $9.995 billion outlays in FY 2005. This amount is $449 \nmillion above the President's request. It matches the 302(b) \nallocations adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee and is $159 \nmillion more than FY 2004 enacted level.

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support passage of the fiscal year 2005 \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Act. This bill provides $10 \nbillion in funding for important military construction activities \nincluding base housing and the construction and maintenance of base \ninfrastructure. Amazingly, this report contains only 35 earmarks \ntotaling $44.7 million, which is significantly less than the \napproximately $80 million in unauthorized earmarks contained in last \nyear's appropriations bill.\n  Although 70 percent of these earmarks are directed to the States of \nappropriators, I applaud the Military Construction Subcommittee for \ntheir generally clean bill. I am particularly pleased by the language \nin the report that specifically states that the committee has provided \nconstruction funds only for projects that were included in the Senate-\npassed version of the fiscal year 2005 Defense Authorization Act, \ncurrently pending in conference. This appropriations bill is a good \nexample of how the legislative process is expected to work, wherein the \nwork of the authorizers is fully taken into account by the \nappropriators. I hope this can be emulated by all appropriations \nsubcommittees and authorizing committees.\n  As we progress towards the scheduled base closure and realignment \nround in 2005, I am encouraged to see that my colleagues have resisted \nthe temptation to add pork to bases in their States in what would be a \nmisguided effort to save their bases base closure. Such efforts would \nbe a waste of taxpayer money and would not prevent their base from \nbeing closed.\n  In an effort to contain the wasteful spending inherent in Member-\nrequested construction projects. I sponsored, and the Senate adopted, \nmerit-based criteria for evaluating member add-ons as a part of the \nfiscal year 1995 Defense Authorization Act. The criteria are: No. 1, \nthe project is in the service's future years defense plan; No. 2, the \nproject is mission essential; No. 3, the project does not conflict with \nbase realignment proposals; No. 5, the service can offset the proposed \nexpenditure within that year's budget request.\n  These criteria have been useful in ferreting out programs or projects \nof questionable merit, and in determining the relative priority of \nprojects that have been requested by Members for strictly parochial \nreasons, often at the expense of the readiness of our Armed Forces. \nUnfortunately, in the years that these criteria have been in place, no \noffsets have been provided for any project.\n  All of the 35 earmarks, totaling $44.7 million, are under the minor \nconstruction account. Normally, this account is intended to be used for \nurgent and unforeseen requirements and, therefore, neither the \nPresident's budget nor the authorizing committees identify specific \nprojects to be funded. Once the services decide to spend the money, the \nauthorizing and appropriations committees must approve or disapprove of \nthe minor construction project to which the services plan to fund. By \nearmarking the funds in the minor construction account, the \nappropriators have usurped the authority of the authorizing committee \nto approve or reject these projects.\n  I commend the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, \nSenator Hutchison, and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for their \nwork on this bill and their continued support for our military. Their \nattention and commitment to only supporting high-priority projects for \nthe Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force is once again exemplary and \nprovide for a sound measure to fund military construction in the coming \nfiscal year.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is, \nShall the bill, as amended, pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

BROTZMAN\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof a dear friend, Donald G. Brotzman, distinguished former Colorado \nCongressman who represented Boulder in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. Congressman Brotzman passed away on September 15 at \nthe age of 82 in Alexandria, VA.\n  Don Brotzman was a friend to all who knew him. Highly respected and a \nman of immense character, he always had time for everyone. His wise \ncounsel was constantly sought by leaders and friends.\n  Don served in the Colorado State House of Representatives from 1952 \nto 1954 and in the State Senate from 1954 to 1956. In 1959, President \nDwight D. Eisenhower appointed Don as U.S. attorney for Colorado. \nCongressman Brotzman served in the U.S. House of Representatives from \n1963 to 1965 and again from 1967 to 1975. In 1975, President Gerald R. \nFord appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and \nReserve Affairs. He served 2 years in that position and was credited \nwith helping lead the way for the implementation of the ``all-volunteer \narmy.''\n  Don was born on a farm near Sterling, CO. He served in the U.S. Army \nin the Pacific theater during World War II. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Colorado Schools of Business and Law where he had begun \nhis undergraduate work before the war on a football scholarship. He was \nan All Big Eight middle linebacker for the Colorado Buffaloes.\n  Don Brotzman was preceded in death by his wife of 51 years, Louise \nReed Brotzman, who died in 1995. He leaves behind his wife, Gwendolyn \nDavis Brotzman of Alexandria, whom he married in 1996; two children \nfrom his first marriage, Kathy Caldwell of Longmont, CO, and Donald G. \n``Chip'' Brotzman Jr. of Carbondale, CO; a stepson, Robert Higgins of \nPhilippi, WV; a brother; and six grandchildren.\n  We will miss this good man, Don Brotzman. I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring World War II veteran and Congressman \nDonald G. Brotzman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9378-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9378-S9379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL \n                                 NEEDS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to bring an important matter to \nthe attention of my colleagues. As we all know, the No Child Left \nBehind Act, NCLB, requires an important shift in accountability for our \nNation's public schools. It requires our schools to look at the \nachievement of all students, including students in several \ntraditionally under-performing subgroups such as students with special \nneeds.\n  Our goal in passing this law was to make sure that no child was left \nbehind to send a clear message that all American children deserve a \nworld-class education. To do that, we required accountability for \nresults, expanded local control and flexibility, emphasized the \nimportance of valid and reliable educational tools, and expanded \nparental involvement. We also required schools to show, through \ntransparent processes, sufficient progress for all students, including \nminorities, low-income students and students with disabilities.\n  Today I am submitting for the record an August 30, 2004, New York \nTimes article that contains troubling information about how NCLB is \nbeing implemented for students with special needs. This article, \n``School Achievement Reports Often Exclude the Disabled,'' by Diana \nJean Schemo, illustrates that some States are skirting the law in ways \nthat are leaving students with disabilities behind.\n  According to Schemo and the education officials who corroborated her \nobservations, some States have raised the minimum number of disabled \nstudents that must be enrolled before the school has to report on their \nprogress as a separate group. And some States do not break down the \ntest scores for disabled students on school report cards. A number of \nStates even classify special education schools as programs, not \nschools, therefore exempting them from accountability.\n  This report is deeply troubling because it makes it impossible for \nparents to evaluate the effectiveness of their children's schools, and \nultimately, could lead to children with special needs being ignored as \nthey too often were in the past.\n  Over 25 years ago, Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, a landmark education and civil rights law that ensured \nthat all students--including the 6 million with disabilities--receive \nquality services in our Nation's public schools. This body has worked \nhard to reauthorize the IDEA because we continue to believe strongly in \nthe notion that every child with special needs has the right to a free, \nappropriate, public education. The spirit and the letter of the No \nChild Left Behind Act builds on that promise, and it is my hope that \nwith better implementation, it will be realized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 30, 2004]\n\n         School Achievement Reports Often Exclude the Disabled\n\n                         (By Diana Jean Schemo)\n\n       The first time Tyler Brenneise, a 10-year-old who is \n     autistic and mildly retarded, took the same state achievement \n     tests as California's nondisabled children, his mother, \n     Allison, anxiously awaited the results, along with the state \n     report card on his special education school, the Del Sol \n     Academy, in San Diego. But when the California Department of \n     Education issued its annual report on school performance \n     several months later, Del Sol Academy was nowhere to be \n     found. Ms. Brenneise wrote state officials asking why. ``They \n     wrote back,'' she said, ``that the school doesn't exist.''\n       That is because San Diego labels Del Sol a program, not a \n     school, said Karen Bachoffer, spokeswoman for the San Diego \n     schools. And like most other states, California does not \n     provide report cards for programs that educate disabled \n     children.\n       ``He doesn't count,'' Ms. Brenneise said. ``He's left \n     behind.''\n       The problem is not confined to California. Around the \n     country, states and school districts are sidestepping the \n     spirit, and sometimes the letter, of the federal No Child \n     Left Behind Education Act when it comes to recording their \n     successes and failures in teaching disabled youngsters.\n       Federal officials have acknowledged permitting a growing \n     number of states to exclude many special education students \n     from reports on school progress, on the grounds that they \n     account for only a small portion of enrollment.\n       But a review of state education records shows that some \n     states and districts are going far beyond this measure to \n     avoid disclosing the quality of the education they provide to \n     such students.\n       Some exempt schools for disabled students. Still others \n     simply do not disclose basic information required by the \n     federal law, for example the percentage of disabled education \n     students who graduate from high school, and about 10 states \n     have not been fully reporting how students do on achievement \n     tests tailored to disabled students, federal officials say. \n     New York City's all-special-education district of 20,000 \n     mentally or physically disabled students, District 75, gives \n     only fragments of the information the federal law requires \n     for accountability, reporting schools ``in good standing'' \n     despite dismal results.\n       The trend toward avoiding accountability is alarming \n     advocates for the nation's six million disabled students, who \n     see it as an erosion of the education act's disclosure \n     requirements. In them, parents and advocates say, they saw a \n     crucial lever for helping their children meet higher academic \n     standards, and a way of finding out which schools were \n     meeting the challenge.\n       ``The reporting system is a shambles,'' said James Wendorf, \n     executive director of the National Center for Learning \n     Disabilities. Without full disclosure, Mr. Wendorf said, \n     parents have no handy way of knowing what kinds of services \n     schools are providing each day and how the schools, as a \n     whole, measure up. ``It's like flying a plane without \n     instruments,'' he said. ``How does a parent know where the \n     plane is expected to land if they don't have that kind of \n     information?''\n       Federal officials say that aside from the 10 or so states \n     not fully reporting scores on achievement tests tailored to \n     disabled students, most have made great strides to satisfy \n     the complex new law, but they say they are monitoring to see \n     that states follow through. Under the law, schools must \n     report on the test scores of disabled children to show they \n     are making adequate progress toward proficiency in reading \n     and math by 2014. The states are left to determine what is \n     proficient. Eugene W. Hickok, the under secretary of \n     education, acknowledged that many schools that exclusively \n     serve disabled children were not issuing report cards. But he \n     said that in such cases, the test scores of children in those \n     schools were instead reported at the school district level \n     and, if not there, at the state level.\n       ``Every child is part of an accountability system,'' Mr. \n     Hickok said. ``That doesn't mean there aren't people who are \n     trying to\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\n     find ways to get around the law.'' State officials deny any \n     effort to shortchange disabled students. Rather, many say \n     they were overwhelmed by the new law and could not initially \n     meet some of its more cumbersome reporting provisions.\n       In some states, like New York, officials said that local \n     and statewide systems did not meet the federal law's demands \n     and that they had not entirely worked out the conflicts. New \n     York officials pledged to correct the problems but also \n     expressed misgivings about the value of report cards for some \n     schools.\n       Particularly in the city's special education district, said \n     Lori Mei, executive director of the division of \n     accountability for the city's public schools, ``you really \n     can't have a cookie-cutter approach.'' Ms. Mei added, ``it \n     may be that we have to have different kinds of outcome \n     measures that are not really tests.''\n       To close the achievement gap, the federal law requires \n     schools to report test scores separately for various groups \n     of students, including African-Americans, Latinos, immigrants \n     and low-income and disabled children.\n       Schools must show sufficient progress by each of these \n     groups or face steadily tougher consequences that can \n     ultimately include closing.\n       But states are skirting the law in a range of ways. About a \n     dozen have raised the minimum number of disabled students \n     that must be enrolled before the school has to report on \n     their progress as a separate group. In Maine, school report \n     cards, available on the state's Web site, do not break down \n     test scores for groups like disabled students or report the \n     percentage that took the exams. Nor do they in New Mexico, \n     Colorado or Arkansas, while in Michigan, report cards say \n     only whether particular groups, like disabled students, met \n     targets for proficiency and 95 percent participation in \n     exams.\n       About 10 states, including Missouri, Utah, Delaware, \n     Colorado and Hawaii, have failed to properly report the \n     scores of disabled children on the special achievement tests \n     and are receiving federal money under ``special conditions'' \n     obligating them to do so in the future, federal officials \n     say.\n       Most states are not issuing public report cards on special \n     education schools. Like California, states generally contend \n     that these are not schools, but programs, and thus are exempt \n     from the federal law, an argument largely accepted by \n     officials in Washington. In California, the determination of \n     what is a program and not a school can be made at the local \n     level, but it is often made by states or a consortium of \n     school districts.\n       As a result, the scores for students attending special \n     education schools are frequently mixed in with the larger \n     pool of scores of disabled students from throughout the \n     districts, making it impossible for parents to get a snapshot \n     of achievement at the institution their children actually \n     attend each day, and for taxpayers to judge their \n     effectiveness.\n       Dee Alpert, a lawyer who has researched the issue \n     extensively for her newsletter, The Special Education \n     Muckraker, said that parents of children who must attend \n     special education schools, usually those with severe \n     disabilities, must ``go through 97 different steps'' to get \n     information that is readily available to parents of normal \n     children.\n       ``Being the parent of a kid with a disability is tough \n     enough,'' said Ms. Alpert, whose son was in special \n     education. ``Trying to be an informed involved parent of a \n     kid with a disability is tougher, by far.''\n       But Mitchell Chester, the assistant superintendent for \n     policy and accountability in Ohio, said there were sound \n     reasons for attributing disabled children's performance to \n     their home districts, as Ohio does.\n       ``We think districts have to remain accountable for whether \n     or not those children are served,'' Dr. Chester said. ``So \n     districts can't just make the decisions to farm kids out and \n     wash their hands of their progress.''\n       Officials in Colorado, Maine and New Mexico said they would \n     release the breakdown of scores of disabled students on \n     standardized tests in the coming months. In Colorado, \n     officials said they had just begun reporting scores on the \n     special tests tailored to the disabled, while Delaware said \n     it had been reporting such scores, but not in the way the \n     federal law requires. Both said they were now complying \n     with the requirement.\n       In Michigan, Ed Roeber, the director for assessment and \n     accountability, said school report cards did not detail \n     performance by particular groups like disabled students \n     because it ``would be confusing to people.'' Michigan grades \n     schools based on 11 indicators, only one of which is test \n     scores for the school as a whole. But reporting on separate \n     groups of students would be ``misleading,'' he said, because \n     test scores were unreliable indicators at that level. ``To \n     me, that's a major fault with the No Child Left Behind Act,'' \n     Mr. Roeber added.\n       Ms. Brenneise, who is the chairwoman of a special education \n     advisory committee to the San Diego Board of Education, said \n     many schools were reluctant to honestly disclose their record \n     in educating disabled students, believing that these students \n     by definition cannot reach the same academic heights as other \n     students, and thus will always drag down the school as a \n     whole. Aside from discovering that no report card existed for \n     her son's school, she said that she never officially received \n     his test results. Eventually, Ms. Brenneise said, she filed a \n     formal records request and a district employee gave her a \n     slip of paper on which she had written what she said were the \n     son's test scores. Ms. Brenneise is now home schooling her \n     son.\n       But much sidestepping of the law appears independent of the \n     intellectual disability involved. In Ohio, as in New York, \n     Oregon and many other states, public schools for the deaf and \n     the blind issue no reports on how well their students are \n     performing. Ohio officials acknowledge that deafness and \n     blindness do not typically imply lower intelligence, and said \n     they would release report cards for these schools next year.\n       In New York, state education officials acknowledged that \n     the city's special education district was not fully reporting \n     on student achievement. Many of the district's schools \n     exclude more than half their students from the state's \n     standardized tests and do not report how they do on the \n     special achievement tests. Nor do they report how many \n     graduate or drop out.\n       Though Albany issues report cards for many schools, state \n     officials said District 75 preferred to report its \n     performance to the public in a report card of its own design.\n       ``Clearly, it was less than perfect, but I don't think it \n     was intentional,'' said Martha P. Musser, director of \n     information reporting services for the State Education \n     Department. ``New York City never had to deal with these \n     accountability issues for District 75 before.'' Ms. Musser \n     added that the state had ordered District 75 to improve its \n     public disclosure.\n       The failure to report leaves parents like Martin \n     Schwartzman of Queens to make decisions in a vacuum. The \n     state recently ordered Mr. Schwartzman's 11-year old son, \n     Robby, who is autistic, to leave the private school he had \n     attended at taxpayer expense since first grade and return to \n     public school, along with 75 classmates.\n       ``How can I get a measure of what's out there when there's \n     so little data available for District 75?'' Mr. Schwartzman \n     asked.\n       Ms. Alpert, the lawyer, contends that the reticence to \n     report school results is too pervasive to be accidental, and \n     said the information being withheld was crucial for parents \n     and advocates.\n       Several years ago, she represented a boy with attention \n     deficit disorder and learning disabilities whom the city \n     wanted to place in one of the special education district \n     schools. The boy was talented in math, and his parents \n     believed that with extra support, he could earn a Regents \n     diploma at a regular high school, she said.\n       Using online school report cards that showed its reading \n     scores had fallen 20 percentile points in three years, while \n     math scores stagnated, Ms. Alpert refuted claims that the \n     school offered any ``foreseeable benefit'' for her client.\n       ``We won the hearing,'' Ms. Alpert said. Within a year, she \n     added, the cumulative scores disappeared from the city's \n     school report cards.\n       ``That's what score and graduation-dropout information does \n     for parents of kids with disabilities,'' she said, ``and \n     that's why school, district,'' regional programs and state \n     education officials ``don't want to publish it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9379-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 16, a 32-year-old man in Austin, TX, went to Oilcan Harry's, \na popular gay bar. Four men accompanied the man home when the bar \nclosed, and once there, broke a glass over the victim's head. The four \nmen then ripped off his clothes, beating and kicking him. They also \ntried choking him with a cord cut from his vacuum cleaner. The \nassailants allegedly forced the victim to sodomize himself with an \nobject at knifepoint while they used homosexual slurs. After the \nattackers left, the police were called and the victim taken to a local \nhospital.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9379-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9379-S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OPENING OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to bring due attention to the \nSmithsonian Institution's newest museum on the National Mall in \nWashington. The National Museum of the American Indian celebrates its \ngrand opening tomorrow.\n  This new museum is a wonderful place, and its collection has been a \nlong time coming. It is a beautiful and suitable home for honoring \ncenturies of American Indian history and their contributions to our \nNation today. Never\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nbefore has such an American Indian exhibit been done on this scale.\n  Congress passed the Smithsonian National Museum of the American \nIndian charter in 1989, but for such a grand endeavor, much planning, \ncoordination, and attention to detail is most appropriate.\n  All who have collaborated on this project have done so in an effort \nto promote and celebrate a deeper understanding of the diversity of the \nAmerican Indian people and to celebrate their rich culture and storied \nhistory. The exhibits will include ancient artifacts and will \neloquently display the talented work of modern Indian artists in a \nskillfully assembled setting.\n  There are numerous tribes in my home State of New Mexico. Those of us \nwho reside in the Southwest are familiar with the tribes and their \npeople, but many are not. While each share many common traditions and \ncustoms, it is important to note that each is a distinct entity of \nindividuals who maintain unique identities.\n  Indian lands in New Mexico are full of fascinating cultures, \nextraordinary landscapes, captivating ruins, and a broad array of \nhandmade arts and crafts by the Pueblo, Navajo and Apache people who \nare rightfully proud of their legacies and strong traditions.\n  Several New Mexicans have been working closely in the project's \nplanning and design. I would like to especially note Santa Fe weaver \nRamona Sakiestewa, Donna House of Acalde, and Duane Blue Spruce of \nLaguna and San Juan pueblos.\n  Ramona Sakiestewa has been involved with the project development \nsince 1994, collaborating with a team of architects and designers as \nthe lead interior designer for museum. Donna House coordinated much of \nthe landscape, and Duane Blue Spruce served as facilities manager for \nthe entire endeavor. There are others from my home State who had a hand \nin the museum, but these three deserve special recognition. And as the \nyears go on, New Mexico tribes and pueblos will add to the ongoing \nexhibits and programs to be offered at the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian.\n  Museum officials spent years consulting with representatives of \nIndian tribes from throughout the Western hemisphere. Because of their \nvision and creativity, the museum will forever tell the story of \nAmerican Indians--their trials, tribulations, triumphs and successes. I \nlaud their countless hours of work and tireless efforts.\n  I look forward to sharing the pride of the American Indian people as \nthey begin their opening ceremonies with a procession of the Nation's \nnative peoples. I hope all will take time to visit the museum, walk its \ncorridors, and view the priceless treasures that reveal stories filled \nwith the rich history of this diverse group. The museum is a \nculmination of years of planning and dedication. To those who have \nworked so hard to make it possible, I give my highest praise for a \n``job well done.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUBMITTING CHANGES TO 302(a) ALLOCATIONS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I would like to call attention to a \ndisease that currently affects the memories and functioning capacity of \nalmost five million Americans, and that is Alzheimer's disease.\n  In the next 50 years, it is estimated that over 16 million Americans \nwill be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I believe that we need to do more \nto understand this disease so that we can bring about effective \ntreatments and preventive measures, and so that we can provide relief \nto those who care for individuals with Alzheimer's.\n  Alzheimer's not only affects our Nation's physical health, it also \nnegatively impacts family resources and our country's overall economic \nhealth. According to the Alzheimer's Association, our country spends \nover $100 billion annually in direct and indirect costs on caring for \nthose with Alzheimer's.\n  As our population ages, more and more Americans will suffer from this \nterrible disease. It is urgent that we bring more resources to bear to \nfind effective treatments and, most of all, to find a cure. In recent \nyears, medical researchers have made critical strides in Alzheimer's \nresearch. I believe that we need to continue to make biomedical \nresearch into Alzheimer's a national priority, and because of this I \nsupport the efforts of Senators Mikulski and Bond to provide $1.4 \nbillion in Federal funding for Alzheimer's research. I have long \nadvocated for more resources both for research into Alzheimer's and to \nhelp those who care for loved ones afflicted with the disease. I \nsupport S. 2533, the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act, not \nonly because it provides those resources, but because it provides hope \nto families that someday we will bring an end to this debilitating \ndisease.\n  The research currently being conducted at the National Institutes of \nHealth holds much promise for identifying potential treatments and \neventually, I hope, a cure for Alzheimer's. However we will not make \nthe progress necessary to truly make breakthroughs with Alzheimer's \nunless we provide sufficient Federal funding for the research underway \nat NIH.\n  As a strong proponent of fiscal discipline, I understand the current \nconstraints on the Federal budget. However, I believe that providing \nresources to increase our Federal investment in Alzheimer's research \nand to offer caregiver support are critical budget priorities. It is my \nsincere hope that Congress passes the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's \nBreakthrough Act before this session of Congress is over.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9380-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9380-S9381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  NORTH DAKOTA STOCKMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, later this month, the North Dakota \nStockmen's Association will hold its Diamond Anniversary Convention in \nMedora, ND. I would like to recognize this organization, which has \nserved our State's ranchers and cattle producers for the past 75 years.\n  On June 6, 1929, a group of cattle producers gathered in Watford \nCity, ND. The men all grazed cattle on the Fort Berthold Indian \nReservation and they\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\nall had a problem with cattle rustling. Andrew Johnson, a Watford area \ncattleman, was determined to do something about it. He established a \nreward of $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction \nof cattle rustlers. The men at the meeting contributed $5 each to start \nthat fund.\n  This group called themselves the Western North Dakota Stock \nAssociation. They would later change their name to the Western North \nDakota Stockmen's Association, and finally they took the name they hold \ntoday; the North Dakota Stockmen's Association.\n  This year the North Dakota Stockmen's Association is celebrating its \n75th year of operation, and that $1,000 reward still stands.\n  Today the North Dakota Stockmen's Association has more than 2,700 \nmembers from across the State. From education efforts that help new \nranchers get a start in the cattle industry to brand registration and \nenforcement of the State's livestock laws, the Stockmen's Association \nplays an important role in all aspects of the ranching industry. And, \nas those of us in elected office know, the North Dakota Stockmen's \nAssociation is a strong, effective voice on behalf of its members.\n  In addition to serving its members, the North Dakota Stockmen's \nAssociation plays an important role in the communities in which its \nmembers live. The association worked with other members of the beef \nindustry in North Dakota to host a Beef Industry Appreciation Day \nduring the 2004 North Dakota State Fair. The association served free \nbeef dinners to active duty military, Reserve, and National Guard \nmembers, and their families. The association offers college \nscholarships to young people who are interested in studying animal or \nrange science, preveterinary medicine, farm and ranch management, and \nother subjects that help maintain a healthy farm economy.\n  I thank the North Dakota Stockmen's Association for their hard work. \nI wish them continued success and congratulate them on their 75th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9381-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING WILMER AMINA CARTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ntremendous public service of Wilmer Amina Carter. Mrs. Carter has long \nserved as a leader, mentor and an advocate for children in San \nBernardino County. For her longstanding personal commitment to her \ncommunity and to the academic achievement of young people, the city of \nRialto's third high school will be named Wilmer Amina Carter High \nSchool in her honor.\n  The Wilmer Amina Carter High School is the first high school in the \nInland Empire to be named after a living African-American woman. Mrs. \nCarter earned this honor through the many pioneering and leadership \nroles she has assumed in her community.\n  Born in an era when adequate public education for African-American \nchildren was not provided, Mrs. Carter was fortunate to receive an \neducation from her grandfather. In her professional and personal \npursuits, Mrs. Carter has always worked to provide others with the \nimmensely important and empowering opportunities afforded her through \neducation. She capped this service with 16 years as a member of the \nRialto Board of Education.\n  Mrs. Carter also served for 23 years as district director for the \nlate, much revered United States Congressman George Brown, Jr. There, \nshe carried out Congressman Brown's directive that everyone receive \ncareful attention and compassionate service.\n  Mrs. Carter used her scholarship and expertise to guide educational \npolicy and curriculum in her community and beyond. Under her \nleadership, a school career education venture of the National Council \nof Negro Women, Inc. and the United States Department of Labor became a \nnationwide model for high school career development programs.\n  In her service to the Rialto Unified School District, Mrs. Carter \nbecame the first African-American member of the Rialto Board of \nEducation in 1983 and served until 1999. Throughout her tenure on the \nboard of education, Mrs. Carter sought to make education a valued \ncommunity endeavor, helping both young people and parents navigate the \nschool system to optimize positive outcomes. She has been an inspiring \nforce in ensuring that our Nation's future leaders have the tools they \nneed to achieve their dreams.\n  The dedication of this school reflects the impact of a woman who has \nprovided an outstanding model of determination and service. I am \nconfident that, true to Mrs. Carter's life work, this school's name \nwill serve as a constant reminder to the students who pass through its \ndoors of their immense potential to achieve and effect positive change \nin their local and national communities. And knowing Mrs. Carter's \npenchant for hands on involvement, it would not surprise me to see her \nat the school, working to instill those values in its students. It is \nwith great pleasure that I congratulate Mrs. Wilmer Amina Carter on \nthis much-deserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9381-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to rise today to recognize a \ngroup of dedicated public servants who are increasing access to mental \nhealth care for people in Multnomah County, OR. Because of their \nwillingness to creatively address barriers to care, Cascadia Behavioral \nHealthCare and its county partners are helping Oregonians lead \nhealthier lives.\n  Three years ago, Multnomah County's mental health services were in \ndisarray. Budget shortfalls and the closure of three major service \nproviders were preventing county residents from accessing care, often \nwith tragic consequences. Because the system's clients are primarily \nlow income, this public crisis became a personal crisis for individuals \nwith no other options.\n  In response, Cascadia and its partners reorganized the county's \nmental health care system, bringing quality, efficient services to many \ncitizens in need. Employing new tools such as a mobile response unit, \n24-hour walk-in clinic, their creative response dramatically increased \noptions for those in need. As a result, there has been a reduction in \nthe hospitalization rate of adult mentally ill patients in the past \nyear, easing the strain on county and State funds. Further, the new \norganization has saved more than $5 million in the last 3 years, while \nhelping some of the neediest residents access care.\n  Now, the system works. For people like Ann, an Asian-American \nteenager who began hearing voices in high school, access to services \nliterally saved her life. The daughter of immigrants, Ann's family did \nnot understand her mental illness, which was later diagnosed as \nschizophrenia. As her condition worsened, Ann's anxiety and suicidal \nthoughts increased. Eventually, she wound up in the State hospital.\n  Ann was referred to Cascadia Behavioral Health center where she was \ntreated by a psychiatrist for medication management and a trainer to \nhelp her understand her diagnosis and develop coping skills. A Cascadia \nfamily therapist, working with a cultural specialist, is helping Ann \nand her family adjust to her diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. She will \nreceive additional case management and help so she can graduate high \nschool.\n  For people like Ann, the availability of mental health care is \nabsolutely crucial. But for the courage of Cascadia and its county \npartners, Ann and others like her may not have found the care they need \nto live stable, productive and rewarding lives. Because of the valuable \nservices they provide, I recognize Cascadia Behavioral HealthCare and \nits partners as true health care heroes. I look forward to following \ntheir continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9381-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9381-S9382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MARINE CORPS AIR STATION MIRAMAR: TOP MARINE CORPS INSTALLATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and \nwomen of the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar which was recently \nrecognized as the 2004 Commander-in-Chief's Top Marine Corps \nInstallation.\n  Annually, one military installation from each service receives the \naward for outstanding achievement in areas including mission support, \nfamily services, environmental stewardship, and quality-of-life \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n  Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego consistently excels as \na supportive, productive, and contributing member of the community. \nMiramar hosts and supports many events that integrate the San Diego \ncommunity into the work of the base. It stages the largest military air \nshow in the United States, has Cockpit Days at the Flying Leatherneck \nMuseum which hosts 16,000 visitors annually, bimonthly tours which give \ncommunity members a chance to become familiar with the Marine Corps, as \nwell as Educators' Workshops, Community Leaders' Forums, and it \nprovides color guards at local events.\n  Integral to the most powerful concentration of Navy bases in the \nNation, Miramar is responsible for supporting combat-ready \nexpeditionary aviation forces capable of worldwide, short-notice \ndeployment as part of a Marine Corps Air-Ground Task Force. Miramar is \nthe home of Third Marine Aircraft Wing Headquarters, Marine Corps Air \nBases Western Area and Reserve Support Unit and more than 10,000 \nMarines, Sailors, and civilian Marines.\n  Miramar's Marines continue to significantly contribute to Operations \nEnduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. While friends and family members \nare serving abroad, Operation Enduring Families, a support network for \nfamilies of deployed service members, operates on the base. Miramar's \ndedication to defending our country while enhancing quality of life for \nits service members and broader community is evident as the Marines \ncontribute to the San Diego community as speakers, teachers, mentors, \nand sport coaches.\n  Miramar achieves excellence in environmental standards, innovation, \nsafety, efficiency, and a dedication to teamwork, honesty, and \nintegrity. Their exemplary service continues to lead the Nation and to \ninnovate for the next generation. It is with great pleasure that I \ncongratulate Miramar and the women and men who support it for their \nreceipt of the 2004 Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9382-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON MENTAL RETARDATION AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join the \nIllinois chapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation, \nAAMR, in recognizing the recipients of the 2004 Direct Service \nProfessional Award. These individuals are being honored for their \noutstanding efforts to enrich the lives of people with developmental \ndisabilities in Illinois.\n  These recipients have displayed a strong sense of humanity and \nprofessionalism in their work with persons with disabilities. Their \nefforts have inspired the lives of those for whom they care, and they \nare an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of \ncommunity service for all Americans to follow.\n  These honorees spend more than 50 percent of their time at work in \ndirect, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily \nmanagers or supervisors. They are direct service workers at the \nforefront of America's effort to care for people with special needs. \nThey go to work every day with little recognition, providing much \nneeded and greatly valued care and assistance.\n  It is my honor and privilege to recognize the Illinois recipients of \nAAMR's 2004 Direct Service Professional Award: Mary Alimi-Seiwart, \nPatricia Baldridge, Linda Christianson, Willie Mae Clinton, Avis \nGanter, Ruth Just, Linda Koch, Patricia Matuske, Harshida Mody, Barbara \nPurches, Mark Rodgers, Dwight Sanders, Chris Shell, Marie Sonnan, Linda \nSweeney, Marla Tegtmeyer, Clarence Woods, and Kim Wren.\n  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners \nof the 2004 Direct Service Professional Award.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to join in celebrating the 150th anniversary of Williams \nCharter Township. Located in the heart of Michigan, this rural township \nis a close-knit community that reflects much of the best America has to \noffer.\n  John Gaffney, Charles Bradford, William Spafford, Charles Fitch, \nGeorge W. Smock, and Lyman Brianard were the first to arrive in 1854 on \nthe land that officially became Williams Charter Township. The area's \nwaterways and roads soon became an essential route of transportation \nfor travelers in the region. The fertile soil led to the establishment \nof many farms, which are providing harvests over a century later. The \nearliest settlers saw this land as an ideal place to begin their new \nlives, and by doing so, built a strong foundation for the generations \nthat have followed.\n  The sesquicentennial festivities of Williams Charter Township took \nplace this past weekend, and its residents and their families and \nfriends came together to commemorate the land's rich history and to \ncelebrate the continued growth of this wonderful community. The \noccasion was marked with many memorable activities, including living \nhistorical re-enactments and an awards ceremony to honor some of the \ntownship's most outstanding citizens.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating the \nresidents of Williams Charter Township on this important milestone. I \nam proud to represent this township and wish them many more years of \nsuccess and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9382-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9382-S9383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING COLONEL ART WHITE, USMC\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, as a veteran Marine and friend, I \nrise today to pay tribute to COL Art White, who will complete his 3-\nyear tour of duty with the United States Marine Corps' Office of \nLegislative Affairs on December 1, 2004. I have had the pleasure to \nwork with Colonel White on many occasions. In his role as the director \nof the Marine Corps' Senate Liaison Office, he has provided tremendous \nsupport while acting as the principal conduit for information between \nthe Marine Corps and many Members of this eminent body. His affable \npersonality and attention to duty contributed to a highly successful \nrelationship between the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Marine Corps. His \ndedication to the Members of the United States Senate will be sorely \nmissed.\n  Art White was born and raised in Westchester, NY. After high school \nin New York, he attended Georgetown University, where he also played \nbasketball for the Hoyas, graduating in 1976. In 1977, Colonel White \nreceived a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps \nand subsequently reported to Quantico, VA, to take on the challenge of \nbecoming a marine officer. During his subsequent 27-year career in the \nMarine Corps that included both active and reserve duty, Art served as \nan infantry officer, aide de camp to the assistant division commander \nof the 1st Marine Division, a communications officer, a civil affairs \nofficer, a counterintelligence officer, and a reserve mobilization \nofficer.\n  In 1980, Colonel White left active duty and transitioned to the \nMarine Corps Reserve. He then attended the Seattle University School of \nLaw, graduating in 1983, and began a long, distinguished career in \npublic service. He served as a professional staff member for the \nRepublican Policy Committee chaired by our former colleague from the \ngreat State of Texas, Senator John Tower; as a staff member in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives; as the director of legislative affairs for \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the Commerce Department; and as \nthe deputy assistant director for legislative affairs for the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  In December, 2001, Colonel White was ordered to active duty to serve \nas the director of the Marine Corps' Liaison office in the Senate. \nSince that time, he has been a key player in maintaining effective \nrelationships between the Marine Corps, my colleagues in the Senate, \nprofessional committee staff, and personal staff members. In \nparticular, he responded to thousands of congressional inquiries, \nranging from such sensitive issues as notification of combat casualties \nduring Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, to providing \ntimely information on the operation, organization and budget of the \nMarine Corps. He also planned and executed approximately 33 \ninternational congressional delegations. I\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nhad the pleasure of traveling on several of these congressional \ndelegations with Colonel White and was greatly impressed with his \nservice to the Members of the Senate. His strong acumen for social \ninteraction carried over into Colonel White's ability to represent his \nservice at numerous Marine Corps and Joint Service social events on \nCapitol Hill. Among others, these events included the Marine Corps \nBirthday Commemoration, the Joint Services Reception, and several \nMarine Corps fall and spring receptions--all important events that \nenabled me and my Senate colleagues to maintain relationships with the \nMarine Corps' senior leadership. His efforts throughout this period not \nonly communicated the commandant's message to the U.S. Senate, but also \nupheld the Marine Corps' positive image and professional reputation on \nCapitol Hill.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I thank Colonel White for his service to the \nNation and the U.S. Marine Corps, and I thank his wife, Katherine Ann, \nand his daughter, Mary Rose, for their steadfast support while he \nfulfilled this essential duty. We in the U.S. Senate, and I personally, \nwish them all the best as Colonel White returns to his civilian career \nand tackles new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9383-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9383-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9383-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT TERMINATES THE EMERGENCY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE \nORDER 12543 WITH RESPECT TO THE POLICIES AND ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT \n          OF LIBYA AND REVOKES RELATED EXECUTIVE ORDERS--PM 94\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I \nhave issued an Executive Order (the ``order'') that terminates the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 12543 of January 7, \n1986, and revokes that Executive Order, Executive Order 12544 of \nJanuary 8, 1986, Executive Order 12801 of April 15, 1992, and Executive \nOrder 12538 of November 15, 1985. I have determined that the situation \nthat gave rise to this national emergency has been significantly \naltered by Libya's commitments and actions to eliminate its weapons of \nmass destruction programs and its Missile Technology Control Regime \n(MTCR) -class missiles, and by other developments.\n  Executive Order 12543 of January 7, 1986, imposed sanctions on Libya \nin response to policies and actions of the Government of Libya that \nconstituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States. Those sanctions were \nmodified in Executive Order 12544 of January 8, 1986, Executive Order \n12801 of April 15, 1992, and supplemented Executive Order 12548 of \nNovember 15, 1985.\n  Based on Libya's recent commitments and actions to implement its \nDecember 19, 2003, commitment to eliminate its weapons of mass \ndestruction programs and its MTCR-class missiles, and other \ndevelopments, I have determined that the situation that gave rise to \nthe national emergency declared in Executive Order 12543 has been \nsignificantly altered. My order, therefore, terminates that national \nemergency with respect to Libya and revokes Executive Orders 12543, \n12544, and 12801, and lifts the trade, commercial, and travel sanctions \nimposed against Libya based on that national emergency. The order also \nrevokes Executive Order 12538, which blocked the import of petroleum \nproducts refined in Libya into the United States.\n  While the order formally lifts sanctions under the national emergency \nwith respect to Libya, it will not lift a wide variety of other \nsanctions imposed on Libya due to its designation as a state sponsor of \nterrorism under section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act (restriction \non arms exports), and section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of \n1979 (restriction on exports of certain items on the Commodity Control \nList), as well as other statutory restrictions applicable to Libya.\n  I have enclosed a copy of the order, which is effective at 12:01 a.m. \neastern daylight time on September 21, 2004.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to give a preference regarding States that require \nschools to allow students to self-administer medication to treat that \nstudent's asthma\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nor anaphylaxis, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nAsthmatic Schoolchildren's Treatment and Health Management Act of 2004. \nI would like to thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for cosponsoring \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  I have come to the floor now many times to talk about asthma, a \ncondition that affects more than 20 million people, including 6.3 \nmillion children. As a parent of eight and a grandparent of eight, I am \nparticularly concerned with the disproportionately high number of \nchildren who suffer from pediatric asthma--the worst chronic health \nproblem among our Nation's youth.\n  I suffer from asthma, as have some of my children, so I know how \nfrightening and dangerous this disease can be. The statistics on \npediatric asthma, especially, highlight the need to do more to combat \nthis disease. An average of one out of every 13 school-age children has \nasthma and the disease is the leading cause of missed school days due \nto chronic illness. In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control reported \nthat 14 million school days were missed annually because of asthma.\n  More than missed school days, however, are the tragic consequences of \nthe condition. The number of deaths related to pediatric asthma nearly \ntripled between 1979 and 1996. In 2000, asthma attacks were the cause \nof 728,000 visits to the emergency room, 214,000 hospitalizations, and \n223 deaths.\n  We know that the severity of asthma attacks can be decreased \nprimarily through the control of the disease. Physicians instruct \npatients to carry their inhalers with them at all times, as they know \nasthma can strike a child anytime, anywhere--in the classroom, on the \nplayground, or in the lunchroom. Therefore, it is imperative that \nstudents have immediate access to their inhalers. However, many schools \ndo not allow students to carry their prescribed lifesaving asthma \nmedication. To date, only 30 States, including my home State of Ohio, \nhave laws or developed policies protecting children's right to carry an \ninhaler at school.\n  The bill I am introducing today would encourage more States to allow \ntheir children to carry their needed asthma medication while they are \nat school, on the school bus, on the playground, at school sporting \nevents, or on school field trips. It would do so by giving States \npreference when applying for asthma-related grants.\n  This bill would help protect our Nation's children from the dangers \nof a sudden asthma attack--an attack that could result in \nhospitalization or even death. It also would help prevent the \nconsequences of more severe allergic reactions. Many children suffer \nfrom asthma attacks and allergy reactions so severe that they need to \ncarry an epinephrine injector with them at all times in the event of \nsudden, life-threatening attacks. Severe attacks can cause anaphylactic \nshock which can kill within minutes. This bill would encourage States \nto adopt laws and policies allowing children to carry their anaphylaxis \nmedication, including epinephrine injectors, while they are at school.\n  Currently, 18 States have developed legislation protecting the rights \nof children to carry and self-administer epinephrine-injectors. We \napplaud these States and hope that this bill will encourage more States \nto follow suit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Asthmatic Schoolchildren's \n     Treatment and Health Management Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, \n     ongoing medical intervention.\n       (2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.\n       (3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma and 6,300,000 \n     children under age 18 had asthma.\n       (4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American \n     children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian \n     children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are \n     in the African-American population.\n       (5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to \n     emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved \n     children under 18 years of age).\n       (6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related \n     hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 \n     years of age).\n       (7) In 2000, 4,487 people died from asthma, and of these \n     223 were children.\n       (8) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, asthma is a common cause of missed school days, \n     accounting for approximately 14,000,000 missed school days \n     annually.\n       (9) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, \n     working parents of children with asthma lose an estimated $ \n     1,000,000,000 a year in productivity.\n       (10) At least 30 States have legislation protecting the \n     rights of children to carry and self-administer asthma \n     metered-dose inhalers, and at least 18 States expand this \n     protection to epinephrine auto-injectors.\n       (11) Tragic refusals of schools to permit students to carry \n     their inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine have occurred, \n     some resulting in death and spawning litigation.\n       (12) School district medication policies must be developed \n     with the safety of all students in mind. The immediate and \n     correct use of asthma inhalers and auto-injectable \n     epinephrine are necessary to avoid serious respiratory \n     complications and improve health care outcomes.\n       (13) No school should interfere with the patient-physician \n     relationship.\n       (14) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic \n     allergic reaction that can kill within minutes. Anaphylaxis \n     occurs in some asthma patients.According to the American \n     Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, people who have \n     experienced symptoms of anaphylaxis previously are at risk \n     for subsequent reactions and should carry an epinephrine \n     auto-injector with them at all times, if prescribed.\n       (15) An increasing number of students and school staff have \n     life-threatening allergies. Exposure to the affecting \n     allergen can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires prompt \n     medical intervention with an injection of epinephrine.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator DeWine \nin introducing the Asthmatic School-Children's Treatment and Health \nManagement Act. This legislation will save lives by enabling children \nto carry their medications with them and quickly treat their asthma \nattacks or allergic reactions.\n  Asthma continues to be a major, and often preventable cause of \nneedless suffering and death among children in the United States. Over \n6 million children under 18 have asthma, and it is significantly more \nprevalent in minority groups. Tragically, over 200 children die from \nthis disease every year. Asthma affects more than health. It accounts \nfor 14 million missed school days annually, and affects grades and \npersonality. The estimated cost of asthma-related health care in our \nsociety is over $14 billion a year.\n  The key to preventing deaths and severe health effects caused by \nasthma and allergic reactions is prompt treatment. Inhalers work within \nminutes to end acute asthma attacks in children. Children experiencing \nsevere allergic reactions must receive life-saving injections of \nepinephrine immediately, in order to avoid serious complications or \neven death.\n  Children need quick access to these medications when they are at \nschool. Yet, in many States, these medications are locked up. Twenty \nStates do not have legislation allowing students to carry and use their \nasthma inhalers, and 32 states have not yet passed legislation \npermitting students to carry and use epinephrine.\n  Some say that school nurses should control access to these lifesaving \nmedications. But in America today, we have only 56,000 school nurses \nserving 47 million students in public schools. The ratio is only one \nschool nurse for every 840 students. If access to these needed \nmedications is controlled by nurses, the safety of asthma and allergy \nsufferers may often be compromised, and needless deaths may occur. \nStudents without immediate access to needed medications could be at \nincreased risk of harm while in a classroom far away from a nurse's \noffice or other school facility. Allowing children to take their own \nmedicine during asthma attacks and severe allergic reactions can \nprevent many life-threatening situations.\n  Our bill will help to see that children with asthma or allergic \nreactions will get their medications when they need it. Under this Act, \nStates that allow students to carry and self-administer asthma or \nallergy medications will receive preferences for asthma-related grants. \nIt requires that a health care practitioner must prescribe the \nmedication and instruct students on its proper use. The student must \ndemonstrate to the practitioner that they have the skills to administer \nthe medication correctly. This bill also requires the student's parent \nor guardian to provide written consent for the student to take their \nmedication according to the treatment plan.\n  When they face a life-threatening asthma attack or allergic reaction, \nchildren deserve an effective way to avoid severe health consequences. \nSchools should give our children the right to carry their medications \nwith them in order to minimize the time lost between the onset of \nsymptoms and the needed treatment. The ``Asthmatic School-Children's \nTreatment and Health Management Act'' will save children's lives and \nminimize suffering during these attacks. I commend Senator DeWine for \nhis leadership on this important health issue, and I encourage Congress \nto act quickly to improve every child's access in school of life-saving \nmedications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9389-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9389-S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 138--COMMENDING JOHN W.

Con. Res 138\n\n       Whereas John W.

Kluge is a dedicated patriot who served his \n     country well as an Army intelligence officer during World War \n     II;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge's commitment to public service has \n     made him one of the most esteemed and generous benefactors of \n     education, and has brought him the admiration and gratitude \n     of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas John W.

Kluge.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate to submit a \nresolution honoring the great philanthropist John Kluge whose 90th \nbirthday is tomorrow. He is a personal friend.\n  John Kluge is a self-made man. He came to this country as a young boy \nfrom Germany with virtually nothing but a china Dresden horse--which he \nstill has. From these humble origins and through hard work he received \na scholarship to Columbia University.\n  After distinguished service as an army intelligence officer during WW \nII--and I say parenthetically he served in Alaska during that period--\nhe went on in the business world to create a vast media empire which he \nconverted into a great engine of philanthropy, supporting many \neducational programs, aimed in particular toward helping minorities.\n  John Kluge's quiet commitment to public service and generosity of \nspirit will live on for generations. For years to come, individuals \nwill be able to attend college on a Kluge scholarship\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\nwho might otherwise be unable to afford it. Countless future national \nleaders will benefit from the intellectual stimulation he has made \npossible through his work at the Library of Congress.\n  Mr. Kluge is the founding chairman of the James Madison Council, the \nLibrary of Congress's private sector philanthropic organization, where \nhe has inspired many others to join in support of the library and its \nprograms.\n  Through his generosity, John Kluge helped the Library of Congress \nbridge the gap into the digital world by enabling it to invest heavily \nin technologies that bring the vast collections of the Library of \nCongress to people all over the world.\n  As chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, I was pleased to \nannounce at a ceremony in the Capitol in 2000 with the Librarian of \nCongress, Jim Billington, Mr. Kluge's generous gift of $60 million to \nestablish the John W. Kluge center in the Library of Congress. Thanks \nto this endowment, the Kluge Center brings some of the world's best \nminds--the Kluge Scholars--into residence to use the rich resources of \nthe library and interact with national policy makers.\n  John Kluge has also generously supported the creation of advanced \ntraining for a new generation of library leaders through the leadership \ndevelopment program at the Library of Congress.\n  John Kluge is a man who has made a difference. He has touched \ncountless lives and truly deserves the recognition of this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit this resolution and ask that it be \nheld at the desk so others might join in cosponsoring this resolution. \nIt is my intention to ask the leadership to try to clear it for \nadoption this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the measure being \nsubmitted and held at the desk? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/20/senate-section/article/S9390-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Kluge for his dedication and commitment to the United \n     States on the occasion of his 90th birthday.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object--I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I served for some time as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Legislative branch. During those years, there was \nan effort made to cut funding for the Library of Congress. I became an \nexpert on funding for the Library of Congress. We were able to overcome \nthe objections of those who thought the Library of Congress should be \nmade different than it now is. But during that period of time, I met \nJohn Kluge. John Kluge is a man who has made lots of money in the free \nenterprise system of our country. But he has dedicated large amounts of \nhis fortune to the Library of Congress.\n  I am so glad Senator Stevens submitted a resolution commemorating the \nbirthday of this great American. Because of his being such a fine man \nand recognizing the importance of the Library of Congress, the greatest \nlibrary in the history of the world, many people will benefit from his \nefforts.\n  I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthis matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 138) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 138\n\n       Whereas John W. Kluge has combined a unique history of \n     American entrepreneurship with pioneering contributions to \n     philanthropy, electronic education, and television and radio \n     broadcasting;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge is a dedicated patriot who served his \n     country well as an Army intelligence officer during World War \n     II;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge's commitment to public service has \n     made him one of the most esteemed and generous benefactors of \n     education, and has brought him the admiration and gratitude \n     of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge's deep belief in human potential and \n     creativity has quietly helped extend educational opportunity \n     through scholarships and other support of important civic \n     causes;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge's wise counsel and leadership as the \n     founding chairman of the Library of Congress's first private \n     sector philanthropic organization, the James Madison Council, \n     have inspired many others to join in support of the Library \n     of Congress's programs and initiatives;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge has established an endowed program at \n     the Library of Congress to bring leading senior scholars and \n     junior fellows from around the world to the Library to use \n     its great collections and to interact with the members and \n     staff of Congress;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge has generously supported the first \n     Nobel-level award for lifetime scholarly achievement in the \n     study of the human sciences;\n       Whereas John W. Kluge has generously supported the creation \n     of advanced training for library leaders of the 21st century \n     through a Leadership Development Program at the Library of \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas John W. Kluge has inspired the people of the United \n     States by his example of support for programs that educate \n     and equip individuals for responsible and productive \n     citizenship: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends John W. Kluge for his dedication and \n     commitment to the United States;\n       (2) expresses, on the occasion of John W.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I guard the nomination process as well as \nanybody. I have had difficulty with someone who we have tried to put on \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a year and a half. I have \nrecognized that by making sure that certain people the administration \nwants do not go through. But I have not held up what I think are \nnominations important to the national defense and welfare of our \ncountry, generally speaking.\n  We have a number of people, as indicated by the acting leader at this \ntime, Senator Murkowski, being discharged from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. There is one person, though, on the list by the name of \nJames B. Cunningham, a career member of the senior foreign service, to \nbe appointed to the Atomic Energy Agency with the rank of Ambassador. \nThere is a hold on this. This man would represent the United States on \nthis most important entity.\n  The news in the last months has been dealing with Iran and what they \nare doing and not doing with their nuclear program. We need this man on \na daily basis doing what he needs to do to protect the interests of not \nonly the United States but the world with this burgeoning problem we \nhave with nuclear materials.\n  There is a hold by the majority on this nomination. I think it is \nwrong. I will not mention the name of the Senator who has a hold, but \nit should be taken off. It is not good for the country or for the \nworld.\n  Having said that, I have no objection to the request of the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
