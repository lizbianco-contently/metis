However, it is our \nhope, and the hope of Chairman Lugar, to complete this bill \nexpeditiously. To accomplish this, Members who intend to offer and \ndebate amendments should notify their respective chairman or ranking \nmember so that the amendments can be scheduled for consideration.\n  Rollcall votes will occur throughout the day as the Senate considers \nthe State Department authorization bill.\n  Again, it is our hope that we will be able to complete this bill \nearly this week so we can begin the appropriations process prior to the \nend of this week. I encourage everyone to help make that possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9061-6", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We anticipate being on one of the \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly have no prior knowledge about amendments being \noffered on the very important State Department authorization bill. But \nI think it will be difficult to finish the bill by tomorrow evening. If \nthat is what the leader wants to do, we will certainly try.\n  As I indicated, I don't know what amendments will be offered. We will \nhave a better idea before we get on the bill, and we will inform \nSenator Biden and let him know what amendments there are, so the leader \ncan have an idea as to what the week holds for us in that regard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think the plan of Senator Frist is to \nget started and see how it goes and to hope that we can move that bill \nrapidly.\n  Mr. REID.

That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. One-half hour of the time we are allotted I will yield to \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, to speak on Judge Wolski.\n  I have been advised by staff that 25 minutes would be adequate \nbecause he has 5 minutes prior to the vote.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration on the motion to proceed to the consideration of \nS. 11. Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 a.m. will be \nequally divided between the majority leader and the minority leader or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the measure we are hoping to proceed \nto, the Patients First Act of 2003, seeks to\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\naddress a major national crisis that confronts us in health care. Two \nweeks ago, or right before the recess, the Senate and the House acted \non a major new health care proposal to modernize and preserve Medicare \nand to add a prescription drug benefit for our seniors. Now the Senate \nseeks to address another part of America's health care crisis--one the \nHouse of Representatives has already dealt with--which is the question \nof the rising cost of medical liability premiums, forcing physicians \nout of certain specialties or, in the case of young physicians, \nchoosing not to go into such high-risk specialties as obstetrics \nbecause they know they won't be able to afford the medical malpractice \npremiums and still perform the service for which they have been \ntrained.\n  Last year, when we dealt with this issue, there were about 11 or 12 \nStates that were in crisis. Now there are 19. There are only 6 of our \n50 States that have no problem at all. All the rest are on the way to \nhaving a major national crisis.\n  The underlying bill that we are seeking to get permission to go to--\nthe principal sponsor is Senator Ensign of Nevada, who is here to my \nright and has been an active and major player in the legislation--is \nvery similar to the measure that passed the House. It is also supported \nby the President of the United States. So we know that if we were to go \nforward with a bill similar to this, it could get a Presidential \nsignature and we would be well on our way to dealing with this enormous \nproblem that is beginning to deny patients care all across our country.\n  So when the Senate has an opportunity to vote, I hope Members will \nvote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed so we can go to the \nbill and begin to address this incredibly serious national problem.\n  I commend Senator Ensign for his leadership on this issue. His State \nhas certainly been one of those that has had an enormous crisis and \nthey are trying to deal with it at the State level. He can address \nthat. But the point is that this is a national problem that needs to be \ndealt with by the National Government.\n  That is what we are seeking to do today: to get an opportunity to get \non to the bill and deal with this extraordinary health care crisis that \nwe have in the country.\n  I will have more to say later in the morning and particularly just \nprior to the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the majority \nwhip. I rise today to speak on behalf of the bill that I have \nintroduced, the Patients First Act. The reason we call it the Patients \nFirst Act is because it really does put patients first.\n  In our health care system today, we have too many patients who are \neither close to being denied care or have been denied care simply \nbecause physicians cannot afford the medical liability premiums they \nare facing today.\n  My State, as the Senator from Kentucky mentioned, is one of those \nStates that is in crisis. Our State has a level I trauma center which \nserves a four-State region, and last year that trauma center closed for \n10 days. The closure of that trauma center was the only event in my \nstate of Nevada that brought the people who were against reforming our \nmedical liability system and our overall tort system and the proponents \nof that reform together. This crisis allowed a special session of the \nlegislature to be called so they could try to deal with this situation. \nI commend our Governor and State legislators for their efforts to deal \nwith the situation.\n  The problem in Nevada, as with other States that have enacted reform, \nis it will take 6 to 10 years, depending on the length of the appeals \nand the challenges to the law, before we know whether the bill will \nactually take effect and have the result of lowering the costs for \nmedical liability insurance.\n  In the meantime, Nevada and many other States are losing doctors in \ndroves. Nevada is the fastest growing State in the country, and we \ncannot afford the migration of doctors from our state to continue.\n  Speciality fields are the most severely affected by this crisis, and \nof those, obstetrics and gynocology are of the most severely affected. \nIn southern Nevada, we have 5,000 to 6,000 new people a month moving \nin. This increase in our population during this time of crisis has \nresulted in three things happening.\n\n  One is we are losing doctors; two is new doctors are not coming to \nreplace them; and three is, the few ob/gyns who actually are staying, \nwhen they were delivering 250 to 300 babies a year previously, they \nhave cut that number down to 125; 125 babies from 250 to 300. One can \ndo the math. It does not add up.\n  Additionally, many doctors who previously delivered babies in high-\nrisk pregnancies no longer can deliver them because their insurance \ncompany will not cover them for that procedure. We are in a situation \nwhere some of our best doctors are not able to give the care they are \nare capable of giving.\n  I see my friend from Wyoming just arrived in the Chamber. Mr. \nPresident, I say to him, I am going to take a couple more minutes and \nthen I will yield the floor.\n  This is not just a Nevada issue. As the Senator from Kentucky \nmentioned, 19 other States are in crisis, and all but 6 States are \nshowing signs of heading into a crisis. In every State that is in \ncrisis or heading into a crisis, we hear the same kind of stories from \npatients. It is a real problem, a problem the Senate must address. The \nHouse has already dealt with it. Now the Senate must deal with it.\n  This crisis is a national problem. For Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, \n60 percent of all the medical bills are paid through the Congress. \nBecause of that, it is a national issue and it requires the House of \nRepresentatives and the United States Senate to act in concert to send \na bill to the President. The House has done its job. Now it is up to \nthe Senate.\n  I will share one or two quick anecdotes to illustrate real people who \nhave been touched by this issue.\n  During the closure of the level I trauma center in my home State of \nNevada, a woman and her father, Mr. Lawson, were in Las Vegas visiting \nwhen this level I trauma center closed. The father had to be \ntransferred to a different emergency room, and on his way there, \nunfortunately, this gentleman passed away.\n  Level I trauma centers are staffed with the most talented, \nspecialized people in the medical profession. We have trauma centers \nspecifically staffed by the best because they must save lives that are \nin jeopardy every day. That trauma center closed because the \nspecialists could not afford the insurance, and they could not afford \nthe liability from the exposure of potential high-risk surgeries to \nsave lives.\n  The only way the legislature was able to open that trauma center \nagain is they covered the people who worked there under the umbrella of \nthe State.\n  By the way, when we talk about caps, my home state of Nevada has a \ncap of $50,000 total for economic, non-economic and medical. It is a \ntotal $50,000 cap, obviously much more severe than we would even think \nto consider in this body. In the bill before the Senate today we have a \n$250,000 cap on pain and suffering, but an unlimited amount on economic \ndamages and medical expenses, and if there is gross negligence, there \nare punitive damages in this bill as well.\n  We think we have taken a balanced approach so that patients \nthroughout this country are not denied care, such as when the trauma \ncenter in Nevada was forced to close, do not have to go through that \nexperience again. We have to ask the fundamental questions: How many \nmore people have to be denied care who really need it? How many more \npeople have to die in this country before this body will take action? \nThat is really the bottom line today. People are being denied care, and \nmore and more people will be denied the care they really need. That is \nwhy this institution needs to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor so the Senator from Wyoming may \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I always \nappreciate his comments. He has one of the fastest growing States in \nthe Nation. I come from the most sparsely populated State in the \nNation. We have some very common problems.\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n  In the last couple of days, we have heard a lot of discussion about \ninsurance companies. We have heard that medical liability insurers are \nthe source of the problem; that they are gouging doctors to make up for \ninvestment losses.\n  Well, the Nasdaq index yesterday closed at its highest level since \nApril 2002. The Nasdaq is up more than 30 percent since the beginning \nof the year. For that matter, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up \nmore than 10 percent in 2003. Under the logic we have heard this week, \nthe stock market rebound ought to be leading to a sharp reduction in \nmedical liability premiums. So why aren't we seeing any relief?\n  We are not seeing any relief because insurance companies are paying \nout more in losses than they are receiving in premiums. It is that \nsimple. It does not take an accountant to figure that out. For every \npremium dollar collected in 2001, medical liability insurers \nexperienced $1.53 in losses. Ten years earlier, for every premium \ndollar collected, insurers lost $1.03.\n  Regardless of investment gains or losses, the fact is that payments \nfor medical litigation judgments and settlements are rising much faster \nthan the incoming premium payments, even though premiums are escalating \ndramatically. Insurance companies cannot make up the gap between the $1 \nthey take in and the $1.53 they pay out without raising premiums. That \nis why we are not seeing reductions in medical liability premiums, \ndespite the stock market's advance in 2003.\n  It all comes back to our legal system. It is simply out of control. \nPeople who are truly injured by health care errors ought to receive \nfair compensation. The problem is that our medical justice system is \ncompletely out of whack. Doctors and hospitals live in constant fear of \nlitigation. They order unnecessary tests out of legal fear.\n  Doctors look at their patients as potential lawsuits, not people in \nneed of their help, because of this legal fear. They are forced to move \ntheir practices to States that have reformed their legal systems. All \nof this because of legal fear.\n  Some of my colleagues may have read a book that came out several \nyears ago, in 1995. The book was called ``The Death of Common Sense.'' \nThe book was written by Philip Howard, a lawyer by training. His \npremise was that American law and regulation are stifling human \njudgment and good sense.\n  Well, Mr. Howard just published a new book, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to read it. It is called ``The Collapse of the Common \nGood.'' In the book, he describes how law and regulation in America \ncreate a warped sense of individual rights. In America today, people \nuse the concept of individual rights to bully other members of society, \nusing the threat of legal action as a weapon.\n  Some of what Mr. Howard has written is pertinent to this debate. For \ninstance, some of my colleagues believe that this legislation would \nlimit a patient's right to sue a doctor. We all believe that patients \nwho are truly injured deserve fair compensation. The problem is that \nsome personal injury lawyers are taking advantage of this belief to \nbring all sorts of claims against doctors, whether the doctors are at \nfault or not.\n  Let me share a passage from Mr. Howard's book. He writes on pages 22 \nand 23:\n\n       Like ancient Mayans accepting human sacrifice or Catholics \n     in the Middle Ages buying indulgences, Americans today accept \n     that being sued is the price of freedom, and that diving for \n     cover is the natural response to reasonable daily choices. \n     Our faith in individual rights keeps us from pausing even to \n     question this conception of justice. But should individual \n     rights include the right to go to court over a sandbox \n     disagreement involving 3-year-olds, or to milk the system \n     whenever there is a freak accident, or to scare towns and \n     school systems out of seesaws and peanut butter? The idea of \n     individual rights derives its moral force from the rhetoric \n     of liberty. But is this what our founders had in mind when \n     they organized a society around the freedom of each \n     individual?\n       Actually, no. Our founding fathers would be shocked. There \n     is no ``right'' to bring claims for whatever you want against \n     someone else.\n       Suing is a use of state power. A lawsuit seeks to use \n     government's compulsory powers to coerce someone else to do \n     something. Asserting individual rights sounds benign, like \n     praying in the church or synagogue of your choice. Sticking a \n     legal gun in someone's ribs, however, is not a feature of \n     what our founders intended as an individual right. The point \n     of freedom is almost exactly the opposite: We can live our \n     lives without being cowed by use of legal power. The \n     individual rights our founders gave us were defensive, to \n     protect our liberty. Liberty, we somehow forgot, does not \n     include taking away someone else's liberty. . . .\n       Courts are not supposed to be commercial establishments \n     where, for the price of a lawyer, anyone can buy a chance on \n     a raffle. Courts supposedly represent the wisdom of law, \n     overseeing when those powers can be used against others in a \n     free society. There's no right to sue except as the state \n     permits.\n       I can practically feel your confusion. How else can we \n     organize justice? People obviously have the ability to go to \n     court. But by what rules and standards? Our modern \n     consciousness is so focused on individual rights we can't \n     conceive of another way to ensure fairness. But if lawsuits \n     are recognized as an exercise of state power, perhaps the \n     state should make conscious judgments of who can sue for \n     what. That's what legal rules and interpretations are for.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. That is what this legislation \nintends to do--make conscious judgments about who can sue and for what, \nand the rules and limits under which medical lawsuits can go forward.\n  Is this bill a perfect bill? No. I have yet to see a perfect bill, \nand I am in my seventh year in the Senate, following 10 years in the \nWyoming Legislature. But we ought to vote to begin this debate and move \non to the consideration of this bill, and the amendments to the bill, \nso that we can address this medical liability crisis before it further \ncompromises the liberties of the people in Wyoming and the other \nStates, and especially their access to medical care.\n  We are debating whether to proceed to debate, whether to proceed to \nbegin the amendments which can even be whole substitutes to this bill. \nSo if my colleagues have a better idea, a way to solve this, they \nshould vote to proceed, then bring their amendments.\n  Our Declaration of Independence speaks to our unalienable rights, as \ngranted to us by our Creator, and that among these rights are life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Well, it is pretty hard for an expectant mother in Wyoming to pursue \nher happiness when she has to pursue her doctor for one more well-baby \ncheck-up before he closes his practice and leaves for a State where \ninsurance premiums are lower.\n  There is another passage in Mr. Howard's book that is pertinent to \nour discussion about limits on pain-and-suffering awards. The \nstatistics show that insurance premiums are lower in States with such \nlimits, but I have heard Members on the other side of the aisle argue \nthat the limit in this bill is too low, that it is unfair to someone \nwho is severely injured, despite the fact that the bill does not limit \nin any way that person's right to recover every cent of the economic \ndamages that result from that injury.\n  Well, if the limit on pain-and-suffering awards in this bill is too \nlow, then what is the right amount?\n  I quote another passage from Mr. Howard's book, and I hope everybody \nwill read at least the first chapter of this book.\n\n       A great thing about bringing lawsuits in modern America is \n     that it is so easy to threaten the adversary's entire \n     livelihood. One stroke of the finger on the lawyer's word \n     processor, and damages go from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Three \n     more key strokes, and we're suing for a billion dollars. This \n     is fun.\n       What kind of justice system is it that allows someone to \n     make up an amount of money to demand? Is that a fact to be \n     ``found'' by a jury? It doesn't even qualify as a value \n     judgment, which at least is a conclusion based on facts. \n     Damages claimed today are completely arbitrary. Just stick \n     your finger in the air and threaten someone with any number \n     that comes to mind.\n       Judges treat damage claims almost as if they are property, \n     and only with greatest reluctance intercede. In 1987, five-\n     year-old Gregory Strothkamp climbed up several shelves to the \n     top of the linen closet, got an unopened box of Q-Tips, and, \n     while trying to use them, punctured his eardrum. His parents \n     sued the maker of Q-Tips for, among other things, $20 million \n     in punitive damages. Whatever the merits of the argument that \n     Q-Tips should come in childproof packaging (which would raise \n     everyone's cost), most people probably agree that making Q-\n     Tips is not an evil act.\n       When the jury awarded young Gregory $20 million in punitive \n     damages, the judge did what was obvious from the beginning \n     and overturned the award. The claim ended sensibly, but is \n     this how justice should work? Sweating through trial and \n     verdict to get to obvious justice, while the judge is sitting \n     there the whole time, doesn't exactly instill confidence in \n     the system.\n       Do judges enjoy watching the Q-Tip companies, or a Little \n     League coach, or a doctor squirm at the end of a \n     multimillion-dollar hook?\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n       Lying dormant along the side of society is another \n     important legal principle: that a person injured should be \n     ``made whole'' by damages. Traditionally, this meant out-of-\n     pocket losses, like lost wages or medical bills. In an \n     unusual case, like a homemaker with no wages, claims were \n     permitted in categories not actually calculable, like ``pain \n     and suffering.'' In cases of genuine evil, punitive damages \n     were possible.\n       Today, the exceptions have engulfed the rule, with all \n     kinds of side effects. Juries are regularly asked ``to assume \n     the baffling task of trying to place a monetary value on pain \n     and suffering,'' Dean Bok observed, ``although the \n     predictable result [is] to encourage a rise in litigation and \n     the growth of the most unsavory and deceptive practices.''\n       Judges might concede the principle but can't imagine how to \n     apply it. They need some objective legal post to hang on to. \n     If $1.35 billion is too much, what is the right amount? The \n     ``exercise of judicial power is not legitimate,'' as one \n     scholar put it, ``if it is based on a judge's personal \n     preference rather than law.'' So what do the judges do? They \n     abdicate. Judges look up at the allegorical figure of Justice \n     and interpret her blindfold as impotence.\n       But Justice is also holding balanced scales. How does \n     Justice achieve balance but through the values and wisdom of \n     judges? Proportion is critical to justice. Equals should be \n     treated alike, Aristotle believed, and unequals \n     proportionally to their relative differences: ``the unjust is \n     what violates the proportion.'' These distinctions, Aristotle \n     observed, can only be made with human wisdom.\n       Dead people can be so smart. ``[T]o speak somewhat \n     paradoxically,'' Cardozo observed, there are times ``when \n     nothing less than a subjective measure will satisfy an \n     objective standard.'' Justice Potter Stewart had it right \n     after all. Judges have to know it when they see it. One \n     billion dollars for a wrongful dismissal case is absurd. \n     Everyone knows it. The case should be dismissed unless the \n     plaintiff comes back with some amount he can plausibly \n     justify.\n       I wonder if judges ever ask themselves why it is that \n     damage claims have escalated to a level where they are like a \n     parody of a dysfunctional system of justice. The answer \n     couldn't be more obvious. Judges sit on their hands and \n     tolerate claims that make lotteries seem like small change. \n     The reason people bring huge claims is not hard to divine: \n     It's a form of extortion. Why else sue for such ridiculous \n     amounts? Being sued for, say, $5 million for a regular \n     accident may not cause you to fold your hand, but the \n     possibility of ruin never strays far from your consciousness. \n     Most million-dollar claims end up settling for thousands or \n     less. But not all. All that it takes is for a jury to get \n     mad. . . .\n\n  The point I am making is that there is an imbalance. I think that \neverybody recognizes there is an imbalance. We want to have a just \nsystem. What we need to do is approve this cloture petition, end the \ndebate of whether to proceed to the debate, and bring in substitute \nbills. And I have heard of some pretty good ones floating around. We \ncan debate the issue and come up with something that will make doctors \nstill accessible in States such as Nevada and Wyoming and the other \nones that we have had on the chart of states in crisis. There are only \nabout five that are not in crisis. Then there are varying degrees of \ncrisis among the rest of them.\n  The problem we are facing today is that multimillion-dollar awards \nfor pain and suffering are contributing to dramatic increases for \ninsurance premiums for doctors. When this forces doctors to leave their \npractices, it hurts innocent patients who lose their access to medical \ncare. Do we not have an obligation to say enough is enough, and set \nsome limits on lawsuits?\n  As Mr. Howard points out in his book, if lawsuits are an exercise of \nState power, perhaps the State should make conscious judgments of who \ncan sue for what.\n  When I spoke on this bill yesterday, I said the current medical \nliability crisis and the shortcomings of our medical litigation system \nmake it clear it is time for a major change. I also said that \nregardless of how we vote on this legislation, we ought to start \nworking toward replacing the current medical tort litigation scheme \nwith a more reliable and predictable and faster system of medical \njustice.\n  I have heard Members on the other side of the aisle say they want to \nwork with Republicans to find a better way to solve this problem, to \nfind reasonable good-faith alternatives to this legislation. If we vote \nnot to proceed on this bill, I hope this process will begin sooner \nrather than later. I hope we proceed so Members can bring their ideas \nout and suggest amendments; then we can vote up or down. The people of \nWyoming and other States in crisis cannot afford to lose any more \ndoctors. We cannot afford to lose any more time.\n  If we do not proceed on this bill today, I pledge to continue working \nto find solutions to this million-dollar liability crisis. I hope \nMembers on both sides of the aisle will also take this pledge to keep \nworking on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom the State of New York.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Victor Wolski\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will talk today about the nomination of \nVictor Wolski to the Court of Federal Claims. This nomination \nadmittedly has not gotten much attention from our colleagues because \nthe Court of Federal Claims does not handle the breadth or the number \nof cases that the courts of appeals do or even Federal district courts.\n\n  However, I remind my colleagues that in one area these courts are \nextremely important--they are important in many areas, but in one area \nwhere we have our usual ideological discussions and battles, the area \nof the environment. The Court of Federal Claims is the place where \nclaims of takings reside. Takings have been the way many have opposed \nthe advances we have made in the environment. They make their arguments \nthis is a government taking from you your right to use your property as \nyou see fit.\n  When the Government says you cannot pollute the water on the land you \nown or you cannot pollute the air on the land above which you own, some \nhave come up with the theory that the Government is taking something \nfrom you. It is sort of denying the theory of compact that we all live \ntogether and we all have to be responsible for our land and our water.\n  I argue that the vast majority of Americans do not agree with this \nargument. However, there is a small group of people who tend to be \npropertied, tend to be quite well off in society, who are very much for \nthis argument.\n  The nominee to the Court of Federal Claims, Victor Wolski, if we \nnominate him, if we approve him, we are approving somebody who has led \nthe charge in this area--not somebody who sees some merit to the taking \nargument and sees the other side but somebody who is a committed \nideologue, not somebody who would have the balance we need on the \ncourts.\n\n  If anyone does not believe me, I take Mr. Wolski's own words to the \nNational Journal:\n\n       Every single job that I have taken since college has been \n     ideologically oriented trying to further my principles.\n\n  He then goes on to describe his principles as ``a libertarian belief \nin property rights and limited government.''\n  This man is a self-described ideologue. I thought we had been making \nsome progress in this body, that while some would propose more \nconservative nominees and some would propose more liberal nominees, \nthat it was a bad idea to put ideologues on the bench, ideologues of \nthe left or the right.\n  Mr. Wolski is clearly an ideologue and does not belong on this \nsensitive court. For that reason, he is opposed by 13 national \nenvironmental groups. When he was counsel for the Pacific Legal \nFoundation, Mr. Wolski consistently furthered his ideology through \nsweeping arguments that would have dramatically undermined the Nation's \nenvironmental laws.\n  My guess is he preferred an America of the 1890s or the 1930s where \nour air was much dirtier, our water was much filthier. Whether you are \na Democrat or Republican, if you believe at all in preserving the \nenvironment, it would seem to me it would make a good deal of sense not \nto further this nomination. We can find people who might be more \nconsistent with the President's views, with many views on the other \nside in terms of not extending environmental laws or making sure that \nthe excesses of environmental laws are limited. Mr. Wolski is just not \nthat. He is so committed to this ideological view that the Government \nhas virtually no right to tell you you cannot pollute the air or the \nwater, that if he had his way, we would turn the clock back \ndramatically in the environmental area. As a result, as I mentioned, 13 \nnational environmental groups oppose his nomination.\n  In addition, a broad coalition of groups, civil rights, women's \nrights,\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nhuman rights organizations, including the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and the National \nWomen's Law Center have expressed serious concerns with Wolski's \n``extreme views on governmental power and his troubling record in race \nand sex discrimination cases.''\n  Admittedly, this court does not handle race and sex discrimination \ncases, but it does handle the takings cases that relate to our \nenvironment.\n  In addition, I argue to my colleagues, Mr. Wolski does not really \nhave the judicial temperament to be a Federal judge. He argued a case \nwhere there were ponds that were providing habitat for migratory birds. \nI know from my own experience that some would think every piece of \nwater, every pond and every lake is a wetlands and cannot be touched, \nand sometimes the advocates, I would be the first to say, go overboard. \nHowever, in this case, Mr. Wolski called ponds ``puddles,'' and he \nbelittled the possibility that there might be any interest in \nprotecting migratory birds. ``Jurisdiction over puddles was justified \nby the Ninth Circuit on the basis that birds might frolic in these \npuddles.''\n  He wrote:\n\n       Will one fewer puddle for the birds to bathe in have some \n     impact on the market for these birds?\n\n  In the argument he is making--I don't know, the facts of the case \nmight be right--the language does not show the temperament, a fair and \nbalanced temperament, that we seek in nominations to the bench, whether \nthey be Democrat or Republican.\n  In a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, Wolski derided what he \ncalled ``a rogue Congress'' and referred to the Members of Congress as \n``bums.'' Again, many of our constituents have hard words about \nCongress Members, but I don't think a lawyer, a trained advocate, ought \nto be using that kind of language. Again, it shows the kind of \ntemperament Mr. Wolski has.\n  On the merits of his views, he is way over to the extreme. On his \njudicial temperament he has used incendiary language that is \ninappropriate for a lawyer or a judge. Mr. Wolski should not be put on \nthe bench.\n  I make one other argument in this regard. The Federal Court of Claims \nhas some vacancies. It has 16 slots. It now has 13 senior judges in \naddition to the 11 regular judges. This court does not have much of a \ncaseload. The average number of cases the United States District Court \njudge handles is 355 cases; the number of cases a current judge of the \nCourt of Federal Claims handles is 24. If we add the new nominees, each \nwill handle 19 cases.\n\n  Let's say you don't agree with Chuck Schumer on the environment. \nLet's say you even agree with Victor Wolski, but you are a fiscal \nconservative. Why are we adding more judges to a bench that does not \nneed any help?\n  The Washington Post editorial--and, as you know, the Washington Post \non the issue of judges has not agreed with many of us on this side--\ncalled the CFC:\n\n       . . . a court of extravagance and an unnecessary waste of \n     judicial resources that should be abolished.\n\n  Each of these judges costs a million dollars. I would say to my \ncolleagues, those on the other side of the aisle did not allow nominees \nto the Court of Federal Claims when President Clinton was in office \nbecause, they said, the caseload was too low. Today the caseload is \neven lower, and there is a rush to nominate. This should not be \ndispositive.\n  If Wolski were a good man, if the caseload were growing, I would \nsupport him no matter what was done between 1995 and 2000. But I have \nto tell my colleagues on the other side, it is extremely galling to us \nthat the very arguments that have been used in the past now seem \nirrelevant, now that there is a new President making different \nappointments. If the Court of Federal Claims should not have had \nappointees under the Clinton administration and the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate did not allow any because the caseload was too low--\n24--why are we now nominating 4 and bringing the caseload down to 19? \nIt is just not right. It is not fair. There ought to be some \nconsistency to the argument. There is not. There absolutely is not.\n  So for these grounds, I urge Mr. Wolski's defeat. No. 1, he is a good \nman--he may be a good man, I don't know him personally, but when I said \n``a good man'' before, I did not mean in terms of his views for this \ncourt. He is an extremist. By his own words, he is an ideologue. He \ndoes not believe in the progress we have made on the environment.\n  If the President wishes, as our great process unfolds, to nominate \nsomebody who would cut back a little bit on the environmental laws, or \nnot make decisions that move them forward, that is a fair and \nlegitimate argument. To nominate an ideologue--a self-admitted \nideologue who has made it his career to say that anytime the Clean \nWater Act or Clean Air Act has effect, it often means it is a taking--\nis really not what the American people want. My guess is maybe half of \nthe people on this side of the aisle, on the Republican side of the \naisle, do not agree with these views at all--in terms of their voting \nrecord.\n  His temperament is poor. He uses inflammatory and derogatory \nlanguage. That makes sense, in a certain sense--that when you nominate \nideologues, they are not dispassionate. They are not going to interpret \nthe law, which is what the Founding Fathers wanted; they are going to \nmake law. I have rejected nominees from the left in my own judicial \npanel because they are ideologues, too, and they want to make law. We \nwant judges to interpret the law. Those far right and those far left \ntend to want to make law. On temperament and ideological grounds, he is \nnot the right man for the job.\n  One other argument to boot. Even if you think he is the right person \nfor the job--and I argue, I plead with you to think otherwise--this \ncourt has no caseload. This court could handle many more cases without \nan additional new judge. This is a total boondoggle. This is a waste of \nthe taxpayers' money. If it was right that this court did not have the \ncaseload under the Clinton administration so we would fill the \nvacancies, with the caseload even lower today, why are we doing that?\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote no on Victor Wolski.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for each side \nfor debate before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 34 minutes on the Democratic \nside; 19 minutes remain on the majority side. The order indicates the \nDemocratic leader will be recognized at 11:10.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before my colleague speaks, I didn't \nrealize when I yielded all the time, there was at least one other of my \ncolleagues who wanted to speak on Mr. Wolski. Could we, if he should \ncome, just leave 5 minutes to continue the debate? I just reserve 5 \nminutes of the time to discuss the Wolski nomination, and I will yield \nthe remainder--whatever is left after reserving those 5 minutes--to my \ncolleague who I know wants to speak on both issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope I understand what just happened. I have 29 minutes \nremaining? Is that mistaken? Five minutes will be given to some \nDemocrat to speak on the Wolski nomination, and then the remaining 13 \nminutes, is that correct, are on the Republican side, majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 19 minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think I have it, or at least close to it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for your cooperation and I thank my \ncolleague from New York for yielding this time.\n  In the last 2 days we have been engaged in a debate on the floor \nwhich affects every American family and business, and the question is, \nWhat are we going to do about the dramatic increase in the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance that we see among some specialties in \nsome parts of the country? It doesn't affect every State. It doesn't \naffect every doctor. But those doctors who are hardest hit, I believe--\nand I think everyone here shares that belief--need relief. They need \nsome help.\n  What do we have offered to us today? S. 11. This is the bill brought \nto us by\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, and Senator McConnell and a number \nof other Republican Senators. This suggests that the best way to limit \nthe medical malpractice premiums being charged to doctors is to limit \nthe amount of recovery that a person who has been a victim of medical \nmalpractice can receive. It is a decision which says we will no longer \ntrust a jury of 12 people from your community, your city, and your \nState to decide what is fair compensation for your injury caused by \nanother person. That decision will be made by a jury of 100 Senators, \nwho will decide today, with S. 11, that regardless of what has happened \nto you or your child, regardless of the severity of the injury, \nregardless of how many years you are going to go through constant pain \nor suffering, we will decide today, in the Senate, that if your State \nhas not come up with another number, the maximum amount you can receive \nis $250,000 for pain and suffering.\n  Some may say that is a pretty substantial sum of money. I have heard \nthat said on the floor here. How can the critics of this bill be coming \nto you and saying $250,000 is not that much money?\n  I concede, if you bought a lottery ticket today and were paid \n$250,000 tomorrow, you would be a happy person. But if you had a \nmedical injury today which incapacitated you for the rest of your life, \nwhich left you in a wheelchair, quadriplegic for the rest of your life, \nwhich left you in a state dependent on others for the rest of your \nlife, which left you permanently scarred and disfigured for the rest of \nyour life, and you were told that your compensation was $250,000, I \nthink it would put it in a much different perspective.\n  I think that is what is missing in this debate. I cannot get over how \nSenators come to this floor and dismiss all of these victims of medical \nmalpractice and say, basically: It is a shame, but they just don't get \nit. We have a bigger problem here. We have a malpractice insurance \nproblem.\n  I have listened to the debate. I have listened to those who suggest \nthat this bill, S. 11, is the answer to the problem. I say it isn't. \nThe problem is national. The problem is serious. The problem will not \nbe answered by this legislation.\n  There is a belief that if you limit the amount that a victim can \nrecover malpractice insurance premiums will go down. Let me tell you \nthat facts don't bear that out.\n  Take a look at these States. Some of them have State laws that cap \nliability. Others don't. Of the States without caps where a victim of \nmalpractice can receive whatever a jury thinks is fair in the period \n1991-2002, four of those--Arizona, New York, Georgia, and Washington--\nsaw modest increases in malpractice insurance premiums. Here are four \nStates with caps on what a victim can receive. The malpractice \ninsurance premiums have shot up dramatically. There is no direct link \nbetween limiting a victim's recovery and the malpractice insurance \npremiums that are charged. Yesterday, Senator Ensign of Nevada, I think \nin a very candid moment, conceded that fact. He brought out a chart. He \nsaid you can't compare States with caps that have only been in place \nfor a short time. In the words of Senator Ensign, as the Congressional \nRecord reflects, it will take 8, 10, 12, or maybe 15 years before these \ncaps on victims in terms of what they can recover for their serious \ninjuries really do have a measurable impact on malpractice insurance \npremiums.\n  I would say to the doctors in Illinois and in Nevada and in any State \nin the Union, is this a reasonable answer to today's malpractice \ninsurance crisis to suggest that limiting a victim's recovery will \nultimately reduce malpractice insurance premiums 8, 10, 12, or 15 years \nfrom now? Trust me. In some of these specialties, OB/GYN and \nneurosurgery, these doctors can't wait for that period of time. Sadly, \neven if you bought the premise of this bill that limiting a victim's \nrecovery will help a doctor's malpractice premiums, the sponsor of the \nbill came to the floor yesterday and conceded that it won't happen for \n8 to 15 years.\n  Where does that leave us? It leaves us in a situation where we have a \nbill that is fundamentally unfair to the victims of medical malpractice \npremiums.\n  I listened to the rhetoric on the other side. I have been a \npracticing attorney, a trial lawyer, both a defense attorney and a \nplaintiff's attorney. I guess I understand that my profession has been \nthe butt of a lot of jokes and a lot of derision. I have heard Members \ncome to the floor and talk about those greedy lawyers. I will have to \ntell you that there are an awful lot of men and women practicing law \nacross the United States who I think are doing a service to their \nclients and to America. They have people come into their law offices \nwho are seriously hurt or who have lost a loved one and who have no \nmoney to their name and are looking for justice. They want an \nopportunity to go to court. They can't pay for it. They can't pay for \nan attorney on an hourly basis and be charged $10,000, $20,000, \n$30,000, or $40,000 for their day in court. Some of them can't even pay \nthe court costs or the filing fees or the necessary expenses for a \ndeposition asking questions preparing for a lawsuit.\n  Lawyers who represent these people say: I will take it on a \ncontingent basis. If you succeed, if you win, I will be paid. If you do \nnot succeed, if you lose, I will lose with you. That will be the gamble \nwe will take together. We believe we have a good lawsuit. Let us go \nforward. Some of these lawyers say on a personal basis this is what my \nrecovery will be.\n\n  I don't think there is anything unfair or insidious about this any \nmore than it is unfair or insidious that those who are defending the \nperson accused of wrongdoing are generally represented by insurance \ncompany lawyers who pay unlimited amounts of money for the defense of a \nlawsuit. That is just the nature of our judicial system.\n  On this floor the people who take contingency fee cases are referred \nto as greedy and selfish, exploiting the plaintiff, exploiting the \nclaimant, and exploiting the victims. I am sure it has happened. I am \nsure it will continue to happen--I hope in as few cases as possible.\n  There is nothing unfair or unjust about a contingency fee system. In \nfact, it gives people an opening in the court they would never be able \nto afford. I have seen it. I represented people under those \ncircumstances. I have run that risk. Sometimes I didn't succeed for the \nclient or myself. Sometimes I did. That is the nature of the system.\n  Then a Senator came to the floor yesterday. He is a friend of mine. I \nrespect him. But he used a term which troubles me greatly. He said he \nwants to end this ``jackpot justice.'' That was his phrase--``jackpot \njustice.'' I guess the idea is that if someone goes into a courtroom \nwith a flimsy case and ends up with millions of dollars, hit the \njackpot. I guess that can happen, too. Maybe it has.\n  But I want to talk to you a little bit about ``jackpot justice'' in \nthe world of medical malpractice. I would like to point, as exhibit No. \n1, to Alan Cronin, a 42-year-old man from the State of California. Alan \nCronin is a man who has three children. He went in for a simple surgery \nof a hernia repair. After the surgery, two doctors failed to diagnose \nan acute infection. They treated him as if he had the flu. But he had a \nvery serious infection instead. He became septic and suffered toxic \nshock. Once the doctors realized that, and they had to reopen the \nsurgery site where they repaired the hernia. They found a horrendous \ninfection underway. They told his family that he had a 98-percent \nchance of dying as a result of this infection. Gangrene had set in. As \na consequence of a simple hernia operation and the malpractice that \noccurred afterwards, this gangrene claimed all four of Alan Cronin's \nlimbs--both of his legs, both of his arms.\n  He used to be a customer service representative for a medical \nequipment manufacturer and workers compensation paid for all of his \nmedical expenses, including some of his future expenses. He also had a \nprivate disability policy that he used to help keep his family \ntogether, offsetting future damages.\n  The reason this case is important is I guess there are some in the \nChamber who would say if Alan Cronin goes to a courtroom and asks the \njury for a verdict against the doctor who made the mistake which led to \nhis infection, which led to gangrene and which led to this man losing \nboth arms and both legs and asks for a verdict against that\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nnegligent doctor and he is given several million dollars to try to keep \nhis family and life together for the rest of his natural life, in the \nwords of some of my colleagues, Alan Cronin would ``hit the jackpot.''\n  What a jackpot--several million dollars for both arms and both legs? \nHow many volunteers would sign up for that jackpot? How many people \nwant to buy a ticket on that jackpot lottery? None of us would. None of \nus would ever trade places with what this man has gone through and will \ngo through every minute of every hour of every day of every week of \nevery month and every year for the rest of his life. This is a jackpot?\n\n  You should have been in the room yesterday when Senator Graham and I \nmet four victims of medical malpractice who came in to see us.\n  Colin Gouley, a young man from Nebraska, came to us. As a result of \nmedical malpractice, when he was born he had serious problems and \ndisabilities and is going to be confined to a wheelchair. He must sleep \nat night with a cast. He has a limited ability to respond and learn and \nspeak. He won't go through the ordinary human events of experiences \nthat we take for granted.\n  He has a twin brother. This is a picture of Colin and his twin \nbrother Conner. You can see Colin on the left and his twin brother, who \nis healthy, happy, and an active young man. That will be the fate and \nfuture for Colin.\n  They took the case to a jury in Nebraska and said for the rest of his \nlife and with all of the pain and suffering that he will endure, what \nis it worth? That jury said: We calculate it to be about $5.6 million. \nBut because of Nebraska's State law that limits the amount that can be \nawarded in cases of medical malpractice, the family will receive a \nfraction of that amount. It will mean that his mother and father and \nhis two sisters and brother will be tending to his care for the rest of \nhis life, as they would naturally, but they will have to do it much \nmore because of his situation. It also means that ultimately the \ndoctors and hospital that may have been responsible for this wrongdoing \nwill not be held accountable but it will be the responsibility of the \ngovernment to pay more and more of his medical expenses. That is not \nwhat the family wants, but look at the situation they face.\n\n  Do you believe the Gouley family hit the jackpot? This is jackpot \njustice? I can tell you what this bill would say. If your State does \nnot have a limitation on recovery, this bill would say to Colin Gouley \nand his family: We are sorry this happened to you, we are sorry you \nwere a victim of malpractice, but the pain and suffering you will \nendure for the rest of your natural life is worth $250,000. The verdict \nrendered by the jury of the Senate is $250,000 and not one penny more.\n  That isn't fair to the Gouley family, but, frankly, that is our idea \nof how to deal with the medical malpractice insurance crisis. At least \nthat is what has been proposed.\n  We have to put a human face on this issue. We have to make sure \npeople understand it isn't just doctors who face malpractice premiums, \nit isn't just people who are looking for care but cannot find it \nbecause doctors cannot practice in some areas because it is more \nexpensive. The solution being offered by the Senator from Nevada and \nothers is to limit the recovery of medical malpractice victims and \ntheir families, to limit the amount of money that would be paid to \nchildren who are the victims of medical malpractice.\n  There is no argument here about who is at fault. The fault was \nestablished by the jury. But this bill would say: The Federal \nGovernment will decide how much the Gouley family can receive. The \nFederal Government will decide how much Alan Cronin will receive for \npain and suffering in those States that do not have a different \nlimitation.\n  I guess what troubles me, too, is this bill does not go to the root \nissue that is before us. We were told by this administration, the Bush \nadministration, through Dr. Clancy of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, that medical errors and medical malpractice have \nreached epidemic proportions in this country. Instead of dealing with \nmedical malpractice at an epidemic proportion, what we are saying is \nthe real way to control this problem is to make sure Colin Gouley and \nhis family are not adequately compensated for the injuries and damages \nthey have suffered.\n  That is so shortsighted and it is so fundamentally unfair.\n  If these malpractice premiums are unfair to doctors, I can tell you \nS. 11 is fundamentally unfair to Colin Gouley and his family and people \nlike them across America.\n  Mr. President, 100,000 Americans will lose their lives this year \nbecause of medical malpractice, not because of their disease or illness \nbut because of mistakes that are made--100,000 people. And that figure \ncomes from the Bush administration Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Of those who could file a malpractice claim in any given year, 1 out \nof 50 actually do go to a lawyer and seek compensation; 2 percent, 1 \nout of 50. If we do not go to the root cause of this problem, this bow \nwave of malpractice that is about to swamp us in this country, then, \nfrankly, we are not addressing the root problem. Instead, what we are \ndoing is penalizing the Gouley family and others like them and \nrewarding insurance companies.\n  Do not be surprised by that. We do that on a weekly basis in the \nSenate. We find ways to take a special interest group, such as \ninsurance companies, and give them more profitability, less \naccountability, whether it is HMOs, which, incidentally, are protected \nand rewarded by this same bill, or other insurance companies. That is \nthe nature of the philosophy that drives the majority opinion in the \nSenate.\n\n  But families across America see it differently, and they should. This \nlaw we are considering, S. 11, unfairly is going to insulate from \nliability HMO insurance companies, managed care insurance companies, as \nwell as drug companies and medical device manufacturers.\n  One last point I would like to make at this moment is they have a \nprovision in this bill which says if your drug, for example, or medical \ndevice has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it \nvirtually insulates you from liability for punitive damages. I asked my \nstaff to prepare a list of the various drugs that have been marketed \nwhich have been found to be dangerous and deadly to people across \nAmerica. Frankly, there are too many for me to list in the record at \nthis point. I will submit them at a later time.\n  Why in the world would we want to put in this bill an insulation for \nthose who make medical devices which end up killing people? Why in the \nworld, in a bill that is supposed to be helping struggling doctors, are \nwe talking about insulating from liability pharmaceutical companies \nthat sell dangerous drugs?\n  Oh, the argument is, if it is approved by the FDA, that should be \nenough. We know better. Those of us who have been involved on Capitol \nHill know we do not fund the Food and Drug Administration adequately. \nThere are not enough people there doing the important work that should \nbe done. We know they do their best, and we know that 9 times out of \n10, maybe 99 times out of 100, they are going to make certain drugs are \nsafe and efficacious, but we also know quite well that there are not \nenough people there doing the job that needs to be done.\n  Much like the tobacco companies hid behind the warning label on their \npackages when they were sued for cancer and heart disease, these drug \ncompanies, under S. 11, want to hide behind an FDA approval and say: We \ncan't be held accountable for what we might have known or what we might \nhave done if, in fact, somewhere along the way the FDA gave us a stamp \nof approval. That should insulate us from liability.\n  Think about what we are doing here, and think, for a moment, about \nthe victims. If you love the companies, if you love the insurance \ncompanies, couldn't you have some love in your heart for these victims, \nsome compassion for what they are going to go through? I think that \nshould be an important part of the debate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time is on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes on the majority side, 13 \nminutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, let's make sure one thing is \nclear. What we are debating today is whether to proceed to the bill. We \nare trying to get on the bill. If people have certain problems with the \nbill, they can offer amendments, but only if they allow us to proceed \nto the bill. That is what the vote is on today, whether or not we are \ngoing even consider that we might address a crisis that is happening in \nthe United States.\n  There have been a few things that have been talked about from the \nother side of the aisle today that I would like to address. I want to \nread from a report because they have been quoting this study. The Weiss \nstudy, which has been referenced repeatedly by the other side of the \naisle, supposedly took numbers from this publication called the Medical \nLiability Monitor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a portion of this report \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Medical Liability Monitor, Oct. 2002]\n\n        2002 Rate Survey Finds Malpractice Premiums Are Soaring\n\n\nhard market wallops physicians; average rate increases more than double \n                             those in 2001\n\n       A nationwide survey of rates for physicians' medical \n     professional liability insurance confirms that not only has a \n     hard market for this necessary coverage arrived, but from all \n     indications, it is settling in to stay for awhile.\n       For the past 12 years Medical Liability Monitor has \n     conducted an annual study of malpractice insurance rates. \n     Reports come in from carriers in all 50 states who represent \n     approximately 65% to 70% of the entire market. This year, \n     that percentage may be even larger, now that former insureds \n     of St. Paul and other companies who have quit the business \n     must obtain replacement coverage and are moving to carriers \n     remaining in the traditional market when possible.\n       For many physicians, whose incomes are held down by rigid \n     government and health plan reimbursement schedules, coming up \n     with funds to pay fast-rising insurance costs poses real \n     problems. Here is a closer look at how malpractice insurance \n     rates have risen in many places in the past year.\n       The chart below shows that the average cost of malpractice \n     insurance for internists rose by 24.7% from July 1, 2001 to \n     July 1, 2002. In 2001 the percent of increase was 10.1%. \n     General surgeons' rates went up similarly, increasing by an \n     average 25% in 2002 from 10.3% in 2001. The average increase \n     in rates for obstetricians/gynecologists climbed from 9.2% \n     last year to 19.6% this year.\n       For internists and general surgeons the average percent of \n     increase in the 12-month 2001-2002 period was a staggering \n     145% and 143%. Increases for OB/Gyns, whose rates typically \n     are much higher than those of their internal medicine and \n     surgical colleagues, went up on average by 113%.\n       The effects of the rate increases were uneven, falling most \n     heavily in certain states and metropolitan areas, like New \n     York, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Miami. Unlikely spots \n     for exploding premiums were Las Vegas, West Virginia, and the \n     Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Even though there were rate hikes \n     in most states, they sometimes were more modest. Two states, \n     Alabama and Alaska, had no increases at all. Insurers in \n     several states raised rates only modestly. There were even a \n     few, but very few, downward adjustments in rates for certain \n     specialists in specific territories in a handful of states. \n     One company in Alabama cut rates for general surgeons by 6%. \n     A company in California pared rates for internists in certain \n     areas by 4% and 7% and for obstetricians in other areas by 1% \n     and 3%. An Illinois company lowered rates for general \n     surgeons, except in Cook and two other counties by 4% to \n     8.6%. There were some modest reductions for certain type of \n     physicians in two or three other states, but these were by \n     far the exceptions, not the rule.\n       The size of increases in some areas in which malpractice \n     problems with claims and claims severity have exploded was \n     mind-boggling. Increases of 40%, 50%, 60%, 80% were not \n     uncommon. In Arkansas one carrier boosted rates by 90.1% to \n     112.7%.\n\n\n                basement to through-the-roof variations\n\n       The differences in premiums for specialists in various \n     states and areas are widespread. Base rates for internists in \n     South Dakota provided by one insurer, were $2,906, while the \n     highest rate reported for these physicians was $56,154 in \n     Dade County, Miami.\n       The extremes in base rates for general surgeons are even \n     greater. In Minnesota one company's manual rate was $8,717, \n     but in Miami the highest number quoted by a carrier for this \n     specialty was $174,268. The wide swings were also typical for \n     OB/Gyns. One company's rate for these physicians was $13,317 \n     in South Dakota, but once again, the highest rate was \n     $210,576 in Miami.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the editor of this report has basically \nsaid the Weiss study they quote is completely misusing their numbers. I \nrefer you to a portion of the report entitled ``Survey Finds Wide \nSwings in Premiums'' because my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle state that there have not been these wide swings in premiums. The \nreport says:\n\n       The size of increases in some areas in which malpractice \n     problems with claims and claims severity have exploded was \n     mind-boggling. Increases of 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 \n     percent, 80 percent were not uncommon. In Arkansas one \n     carrier boosted rates by 90.1 percent to 112.7 percent.\n\n  Notice what it said here. It said, ``malpractice problems with claims \nand claims severity have exploded.'' The premium increases have been \n``mind-boggling.''\n  The Senator from Illinois has put up pictures of victims of \nmalpractice. I want to show a picture of one of the victims, because \nthere are victims on both sides of this issue.\n  Picture this gentleman shown here.\n  This was a gentleman, Mr. Lawson, who was visiting the city in which \nI live, Las Vegas, Nevada with his family. Unfortunately, the time they \nvisited was the week the trauma center closed because of the crisis we \nhave in the State of Nevada. The trauma center closed, and this \ngentleman, unfortunately, could not get care. In this picture he looks \nhealthy. Unfortunately, he is no longer with us.\n  There are a lot of people the other side have shown as victims. Those \npeople, if we do not do something, will not even have doctors to go to \nbecause doctors are leaving the profession, and new doctors are not \ncoming in to replace them.\n  We have a crisis in this country in 19 States. All but six States are \nshowing serious problems. The Senator from Illinois quoted my words \nyesterday, that it takes years to find out whether legislation in the \nStates that have enacted reform will be effective. The reason for that \nisn't that they aren't necessarily good pieces of legislation, it is \nthat they are being challenged in court and then appealed and appealed \nand appealed. A lot of the State courts are striking down these laws, \nbecause of some technicality in their constitution or a particular \nproblem in their piece of legislation. Because of that, there is \nuncertainty even when States pass legislation if this crisis will \nremain out of control. The insurance companies don't know whether the \nlaws are going to be upheld, so they can't lower rates because they may \nend up with a huge liability down the road if the law is struck down. \nThat is the problem.\n  We must act now while we still have some time. How bad does the \nsituation have to get in the future? I would love to add into this \nbill, as we did with campaign finance reform legislation in the year \n2001, an expeditious judiciary review of the law so that we can find \nout whether it is going to be held constitutional or not. But we can't \ndo any of that because the other side of the aisle will not even allow \nus to proceed to the bill. We can't debate the legislation and we can't \noffer any amendments unless we can at least agree to proceed to the \nbill.\n  If the opponents don't like the legislation, if they think there are \nways to fix it, they should allow us to at least proceed to the bill so \nthat we can have amendments offered, have a full debate, bring out all \nthe pictures of the victims you want to bring out, amend the bill, and \ncome up with legislation that is going to actually fix the problem in \nthe United States. It really is a crisis and you can be sure that \ndebating on the motion to proceed, and not agreeing to take up the bill \nwill not fix the problem.\n  I wish to again illustrate the differences in the premiums across the \ncountry by the use of this chart. In white are the two States with \ncities represented that have had medical liability reforms in place for \nsome time.\n  I yield myself an additional minute.\n  The ones in gray have not.\n  Let's go to obstetrics and gynecology. Los Angeles, CA, the bill \nbefore us today mirrors the law they have there. There is a $54,000 \nmedical liability premium in Los Angeles. In Denver, where they have \nhad it since 1988, it is $30,000. New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, Miami \nare much higher: $89,000, $108,000, $102,000, over $200,000 in Miami. \nThat illustrates the difference in the premiums in States that don't \nhave the reform. These numbers are continuing\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nto go up at a rapid rate. The numbers reflected here are actually a \ncouple years old, and they are continuing to skyrocket in States \nwithout reform. That is why we need to act. It is a national priority, \nand we must act now.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  My question is, Why do we need to consider a bill of this magnitude \nwithout taking it through the ordinary committee process? The Senator \nfrom Nevada said yesterday, we just know we would never get it out of \ncommittee. I am a little bit surprised at that because, if I am not \nmistaken, it is the party of the Senator from Nevada that is the \nmajority in every committee that would consider this bill. If they are \ntruly looking for a bill that is fair and one that compromises where \nnecessary and negotiates a good-faith outcome, then it would come out \nof committee. And certainly with the direction of the majority leader, \nSenator Frist, who has spoken in favor of it, there would be an urgency \nto it.\n  That is not the way this bill is being considered. This bill is \ncoming to the floor without committee hearing. They haven't had a \nchance to hear the witnesses, not the four malpractice victims and \ntheir families we met yesterday, not the doctors on both sides of the \nissue, not the practicing attorneys, not representatives of the \ninsurance companies, none of them, no hearings from them, no statements \nfrom them, no suggestions from them. I don't know where this bill came \nfrom.\n  I can tell you the people who want it: Not only the American Medical \nAssociation but clearly those who represent HMOs and managed care \ncompanies that are insulated from liability under this bill, those who \nrepresent prescription drug companies that are insulated from liability \nunder the bill, as well as medical device manufacturers. They put this \nbill together.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the Senator's time I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Is the Senator aware, last year, when his party was in \ncontrol, 115 bills bypassed the committee process, including the \neconomic growth package, No Child Left Behind, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, a Medicare prescription drug bill, the energy bill, and the \nTrade Promotion Act? All were brought directly to the floor and \nbypassed the committee process. Is the Senator aware his party did \nthat?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of that. I also have quotes from Republican \nSenators who screamed in outrage every time that happened.\n  S. 11 is too important for us to consider without deliberation. It is \ntoo important for us to ignore that this bill is an historic precedent. \nIt will take away from States across America the power they have had \nfrom the beginning of this Republic to establish standards for \nprocedure and recovery in civil lawsuits.\n  That is something that, honestly, we do very rarely around here. If \nwe do it, if we consider it, as we are right now, for example, on the \nasbestos issue, it is with a long and deliberative process. Not so when \nit comes to medical malpractice. This is being brought to the floor on \na take-it-or-leave-it basis. When you say take it or leave it, I hope \nmy colleagues will leave it because the thought that we would limit \nrecovery to $250,000 for pain and suffering for every case defies \nlogic, common sense, and compassion. If you are looking for \ncompassionate conservatives, you won't find them in those supporting \nthis bill.\n  Let me give one illustration. This poor lady is from the city of \nChicago. She had two moles on the side of her face. She went to an \noutstanding hospital to have the moles removed. She is about 50 years \nof age. During the course of the simple surgery, she was receiving \noxygen. They were using a cauterizing gun, which you are not supposed \nto do. As a consequence, there was an explosion with the oxygen. Her \nface was literally burned off because of the fire which happened.\n\n  Her nose was so burned and scarred, she went through several \nsuccessive surgeries and, even after those surgeries, has to rely on \noxygen tubes to breathe 23 hours a day. It is anticipated she will go \nthrough more surgeries to deal with the scarring and disfigurement and \nproblems she has had. She is in her fifties. She went in for simple \nsurgery. She came out disfigured for life.\n  According to this bill, the hospital and doctor responsible for it \nshould both come together and pay her medical bills. I certainly hope \nso. If she bought health insurance to cover her own medical bills, that \nwould be brought up in the courtroom, so that the jury might not \nbelieve she receives quite as much money because her payment of health \ninsurance, frankly, would be used against her. She would receive lost \nwages for time off the job. That is reasonable. But when it comes to \nthe pain and suffering she will endure and has endured from the moment \nthis occurred until the day she dies, the jury of the Senate has \nreached a verdict through this bill: She is entitled to recover not one \npenny more than $250,000 for a lifetime of disfigurement.\n  She wrote an article in the Chicago Sun-Times and said: How many of \nyou would trade what I went through for $250,000? The answer, \nobviously, is no one. No one would.\n  For those who come before us today and say this is the only way we \ncan deal with the medical malpractice insurance crisis is to ignore \nwhat happened to this woman who went in for routine surgery and saw her \nlife tragically changed. That is what is wrong with the bill.\n  What we need to do is to be honest about addressing malpractice. I \nhave not heard one word from the other side of the aisle on how we can \nreduce medical errors. What can we do about HMO insurance companies \nmaking medical decisions when in fact doctors know better? It is \nhappening. This bill does nothing about that.\n  What can we do about the nursing shortage which accounts for 20 \npercent of the deaths in hospitals each year for malpractice? Nurses \noverworked. They can't keep up with the caseload, the patients coming. \nThis bill does nothing about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield myself an additional 1 minute.\n  This legislation addresses the issue from one perspective only. To \ndeny to this person and other victims an opportunity for their day in \ncourt, to say we don't trust a jury in America, in any State in the \nUnion, to make a decision on the death penalty in a criminal case, or \nwe cannot trust a jury in Chicago to make a decision on what she is \nentitled to receive because of the injuries she endured in that one \ntragic moment in the hospital, that just defies logic.\n\n  It says to me that this bill is being brought to us by insurance \ncompanies, by drug companies, by HMOs, by medical device manufacturers, \nand it is not being brought to us with an eye toward solving a serious \nnational problem of bringing down malpractice insurance rates.\n  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time. When I return, I will \ntalk about an alternative bill that Senator Graham of South Carolina \nand I are offering, which addresses this in a more responsible and \ntimely fashion. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I think we have 12 minutes 20 seconds on \nour time. How much time is on theirs?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Two Senators have just come into the Chamber. As soon as \nthey are ready, I would like to yield them 10 minutes and reserve 2 \nminutes on our side and we can close up. At 11:10, the Democratic \nleader will be recognized. So I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Patients First Act \nof 2003. Going to the doctor for a checkup is hard enough these days. \nYou have to juggle your family and work schedules. A few of us get all \nthe checkups and screenings we need, but making matters a lot worse is \nthe fact that more and more doctors are closing their practices or \nlimiting the services they offer. They are doing so because they cannot \nafford the increasing costs of their medical malpractice insurance, \nwhich they are required to carry.\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\n  According to the American Medical Association, 19 States are in a \nfull-blown medical liability crisis, including, regrettably, my home \nState of Missouri.\n  In Missouri, physicians' average premium increases for 2002 were 61.2 \npercent. This was on top of increases in 2001 of 22.4 percent. As a \nresult, over 31 percent--almost one-third--of all physicians surveyed \nby the Missouri State Medical Association said they are considering \nleaving their practices altogether. Let me repeat that. Almost one in \nthree physicians in Missouri are considering leaving their practices \naltogether because they simply can no longer afford to practice because \nof exorbitant medical malpractice insurance rates.\n\n  In some cases, medical liability insurance rates are tripling in \nMissouri, forcing older doctors into retirement and younger physicians \ninto other fields.\n  What is the cause of that? The cause, quite frankly, is the \nunrestrained plaintiffs' legal actions asserting all kinds of \nnoneconomic and economic damages, which are paid, ultimately, by the \nconsumers who must compensate the doctors or lose their doctor services \nbecause of the rates of malpractice insurance. Those judgments go \nagainst doctors, and they have to be paid by insurance companies. But \nthe insurance companies raise their rates and drive good and bad \ndoctors out of practice.\n  According to the Missouri State Medical Association, 32 insurance \ncompanies are licensed to write professional liability insurance for \nMissouri physicians. Currently, only three of them are willing, or \nable, to write new business. Three companies, which accounted for \nalmost one-third of Missouri's markets in 2001, have left the State of \nMissouri altogether. The result: doctors who have practiced for years \nin Missouri are closing their doors, moving their practices and \nfamilies across State lines, or limiting the care and services they \nprovide. It is happening in my State and it is happening across the \ncountry.\n  But this is not just a problem for doctors. They are well educated, \nand they can move elsewhere and resume their practice, as difficult and \nunfair as that is. The real damage and pain is being felt by the \npatients, or people who would be their patients if they had the choice. \nLook at what is happening in Kansas City, MO, for example. Twelve \ndoctors at the Kansas City Women's Clinic, founded in 1953, used to \nserve women in Missouri and Kansas. Because of rising medical liability \nrates, the clinic could not find a single company that would offer them \na single medical malpractice insurance policy that they need to keep \ntheir office open in Missouri. The result: On December 31, 2002, they \nclosed their doors to Missouri patients. They closed their doors.\n  There were over 6,600 visits a year in the Missouri office. Now women \nin Kansas City, MO, tell me that when they are expecting a child, in \norder to go in for a checkup, they have to go to Kansas--drive across \nthe State line to Kansas. They either travel to Kansas to see an \nobstetrician/gynecologist or try to find a new doctor elsewhere in \nMissouri.\n  In a recent letter, Dr. Anthon Heit, president of the Kansas City \nWomen's Clinic, said:\n\n       Our loyal patients from Kansas City, Missouri, and many \n     surrounding Missouri communities, lost large, well-respected \n     groups of OB/GYN physicians as a source of their maternity \n     care. This type of action is going to continue to occur in \n     the Kansas City area, and in many other specialties, if the \n     trend does not reverse.\n\n  Sadly, that is not an isolated case. Also in Kansas City, the Midwest \nWomen's Health Network suffered a 170 percent increase in the cost of \nits medical malpractice insurance. It used to pay $200,000 a year for \nliability coverage. Now it pays $543,000.\n  Two Kansas City inner-city OB/GYNs, who serve low-income, high-risk \npatients, had to sell their practices to their hospital in order to \ncontinue to see patients in Missouri. Excessive litigation has created \nan environment that forced these two doctors--committed to serving some \nof the most vulnerable in Kansas--out of business. They are no longer \nin independent practice.\n\n  One OB/GYN practice in Missouri is taking out a $1.5 million loan to \npay its medical malpractice insurance for this year. That doesn't even \ncover the cost of previous actions over which they might subsequently \nbe sued. Other doctors in Missouri are considering going without \ninsurance for those past actions, or the ``tail'' coverage, as it is \ncalled, because they cannot afford the premiums.\n  In Missouri, this year alone, we have already lost 33 obstetricians \nand it is only July. If this trend continues, potentially 3,564 \npregnant women in Missouri will be forced to find new physicians \nannually to provide their obstetric care--probably outside of the \nState--thus, interrupting continuity of care and long-established \nphysician-patient relationships upon which so many women have come to \nrely.\n  Patients cannot get the care they need. The communities are losing \ntheir trusted doctors. We have a health care system that is in crisis \nin Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he may require to my friend and \ncolleague from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time remains \nthat was yielded by the Senator from Nevada to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n  As his neighbor to the west, I share Senator Bond's concern for our \nhealth care providers and patients. But it seems that we have a ``tale \nof two cities'' between Kansas City, KS, and Kansas City, MO.\n  Just across the State line, we in Kansas have problems and \nchallenges. But we don't have the same severe problems Missouri doctors \nand patients are facing. That is because, in the 1980s, Kansas enacted \nsweeping medical liability reform legislation that does create a hard \ncap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages.\n  By contrast, that same cap in Missouri is $557,000 and can go even \nhigher under certain circumstances. As the Senator from Missouri said, \nyou won't find it surprising that nonsurgical specialists in Missouri \nare now seeing very dramatic liability premium increases that have \nbeen, until now, limited to surgical specialties. One pulmonary \npractice's quote for traditional insurance went from $35,000 to \n$125,000 per year. Another pulmonary specialist quit practicing at \nNorth Kansas City Hospital because he couldn't afford the premium on \nhis Missouri practice. Now, as the Senator knows, he practices in \nKansas.\n  Here is another example.\n  We have learned that both neurosurgeons in Independence are moving \nout of Missouri this summer leaving eastern Jackson County with no \nneurosurgeon. There is no trauma care basically between the Kansas \nState line and Columbia, 2 hours to the east.\n  According to the Kansas Medical Society, the two largest companies in \nKansas that provide medical liability insurance, Kansas Medical Mutual \nInsurance Company and Medical Protective, had increases that were not \nnearly as excessive as the increases in Missouri. Kansas Medical \nMutual, the largest insurer in Kansas, took rate increases of 16.2 \npercent last year and 8.5 percent this year. Medical Protective took a \n13-percent increase last year.\n  Premiums for the standard policy in Kansas that have been available \nfor the last 15 to 20 years were actually lower in 2002 than they were \nin 1991.\n  As I have stated, premiums for the standard policy in Kansas are \nactually lower than they were in 1991. I simply want to make the point \nin the short time I have that we have a tale of two cities. We have a \nKansas law in which we have 15 percent more doctors in Kansas than in \nthe past. Their premiums are not excessive. People are leaving Kansas \nCity, MO, to practice in Kansas. It is a tale of two cities. That is \nwhy I think we should support the bill that has been authored by the \nSenator from Nevada, S. 11.\n  A study by Weiss Ratings on medical malpractice caps was mentioned \nyesterday evening. The study found that States with caps experienced \nhigher premium increases than those States without. I cannot speak for \nother States but I can speak for Kansas, and the reports conclusions \nwere untrue.\n  First, as I have stated, premiums for the standard policy in Kansas \nare actually lower now than they were in 1991.\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\n  Secondly, the point needs to be made that all caps are not the same. \nThe Weiss report lists the 19 States with caps, but only 5 States, \nincluding Kansas, have $250,000 caps on noneconomic damages. The rest \nare significantly higher, thus reducing the cap's impact on payouts and \npremiums.\n  There is no question that the cap on noneconomic damages has had an \nimpact on premiums. It has created an unparalleled period of premium \nstability for Kansas physicians and hospitals. Yes, premiums are \nincreasing in Kansas but at a much lower rate that other States.\n  Case in point: a family physician who delivers babies paid $13,790 in \n1991 . . . . in 2001, that same physician paid $12,575--an 8.8 percent \nreduction. Similar reductions exist for virtually every specialty. In \nthe aggregate, physicians paid $75.3 million in premiums in 1991 and \n$60 million in 2002.\n  Finally, I wish to point out that there are probably about 15 percent \nmore physicians practicing in Kansas today than there were 12 years \nago, and the total premium is still lower.\n  Senator Bond and I have shared with our colleagues what good medical \nliability reform can do.\n  Our Kansas City doctors have provided an outstanding example of how \nmedical liability affects doctors and patients on different sides of \nthe State line.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take a closer look at the \ndifferences between our two States and the positive impact medical \nliability reforms have had in Kansas. I hope that the Senate will \nsupport S. 11 so that States like Missouri which are struggling to \nretain doctors and offer the best patient care are not left out in the \ncold.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to reclaim the remaining time. How \nmuch time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will have 1 minute 30 seconds \nleft, but the Senator from Illinois has been recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and fellow Cardinal \nrooter from Illinois for allowing me to finish.\n  It is important, as I hope the Senator from Kansas and I have pointed \nout, that we must do something on a national basis. Missouri patients \ncannot continue to lose their trusted doctors to the State of Kansas. \nWe cannot see people driven out of the practice of medicine--well-\neducated, good practitioners who cannot afford the premiums. Unless we \nact today, retaining and recruiting doctors in Missouri will continue \nto be a difficult task.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the experience of patients in Kansas \nCity and across Missouri and support the essential medical liability \nreforms in S. 11.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in today's \nWall Street Journal entitled ``Political Malpractice'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                         Political Malpractice\n\n       Democrats are expected to muster the 41 votes needed to \n     kill medical liability reform in the Senate today, so why are \n     Republicans smiling? Perhaps because they know they're teeing \n     up what promises to be one of their better issues going into \n     2004.\n       Democrats have long made the Senate the graveyard of any \n     and all legal reform. The news is that they're having a \n     harder time getting away with it. The scandal of asbestos \n     litigation has forced them at least to bargain on that issue, \n     while momentum is also building to limit class-action suits. \n     It says something about Tom Daschle's devotion to the trial \n     bar that he's willing to ask his Members to walk the plank \n     even on medical liability, just as voters are discovering the \n     damage it is doing to health care across the country.\n       No fewer than 19 states are in ``malpractice'' crisis; \n     Doctors have protested or walked our from Nevada to New \n     Jersey, while pregnant women have had to cross state lines to \n     find an obstetrician. One New Jersey doctor has held seminars \n     to train toll-booth operators in emergency delivery, since \n     more live births are likely to occur in transit to a distant \n     hospital.\n       Before Texas passed a recent reform, 14 of 17 medical \n     insurers had left in the past two years. In Arkansas, doctors \n     who treat nursing-home patients face a 1,000% premium \n     increased on renewals. In West Virginia, trauma centers \n     closed and doctors went on strike before Democratic Governor \n     Bob Wise led a successful reform effort. Because they \n     contribute to the practice of ``defensive'' medicine--or \n     unnecessary procedures just to be sure--liability suits are \n     also a major cause of rising health-care costs.\n       All of this prompted the House to limit medical damages by \n     a vote of 299-196 in March. But Senate Democrats continue to \n     just say no. California's Dianne Feinstein dallied with \n     support for a while, before the lawyers and Mr. Daschle \n     yanked her back into line.\n       The irony is that the proposed Senate bill is modeled after \n     California's own successful 1975 reform that limited pain and \n     suffering damages to $250,000. Victims of genuine malpractice \n     still get compensated for economic harm, but they are no \n     longer able to win the lottery of a huge jury award. In the \n     past 25 years premiums across the U.S. have risen three times \n     more than in California.\n       Even if reform fails in Congress, the national battle has \n     helped to trigger a wave of change in the states. Ten states \n     have passed some liability reform in the past year, and \n     another 17 have debated it. Nearly all of these reforms \n     include some limit on non-economic damages, the kind that \n     drive insurance rates out of sight and are unconnected to \n     genuine harm.\n       Still more state reforms are on tap this year. Florida \n     Governor Jeb Bush is calling his legislature back for an \n     unprecedented second session starting today to address the \n     problem. Connecticut, where obstetricians will seen an 85% \n     increase in premiums for next year, may also have a special \n     summer session.\n       As federalists, we think this wave of state reform is \n     probably better than a single national law. Unlike class \n     actions, which damage commerce nationwide, medical liability \n     affects health care in individual states. If a state's \n     political-legal class is driving doctors away, then its \n     voters can throw the political bums out. That may be what \n     eventually happens in Missouri, for example, where Democratic \n     Governor Bob Holden is promising to veto reforms passed by \n     the GOP-run legislature. There's also a danger that a \n     national reform might override even better state laws, such \n     as California's.\n       The argument for national reform is that the crisis is too \n     acute to wait for 50-state trench warfare, especially against \n     a trial bar grown so rich on tobacco and asbestos shakedowns \n     that it can buy entire legislatures. Some states in crisis, \n     notably Pennsylvania, also have constitutional obstacles to \n     capping non-economic damages. And yet reform's recent success \n     shows that is can be done.\n       The vote in Congress will help this along by educating \n     Americans about the problem and who refuses to solve it. \n     Among Republicans, we'll be watching Pennsylvania's Arlen \n     Specter in particular. He's typically a pal of the trial \n     lawyers (his son is a medical liability lawyer), but he also \n     faces a primary challenge next year from a reform proponent, \n     Congressman Pat Toomey.\n       But the main result of today's vote will be to get the \n     Democrats on record for killing reform one more time. They \n     will then have handed President Bush and most Republicans an \n     issue that is both good policy and good politics for next \n     year. In a debate between lawyers and patients, we know where \n     the voters will come down.\n\n  Mr. BOND. The Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       As federalists, we think this wave of state reform is \n     probably better than a single national law. Unlike class \n     actions, which damage commerce nationwide, medical liability \n     affects health care in individual states.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The argument for national reform is that the crisis is too \n     acute to wait for a 50-State trench warfare, especially \n     against a trial bar grown so rich on tobacco and asbestos \n     shakedowns that it can buy entire legislatures.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, we have talked a \nlot about the Patients First Act that is before us, S. 11. As far as I \ncan tell, this is ``patients last.'' It says, regardless of the injury \nyou sustained because of medical errors, medical negligence, medical \nmalpractice, we are going to limit you to $250,000 that you can recover \nfor your pain and suffering no matter how many years you have to \nendure.\n  This is a photograph of Sharon Keller whom I met yesterday, a proud \nregistered Republican, as she announced in our press conference. After \na hysterectomy, she went into the doctor's office for an exam. \nUnfortunately, the surgeon, as she examined her, made a move and \nremoved a suture and bleeding started. When the bleeding became \nexcessive, the doctor left the room and left Sherry on the examining \ntable as she went out to find someone\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\nwho could respond to the need and, at the same time, went to see some \nother patients while Sherry was bleeding on the examining table.\n  Unfortunately, after a period of time, she went into shock and fell \noff the examining table, as she was left unattended in the examining \nroom. When she fell off the table, she hit the counter as she fell and \ndamaged her spinal cord, rendering her an incomplete quadriplegic.\n  In this state of bleeding and virtually paralyzed, she dragged \nherself out into the hallway to beg for help. The doctor called an \nambulance to take her to the emergency room but said: Just transport \nher; you do not need to treat her on the way. She waited several hours \nat the emergency room before they eventually treated her. She will \nnever walk again. She is a housewife and mother who had no lost \nwages because of this and, frankly, because of this bill, she would be \nlimited to recover $250,000.\n\n  Is that jackpot justice? Has Sherry Keller made out like a bandit--\n$250,000--for what she is going to go through for the rest of her life? \nIs she being treated first as a patient? She is being treated last, and \nthat is unfortunate and unfair.\n  There is a medical malpractice insurance problem in America. We \nshould address it in a responsible way and not at the expense of \nvictims such as Sherry Keller.\n  Senator Graham of South Carolina and I have introduced a bill as an \nalternative to this which we believe is a constructive first step \ntoward dealing with this.\n  First, to increase patient safety efforts across the United States to \nreduce malpractice.\n  Second, to provide an immediate tax credit for doctors and hospitals \nfor their malpractice premiums. Doctors and hospitals cannot afford to \nwait 8 to 15 years, as the sponsor of this legislation says it will \ntake, before limiting the recovery of victims results in lowers \npremiums.\n  Incidentally, there are people in the insurance industry who will not \neven say it will result in any reduction in premiums over a period of \ntime.\n  We also repeal the antitrust exemption given to the insurance \nindustry, which is totally unfair, which will end collusion among those \ncompanies in setting rates.\n  We reduce frivolous lawsuits in saying to attorneys, those few bad \nactors: If you do it, we not only will fine you, but ultimately we will \nprohibit you from filing this type of lawsuit.\n  We give grants to hard-hit areas described in Missouri, Kansas, \nIllinois, and North Carolina, so they can deal with losing doctors and \nhospitals. We say that punitive damages are going to be allowed in only \nthe most egregious cases, serious intentional situations. But if a \ndoctor has been involved in helping his or her community through \nMedicare and Medicaid, they would be immune from punitive damages in \nmedical malpractice cases.\n  We do not provide this great protection for the drug companies and \nthe medical device manufacturers who decided to jump on this medical \nmalpractice bandwagon for the ride and limit their own liability.\n  We do not preempt State laws. Individual States can still make \ndecisions they made historically, and we do provide statute of \nlimitations be decided by each State.\n  This is going to result in lower premiums and better situations for \npeople across America. It is a better way to go. I, frankly, think we \nhave to look at the root causes of the malpractice insurance problem. \nFirst is the incidence of malpractice of epidemic proportions, \naccording to the Bush administration. That is the root cause.\n  Secondly, the malpractice insurance companies, when they made \ninvestments during the Clinton era, as the stock market was booming--\nand we all remember that--they did quite well. When the bottom fell out \na couple years ago in the stock market, so did their investments.\n  What does an insurance company do when their investments start to \nlose ground? They raise the premiums on the doctors. That is what is \ngoing on here. We are being asked to penalize patients and victims of \nmedical malpractice because of the investment practices of insurance \ncompanies. We are riding to the rescue of insurance companies at the \nexpense of children whose lives are forever damaged and changed because \nof medical malpractice. We are putting limitations on recovery for \npeople who are innocent victims so we can help the bottom line and \nprofitability of insurance companies.\n  Time and again, this Senate races to protect special interest groups \nand forgets the families, children, and elderly people across America \nwho are the victims of this wrongdoing. That is not fair to them. It \ncertainly is not fair to this country.\n  I end by saying to doctors and hospitals across this country, after \nwe defeat this bad bill, let us come together for a reasonable solution \nto reduce medical malpractice, to bring in the insurance companies and \nhold them accountable and say to the legal profession they must \nguarantee to us as well that there will be responsible conduct on their \npart.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I have 2 minutes and 20 seconds remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yielded to the Senator from Missouri and reserved 2 \nminutes and 20 seconds for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is my understanding the Senator from \nMissouri used that time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada have \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time to be yielded.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, at 11:10, the \nDemocratic leader will be recognized for 10 minutes. At 11:20, the \nmajority leader will be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I designate myself as the Democrat to control those 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield 2 of those 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, and I will then take the next 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the time.\n  I will make a couple of quick points. First, we have seen a lot of \npictures from the Senator from Illinois. He talked about the $250,000 \ncap on damages included in this bill. Let's get one thing straight. It \nis a $250,000 cap on pain and suffering.\n  He put up a picture of a young child. I will read some of the totals. \nCalifornia has comprehensive medical liability reform in place that \nthis bill I have presented today is modeled after. These are the \nfollowing awards, and these are almost all economic damages or medical \ndamages that were awarded to these infants: $43,500,000 in May 2002; \nJuly 1999, $30,800,000; April 1999 in Orange County, almost $7 million; \nJanuary 1999 in Los Angeles County, almost $22 million; December 2002, \n$84 million. So for pictures to be put up and to say, what is this \nchild going to get, this child can get a lot. Most of these awards are \nin economic damages or in medical expenses. Those damages are not \ncapped in this bill.\n  The next picture we have to put up is a woman with her child. Because \nthere was no OB/GYN available, she had to deliver this child on the \nside of a road by herself. Unfortunately, the patient did have \ncomplications, and the mother had to provide CPR to the baby on the \nside of the road in the middle of the Arizona desert. Thankfully, the \nbaby survived. But she could have had serious consequences, and then \nthey would not have been able to get compensation from anybody. And \nthis is because there was no care available at the community hospital \nthat she had to bypass because the doctors could no longer afford the \npremiums because of the frivolous and outrageous lawsuits that are \ndestroying our court system.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Victor J. Wolski\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that I be given 4 minutes of the \nremaining 8 and the Senator from Illinois be given 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to repeat the arguments against \nMr. Wolski. Something new has happened since I spoke an hour ago. The \nAFL-CIO has come out against him, which is understandable, because of \nhis ideology.\n  Mr. Wolski should be defeated for two reasons. First, he is an \nideolog. This important court, when it comes to the environment, does \nnot deal with much else we would care about, other than just claims \nissues, and we should not have somebody who is a self-described \nideolog. Let me repeat that Victor Wolski, in his own words, said every \nsingle job he has taken since college has been ideologically oriented, \ntrying to further his principles, which he describes as a libertarian \nbelief in property rights and limited government.\n  I do not think the Founding Fathers intended judges to be ideologs. \nThat is why they have us advise and consent, so that if a President, as \nthis President does, sees judges through an ideological prism and does \nnot nominate moderates--I do not like judges far right or far left--\nwhen he nominates them, we can be the check. We have used that power \njudiciously. We have defeated or filibustered only two of the 134 \nnominees the President has made.\n  This man deserves to be defeated. He is an ideolog, way over. If my \ncolleagues believe we have made advances in clean water and clean air, \nhis theory is that any type of environmental law is a taking, which \ndenies the compact on which we all live: That if someone lives upstream \non a river from somebody else, they do not have the right to dirty that \nriver and foul the water of the person who lives downstream. If someone \nlives 100 miles east and they own a factory where the winds blow in \nthat direction, they do not have a right to spew SO2 and NO2 in the air \nand foul the lungs of people who live downwind.\n\n  Mr. Wolski does not believe in that. He says if someone has the money \nand can build the plant, go build it. That is the core of his beliefs \nin terms of takings. So he is an ideolog. He does not have the \ntemperament for the bench, as mentioned. He said that Members of \nCongress were, and this is his word, bums. If he does not like us, he \nhas a right to denounce us, but that is not the kind of word of a \nperson we want to see as a judge.\n  Just as importantly, whatever one's views on Wolski, this is a \nboondoggle, a waste of money. The average number of cases a court of \nappeals judge handles is 355. The Court of Federal Claims handles 24. \nIf we add these judges, it will go down to 19--a million-dollar \nboondoggle.\n  The Washington Post, in an editorial, called it the ``Court of \nExtravagance.'' When President Clinton was President, Members of the \nother side refused to fill these vacancies, stating there were too few \ncases and too small a workload. Well, the workload is even smaller and \nwe are nominating four judges. We do not have money for all of what we \nare talking about--prescription drugs health care, education--and we \nare doing this. It is wrong. It is hypocritical of those who have said \nin the past that this court should not be filled, because it has such a \nlow caseload, to fill it now.\n  I urge Mr. Wolski's nomination be defeated.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of proceeding to the \nconsideration of S. 11, the Patients First Act. The issue of medical \nliability reform has been studied extensively, and clearly Federal \npolicymakers have an obligation to address the explosion in litigation \nacross the country and jackpot-sized awards that are having a severe \nimpact on doctors, hospitals and patients' access to care.\n  This is a national crisis that requires a Federal solution. The \ncrisis is not confined within State lines, as patients are losing \naccess to physicians within their State and are having to cross State \nlines merely to get access to care. Similarly, physicians are being \nforced to leave their practices due to high insurance rates, and \nrelocate to a State that has enacted some type of reasonable reform \nthat has remained on its books through judicial review.\n  In Pennsylvania and many other States, health care providers are \nfacing enormous increases in their medical liability insurance premiums \nor are unable to obtain coverage at all due to a significant rise in \nscarce resources being drained from our health care system because of \nsporadic and sometimes frivolous health care litigation. As a result, \nreal patients are being denied access to care and losing their family \ndoctors because of exorbitant medical liability costs.\n  In some States including Pennsylvania, some ob-gyns have been forced \nto stop delivering babies, trauma centers have closed, and physicians \nare grappling with how they can continue to provide other high-risk \nprocedures. South Philadelphia now has no operating maternity wards. In \nFayette County, a practice of three obstetricians that delivers half of \nthe babies born in the area stopped delivering babies when faced with a \npremium increase from $150,000 in 2002 to $400,000 in 2003. And \naccording to the Pennsylvania Medical Society, 72 percent of doctors in \nour State have deferred the purchase of new equipment or the hiring of \nnew staff due to increased medical liability costs.\n  To be sure, Mr. President, the health care profession is not free of \nerror. And I fully support a person's right to seek just compensation \nwhen they are harmed by negligent or improper medical care. And I also \nfully support initiatives referenced over the past couple of days that \nwould help to root our and prevent medical errors. But escalating jury \nawards and the high cost of defending against lawsuits--even frivolous \nones--are driving up liability premium increases, with devastating \nresults for patients.\n  According to Jury Verdict Research, the median jury award increased \n43 percent in just one year, 1999-2000. More than half of all jury \nawards today top $1 million, and the average jury award has increased \nto $3.5 million. And the vast majority of medical liability claims do \nnot result in any payments to patients.\n  And so how does this impact patients? Quite simply, medical \nprofessionals are fleeing from areas where medical liability premiums \nare escalating at a rapid pace. We have heard of many horror stories \nover the past couple of days and in Congressional testimony about \npatient access to care being adversely affected. The Wilkes-Barre Times \nLeader, on October 23, 2002, reported the experiences of one of my \nconstituents in Northeastern Pennsylvania who suffers from two \nherniated disks, having to travel an entire day because high insurance \npremiums have decreased the number of neurosurgeons.\n  The truth is--every American pays the price for this country's \nliability crisis, and Congress and the President have a responsibility \nto fix this very serious problem.\n  Pennsylvania's own Representative Jim Greenwood has been a strong \nleader on this issue and has introduced the bipartisan HEALTH Act, \nlegislation which would put in place new Federal minimum standards for \nliability reform, based on measures that have been proven to be \neffective in States like California with its proven MICRA reforms, to \nhelp prevent excessive awards that are driving up health care costs, \nencouraging frivolous lawsuits, and promoting time-consuming legal \nproceedings.\n  The Patients First Act we are seeking to consider here in the Senate \nis largely based on the House-passed HEALTH Act, and includes many \ncommonsense provisions which can serve as a bipartisan model for \nmedical liability reform. It would establish a reasonable Federal fall-\nback cap on non-economic and punitive damages, but would allow States \nthe flexibility to set levels higher and lower if they choose. It would \nallow for unlimited economic damages, and would ensure fair allocation \nof damages, in proportion to a party's degree of fault. It would also \nensure that more of the awards from meritorious cases are paid to the \npatient instead of trial lawyers.\n  Far from limiting the opportunities of patients to seek redress in \nthe courts, S. 11 would ensure full and unlimited recovery of economic \ndamages, of medical expenses, of rehabilitation costs, childcare \nexpenses, all current and future wage earnings that are lost, including \nemployer-based benefits, and any other economic losses.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  We have heard a lot from the other side of the aisle about how this \nlegislation would somehow limit patient access to the courts by forcing \na Federal mandate to limit non-economic damages to $250,000. This is \ncompletely false, and the other side of the aisle knows it. S. 11 would \ngive States the flexibility to establish or maintain their own laws on \ndamage awards, whether higher or lower than those provided for in this \nbill.\n  And the experience of California shows that injured patients have not \nonly maintained access to the courts, but in many cases have received \nmulti-million dollar awards in economic damages, including minors and \nnon-working spouses.\n  The opponents of moving to consideration of this bill have also tried \nto move the spotlight away from the underlying issues of cost and \naccess and suggest that the answer lies in insurance reform. This is a \nflawed argument that takes needed attention away from the real \nproblems.\n  Suggestions that liability rates are high because insurance companies \nare trying to recover past losses are, quite simply, factually wrong. \nAs a matter of law, medical liability rates are determined by estimates \nof future losses from claims. State regulators are already required by \nlaw to reject liability insurance rates that are excessive. Changing \ninsurance laws will do nothing to change the underlying reason for \nrising premiums--an increase in meritless litigation and skyrocketing \njury awards.\n  President Bush is committed to passing balanced bipartisan \nlegislation that will put reasonable limits on liability lawsuits while \nallowing compensation for patients truly harmed by medical malpractice. \nSuch reforms can save the Federal government and our health care system \ntens of billions of dollars in rooting out frivolous lawsuits and \nreducing defensive medicine.\n  We can and should create a medical liability system that more \nequitably and rapidly compensates patients who have received \nsubstandard care, but which at the same time limits frivolous lawsuits \nand increases access to health care by reducing the excessive costs of \nthe system.\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to at least move to \nconsideration of this bill, to have the opportunity to offer \namendments, and to show the American public that Congress is capable of \nworking toward real solutions on this growing health care crisis.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today the Senate must make a decision that \nwill affect the entire state of our health care system. For years, \nAmerica has enjoyed world-class health care. We have led the way in \ncures and treatments, we have developed the latest and the best \ntechnologies, and we have ensured that our doctors are trained in \nground-breaking procedures. Indeed, our Nation has accomplished much in \nthe area of health care.\n  But today the future of our world-renowned health care system sits in \nthe balance as this Senate mulls two very important choices. Will we \nsuccumb to some trial lawyers who have nearly crippled the system by \nfiling hundreds of frivolous lawsuits each year? Or will we do the \nright thing and place limits on these lawsuits and the big-money fees \nlawyers earn off of them, so that our doctors can have the peace of \nmind they need to do the job they love? I challenge my colleagues to do \nthe latter.\n  America is in the midst of a crisis. Those who need health care, the \nmost vulnerable and sickest among us, are the real victims. We have all \nheard their stories. Too many of our patients can't get doctors, can't \nget specialists, can't get health care. In North Carolina, rural \nresidents have been among the hardest hit. Patients tell stories of \ndriving miles just to find a doctor to treat an illness. There have \nbeen reports of women driving for miles and miles just to find someone \nto deliver their baby. This is beyond unacceptable. No one in this \ncountry should have to struggle like this for health care. The America \nI know is better than that.\n  I have heard from doctors in my State. And this crisis is having a \ndetrimental effect on our medical providers. Too many of them can't \nafford rising malpractice insurance rates. They have had to curb their \nmedical practices, stop taking some patients, move to another State and \nperhaps the most painful, leave the profession altogether. Dr. Jack \nSchmitt says his insurance premiums went from $18,000 to $45,000 a \nyear. He eventually decided to leave his practice and teach at the \nUniversity of Virginia Medical School.\n  Doctors who decide to remain are forced to practice defensive \nmedicine and order an excessive amount of tests and procedures to \nprotect themselves from lawsuits. Dr. Steve Turner of Garner estimates \nthat internists like him prescribe close to $5,000 a day in defensive \nmedical practices or $1.2 million a year per doctor. This cannot \ncontinue.\n  North Carolina is included on a list of 18 States that the American \nMedical Association says is suffering from a medical liability crisis. \nAccording to the AMA, some North Carolina hospitals have seen their \nliability insurance premiums rise three- and five-fold in the last few \nyears. Specialists--like our obstetricians, emergency doctors, and \nanesthesiologists--are seeing even higher increases.\n  Consider this: Novant Health, the corporate parent of Presbyterian \nHospital in Charlotte, saw its malpractice insurance increase by 114 \npercent between the years 2000 and 2003. They are now paying $4.5 \nmillion in malpractice insurance.\n  In Catawba County, doctors participating under the Network of Primary \nCare practices have been told that because of rising premiums, charity \ncare will no longer be purchased for them under their policy. This \nmeans if doctors want to volunteer their medical services at a soup \nkitchen, homeless shelter, or some other charity, they are going to \nhave to first buy separate, costly insurance coverage themselves.\n  Even our Level III trauma center in Cabarrus County is in danger of \nclosing after premiums increased 88 percent. The list, the stories, and \nthe pain are endless.\n  The legislation before us is a solution that we know works. It is \nmodeled after California's MICRA law which has been in place since 1975 \nand has kept insurance premiums down in that State. This legislation \ndoes not cap damages. Victims who suffer from a doctor's malpractice \nwill be able to recover every penny of their actual economic damages. \nIt does limit noneconomic damages, like pain and suffering. Punitive \ndamages would be limited and so would attorneys' fees. But the \nlegislation allows patients to collect for medical bills, funeral \nexpenses and other costs. And States would still have the option of \nsetting higher or lower caps than what is in the bill.\n  This really is one of those issues where the Senate cannot sit idly \nby. The House has passed a bill. It is time for the Senate to do the \nsame.\n  We have a choice. We can vote with some trial lawyers who file \nendless lawsuits and watch our health care system spiral into decay, or \nwe can put an end to this debate and protect our health care system by \ncasting a vote for our patients and the medical professionals who so \ntirelessly care for them. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \ncloture. Let's pass the bill for our patients who need it most.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while I recognize that medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums have increased at an alarming rate in \nmany States, I rise today in opposition of the Patients First Act of \n2003, S. 11. This bill does not put patients first, and fails to \naddress major parts of the problem.\n  Any legislation aimed at reducing premiums for medical malpractice \ninsurance must include reforms to the industry, and should be done by \nexperts at the State level. Insurance regulation and tort law are \ntraditional State issues.\n  The Senate is moving forward on this bill even though it has not been \nvetted through the appropriate committees. To date, there have been no \nhearings in Judiciary or a markup of S. 11.\n  In addition to foregoing the appropriate legislative process, I am \nalso concerned that this proposal, as introduced, fails to do what it \npromises to do--ensure patients' access to doctors and decrease \nmalpractice insurance rates for physicians.\n  As a former insurance commissioner, I learned first hand that \ninsurance is best regulated at the State level. That level or \nregulatory oversight over the industry ensures that residents of a \nparticular State are all afforded the\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nsame protections and guarantees. A one-size-fits-all approach like S. \n11 is not the best policy.\n  In addition, one of the cornerstones of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in \n1945 was that in exchange for exemption to Federal antitrust laws, the \nregulation of the business of insurance would be carried out at the \nState level.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s insurers flocked to the medical \nmalpractice insurance market because of increased cashflow and rising \ninterest rates. These insurers pursued as much business as they could \nand as competition increased, prices dropped. This competition created \nan environment of underpricing the actual risks of the insurance.\n  As the economy worsened and investment income dried up, insurance \ncompanies increased premiums to recover investment as well as insurance \nlosses. The Senate should not ignore the business practices of the \ninsurance industry in the so-called ``medical malpractice crisis.''\n  In a recent report by the Institute of Medicine it was estimated that \n98,000 people die each year due to preventable medical errors. That is \n268 each day. Why then instead of solely focusing on the tort system \nare we not also addressing this issue? After all these errors are the \nreasons most people seek compensation.\n  The Senate's proposal fails to improve overall patient safety and the \nreporting of medical errors. Patients should have access to this \ninformation and be allowed to make informed decisions about their \nphysicians.\n  Proponents of this legislation argue that by limiting the risk of \ninsurance companies through caps on damages, that by protecting their \ninterests, we will then lower medical malpractice insurance premiums \nand ensure access to health care providers. I do not believe this is \naccurate.\n  In the State of California, which already limits non-economic damages \nto $250,000, the average actual premium is $27,570, 8 percent higher \nthan the average of all States that have no caps on non-economic \ndamages. Clearly a cap did not keep these premiums from rising.\n  In Florida, as in the Nation, we have had some sad malpractice cases. \nIf patients had access to information about their doctors then perhaps \nWillie King may not have had the wrong foot amputated in 1995.\n  Mr. King was admitted to University Community Hospital in Tampa, \nFlorida, for the removal of his right foot. Imagine his surprise when \nhe woke up to find that Dr. Rolando Sanchez had removed the left one \ninstead. As it turns out 2 years earlier, Dr. Sanchez had settled a \nclaim from a man who agreed to one type of hernia operation but instead \nhad another, State records show.\n  Still, Mr. King--who was already collecting disability--still had to \nhave his other foot removed and was unable to remain independent as he \nhad been prior to the operation.\n  To cap damages, without regard to the extent of an injury is \nshortsighted and unfair. Caps just do not fix the problem. It is far \nmore complicated than that.\n  In California, which is often touted as the example of how effective \ncaps are, medical malpractice premiums increased by 190 percent during \nthe first 12 years following enactment of the $250,000 MICRA cap. It \nwas not until California's Proposition 103 was enacted that malpractice \npremiums were lowered and stabilized.\n  In Florida, where this issue is being hotly debated, insurers have \nmade no guarantees to lower their premiums. Even after the Governor \nsought to get that assurance by further protecting them from lawsuits, \nthe industry still refused to guarantee any sort of decrease in rates.\n  In addition to caps not reducing malpractice insurance premiums, they \nare also unfair. Take the case of Janet Pandrea from Coconut Creek.\n  In January 2002, at the age of 65, Mrs. Pandrea was diagnosed with \ncancer in her chest. Janet had been married for 46 years, she had been \na healthy and active mother and grandmother. She was told to begin \nchemotherapy treatments, and died from complications after only 2 \nmonths.\n  The doctors did not tell her family why she died so suddenly, so they \nrequested an autopsy. The autopsy showed that she never had cancer. \nJanet should never have been subjected to the chemotherapy that killed \nher.\n  The economic damages for a 65-year-old woman would cover only her \nmedical bills. Her family would not be able to recover more than \n$250,000 for the loss of their wife, mother, and grandmother.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this legislation, not because \nI do not think that there is a serious problem with the medical \nmalpractice insurance in this country, but I do not support this bill \nbecause it will not reduce premiums or enhance a physician's ability to \nprovide care.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I recognize that we have a problem in \nthis country with malpractice insurance premiums. I would like very \nmuch for Congress to address that problem. It is my judgment that S. 11 \nwill not solve that problem, and it will harm innocent Americans who \nhave suffered horrible and permanent injury at the hands of negligent \nmedical practitioners. I will therefore vote no on the cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, there are many provisions of S. 11 with which I have \nserious disagreement. Let me just mention a few. In a provision called \nthe fair share rule, the bill eliminates joint and several liability in \nmedical malpractice cases. What that means is that if one responsible \ndefendant is insolvent and has no insurance coverage, the victim of \nmalpractice ends up without a full recovery of his or her damages. This \nis not fair. Most State laws provide that the risk of one defendant \nbeing insolvent or judgment-proof is borne by the other responsible \ndefendants. There is no reason to change this longstanding principle of \nlaw.\n  Another problem with this bill is the new statute of limitations that \nthe bill imposes on medical malpractice claims. Shorter statutes of \nlimitation don't discourage frivolous claims, they encourage them. \nLawyers facing a looming statute of limitations have to file lawsuits \nto protect their clients' options. Imposing a statute of limitations of \nas little as 1 year, as this bill does, does not allow adequate time to \ninvestigate a claim and determine if it is really worth filing.\n  I am also concerned that this bill has been drafted to protect not \nonly doctors but medical device manufacturers and drug companies from \nliability claims. There is no evidence that suits against these \ndefendants are contributing to rising medical malpractice insurance \npremiums. So this bill is not just a medical malpractice bill, it is a \nproduct liability bill.\n  But the most ill-advised provision in this bill is the cap on \nnoneconomic damages of $250,000. At the one hearing held on this issue \nthis year, the Judiciary and HELP Committees heard from Linda McDougal, \na 46-year-old Navy veteran from Woodville, WI. Last year, Ms. McDougal \nunderwent a double mastectomy after her biopsy results were switched \nwith those of another patient. She didn't have cancer, she never had \ncancer. We can be thankful for that. But her life, and her family's \nlife, will never be the same.\n  I hope everyone in the Senate will read Linda McDougal's testimony \nand learn about her experience. It is a powerful cautionary tale for \nthose of us who are charged with voting on legislation concerning \nmedical malpractice.\n  I find it hard to believe that anyone in this body can look Linda \nMcDougal or any of the thousands of victims of catastrophic medical \nmalpractice in the eye and say, ``$250,000 is all your pain and \nsuffering are worth.'' Would any of us be able to tell our mothers or \nour wives or our daughters that their damages should be limited to \n$250,000 if they were the victims of the unspeakable pain and lifelong \nsadness that Linda McDougal will endure? Remember, Linda McDougal \ndidn't have extraordinary medical bills or lost wages. Her damages are \nnoneconomic. But her loss is real, it is permanent, it is unfathomable.\n  There is no question that we have a problem in this country over the \ncost of malpractice insurance. But the solution cannot be to penalize \ninnocent victims like Linda McDougal, to prolong and extend this \nsuffering by denying them adequate compensation.\n  We have virtually no evidence that caps on economic damages will \nactually lower insurance rates. Indeed, as Senator Durbin noted in this \ndebate, in\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nStates that have caps on noneconomic damages, insurance premiums \nincreased 48 percent from 1991 to 2002. But in States without caps, the \ninsurance has been only 36 percent. So the case has just not been made \nthat the caps in this bill will lower malpractice premiums. But more \nimportantly, the case has not been made, and in my view cannot be made, \nthat these caps are fair to victims like Linda McDougal.\n  There very well may be solutions that we in the Senate can develop to \naddrsess the cost of medical malpractice insurance in this country and \nthe effect on patient care that rising premiums are causing. And there \ncertainly are things we can do to address the disturbing problem of \nmedical error in this country. The Institute of Medicine estimates that \nbetween 44,000 and 98,000 adverse medical events occur in hospitals \nevery year.\n  If we want to reduce malpractice insurance premiums we must address \nthese problems as well as looking closely at the business practices of \nthe insurance companies. What we shouldn't do is limit the recovery of \nvictims of horrible injury to an arbitrarily low sum.\n  This is obviously a complicated issue. This is the kind of issue that \nneeds to be explored in depth in our committees so that a consensus can \nemerge. It is not the kind of issue that should be brought directly to \nthe floor with such a great gulf between supporters and opponents. So I \nwill vote ``no'' on cloture today, and I hope that the bill will go \nthrough the HELP Committee and/or the Judiciary Committee before we \nbegin floor consideration of this important topic.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nconcern with the rising cost of medical liability insurance. I have \nheard from doctors and hospitals from one end of Tennessee to the \nother, all concerned with the sky rocketing cost of medical liability \npremiums. The increasing cost of medical liability insurance is \ncreating a patient access crisis because doctors are leaving the \npractice of medicine.\n  At Hardin County General Hospital in Savannah, TN, both an \northopedist and an OB/GYN have left the hospital to go practice in \nother States because their insurance premiums were too high. High \nmedical liability insurance is one more reason it is difficult to \nrecruit specialists to rural areas.\n  At the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center in Memphis, \nyoung people just entering the profession are being sued at a \nhorrifying rate, discouraging them from continuing with the practice of \nmedicine. Since 1990, one third of all residents in training have been \nserved with a malpractice suit. Some specialties, such as OB/GYN and \nNeurosurgery, are being sued so frequently that students are not \npursuing these specialties. This will soon cause a crisis in access to \nspecialty care.\n  Tennessee hospitals experienced liability insurance premium increases \nof 75 percent to 400 percent last year. Baptist Memorial Health Care \nCorporation in Memphis, TN, had liability coverage of $2.7 million for \n2002. For 2003, Baptist was quoted $8.3 million for liability coverage. \nThis is an increase of $6 million in 1 year.\n  In 2002, the medical liability premium for an OB/GYN in Tennessee was \n$62,000. In 2003, the premium more than doubled to $160,000, and in \n2004, it is estimated to more than double again to $285,000. This sort \nof increased cost is not sustainable. I am worried about who will \ndeliver babies in my State. Other physicians are also feeling the \nsqueeze. In 2002, the medical liability premium for a family practice \nphysician was $44,000. In 2003, the premium increased to $117,000. \nAgain, this sort of increased cost is not sustainable.\n  I believe that S. 11, the Patients First Act, is a great step in the \nright direction. The Patients First Act will reduce the effects of \nexcessive liability costs by placing a sensible cap on non-economic \ndamages. The bill will still allow unlimited economic damages. If a \npatient is injured, they will have unlimited access to economic damages \nto pay for their recovery.\n  S. 11 will help stem the tide of rising medical liability premiums \nbefore patients lose access to medical care. I hope we reach cloture on \nthe motion to proceed so that we can consider this very important \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there is a health care crisis in this \ncountry. Millions of Americans have no health insurance. Insurance \ncompanies continue to increase their premiums and doctors and patients \nare the ones who are paying.\n  In my home State of Washington, our health care system is in trouble. \nSome doctors are closing their practices, retiring early, or moving to \nother States. We have a shortage of nurses and other medical \nprofessionals. And one in nine Washington State residents do not even \nhave health insurance.\n  Doctors in my State are seeing their malpractice insurance premiums \nincrease by 100 and even 200 percent. At the same time, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and private insurance companies are reducing their \nreimbursement amounts. These multiple forces have created a perfect \nstorm for doctors and patients.\n  In some specialties, like OB GYN, the malpractice insurance market is \nout of control. Insurance companies keep jacking up their premiums. \nThese insurance company increases are simply not sustainable.\n  I strongly support legislation to correct these problems and to get \nskyrocketing insurance premiums back under control. We must help to \nstabilize our health care system by making sure that doctors are not \nforced out of business by rising insurance rates.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal before us is not the answer. There are \nmajor flaws with both the process and the substance of the proposal.\n  First, this bill would preempt State patient rights laws, and give \nmore protection to HMOs and insurance companies at the expense of real \npeople who are hurt.\n  Second, caps on noneconomic malpractice awards have not been \neffective at reducing insurance rates in States where they have been \ntried; and\n  Third, this bill is being used as a political club, instead of a real \nattempt to find a meaningful solution.\n  I am deeply disappointed that some Senators would rather play \npolitical games with our Nation's health care instead of trying to find \na real solution.\n  One problem is that this proposal preempts State patients' right laws \nand protects HMOs and insurance companies rather than doctors and \npatients.\n  For the past 3 days Senators have talked about the impact of the \nmedical malpractice crisis on doctors and patients across the country. \nAnd those who have been following this debate might assume that this \nlegislation would only provide protection to doctors and hospitals. But \nthis bill goes much further.\n  S. 11 also extends additional protections to nursing homes, HMOs, \ndrug and medical device manufacturers.\n  Not only does S. 11 provide liability relief for these groups. In \nsome cases it preempts State patient bills of rights laws and \nprotections--protections that patients and doctors have fought hard to \nachieve.\n  Since 1997, I have worked to secure passage of a Federal Patient's \nBill of rights to protect patients and to ensure that insurance \ncompanies make decisions based on sound medicine, not profit margins.\n  Working with doctors and hospitals we have twice tried in the U.S. \nSenate to enact a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, but were \ndefeated by special interests. The foundation of any patients' bill of \nrights legislation is holding HMOs accountable for making medical \ndecisions. Unfortunately, S. 11 would take us in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Many States, like my home State of Washington, did not wait for \nFederal action to protect patients and doctors. In March 2000, \nWashington state enacted a strong Patients' Bill of Rights law that \nheld HMOs and insurance companies accountable and liable for harm \ncaused when insurance plans denied or delayed access to recommended \nhealth care services.\n  The State law also provides a 3-year statute of limitation from the \ncompletion of the independent external review process. But, S. 11 would \npreempt this law. It would impose a Federal noneconomic limitation of \n$250,000 and would reduce the state of limitation to 1 year.\n  This is the wrong approach. The Senate leadership is proposing to \nsubstitute the judgment of the Federal\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\nGovernment in Washington, DC for the judgment of the State legislature \nin Washing State. As insurance has historically been a State, not a \nFederal, issue, Congress must be careful about this Federal expansion.\n  The second problem with this proposal is that caps on malpractice \nawards do not necessarily reduce insurance rates.\n  I have heard my colleagues refer to California's experience as a \nmodel for Federal action, since California has enacted caps. However, \nrecent data shows that average actual premium rates in California are \nactually higher than States that have no such caps, according to the \nMedical Liability Monitor.\n  Across the country, States that have imposed caps on noneconomic \ndamages, are now seeing similar increases in insurance premiums as \nthose States without caps. If the goal is to help insurance companies \nwith their profit margins, then this bill might help. But if the goal \nis to help doctors afford to pay for insurance, then this bill will not \nhelp.\n  Even if caps did force insurance companies to reduce their rates, are \ncaps fair to patients who were harmed?\n  We know that as many as 90,000 people a year die from medical errors. \nNot all of these errors constitute malpractice, but limiting fair and \njust compensation for even a fraction of these individuals and their \nfamilies is a major change in our judicial system--and a huge price to \npay in the name of reform.\n  If this legislation had gone through the appropriate committee \nprocess, Congress might have gotten some answers to these questions, \nand the legislation before us might have been helped doctors and \npatients.\n  Unfortunately, this bill was brought forward for purely political \nreasons. This is the greatest tragedy of all for doctors and patients. \nSome colleagues would use this bill to help their follow partisans \nrather than the physicians who need it.\n  This bill did not go through the standard committee process. There \nwere no public hearings to get expert testimony to help shape the \nlegislation. There was no committee markup for the legislation for \nSenators to weigh in on the issue.\n  In fact, there are a number of reports indicating that malpractice \nclaims are not necessarily responsible for higher insurance premiums. \nThese reports suggest that it is not the growing number of cases or \neven the size awards that are driving premium increases, but rather the \ndecline in the value of investments for insurance companies.\n  Without the opportunity to fully understand the problem--with \nhearings and markups-Congress cannot develop a real, workable solution.\n  Instead, some Republicans are exploiting this legislation, according \nto the Washington Post, ``as an issue for next year's election.''\n  In fact, even Republicans have acknowledged that this is not a \nserious proposal, but instead is a ``political document.''\n  A Republican Senator was quoted in the New York Times this morning \ndiscussing this bill. He said the Senate leadership is ``bringing this \nbill up to get most of my Democratic friends to vote against it, a \nhandful of Republicans to vote against it, and they're going to take it \non the campaign trail.''\n  This is outrageous. Patients are losing their doctors. Doctors are \ngoing out of business. And rather than address a critical problem, the \nSenate leadership is playing political games.\n  So what is the answer?\n  Clearly, the medical malpractice insurance rates doctors are facing \nare untenable. They are a real problem for doctors, for patients, and \nfor our entire health care community. Every week, I hear from doctors \nthroughout Washington State about the challenges that soaring \nmalpractice insurance premiums are causing.\n  That is why I support the Durbin-Graham proposal to provide immediate \nrelief to doctors.\n  When insurance markets are dysfunctional--as they certainly are in \nmalpractice--the Federal Government has a tradition of providing needed \nsupport. We did that with flood insurance a few years ago, and we did \nit again with terrorism insurance in 2001. When an insurance market \nfails, there is certainly precedent for Federal corrective actions.\n  If we can provide relief for terrorism and flood insurance, we should \nbe able to provide relief for high-risk, critical practices like trauma \nand OB GYN services.\n  While we need to examine every way that we might address this crisis, \nas I look at this idea, I am also realistic. Noneconomic damages are \nnot the only factor impacting insurance premiums. It is not clear to me \nthat capping just noneconomic damages will really solve the problem. In \naddition, malpractice insurance is traditionally a state issue. If the \nFederal Government is going to insert itself so dramatically in a State \nmatter, we need to be sure this approach is going to work.\n  There are still too many unanswered questions to proceed with this \nbill. We know that the status quo is not sustainable, but we need to \nrecognize that this is a complicated problem and there can be no quick \nfixes.\n  It is time to stop playing politics and start working together to \nfind solutions and heal our ailing system.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I speak out for ordinary people.\n  We all recognize that we need to do something about the medical \nmalpractice problem in this country. Premium rates are too high and, in \nsome cases, drive away the medical care these people need. I have \nspoken out loud and clear about this issue and recently published an \nop-ed piece in the Washington Post calling for common sense provisions \nincluded in our bill, which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed \nfollowing my remarks. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We have to do something about this problem. But the \nanswer is not to slap down the victims, which is exactly what the \nRepublican plan will do.\n  This is nothing new. Time and again, we have seen this administration \nand the Republican majority stand up for corporate interests with \nlittle regard for the people who will be harmed by this rush to protect \nbig business. This time it is the malpractice insurance companies who \nare being protected at the expense of ordinary people.\n  S. 11 comes right off the insurance companies' wish list. It might as \nwell have been written by the insurance companies. It drastically \nlimits the compensation these companies have to pay children and \nparents who have been blinded, paralyzed or otherwise severely injured. \nThe victims who make the least money will suffer the most under this \nplan. The harm to the kinds of families I represented as a lawyer for \nnearly 20 years will be enormous. We need to stand up for these people.\n  We need to fight for people like little Tristan Lewis, who lives in \nmy State of North Carolina. Tristan was born 3 months premature, but \nher early signs were good. She was breathing on her own and had scored \neight out of 10 on the APGAR tests, used to rate newborn babies. \nUnfortunately, nurses attempted to warm Tristan with heated IV saline \nbags that burned the tiny girl. They heated the bags in a microwave \nwithout doctor approval; they failed to check the temperature of the \nbags, and then left Tristan on the boiling hot bags for over 10 \nminutes, even though she was crying loudly.\n  Black burns covered much of Tristan's back. The third-degree burns \nhad penetrated her skin. Nine days after she was born, Tristan was sent \nto another hospital for a surgery, commonly needed by premature babies, \nto close a blood vessel near her heart. The doctors there discovered a \ndangerous infection. Tristan had meningitis, which likely entered her \nlittle body through the burn wounds. Tristan spent most of her first \nyear in the hospital and she had more than a dozen surgeries.\n  The pain and complications of the burns increased Tristan's blood \npressure and caused or aggravated bleeding inside her brain. The \nbacteria that led to her meningitis probably entered her body through \nthe burn wounds, where the skin's ability to serve as a barrier against \ninfection had been weakened.\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\n  Tristan, who is now 7, is legally blind. Her eyes bring in images, \nbut her brain cannot process them. She is fed through a tube. \nAntiseizure medications make her groggy, so she spends most days \nsleeping. Tristan has no purposeful movement and cannot communicate.\n  The hospital's insurance company agreed to settle the case. Now \nTristan's mother knows that her little girl will always have what she \nneeds.\n  But if the administration had its way, the hospital would have been \nless likely to settle the case and Tristan would have been limited to \n$250,000 for her ``noneconomic'' suffering. That is just not right. It \nis wrong to try to protect the profits of big insurance companies at \nthe expense of victims like little Tristan.\n  But every time we point out these inequities, we are shouted down \nwith cries of ``class warfare!'' Well, the American people need to hear \nthe truth. We are engaging in class warfare. What we have here is a \nfight for fairness.\n  The Republican plan is just plain, flat out unfair. And it won't \nwork. It penalizes the worst injured people but it doesn't do a thing \nto solve the problem. It doesn't do anything to punish the bad lawyers \nwhile rewarding the good. It doesn't do anything to make doctors \naccountable for bad behavior. All this plan does is save insurance \ncompanies money by slamming the courthouse door in the face of innocent \nvictims who have nowhere else to turn. But it doesn't require them to \npass along one cent of this savings to doctors. So victims lose, \ndoctors get nothing, and the insurance companies get richer. How can \nanyone claim that is fair?\n  Our plan is fair and it will work. It will work because it cracks \ndown on price gouging by the insurance industry and takes aggressive \naction against lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits that don't belong \nin court.\n  We have got to reform the insurance industry, something the \nRepublican plan completely sidesteps. Today insurance companies use \nslow and burdensome processes to discourage both doctors and patients \nfrom filing legitimate claims. Worse still, these companies can fix \nprices and divvy up the country in order to drive up their profits. \nEven when companies don't explicitly collude, they set their rates \nbased on a trade-group loss calculation that they know other companies \nwill follow. In any other industry, this kind of conduct would be \nsubject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws. But an obscure 1945 law \ngives insurance companies a broad antitrust exemption. Because of the \ninsurance lobby's influence, Congress has even blocked the Federal \nTrade Commission from investigating insurance company rip-offs. These \nspecial privileges have go to go and our plan does just that.\n  Next, we need to prevent and punish frivolous lawsuits. The vast \nmajority of lawyers are responsible advocates for their clients, but \nthe few who aren't hurt the real victims, make a bad name for the good \nlawyers and clog up our courts. But for all his talk about frivolous \nlawsuits, President Bush does nothing to address them. He has got it \nbackward--instead of cracking down on irresponsible behavior and \nbaseless cases, he is targeting serious victims who win in court and \nare believed by juries.\n  Our plan requires that before a lawyer can bring a medical \nmalpractice case to court, he or she must file an affidavit from a \nqualified health specialist verifying that real malpractice has \noccurred. Lawyers who file frivolous cases will face tough, mandatory \nsanctions. Lawyers who file three frivolous cases will be punished \nseverely--in other words, three strikes and they are out.\n  And, while it is important to clamp down on frivolous lawsuits, we \nalso must do everything we can to prevent malpractice in the first \nplace. That is why our plan includes measures that will help patients \navoid doctors with bad track records.\n  And, finally, our plan enhances patient access to quality health care \nby easing the burdens imposed on doctors by out-of-control insurance \ncompanies. First, it repeals the special interest antitrust exemption \nthat allows insurance companies to collude and jack up premium rates \nwith impunity. Second, it provides a tax credit for malpractice \npremiums paid, based upon the nature of risk in their areas of \npractice. And, third, our plan will help stem the tide of health care \nproviders being driven out of certain geographic areas by out-of-\ncontrol insurance rates by, among other things, providing grants and \ntax credits to areas experiencing shortages.\n  Our plan is fair, it is reasonable, and it will work. The Republican \nplan is not only mean-spirited, but it won't do a thing to solve the \nproblem it is supposed to address. Their plan doesn't do a thing but \nbuild more wealth for big insurance companies on the backs of ordinary \npeople who have already suffered too much. And I won't stand by and let \nthat happen. None of us should. That is why I urge all of my colleagues \nto stand up for what is right and fight for fairness by voting no on S. \n11.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 20, 2003]\n\n                     Let's Keep Doctors in Business\n\n                           (By John Edwards)\n\n       The rising cost of malpractice insurance for doctors is \n     getting in the way of good health care. In rural areas, some \n     specialists can no longer afford to practice, and patients \n     can't get the care they need. We need to fix this problem \n     now, and we need to fix it in a way that is consistent with \n     the doctors' own Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.\n       Unfortunately, President Bush's proposed prescription comes \n     straight off the insurance companies' wish list: a sharp \n     limit on the compensation these companies have to pay \n     children and parents who have been blinded, paralyzed or \n     otherwise severely injured. The victims who make the least \n     money will suffer the most under this plan. The harm to the \n     kinds of families I represented as a lawyer for nearly 20 \n     years will be enormous.\n       What the president's proposal won't do is work. Insurance \n     premiums have spiked recently because of insurance companies' \n     losses on their investments, not their losses to victims. In \n     fact, about half the states already have some limits on \n     victim compensation, yet premiums in states with caps average \n     about the same as premiums in states without caps. California \n     finally controlled rates not by attacking victims--that \n     didn't work--but by reforming the insurance industry and \n     rolling back premium increases.\n       We need a real solution that frees doctors from crippling \n     insurance costs--without preventing the most badly injured \n     victims from receiving the compensation they deserve.\n       That real solution has three elements. Most important, we \n     need to crack down on price gouging by the industry. We also \n     need aggressive action against frivolous lawsuits that don't \n     belong in court--not against the serious lawsuits that bring \n     help to the most badly injured. And finally, we need to \n     reduce the number of medical errors, many made by a very \n     small fraction of the medical profession.\n       The most critical step is reforming the insurance industry. \n     Today insurance companies use slow and burdensome processes \n     to discourage both doctors and patients from filing \n     legitimate claims. Worse still, these companies can fix \n     prices and divvy up the country in order to drive up their \n     profits. Even when companies don't explicitly collude, they \n     set their rates based on a trade-group loss calculation that \n     they know other companies will follow. In any other industry, \n     this kind of conduct would be subject to scrutiny under the \n     antitrust laws. But an obscure 1945 law gives insurance \n     companies a broad antitrust exemption. Because of the \n     insurance lobby's influence, Congress has even blocked the \n     Federal Trade Commission from investigating insurance company \n     rip-offs. These special privileges must go.\n       Next, we need to prevent and punish frivolous lawsuits. \n     Most lawyers are responsible advocates for their clients, but \n     the few who aren't hurt the real victims, undercutting the \n     credibility of the legal system and clogging our courts. For \n     all his talk about frivolous lawsuits, President Bush does \n     nothing to address them. He's got it backward--instead of \n     cracking down on irresponsible behavior and baseless cases, \n     he's targeting serious victims who win in court and are \n     believed by juries.\n       Before a lawyer can bring a medical malpractice case to \n     court, we should require that he or she swear that an expert \n     doctor is ready to testify that real malpractice has \n     occurred. Lawyers who file frivolous cases should face tough, \n     mandatory sanctions. Lawyers who file three frivolous cases \n     should be forbidden to bring another suit for the next 10 \n     years--in other words, three strikes and you're out.\n       Finally, we can reduce malpractice premiums by helping to \n     reduce malpractice. The Institute of Medicine found that at \n     least 44,000 people die from preventable medical errors every \n     year. In medicine, as in law, a few people cause the most \n     problems: Only 5 percent of doctors have paid malpractice \n     claims more than once since 1990. This same 5 percent are \n     responsible for more than half of all claims paid. One part \n     of the problem is state medical boards whose discipline is as \n     lax as state bar associations'. We need to provide resources \n     and incentives for boards to adopt real standards on the \n     ``three strikes'' model. At the same time, we need to \n     encourage doctors to report more medical errors voluntarily, \n     so we can learn more about systemic problems.\n       Together these measures will give relief to most doctors \n     who are suffering under the\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n     staggering weight of insurance premiums. But where premiums \n     still cause shortages of medical care, Washington must \n     provide a temporary subsidy so good doctors can continue \n     their essential work. We shouldn't be padding insurers' \n     profits and hurting people who have already suffered \n     immensely, as the president proposes. But we should be \n     protecting good doctors and the patients who depend on them.\n       The writer, a Democratic senator from North Carolina, is \n     seeking his party's nomination for president.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I support the bipartisan medical \nmalpractice alternative legislation, a bill that is more comprehensive \nthan the bill previously being considered on the floor, S. 11, called \nthe Patient First Act. I want to thank Senators Durbin and Lindsey \nGraham for their leadership and hard work on this issue, and I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of the alternative, which really begins to address \nthe root of the medical malpractice premium problem, rather than just \nattempt a quick fix as does the approach found in Senator Ensign's \nlegislation.\n  In South Dakota, we already have a cap on noneconomic damages at \n$500,000, which has been in effect since 1997. While some are claiming \nthat caps are supposed to reduce premiums doctors pay, this issue is \nnot that cut and dried. The Medical Liability Monitor found that in \nSouth Dakota, prior to 1997, medical malpractice premiums charged by \nsome insurers were being maintained or on the decline, while for others \nrates were going up. And these rates varied across specialty. For \nexample, in 1996 the premium rate went up for general surgery across \ntwo insurers, while one company increased premiums for internal \nmedicine and OB/GYN and another insurer reduced rates for those exact \nsame specialties. Since the implementation of caps in my State, rates \ninitially declined, but in 2002 rates jumped as high as 20 percent over \nthe previous year. This would indicate that caps are not the quick fix \nthat Republicans would like you to believe is needed.\n  Generally, my feeling is that caps are really a State issue and that \nwe should spend our time focusing on how to prevent the need for \nmalpractice in the first place, through measures to reduce medical \nerrors and improve patient safety. Beyond my overall view of this \nissue, I am disappointed that our Republican colleagues have taken the \nissue of medical malpractice, which touches the core of these important \npatient care issues, and are using it for politically motivated \npurposes. This legislation has not had any hearings in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions or Judiciary Committee. It has not been \ngiven careful consideration in a bipartisan way prior to the majority \nleader bringing it to the floor. This is not the way we get things done \nin the Senate and this is one of the reasons why I cannot support S. \n11.\n  I also cannot support S. 11 because it is crafted in such a way that \nhas broad implications across the health care continuum. This bill's \nsupporters will try and tell you that it is only about doctors' \nabilities to continue to provide care to patients. While I do recognize \nthat this is of significant concern and support measures to bring down \nthe cost of medical malpractice premiums, this bill goes far beyond \nthat. S. 11 represents a broad, sweeping initiative that would apply \nnot only to lawsuits against doctors, but to all health care lawsuits, \nthereby shielding HMOs, drug companies, nursing homes, hospitals, and \nmedical device manufacturers who injure patients.\n  And what is equally disturbing is that this so-called fix is not even \nconsidered the solution by all doctors, some who have conceded that \nthis legislation would not reduce their malpractice premiums for 3 or 4 \nyears. This legislation also discriminates against the most vulnerable: \nthe aged, children and low-income. By placing a cap on noneconomic \ndamages, it says to those with lesser earning potential--``your lives \nmean less and a small pot of money for the rest of your life is enough, \nirrespective of how much of your quality of life has been taken from \nyou.'' I cannot support this mindset and would prefer to approach this \nissue more comprehensively and without discriminatory practices.\n  As mentioned, we have learned that caps do not necessarily translate \nto lower premium rates. Studies have examined this issue and results \nare found on both sides, some finding that caps do reduce malpractice \npremiums, while others find the exact opposite. This says to me that we \ndo not have the sound evidence needed to say that caps are the way to \ngo. Because of this, we must be looking at other creative ways to \naddress this issue that is forcing many doctors, especially those in \nhigh-risk specialties, to leave practice. That is why I support the \nDurbin/Graham alternative, which takes a critical look at the causes of \nhigh malpractice premiums and seeks to address them.\n  The Durbin/Graham alternative does provide some relief to doctors \nthrough tax credits for malpractice premium rates. It also provides a \nvoluntary system to share medical error information through a database \nthat is immune from legal discovery and will improve patient safety. It \naddresses issues related to frivolous lawsuits and provides some \nprotection from punitive damages for health professionals participating \nin federally funded programs. This alternative finally addresses \nFederal antitrust exemptions enjoyed very broadly by insurance \ncompanies in an effort to diminish their opportunity to collude and set \nrates. These initiatives get at the root of the medical malpractice \nproblem and are a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 11 and work \ntogether to embrace the Durbin/Graham alternative.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Americans are fortunate to enjoy some of \nthe best medical care available in the world. If we do not reform the \ncurrent system, however, our good fortune will not last. Medical \nmalpractice reform looms as one of the most critical factors negatively \nimpacting our Nation's health care system. In the year 2000, doctors \nalone spent $6.3 billion on medical malpractice insurance coverage. \nThat does not take into consideration coverage paid for by hospitals, \nnursing homes, and other groups.\n  Originally intended to provide patients with security by improving \nquality and providing fair and equitable compensation for valid claims, \nour Nation's medical malpractice system has only succeeded in adding \nbillions of dollars a year to the cost of health care, while reducing \npatient access to physicians and treatment. The current system is \nbroken.\n  Qualified doctors with years of valuable experience are leaving the \nmedical field in droves. Some are opting for early retirement, while \nothers are changing fields. Many physicians, particularly those in \nhigh-risk specialties, are moving to States that have implemented \nreforms or are opting to scale back their practices. Discouraged by the \ncurrent system, many of today's medical students cite medical \nmalpractice as a major factor in their choice of fields.\n  Rural areas have been hit particularly hard. In Arizona, our rural \nhospitals are struggling to keep qualified doctors. In our border \nregion, where hospitals already struggle with the high cost of \nuncompensated care due to illegal immigrant populations, the Copper \nQueen Hospital in Bisbee has been without an obstetrician for over a \nyear because of the high cost of medical malpractice insurance. Because \nof this void, pregnant women in southeastern Arizona have had to drive \nextremely long distances to reach the nearest hospital with an \nobstetrician.\n  Earlier this year, the daughter of a hospital board member gave birth \non the side of the highway as she and her husband drove over a mountain \npass to the nearest hospital in Sierra Vista. Fortunately for Bisbee \nand the surrounding areas, a local community health center, which is \nshielded from high liability costs by Federal law, recently received a \nFederal grant to develop a birthing facility. Now, the community will \nbe able to retain obstetricians and pregnant women will be assured \naccess to vital prenatal care.\n  Unfortunately, patients suffer most from the failures of our current \nsystem. Not only are patients losing access to qualified doctors, they \nare also losing health care coverage, substantially contributing to the \nrising numbers of uninsured Americans, most recently estimated at over \n41 million. A recent study by Pricewater-\nhouseCoopers found that 7 percent of the rise in health care costs are \ndue to litigation and risk management. Those skyrocketing health care \ncosts are\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\npassed from health insurance companies to employers, making it more \ndifficult for American businesses to provide coverage to employees. \nBusinesses today pass a larger share of the cost burden on to employees \nthan ever before, and many, particularly small businesses, have made \nthe difficult decision to drop employee coverage entirely.\n  This morning, the Senate voted on the motion to invoke cloture on, S. \n11, the Patients First Act of 2003. I voted to invoke cloture on this \nbill, not because I believe it is the perfect solution to this crisis, \nbut because I believe that our Nation's medical malpractice system is \nbroken and we must begin debating viable solutions. I have long \nsupported tort reform generally, and medical malpractice in particular, \nbecause the current system is unfair and inefficient.\n  Unfortunately, the medical malpractice debate has been polarized by \ntwo powerful special interest groups, preventing necessary compromise \nand real reform. On one side, the trial lawyers, fearing the loss of \nenormous jury awards, have fought tooth and nail against any cap on \nnon-economic damages. Similarly, the insurance industry and other \nmedical special interest groups have been equally unwilling to \ncompromise on the dollar amount of these caps. As long as this body \nremains polarized in between these two competing interests, we will not \nhave real reform and the American people will suffer.\n  Under the bill considered today, patients would be able to recover \nthe full cost of medical expenses coupled with past and future wage \nlosses through unlimited economic damages. To address exorbitant jury \nawards for non-economic damages, this bill, caps non-economic damages \nat $250,000, while allowing states the flexibility to maintain their \nown caps. A federally imposed ceiling would be a tremendous help to \nStates like Arizona that require State constitutional amendments in \norder to implement medical liability reform.\n  The reality is, we know that caps on damages do successfully reduce \nthe cost of medical malpractice insurance. Malpractice rates \nnationally, have risen three times faster than in California, where \ncaps have been in place for twenty years. Similarly, a recent study by \nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that states that \nenacted limits on non-economic damages have 12 percent more doctors per \ncapita than states without caps.\n  Although I support reform efforts, I am concerned that $250,000 may \nnot be a realistic amount at which to cap non-economic damages. I \nrecognize that although the state-imposed cap of $250,000 has \nfunctioned well in California, there are also certain medical errors \nwhich are difficult, if not impossible to put a price tag on.\n  Additionally, I believe any medical malpractice reform legislation \nmust be coupled with meaningful measures to address the alarming \nnumbers of medical errors in this country. A 1999 study by the \nInstitute of Medicine found that upwards of 98,000 people a year die of \nmedical errors. Congress must address this escalating problem, \nparticularly in the context of the current debate. Bipartisan \nlegislation establishing medical error reporting requirements passed \nthe House and will hopefully pass the Senate later this year, however \nmuch more can and should be done on this issue.\n  I believe a majority of my colleagues in the Senate agree that there \ndoes exist a serious problem in our Nation, that patients and doctors \nare suffering as a result, and something must be done. When the Senate \nvoted this morning to invoke cloture, this bill did not have the votes \nnecessary to continue debate. In fact, it did not even garner a \nmajority vote. If we are truly committed to addressing this important \nissue, we must put special interests and partisan politics aside and \nwork together to craft an equitable compromise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority appears \nto be playing politics with the medical malpractice insurance debate. \nThis is a complex issue, and the bill before us would encroach on the \nrights of every state and would take away the legal rights of the \nAmerican people. Great care is in order as Congress considers such \nsteps. But instead of introducing a bipartisan bill and sending it \nthrough the committee process to reach consensus, the majority is \nrushing a partisan bill directly to the Senate floor. That is highly \nunfortunate, because our health care system is in crisis. We have heard \nthat statement so often that it has begun to lose the force of its \ntruth, but that truth is one we must confront, and the crisis is one we \nmust abate.\n  Dramatically rising medical malpractice insurance rates are forcing \nsome doctors to abandon their practices or to cross state lines to find \nmore affordable situations. Patients who need care in high-risk \nspecialties--like obstetrics--and patients in areas already underserved \nby health care providers--like many rural communities--are too often \nleft without adequate care.\n  We are the richest and most powerful nation on earth. We should be \nable to ensure access to quality health care to all our citizens and to \nassure the medical profession that its members will not be driven from \ntheir calling by the manipulations of the malpractice insurance \nindustry.\n  The debate about the causes of this latest insurance crisis and the \npossible cures grows shrill. I had hoped for a calmer and more \nconstructive discussion within the Senate Judiciary Committee and on \nthe Senate floor. My principal concerns are straightforward: That we \nensure that our nation's physicians are able to provide the high \nquality of medical care that our citizens deserve and for which the \nUnited States is world-renowned, and that in those instances where a \ndoctor does harm a patient, that patient should be able to seek \nappropriate redress through our court system.\n  To be sure, different States have different experiences with medical \nmalpractice insurance, and insurance remains largely a State-regulated \nindustry. Each State should endeavor to develop its own appropriate \nsolution to rising medical malpractice insurance rates because each \nState has its own unique problems. Some States--such as my own, \nVermont--while experiencing problems, do not face as great a crisis as \nothers. Vermont's legislature is considering legislation to find the \nright answers for our State, and the same process is underway now in \nother States.\n  In contrast, in States such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, \nand New Jersey, doctors are walking out of work in protest over the \nexorbitant rates being extracted from them by their insurance carriers.\n  Thoughtful solutions to the situation will require creative thinking, \na genuine effort to rectify the problem, and bipartisan consensus to \nachieve real reform. Unfortunately, these are not the characteristics \nof the bill before us. Indeed, S. 11 is a partisan bill that was \nintroduced only a few days ago without any committee consideration. \nIgnoring the central truth of this crisis--that it is a problem in the \ninsurance industry, not the tort system--the majority has proposed a \nplan that would cap non-economic damages across the nation at $250,000 \nin medical malpractice cases. The notion that such a one-size-fits-all \nscheme is the answer runs counter to the factual experience of the \nstates.\n  Most importantly, the majority's proposal does nothing to protect \ntrue victims of medical malpractice and nothing to prevent malpractice \nin the first place. A cap of $250,000 would arbitrarily limit \ncompensation that the most seriously injured patients are able to \nreceive. The medical malpractice reform debate too often ignores the \nmen, women and children whose lives have been dramatically--and often \npermanently--altered by medical errors. The experience of Linda \nMcDougall, who testified a few months ago before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, is just one tragic example of such an error. Mrs. McDougal \nis recovering from an unnecessary double mastectomy, and her testimony \nreminded us all of the real-life consideration of these issues. \nArbitrarily limiting injured patients' remedies under the law without \naddressing the system-wide medical errors that result in patient harm \nand death is a recipe for failure.\n  The majority's proposal would prevent individuals like Linda \nMcDougall--even if they have successfully made their cases in courts of \nlaw--from receiving adequate compensation. We\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nare fortunate in this nation to have many highly qualified medical \nprofessionals, and this is especially true in my own home state of \nVermont. Unfortunately, good doctors sometimes make errors. It is also \nunfortunate that some not-so-good doctors manage to make their way into \nthe health care system as well.\n  While we must do all that we can to support the men and women who \ncommit their professional lives to caring for others, we must also \nensure that patients have access to adequate remedies should they \nreceive inadequate care.\n  High malpractice insurance premiums are not the direct result of \nmalpractice lawsuit verdicts. They are the result of investment \ndecisions by the insurance companies and of business models geared \ntoward ever-increasing profits as well as the cyclical hardening of the \nliability insurance market. In cases where an insurer has made a bad \ninvestment, or has experienced the same disappointments from Wall \nStreet that so many Americans have, it should not be able to recoup its \nlosses from the doctors it insures.\n  The insurance company should have to bear the burdens of its own \nbusiness model, just as the other businesses in the economy do. And a \nnationwide arbitrary capping of awards available to victims--as the \nmajority has proposed here this week--should not be the first and only \nsolution turned to in a tough medical malpractice insurance market. The \nproblem at hand deserves thoughtful and collaborative consideration in \ncommittee to achieve a sensible solution that is fair to patients and \nthat supports our medical professionals in their ability to practice \nquality health care.\n  One aspect of the insurance industry's business model requires a \nlegislative correction--its blanket exemption from federal antitrust \nlaws. Insurers have for years--too many years--enjoyed a benefit that \nis novel in our marketplace. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits \ninsurance companies to operate without being subject to most of the \nfederal antitrust laws, and our nation's physicians and their patients \nhave been the worse off for it.\n  Using their exemption, insurers can collude to set rates, resulting \nin higher premiums than true competition would achieve--and because of \nthis exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate any such \ncollusion. If Congress is serious about controlling rising premiums, we \nmust objectively limit this broad exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson \nAct.\n  In February, I introduced the ``Medical Malpractice Insurance \nAntitrust Act of 2003,'' S. 352. I want to thank Senators Reid, \nKennedy, Durbin, Edwards, Rockefeller, Feingold, Boxer and Corzine for \ncosponsoring this essential and straightforward legislation. Our bill \nmodifies the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to medical malpractice \ninsurance, and only for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: price \nfixing, bid rigging, and market allocations. Only those anticompetitive \npractices that most certainly will affect premiums are addressed.\n  I am hard-pressed to imagine that anyone could object to a \nprohibition on insurance carriers' fixing prices or dividing \nterritories. After all, the rest of our nation's industries manage \neither to abide by these laws or pay the consequences.\n  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within \nthe power they are accorded in their own laws, and some states have \nantitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive \nactivities in the insurance industry. Our legislation is a scalpel, not \na saw. It would not affect regulation of insurance by state insurance \ncommissioners and other state regulators. But there is no reason to \ncontinue, unexamined, a system in which the Federal enforcers are \nprecluded from prosecuting the most harmful antitrust violations just \nbecause they are committed by insurance companies.\n  Our legislation is a carefully tailored solution to one critical \naspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance rates. \nI had hoped for quick action by the Judiciary Committee and then by the \nfull Senate to ensure that this important step on the road to genuine \nreform is taken before too much more damage is done to the physicians \nof this country and to the patients they care for.\n  But our legislation to narrow this loophole in the nation's anti-\ntrust laws for medical malpractice insurers has languished for months \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead of conducting hearings and a \nmarkup on our bill, the majority now rushes a ``tort reform'' agenda \nitem to the floor without any committee consideration.\n  I want to comment for a moment on why committee consideration is so \nimportant to building the consensus needed to enact serious legislation \nto address the serious issue of rising medical malpractice premiums. \nDuring the last Congress, some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle complained about the lack of committee consideration of \nprescription drug legislation. This year, we had committee \nconsideration of a bipartisan bill and the Senate passed prescription \ndrug legislation.\n  Last year, during that debate, Senator Lott said: ``If we bring these \nimportant issues to the Senate floor without them having been worked \nthrough committee, it is a prescription for a real problem . . . .''\n  Last year on the Senate floor, Senator Nickles declared: ``What \nhappened to the committee process? Shouldn't every member of the \nFinance Committee have a chance to say, I think we can do a better job? \nMaybe we can do it more efficiently or better. No, we bypass the \ncommittee and take it directly to the floor.''\n  And Senator Snowe, one of the Senate's most thoughtful members, \nwisely pointed out: ``I think each of us here knows that without a \nmarkup in the committee we are creating a predetermined train wreck. We \nare heading for a train wreck because we are creating a process \ndesigned for failure. It is designed for politics. It is not designed \nfor creating a solution to a serious problem.''\n  If Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums, then we must limit the broad exemption to federal \nantitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance industry, \nas well as attack this problem at its core by reducing medical errors \nacross our health care system. Unfortunately, the partisan bill before \nus is not designed for creating a solution to a serious problem. \nInstead, it is designed purely for politics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the other side unless they are \ngoing to use the entire 10 minutes and then I will use my 4.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Senator from Illinois, what is the time \nsituation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes on his side, 4 minutes on my side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the suggestion of the Senator was?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator is going to divide it and would like to \nhave one speaker and then I will speak and he can close.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was going to split the time with Senator Ensign and \nuse the last 5 minutes. Does the Senator from Illinois want to be the \nlast speaker?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I defer to the Senator. I believe that as proponents of \nthe bill, the Senator should have the last word. If the Senator is \ngoing to divide his time, I would just suggest that one of his speakers \ngo first, I speak, and then the Senator be the last speaker.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me ask if my friend from Nevada is ready to \nproceed?\n  He will be ready momentarily.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will use my 4 minutes.\n  First, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Although we \ndisagree on the approach, and I certainly do not support S. 11, I \nencourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to join me in stopping \nthis bill from moving forward. This is too important to come to the \nfloor without a committee hearing, without deliberation. It is unfair \nto address the medical malpractice premium crisis in America by simply \nsaying that victims of malpractice shall be limited in what they can \nreceive from a court.\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\nIt is unfair for us to put ourselves in the place of a jury. If we are \ngoing to deal with the malpractice insurance crisis that faces us, let \nus do it in an honest and complete fashion.\n  Early in this debate, I told the story about David from the small \ntown in downstate Illinois. At 6 years of age he went in with a high \nfever and because of medical negligence and medical errors, this 6-\nyear-old boy became a quadriplegic. He is unable to communicate with \nothers. He breaths through a tracheotomy stoma and is fed through a \ngastrointestinal tube. They believe he understands what is being said, \nbut he is unresponsive. He is now 17 years of age. His mother has quit \nher job at a local college to be with him full time.\n  The decision of this bill is that in cases such as David's what they \nare going to go through the rest of their lives, David and his family, \nis worth no more than $250,000 in pain and suffering.\n  This verdict by this jury in the Senate is unfair. I say to doctors \nacross America who have a genuinely serious problem that needs to be \naddressed, the love and compassion you give to your patients, the \ncommitment you made to your patients is inconsistent with the message \nof this bill. I believe doctors in my home State and those I have met \nwith in other places are some of the finest people with whom I have \never worked. I genuinely want to work with them to deal with \nmalpractice premiums that are much too high, by reducing the incidence \nof malpractice, by saying to insurance companies, just because you made \na bad investment does not mean you will run a doctor out of business--\nthat is what is happening with these high premiums--and by saying as \nwell to the legal profession, the bad actors have to get out of the \ncourtroom; stop harassing doctors with frivolous lawsuits. That is \nrelatively uncommon, but where it occurs in one case, that is one case \ntoo many.\n  We need to come together after this bill is stopped today in a good-\nfaith, bipartisan effort as we did on the terrorism insurance issue. We \nneed to bring in the AMA, the bar association, the trial lawyers, the \ninsurance companies, and all parties that can come to a good solution. \nWe need to do it quickly. We need a tax credit for doctors right now. \nWe do not need to pass a bill that might help them 8 or 10 years from \nnow; we need to pass a tax credit now, so they can get through this \ntroublesome period where the insurance companies have seen the bottom \nfall out of their investment and are charging these high premiums. That \nis the fair way to deal with it.\n  Please, do not close off a day in court for deserving victims of \nmedical malpractice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what is this about today? What are we \nreally talking about? We are talking about access to health care by \npatients. We have enacted reasonable limits in this bill so the crisis \nfacing 19 States and the patients in 19 States across this country can \nbe resolved.\n  The problem is caused by out-of-control jury awards and frivolous \nlawsuits which are cheaper to settle--and those get settled all the \ntime--than they are to fight. The reason they will settle them is the \npotential huge award and the huge downside risk they have down the \nline. A lot of insurance companies just settle those and pass the \nhigher rates on to doctors. That has led to many physicians leaving \nthose 19 States in crisis and a lot of new doctors not going into the \nspecialties which are in short supply.\n  If we ask ourselves the fundamental question, Is there a shortage of \ndoctors or is there a shortage of lawyers? we do not have a shortage of \nlawyers in my State home state of Nevada, or in any other State, as far \nas I know. We do not have any shortage of people going into the \npractice of law. We do have a shortage of people going into the \npractice of a lot of the specialties in health care. The reason is that \nwe have a jury system that is out of balance. We did not used to live \nin this litigious society of today. People are so sue happy and the \nsystem is set up to encourage frivolous lawsuits.\n  California and Colorado are the two best examples we have of medical \nliability reform that has been on the books long enough. We know it \nworks. Victims get what they deserve in those States, but the system is \nbalanced so doctors can afford their premiums on medical liability. \nThat is what the bill before the Senate today lays out, a model very \nsimilar to Colorado and California for the rest of the country.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to at least vote for the motion to \nproceed to the bill so we can have a full debate with amendments to \nproceed to solve this severe crisis we have in access to health care \nacross the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The vote we are about to have is not about the details \nof the underlying bill, it is about whether we think there is a medical \nmalpractice crisis in America and whether we ought to do something \nabout it. If we were able to get on the bill, it would obviously be \nopen to amendment and we would see how the Senate felt, that some issue \nought to be addressed.\n  The Senator from Nevada, the floor leader on this subject, says 19 \nStates are currently in crisis and 25 are on the way to crisis, while \nonly 6 of our 50 States are OK as far as the price of medical \nmalpractice premiums not driving physicians out of work is concerned.\n  It has been incredibly stated on the other side of the aisle by \nnumerous speakers that this crisis has nothing to do with runaway \njudgments. I don't know how you can reach that conclusion. The people \nat CBO and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Joint \nEconomic Committee, insurance commissioners, actuaries, all believe \nthis crisis is related to runaway judgments.\n  California, which we keep referring to, has the model system after \nwhich the underlying bill has been modeled. My friends on the other \nside of the aisle think this crisis has been created by something else. \nThey have been suggesting it is bad returns from the stock market or \ninsurance company collusion, or a cadre of quacks who are causing \nproblems for medicine. I don't know whether all of that has made some \ncontribution, but we know there is one solution that works, and that is \nthe California approach. That is what is in the underlying bill.\n  We ought to at least recognize this is a national crisis, a national \nproblem that ought to be dealt with at the national level. We will have \nan opportunity to find out whether the Senate agrees with that shortly \nwhen we vote on cloture on the motion to proceed. I hope the Senate \nwill give us an opportunity to get to the underlying bill. It would \nthen be open to all kinds of amendments and we could begin to proceed, \nas we normally do in the Senate, in crafting legislation to deal with \nnational problems.\n  We urge our colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will be voting on a cloture motion \nto allow the Senate to proceed to debate S. 11, the Patients First Act. \nI want to strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to \nproceed.\n  We have had a good debate over the last three days, and it is clear \nthat right now patients across the country are facing a crisis of \naccess to quality health care. Congress needs to act.\n  The upcoming vote will allow us to fully debate this critical issue. \nIf action is delayed, we know what will happen: Patients will suffer, \ndoctors will continue to flee their practices, and more States will be \nadded to the AMA crisis list. Since we last debated this issue seven \nmore States have joined the list, that is nearly a 60 percent increase \nover last year.\n  I have received letters from doctors all over America, including from \nmy home State of Tennessee. Premiums in Tennessee have gone up 68 \npercent over the last four years, and Tennessee is not even considered \na crisis state by the AMA yet.\n  One doctor from Waverly, TN writes:\n\n       My insurance premiums as a general surgeon have jumped over \n     70 percent in the last four years. The current crisis has \n     forced me to limit doing any moderate to high risk surgery . \n     . .\n       There are counties around mine that have lost the services \n     of their general surgeons who have opted to limit their \n     practices to family practices . . . rather than continue to \n     pay the high premiums that are prohibitive for a surgeon in \n     rural Tennessee.\n\n  Another doctor from Madisonville, TN writes:\n\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\n\n       My wife and I came to Madisonville, Tennessee, 24 years ago \n     as national health service corps doctors. We helped start the \n     Women's Wellness and Maternity Center, Tennessee's first out \n     of hospital birth center. We depend on the obstetrical \n     service at Sweetwater Hospital for C-sections and \n     consultation.\n\n  This doctor goes on tell me that because of high malpractice premiums \nSweetwater has only one remaining obstetrician who is now forced to \nbear full responsibility for providing 24-hour maternity coverage and \nthat efforts to recruit additional doctors have failed.\n  As these real life stories show, this health care crisis is real and \nit is spreading. The current medical liability system is costly, \ninefficient and hurts all Americans. In addition to damaging access to \nmedical services, the current medical malpractice system creates \nproblems throughout the entire health care system.\n  It indirectly costs the country billions of dollars every year in \ndefensive medicine. The fear of lawsuits forces doctors to practice \ndefensive medicine by ordering extra tests and procedures. Though the \nnumbers are hard to calculate, well-researched reports predict savings \nfrom meaningful reform at tens of billions of dollars per year.\n  It directly costs the taxpayers billions. The CBO has estimated that \nreasonable reform will save the federal government $14.9 billion over \n10 years primarily through savings in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It impedes efforts to improve patient safety. The threat of excessive \nlitigation discourages doctors from discussing medical errors in ways \nthat could dramatically improve health care and save hundreds or \nthousands of lives. I am a strong supporter of patient safety \nlegislation which I hope we will pass this year. But in addition to \npatient safety legislation, we need to address the underlying problem--\nour liability system.\n  We must reform this broken liability system. That is why I strongly \nsupport the Patients First Act. I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nMcConnell, the majority whip, who skillfully led this debate. I also \nwant to thank Chairman Gregg and Chairman Hatch for their longstanding \nleadership of this issue, and Senator Ensign, the lead sponsor of S. \n11, who has seen the current crisis close up in his own State of \nNevada. And finally, I want to thank Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia. Her State has been the model of medical liability reform \nand has demonstrated that commonsense reforms work. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Feinstein on this issue. We share the \ngoal of putting patients first.\n  The Patients First Act will protect access to care and ensure that \nthose who are negligently injured are fairly compensated. Again, I \nencourage my colleagues to move this legislation forward. We cannot \nafford further delay.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \ndisappointment with the very troublesome nomination of Victor Wolski to \nbe a judge on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n  The last time I spoke on the Senate floor about judicial nominations, \nI whole-heartedly supported and endorsed President Bush's nomination of \nMr. Michael Chertoff to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I commended the administration for selecting Mr. Chertoff because he \nwas a ``consensus nominee.'' I supported Mr. Chertoff and many other \njudicial nominees because they demonstrated that they were not \nideologues beholden to a specific political agenda.\n  I support nominees who demonstrate moderation, fairness, open-\nmindedness, and the proper judicial temperament.\n  Victor Wolski is a self-described political ideologue on a mission to \npromote extreme right-wing libertarian views.\n  In his own words, Mr. Wolski told the National Journal that ``every \nsingle job I've taken since college has been ideologically oriented, \ntrying to further my principles,'' which he describes as a \n``libertarian'' belief in ``property rights'' and ``limited \ngovernment.''\n  There is nothing wrong with having convictions and strong beliefs. I \nrespect that. But when a judicial nominee views the world through a \nlimited, ideological prism, that presents a grave danger to our \ndemocracy and judicial system.\n  Such a nominee does not inspire trust or confidence in our judicial \nsystem.\n  Victor Wolski has unabashedly dedicated his career to promoting an \nextreme right-wing crusade to erode important Federal safeguards \nprotecting workers, human health, and the environment.\n  For example, he has argued that it was ``far beyond'' Congress's \npower under the Commerce Clause to protect wetlands that serve as \nhabitat for 55 different species of migratory birds and repeatedly \nreferred to these wetlands as ``puddles.''\n  Mr. Wolski also lacks the judicial temperament necessary for a \nFederal judge.\n  In his testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Wolski asserted that \nhe ``certainly meant no disrespect'' when he referred to Members of \nCongress as ``bums'' in a letter he wrote to the editor of the San \nFrancisco Chronicle. I wonder what he did means?\n  Mr. President, it is entirely permissible for Mr. Wolski--as an \nadvocate--to promote limited government; but he should not be a Federal \njudge.\n  And he certainly shouldn't be a judge on the Court of Federal Claims.\n  This is the court that hears disputes involving the Government \narising under the fifth amendment's ``takings'' clause--the very \nconstitutional provision Mr. Wolski has fervently worked to undermine \nand redefine.\n  Appointing Victor Wolski to the Court of Federal Claims is akin to \nputting the fox in charge of the henhouse. It is part of the Bush \nadministration's war against the environment--a war the administration \nis waging on many fronts--the courts included. His nomination is \nanother example of the Bush administration's zeal to pack the courts \nwith right-wing ideologues despite the President's claim that he is ``a \nuniter, not a divider.'' How cynical.\n  The ``bottom line'' is that Victor Wolski is wholly unfit for the \nposition to which he has been nominated. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I feel compelled to take a moment to \nrespond to remarks of my colleague from New York on the nomination of \nMr. Wolski and the status of the Court of Federal Claims. My colleague \nfrom New York has stated that we should not fill the judgeships that \nCongress itself created. This eleventh- hour attack on the court of \nclaims and Mr. Wolski is simply a thinly veiled effort to stall action \non more of President Bush's judicial nominees. Let's give the President \na break and be honest.\n  I would like to respond to allegations that Mr. Wolski is not \nqualified to serve on the court of claims. These allegations are simply \nunfounded. I agree with my colleague that, in print, Mr. Wolski's \nstatement in his 1999 National Journal profile raised questions about \nhow he would view his role as a judge. But Mr. Wolski was indeed \nthoroughly questioned about this statement at his hearing. His response \nto those questions has convinced me that this statement should not be \nany bar whatsoever to his confirmation. Mr. Wolski testified at his \nhearing that he understands that the role of a judge is not political. \nHe understands that the role of a judge--especially a trial court \njudge--is to follow the law and not to consider personal beliefs or \npositions argued as an advocate in determining how to rule. Mr. Wolski \nexplained during his hearing that this statement was meant to reflect \nthat his decision to work for our former colleague, Senator Connie \nMack, was consistent with his commitment to public service. Mr. Wolski \nemphatically stated on several occasions throughout his hearing that \nhis statement was meant to clarify the point that he has been not \nmotivated by the money throughout his career, and he does not consider \nhimself an ideologue.\n  Mr. Wolski has also been criticized about some of the clients that he \nhas represented. It is important to remember that the clients Mr. \nWolski has represented have been on both sides of the issues. He has \nrepresented property owners in takings cases, but he has also \nrepresented municipal and State governments. For example, he is \npresently a member of the litigation team representing the State of \nNevada, Clark County, and the city of Las Vegas in their opposition to \nthe location of a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. He \nrepresented a group of municipal governments challenging a commercial \ndevelopment that would have caused environmental, traffic, and other \nurban sprawl problems. So plainly, Mr. Wolski has represented a broad \nrange of clients, including some whom a die-hard conservative ideologue \nwould not represent. Instead, Mr. Wolski's clients indicate to me that \nhe has done his best to act as an advocate on behalf of his clients' \npositions, regardless of his personal beliefs, just as every good \nlawyer should do.\n\n  I know that some of my colleagues have expressed concern about Mr. \nWolski's brief in the case of Cargill v. United States. The first thing \nthat I want to point out is the obvious: Mr. Wolski was acting in this \ncase as a lawyer on behalf of his employer and had to perform his \nduties as assigned to him. In this case, his job was to submit an \namicus brief. Second, it is important to note that Mr. Wolski was not \nchallenging Congress's ability to protect migratory birds in general. \nRather, his argument specifically addressed the scope of the Clean \nWater Act, which does not incorporate findings about migratory birds. \nMr. Wolski clearly testified that he believes that the Clean Water Act \nis constitutional.\n  Finally, in regard to Mr. Wolski's comments in the San Francisco \nExaminer, I agree that they were a bit passionate, but Mr. Wolski's \nhearing testimony reflects that he has matured in the 11 years since he \npenned that letter. In fact, Mr. Wolski testified that he wrote that \nletter before he worked as a congressional staffer. He testified that \nhad he worked on the Hill before he wrote that letter, he probably \nwouldn't have written it at all. So I believe that this letter can \neasily be chalked up to youthful indiscretion, and nothing more. I have \nevery reason to believe that, as a judge, he will act consistently with \nhis past practice by following the law regardless of his personal \nbeliefs.\n  Now, I would also like to take a moment to respond to some of the \nallegations regarding the Court of Claims. It is clear that the Court \nof Claims is a necessity, especially with the current backlog of cases \nin our Federal district courts. The Court of Claims and the district \ncourts have overlapping jurisdiction. This allows the Court of Claims \nto ease the heavy caseload in the district courts. As such, the Court \nof Claims is a mainstay of the system.\n\n  A letter to the editor in the Washington Post on April 9, 2003, from \nthe president of the Court of Claims bar association made the point \nwell. He said that the docket of the court ``consists of more than \n4,000 cases. Opinions by the judges are recognized as well-written and \nwell-considered and reflecting\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nof the complexity of the caseload. Those practicing before the Court \nknow that its judges are busy.'' This letter, drafted by a lawyer who \nactually practices before the court, took direct issue with the Post's \nrecommendation to abolish the court, saying it ``missed the central \npoint.''\n  The editorial by Professor Schooner in the Washington Post on March \n23, 2003, suggesting that the current cases pending before the Court of \nClaims can be easily divided among the district courts is troubling to \nme. Eliminating the Court of Claims would add nearly 5,000 additional \ncases to the district courts at a time when they are unable to keep up \nwith the pace of cases being filed. Professor Schooner's academic \nanalysis also fails to take account of the considerable work and \nlearning that district judges do in order to handle complex patent, \nantitrust, environmental or civil rights cases.\n  I must admit that I was surprised to learn how inaccurate the \nstatistics of my colleague from New York were after I did some research \nregarding the caseloads of the Federal district courts and the Court of \nClaims. These misleading numbers allege that the district court judges \nhave an average caseload of 355 cases per judge, whereas Court of \nClaims judges would have an average caseload of 19 cases if the four \npending nominees were confirmed. After reviewing statistics from both \nthe Federal courts' legislative affairs office and the Court of Claims, \nhowever, it is clear that Senator Schumer's figures are erroneous. If \nwe take the current caseload of the Court of Claims and suppose that \nthe court was at its fully authorized number of 16 judges, the average \ncaseload per judge would be 309. This is in sharp contrast to the 19 my \ncolleagues would have us believe and not much less than the average \ncaseload per district judge.\n  This campaign against Mr. Wolski and the Court of Claims is just the \nnewest tactic in an organized effort to prevent President Bush's well-\nqualified judicial nominees from being confirmed and it must stop. It \nis obvious to me that the criticism of the court's necessity is borne \nmore of political opportunity than any serious merit. We shouldn't be \nin the business of creating more rationales for delay. The lack of any \nfunctional problem in litigation between sovereign and citizen, or \nproblem with the court structure, makes the solution of elimination of \nthe Court of Claims a solution in search of a problem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of Victor Wolski, \none of the four nominees for the Court of Federal Claims who have been \nawaiting votes on their nominations by the full Senate since March.\n  When Mr. Wolski was first nominated to the Court of Claims in \nSeptember 2002, he joined three other well-qualified nominees to the \nsame court who had been pending even longer. Charles Lettow had been \nnominated a month earlier, in August 2002, while Susan Braden and Mary \nEllen Coster Williams had been nominated, respectively, in May and June \n2001. None of them received a hearing in the 107th Congress.\n  So I am pleased that we have at last reached an agreement for an up-\nor-down vote on the nominations of Mr. Wolski and the other Court of \nClaims nominees. But getting to this point was not simple. We had to \nfile a motion to invoke cloture on Mr. Wolski's nomination. Now, I am \npleased that our Democratic colleagues agreed to vitiate this motion. \nBut the fact still remains that we were almost forced to resort to a \ncloture vote simply to secure an up-or-down vote on Mr. Wolski's \nnomination. Mr. Wolski would have been the first Court of Claims \nnominee in the history of the Senate to be forced through a cloture \nvote. This would have been a historic but sad precedent that we came \ndangerously close to setting. As I said, I am pleased that we did not \ngo down this path and that we are proceeding to an up-or-down vote on \nMr. Wolski's nomination.\n  Mr. Wolski will make a fine addition to the Court of Claims. His \nnomination has bipartisan support, having been reported favorably to \nthe full Senate by all 10 Judiciary Committee Republicans and Senator \nFeinstein. He is an accomplished trial attorney who has represented \nclients on both sides of the issues, including a number of clients on \nwhat many consider to be the so-called liberal side. For example, Mr. \nWolski has represented a group of municipal governments challenging a \ncommercial development that would have caused environmental, traffic, \nand other urban sprawl problems. He presently represents a class of \nMedicare beneficiaries who are suing the tobacco industry to try to \nrecover reimbursement to the Medicare system. And he represents the \nState of Nevada, Clark County, and the City of Las Vegas in their \nopposition to the location of a nuclear waste repository at Yucca \nMountain. Clearly, this is not the work of an ideologue but the work of \nan accomplished lawyer who recognizes his duty to represent his \nclients' interests to the best of his ability.\n  Mr. Wolski's breadth and depth of experience will be a true asset to \nthe Court of Claims. After graduating from the University of Virginia \nLaw School, Mr. Wolski clerked for Judge Vaughn Walker of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. He has a fine \nrecord in public service, including 5 years as a litigator with a \npublic interest law firm. During his tenure there, he represented \nclients in cases presenting significant issues of constitutional and \nproperty rights law. He continued his public service by serving as \nGeneral Counsel and Chief Tax Advisor in the Congress with the Joint \nEconomic Committee for Senator Connie Mack. As the first person to \nattend college in his family, Victor Wolski feels it is important to \ngive back to the community and felt a strong commitment towards the \npublic sector. This commitment is quite evident in his professional \nbackground.\n  In 2000, Mr. Wolski transitioned from the public sector to private \npractice, joining the prominent Washington, DC, law firm Cooper, Carvin \n& Rosenthal. He now practices with its successor firm, Cooper & Kirk. \nHe has a reputation for being a thoughtful and hard-working legal \nprofessional who will be a stellar addition to the Court of Federal \nClaims, and I commend President Bush for nominating him.\n  Mr. President, we find ourselves at an important point. We have two \neminent and well-qualified circuit court nominees, Miguel Estrada and \nPriscilla Owen, currently being blocked by a minority of Senators from \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. History will show that this \nminority group of Senators was not asking for a full and open debate. \nThey were not asking for meaningful deliberation on these well-\nqualified nominees. Rather, this minority group of Senators was \ncommitted to subverting precedent and reworking the meaning of advice \nand consent.\n  I think we can agree that the confirmation process is broken. I \ncertainly hope we can find a constructive way to restore the process, \nbut recent talk does not lead me to be overly optimistic--not when we \nhear injudicious talk about plans for three, four, or more planned \nfilibusters. I hope that is not the kind of history we want to write. \nInstead, I hope that my colleagues will see today's up-or-down vote on \nMr. Wolski's nomination as an opportunity to put a stop to the \nobstruction and delay by giving all the rest of our nominees the \ncourtesy of a simple vote on their nominations. That is all we ask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9085-S9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATIONS OF MARY ELLEN COSTER WILLIAMS, OF MARYLAND, SUSAN G. \nBRADEN, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND CHARLES F.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination and confirmation of someone for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect, Susan Braden, to be a Judge for the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims. I cannot think of a better person for this court. She is \ncurrently counsel at Baker & McKenzie. She earned her bachelor degree \nin 1970 and her law degree in 1973 from Case Western Reserve \nUniversity. She has worked as a trial attorney in the Department of \nJustice. She has served as a senior attorney at the Federal Trade \nCommission. For the past 18 years, she has had a distinguished career \nin the private sector, specializing in Federal litigation, antitrust, \ninternational trade practices, and intellectual property.\n  Her work on international trade gave her the opportunity to accompany \na delegation led by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer on \nan official visit to several European courts in 1998.\n  She is very qualified, and I wish to say on a personal note that she \nand her husband, Tom Sussman, have been friends of mine for a long \ntime. I went to law school with Tom Sussman. I have a great deal of \nrespect for both Tom and Susan, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis qualified nominee. She will be a wonderful public servant.\n  Madam President, I urge approval of the three nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to add my comments to the \nconfirmation of Susan Braden. I happen to know her. She represented a \nbusiness in the steel industry in Alabama that was in trouble. We tried \nto save it for the State. She worked so hard with the union members and \nwith the company. I came to be extraordinarily impressed with her \ndedication, her legal skill, her love of law, and her integrity. I \nthink she will do an excellent job in this important position.\n  I wanted to add my comments that we need more people like Susan \nBraden in the courts of America. I think she will do a super job. I am \nvery proud of her on this special day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Susan Braden, who has been nominated to serve as a \njudge on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Ms. Braden has the breadth \nof experience and accomplishment we look for in a Federal judge, and I \ncommend President Bush for nominating her.\n  After graduating from law school, Ms. Braden served for 7 years as a \ntrial attorney, and then as a senior trial attorney, for the Department \nof Justice Antitrust Division. She then worked at the Federal Trade \nCommission for 5 years as a senior attorney advisor and senior counsel \nto Chairman David Clanton and Chairman James Miller III. In this \ncapacity, she assumed responsibility for special policy and legislative \nprojects, such as drafting a potential set of guidelines concerning \ninterlocking directorates and issues concerning enforcement of the \nantitrust laws to professionals.\n  Ms. Braden has worked in the private sector for the past 18 years, \nwhere she has focused on antitrust law, complex civil litigation, \ninternational trade matters for industrial clients, and computer \nsoftware litigation. Her experience will serve her well on the bench. I \nam confident that she will execute her duties on the bench with \nintegrity, intelligence, and fairness. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin my unqualified support for her nomination.\n\n\n                nomination of mary ellen coster williams\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nMary Ellen Coster Williams, who has been nominated to the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims.\n  Judge Williams has served with distinction on both sides of the \nbench. Upon her graduation from Duke University Law School in 1977, she \nworked in private practice with Fulbright & Jaworski and with Schnader, \nHarrison, Segal & Lewis.\n  Judge Williams then left private practice in 1983 to work in the \nCivil Division of the United States Attorney's Office in Washington, \nDC. She returned to private practice in 1987 as a partner with Janis, \nSchuelke & Wechsler.\n  During her 8 years in private practice and 3\\1/2\\ years as an \nAssistant United States Attorney, Judge Williams gained valuable \nexperience handling matters involving Government contracts, employment \nlaw, torts, and commercial litigation. Since 1989, she has served as an \nadministrative judge on the General Services Administration Board of \nContract Appeals.\n  Judge Williams was named a Life Fellow by the American Bar \nAssociation and is currently the vice chair of the ABA Section on \nPublic Contract Law. She also has been active in the District of \nColumbia Bar Association. Since 1997, she has served on the U.S. Court \nof Federal Claims Advisory Council, so she has much more than simply a \npassing familiarity with the court to which she has been nominated.\n  With her wealth of experience and dedication, Judge Williams is well \nequipped to serve on the Court of Federal Claims. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting her nomination.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Charles F. Lettow\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my full support \nfor the confirmation of Charles F. Lettow, who has been nominated to \nthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n  Mr. Lettow is an excellent selection to join the Court of Federal \nClaims. He has a strong academic background and more than 30 years of \nlitigation experience in constitutional and administrative law matters. \nA graduate of Stanford Law School, Mr. Lettow clerked for both the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court before taking \na position in 1970 as Counsel to the Council on Environmental Quality, \nwhich was established by Congress a year earlier. His responsibilities \nincluded drafting legislation and Executive orders and working to \nnegotiate bilateral agreements.\n  In 1973 Mr. Lettow joined the firm of Cleary Gottlieb as a litigation \nassociate, became a partner three years alter, and has remained with \nthe firm since that time, focusing on Federal litigation and \nenvironmental cases. Cases he has handled over his career have \npresented often difficult questions of constitutional and \nadministrative law, and he has handled them with expertise.\n  Mr. Lettow has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court three times and \nin the U.S. Courts of Appeals in more than 40 cases, as well as \nlitigated in numerous Federal district courts and the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims. I cannot imagine someone who is better prepared to sit \non the Court of Federal Claims. I urge my colleagues to vote for his \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the nominations are \nconfirmed, en bloc, the motions to reconsider are laid upon the table, \nthe President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9086-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, today the Senate will be considering S. \n925, the State Department authorization bill. During the last 4 months, \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been working hard on issues \nrelated to the funding and operations of the State Department. We have \nheld hearings on public diplomacy, embassy security, the role of the \nState Department in the war on terrorism, the nonproliferation programs \noverseen by the State Department, and the overall State Department \nbudget. In numerous other hearings and briefings covering such issues \nas Iraq, North Korea, Afghanistan, and NATO, we have reviewed the vital \nrole of diplomacy at this stage of our United States history.\n  In our hearings and through our daily contacts with the State \nDepartment, the Foreign Relations Committee has witnessed the \ncommitment and the skill of departmental personnel as they work to \nimprove national security and our prosperity in increasingly difficult \nand often very dangerous circumstances.\n  We have seen both the benefits of our successes and the consequences \nof our failures. We cannot expect diplomacy to succeed 100 percent of \nthe time, but it is vital that our diplomats have the resources and the \ncapabilities that will maximize their chances of success. That is the \njob of the Senate today. We must make certain that Secretary Powell and \nthis Department have the tools they need to make our case convincingly.\n  I wish to thank especially the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Joe Biden, for his strong support of this \nprocess and his leadership in foreign policy matters. We have agreed on \nthe vast majority of provisions in this bill, and when we have \ndisagreed, we have worked hard to bridge our differences and find \nbipartisan solutions with our colleagues.\n  We have always shared the common goal of bringing good legislation to \nthe floor for the Senate's judgment. Senator Biden's commitment to this \nprocess and his innumerable contributions to the substance of this bill \nhave been indispensable.\n  After consultations with Senator Biden and the majority leader, we \ndetermined the Senate would best be served by adding the foreign \nassistance authorization bill, passed by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in May, to the State Department bill.\n  Consequently, the substitute amendment that is the pending business \ncontains the language of both S. 925 and S. 1161. Both bills passed in \ncommittee by votes of 19-0. I believe that this combination will give \nus a chance for a meaningful debate on foreign policy, while expediting \nthe work of the Senate.\n  At this time in our history we are experiencing a confluence of \nforeign policy crises that is unparalleled in the post-cold war era. \nOur Nation has lived through the September 11 tragedy, and we have \nresponded with a worldwide war against terrorism. We have fought wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, where we are likely to be engaged in security \nand reconstruction efforts for years to come. We have been confronted \nby a nuclear crisis in North Korea that threatens U.S. national \nsecurity and that could destabilize the entire northeast Asian region. \nWe are continuing efforts to safeguard Russia's massive stockpiles of \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and to prevent proliferation \nthroughout the world. We have experienced strains in the Atlantic \nAlliance, even as we plan for its expansion. We are trying to respond \nto the AIDS pandemic in Africa and elsewhere, as well as help stabilize \nColombia and preserve democracy in Venezuela.\n  Despite these extraordinary international conditions that demand the \nconstant attention of our Government, the State Department and our \nforeign assistance programs are still underfunded. Although President \nBush and Secretary of State Powell have supported important funding \nincreases for our foreign policy accounts during the last 2 years, we \ndug a deep hole for ourselves during the 1990s, when diplomatic \ncapabilities were placed at the bottom of our spending priorities.\n  From 1994 through 1997, for example, the Function 150 account, which \nfunds State Department operations and foreign assistance, sustained \nconsecutive annual real decreases of 3.6 percent, 5.6 percent, 11.4 \npercent, and 1.5 percent. This slide occurred even as the State \nDepartment was incurring the heavy added costs of establishing new \nmissions in the 15 states of the former Soviet Union. Relative to other \nspending priorities, we continue to disadvantage our diplomatic \ncapabilities. As a percentage of discretionary spending, the \ninternational affairs account stands at about 3.4 percent in fiscal \nyear 2003. This is the lowest percentage of discretionary funding \ndevoted to international affairs in the past 2 decades. We are still \nconducting diplomacy on a shoestring in an era when embassies are prime \nterrorist targets and we depend on diplomats to build alliances; work \nwith foreign governments to apprehend terrorists before they reach U.S. \nsoil; and explain U.S. principles, values, and policies worldwide.\n\n  In April, with the assistance of Senators Feinstein, Biden, DeWine, \nHagel, Sarbanes, Chafee, Smith, Jeffords, Kennedy, and others, I \noffered an amendment to the Senate budget resolution that restored \n$1.15 billion to the 150 account. The amendment brought the 150 account \nup to the level requested by the President. The success of the \namendment on this Senate floor, during a process when few amendments \nreceived favorable votes, illustrates the growing appreciation for and \nunderstanding of the role of Secretary Powell and the State Department. \nBut we need to go further. We need to commit to a long-term course that \nassigns U.S. economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic \npriority that we assign to military capabilities.\n  There is a tendency in the media and sometimes in this body to see \ndiplomatic activities as the rival of military solutions to problems. \nWe have to get beyond this simplistic formulation. We have to \nunderstand that our military and our diplomats are both instruments of \nnational power that depend on one another. They both help shape the \ninternational environment and influence the attitudes of governments \nand peoples. They both gather information and provide expertise that is \nvital to the war on terrorism. And they both must be unsurpassed in \ntheir capabilities, if the United States is going to survive and \nprosper.\n  Americans rightly demand that U.S. military capabilities by unrivaled \nin the world. Should not our diplomatic strength meet the same test? If \na greater commitment of resources can prevent the bombing of one of our \nembassies, or the proliferation of a nuclear weapon, or the spiral into \nchaos of a vulnerable nation wracked by disease and hunger, the \ninvestment will have yielded dividends far beyond its cost.\n\n  Both the State Department authorization bill and the foreign \nassistance authorization bill for 1-year authorizations. Given that the \nForeign Relations Committee has many new members, the State \nDepartment's responsibilities are expanding, and world events are \nunpredictable, we decided that it would be wise to retain the \nopportunity for the committee and the Senate to revisit these bills \nnext year after we have had some time to perform oversight.\n  The State Department portion of this bill contains funding that \ncovers the operating expenses for the department, embassy construction \nand security, education and cultural exchange programs, as well as \nother programs and activities. It also includes funding for: assessed \ncontributions to international organizations required by treaty; \ninternational commissions and such centers as the Asia Foundation and \nthe East-West Center; international broadcasting activities; refugee \nand migration assistance; and Peace Corps funding for 2004 through \n2007.\n  The committee is recommending increases to the administration's \nrequest for the State Department of about $400 million, or roughly 4 \npercent. These increases address needs that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee identified as keys to U.S. success in this dangerous new \ncentury. They include: an additional $312 million for embassy \nconstruction that will allow groundbreaking this\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nyear for three new embassy compounds; approximately $8 million to \nincrease the cap on hardship pay and danger pay for State Department \nemployees; an increase of $8.9 million to restore cuts in international \nbroadcasting to Eastern and Central European nations; the restoration \nof $25 million that was cut for SEED and Freedom Support Act funding to \nCentral Europe and the Balkans; and an additional $30 million to \nstrengthen public diplomacy and international exchanges with the \nIslamic world.\n\n  In addition, in committee, individual members offered amendments on \nsuch important issues as international support for a successor regime \nin Iraq, U.S. policy toward Haiti, and U.S. policy regarding \nrecognition of a Palestinian state. A detailed listing of other issues \ncovered and policy recommendations made by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in this bill are contained in the committee report.\n  As our committee undertook an in-depth study of State Department \nneeds, we simultaneously examined our foreign assistance programs and \ntheir evolving role in U.S. humanitarian and national security efforts. \nAs I indicated, in May, we passed a foreign assistance authorization \nbill by a 19 -0 vote.\n  The committee held hearings on U.S. foreign assistance in six \nstrategic regions of the world: the Near East, South Asia, East Asia, \nEurasia, the Western Hemisphere, and Africa. In other hearings we \nexplored numerous topics related to foreign assistance, including \nglobal hunger, reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, and President \nBush's vision for a new Millennium Challenge Corporation.\n  In the hearings, we learned how the administration's 2004 budget \nrequest would support U.S. foreign policy interests. Those hearings \nwere very informative, and I again want to express my appreciation to \nthe subcommittee chairs and ranking members who conducted them, as well \nas to all Senators who participated.\n  This was only a first step. Since the mid-1980s, Congress has not \nfulfilled its responsibilityb to pass an Omnibus Foreign Assistance \nAct. Several discrete measures, such as the Global AIDS bill, the \nFreedom Support Act, and the Support for Eastern European Democracy, \nSEED, have been enacted.\n  But in the absence of a comprehensive authorization, much of the \nresponsibility for providing guidance for foreign assistance policy has \nfallen to the Appropriations Committees. The appropriators have kept \nour foreign assistance programs going, but in many cases, they have had \nto do so without proper authorization. In most years, the Foreign \nRelations Committee did pass a State Department authorization bill, but \nthat bill only authorizes about 35 percent of the function 150 account. \nTo fund the remaining accounts, appropriators frequently had to waive \nthe legal requirement to appropriate funds only following the passage \nof an authorization bill.\n  There is no single reason why the Congress has failed to pass a \ncomprehensive foreign assistance authorization bill for so long. But we \nall recognize the difficult legislative task involved. As a general \nspending item, foreign assistance rarely is high on the list of \nconstituent priorities. Yet specific provisions in foreign assistance \nbills have often raised political emotions. Thus, comprehensive foreign \nassistance bills have contended with the most difficult of legislative \ncircumstances--they have generated seemingly intractable political \ndisputes, while lacking an overriding legislative payoff.\n  We must stop thinking in conventional political terms. Passing a \ncomprehensive foreign assistance bill is good politics, as well as good \npolicy. It is good politics because it underscores the leadership of \nthis Senate at a time when our country is in great peril. It is good \npolitics because foreign assistance is an instrument of national power \nin the war on terrorism. It is good politics because it recognizes that \nour standard of living, the retirements of our parents, our children's \neducations, advancements in our health care, and the security of \nAmericans depend on winning the war on terrorism.\n  With this in mind, Senator Biden and I, with the support of the \nmajority leader, bring the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act to the \nfloor in tandem with the State Department authorization bill.\n  The Foreign Assistance bill before you authorizes funding levels for \nmost of the foreign operations accounts within function 150 for fiscal \nyear 2004. The committee took as a starting point the request submitted \nby the President last February. The executive branch has been working \nwith our embassies around the world for many months to develop accurate \nbudget numbers.\n  As I previously mentioned, the Foreign Relations Committee worked \nclosely with the Budget Committee on maintaining the President's \nrequests for the 150 account. I note this to highlight the fact that we \nhave sought to work within the rules to achieve the overall funding \nlevels that are before us today. Many members of the committee, \nincluding myself, would like to have more funding available. But I am \nhopeful that members will respect the budget process and the decisions \nthat were made earlier in the year.\n  With respect to the foreign assistance authorization, the committee \nmade relatively few changes to the dollar amounts requested by the \nPresident. We provided a $70 million increase for the Freedom Support \nAct, a $40 million increase for the Support for Eastern European \nDemocracy Act, a $15 million increase for development assistance, a $6 \nmillion increase for peacekeeping operations, and a $100 million \nincrease for the Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and \nRelated Programs account. The additional funds in the Account would be \nused to safeguard and hasten the destruction of weapons of mass \ndestruction. They also would provide $15 million for a new initiative, \nThe Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2003, contained in \ntitle IV of the bill. This legislation authorizes the State Department \nto provide contributions and technical assistance to the IAEA to deal \nwith the dirty bomb threat. The bill is the result of a cooperative \neffort between Senator Biden and myself, as well as Senator Domenici. I \nwant to thank Senator Biden for his leadership, going all the way back \nto the hearings he held in 2002 on this issue.\n  On the other side of the ledger, we have reduced funding for two of \nthe President's requested programs. The Millennium Challenge \nCorporation has been reduced from $1.3 billion to $1 billion. This is \nnot an expression of doubt about the MCC concept. Rather, the reduction \nis based on the judgment that the MCC will require time to become \nestablished and may not be able to efficiently distribute the entire \n$1.3 billion request in the first fiscal year. The $300 million has \nbeen deferred until the next fiscal year when the MCC would be in a \nbetter position to spend it. We also have made a small cut in the \nAndean counter-drug initiative. It has been reduced from $731 million \nto $700 million--the amount appropriated in the previous fiscal year. \nIn addition, we have authorized 2 new contingency funds at the request \nof the President--the Complex Foreign Crises Fund and the Famine Fund. \nBut we have not authorized specific amounts for these Funds.\n\n  Finally, I would like to address the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation. For those Senators who have not studied this concept, it \nis a bold proposal by President Bush to provide a new model for U.S. \nforeign assistance programs. A compromise version of the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation bill is included in the substitute before us.\n  Our foreign assistance must be aimed at both humanitarian objectives \nand goals that aid in the fight against terrorism over the long run. \nThese include strengthening democracy, building free markets, and \nencouraging civil society in nations that otherwise might become havens \nor breeding grounds for terrorists. We must seek to encourage societies \nthat can fulfill the aspirations of their citizens and deny terrorists \nthe uncontrolled territory and abject poverty that the terrorists use \nto their advantage. To do this, all of us should begin to think about \nforeign assistance as a critical asset in the long-term war on \nterrorism.\n  This process will require us to ask how nations develop political \nstability and economic momentum and how they become good international \ncitizens that contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world \ncommunity. The Millennium Challenge Corporation has\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nbeen proposed on the assumption that we do know some of the answers. We \nbelieve that successful societies cannot be built without good \nleadership, economies based on sound market principles, and significant \ninvestments in health and education. By establishing firm criteria to \nmeasure and reward the progress of low-income nations in these areas, \nthe MCC can provide a powerful incentive to foreign governments to \nembrace and sustain reform.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee strongly supported the basic \npremise of the MCC and applauded the President's personal commitment to \nthe concept. However, members came forward with differing proposals on \nthe organization and bureaucratic status of the MCC. The committee \npassed a version of the MCC that differed substantially from the \nPresident's initial vision.\n  Since that time, Senator Hagel, Senator Biden, and myself have sought \nto construct an efficient format for this concept that would be \nsupported by the White House while meeting the concerns of our \ncommittee. These talks were difficult, but they also were a positive \nindication of the interest in the ultimate success of the MCC. I \nbelieve that we have succeeded in constructing a good compromise. \nEveryone gave up something to move the bill forward. Senator Biden and \nSenator Hagel will be addressing the Senate on their views toward the \nMCC, and I am sure that they will outline some concerns and \nreservations. I want to thank both of them for their willingness to be \nflexible and their contributions during this process.\n  I would note that the White House also was instrumental in concluding \nthis compromise. The administration has endorsed Senate passage of the \nthe Lugar-Hagel version of the MCC.\n  Our MCC compromise creates the needed ingredients for inter-agency \ncoordination, a top priority among a majority on the committee. It puts \nthe MCC under the authority of the Secretary of State and has the chief \nexecutive officer report to the Secretary. But it does not determine \nthe integrity of the President's concept. It gives the MCC the same \nautonomous status as the US Agency for International Development with \nthe right to manage itself, hire staff, and create its own new culture. \nIt mandates coordination between the MCC and USAID in the field and \ngives USAID the primary role in preparing countries for MCC \neligibility.\n  I believe our MCC approach is the right plan at the right time. It \nprovides a way to focus single-mindedly on economic development that is \nresults-based and meets clear benchmarks of success. We can have the \ncoordination we seek while also insulating it from short-term political \nconsiderations so that it can focus on the long-term benefits of \nwidening the universe of countries that live in peace and look to a \nprosperous and stable future.\n  I would like to notify members that I will be offering a managers' \npackage of amendments and will be asking unanimous consent that it be \nadopted. As part of that package, Section 204 of S. 925 will be deleted \nfrom our bill because it has been included in the defense authorition \nbill. I would like to express appreciation to Senator Warner, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for his help on \nthat matter.\n\n  The other amendments in the managers' package are technical in \nnature, clarifying original intention, or correcting errors.\n  I am looking forward to the debate on this bill and the constructive \ncontributions of our Members at this important time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9089-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9089-S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ACCELERATING THE INCREASE IN THE REFUNDABILITY OF THE CHILD TAX \n                       CREDIT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first, I compliment the distinguished \nchair of the Foreign Relations Committee for his work on this omnibus \npiece of legislation. I intend to support it. I admire the work that \nhas been done. I notice Senator Hagel is in the Chamber, and Senator \nFeingold. They and Senator Biden have really done yeoman work bringing \nus to this point. The MCC, foreign aid legislation, in addition to the \nState Department authorization bill, represents a tremendous amount of \nwork and effort to get us to this point. I look forward to the debate.\n  Having said that, however, I must rise to express my frustration on \nan unrelated matter. I want to call to the attention of my colleagues \nthe fact that it has now been a month since the Senate passed \nbipartisan legislation, 94 to 2, to rectify a problem that we all \nagreed should be fixed. I am referring to the 12 million children, and \nover 6 million families, that were excluded from legislation we \nrecently passed and signed into law providing tax relief to American \nfamilies.\n  Shortly after the exclusion was noted, the President admonished the \nSenate and the House to solve this problem as quickly as we can because \nwe were bumping up against a deadline.\n  I recall all the speeches on the Senate floor. Republicans and \nDemocrats came to the floor and said: Yes, we have to change this. Yes, \nwe have to recognize that by July 25th all of this must be done. Yes, \nwhen all of these checks go out and relief is provided to everybody \nelse, we should not be leaving out these 12 million children or these 6 \nmillion families. Let's resolve it. Let's do it. We said unequivocally \nthat we were going to resolve this by the 25th of July.\n  Here we are, well into the second week of July, just a matter of a \ncouple of weeks to go before the 25th is here, and yet there is no \naction. We keep promising. We keep hearing the promises made by others. \nThe fact is, nothing has been done.\n  I think it is important for us, once again, to light a fire, to \nreignite it, to state again our determination to see that this is going \nto be done, to see that these people are not left out, to ensure that \nwe address this issue as we all promised we would do just a month ago.\n  While I want to get on with this bill and while I want to be as \nsupportive as I can to assure that the very distinguished chair of the \nForeign Relations Committee can move this legislation along, I simply \nbelieve it is time for us, once again, to restate our determination to \nsolve this problem. We do not need any time. We can have the vote just \nas we had it before and complete our work on it. But I do think it has \nto be done prior to the time we get into the real, legitimate debate \nand discussion about the many worthy aspects of the bill the \ndistinguished chair has laid down.\n  So, Madam President, at this time I move to proceed to S. 1162, the \nchild tax credit bill, in order for us to accomplish that task first.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for not more than 10 minutes on the pending legislation, to be \nfollowed by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, if I could ask, when I am recognized, \nthat my statement be as in morning business, rather than as part of \nthis subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin.\n  I rise this afternoon to support the legislation that the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee has brought to the Senate floor \ntoday. I also wish to acknowledge his strong leadership, along with \nthat of the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Biden. They \nhave done a particularly effective job at a historic time in the \nhistory of this country and the world. This country, the world, and \nthis body will continue to look to their leadership as we go forward \ninto the next challenging year.\n  I also rise this afternoon to support the Lugar-Hagel compromise \nregarding\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\nauthorization for expanded development assistance through President \nBush's initiative to establish the Millennium Challenge Account--MCA, \nas the distinguished Chairman mentioned, as part of the substitute to \nthe Foreign Relations Authorization bill which is now before the \nSenate.\n  America faces no greater challenge in the world today than assisting \nglobal development and helping eliminate poverty. The security and \nprosperity of America and our allies cannot be disconnected from \nstability in the developing world. There are approximately 6.3 billion \npeople in the world and roughly half of them live on less than $2 per \nday. An estimated 2.4 billion of them are 19 years old or younger.\n  The next generation hangs in the balance. Global threats and \nconnections to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, \ndespair, oppression and infectious disease are not always apparent, but \nthis combination of threats presents complex challenges for America and \nher allies. Global economic development is a shared interest and must \nbe a shared responsibility.\n  The Millennium Challenge Account represents a significant new \ndirection in economic development. Linking American development \nassistance to good governance, democracy, human rights, transparency, \nand rule of law, will help support the transition to more stable and \ndemocratic political systems in the developing world.\n  The Lugar-Hagel compromise on Millennium Challenge assistance \naddresses the concerns of myself, Senator Biden, and some of my \ncolleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the \norganization and management of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, \nthe new agency that will be established to administer this program.\n  There was unanimous support in the committee for the goals of the \nPresident's program--the innovative evaluations and indicators that \nwill be used to assess a country's eligibility for assistance, and the \nneed for more funding for economic development. But I shared the \nconcern of Senator Biden and other colleagues that this initiative \nshould complement and expand, not constrain or complicate, the \nauthority of the Secretary of State to manage foreign assistance.\n  This is a particularly critical time in the history of our Country \nand the world.\n  Given the many challenges we face in the world, the secretary's role \nas America's chief diplomat must not be undercut or compromised. The \nLugar-Hagel compromise places the management of the MCA directly under \nthe authority of the Secretary of Sate, who chairs the board of the \ncorporation.\n  We have the potential to bring a new dynamic to American government \ninteragency cooperation and coordination on economic development on a \nlarge scale. The board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, chaired \nby the Secretary of State, would also include the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the USAID Administrator, and the U.S. Trade Representative, \nas well as the CEO of the corporation, who will report directly to the \nSecretary of State. This type of coordination, if managed properly, \nwill bring new energy and creativity to our development programs.\n  America remains the world's indispensable leader in working with \nothers to help promote global stability and prosperity and help \neradicate poverty and disease. We need to do more. We will do more. And \nwe need to do it better, smarter and wiser in meeting the challenges of \nglobal poverty.\n  That means our programs and the management of those programs must be \nmore efficient and accountable. Establishing the Millennium Challenge \nAccount is clearly in the interest of the United States. Millennium \nchallenge assistance can play a creative and important role in helping \nshape a new approach to development policy.\n  Global development is not a zero-sum game.\n  As economies stabilize and grow, the citizens of those countries \nprosper, as well as citizens from all countries. Trade-based growth is \nthe most effective approach to long-term economic stability and \nprosperity. America's development policies should reflect these \neconomic development fundamentals.\n  America's credibility will much depend on our ability to continue to \nassist the developing world. Our power and influence is not defined \nsolely by our military might. President Bush's Global AIDS initiative, \nhis trip to Africa, and the MCA proposal all reflect dynamic and new \ncommitments to security and development.\n  September 11, 2001 reminded Americans that we face a dangerous world \nwith complex connections and enormous responsibilities for U.S. \nleadership. The world is inter-connected. Global development, \nprosperity and stability are directly connected to America's future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Lugar, myself, and others in \nsupporting this compromise management approach to the Millennium \nChallenge Assistance program.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee indicated, \nthis approach, this amendment, this compromise, is also being supported \nby the White House and the State Department.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for allowing me to \nspeak at this point and for the excellent experience of serving on the \ncommittee during his tenure as chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin for his extraordinary leadership as subcommittee chairman and \nranking member over a number of years and his eloquent and important \nstatement on Africa today.\n  In a moment, the majority leader will be on the floor, and Members \nwill want to take note that a rollcall vote is likely to occur sometime \naround 2 p.m. The leader will explain the situation. In the meanwhile, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand the Democratic leader has made \na motion to proceed to a bill on the calendar regarding the child tax \ncredit and that the motion is pending.\n  As my colleagues know, we have been considering critical legislation \nregarding the State Department reauthorization and are ready to proceed \nwith that debate. The child tax credit bill is currently in conference. \nThat conference is underway. We need to allow the conferees the \nopportunity to work through the regular order and reconcile the \ndifferences between the House and Senate bills. Meetings are underway. \nWe will be meeting later today on the very important issue of the child \ntax credit. Therefore, in order to allow the process to move forward on \nthat issue and to allow us to return to the important pending \nlegislation, I now move to table the motion to proceed and ask that the \nvote occur at 2 p.m. today and further that the pending motion be set \naside until that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Lugar in \npresenting the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2004. As the chairman has described, we will soon submit a substitute \namendment consisting of the text of three bills: S. 925, the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act as reported out of committee in April; S. \n1161, the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act, as reported out of \ncommittee in late May; and thirdly, a bill authorizing a new program, \nthe Millennium Challenge Account which\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nwas initiated by the Bush administration in March of 2002. This program \nwas authorized by the committee in legislation also reported in May. \nSince then, further discussions have occurred between myself, Senator \nHagel, and the chairman which the chairman has already described. I \nwill return to that subject in a few moments.\n  All three bills received unanimous support from the Committee on \nForeign Relations. The markups of these bills were not at all \ncontentious and, quite frankly, didn't last very long. Their easy \npassage in committee is a testament to the bipartisan approach the \nchairman is developing on this legislation and the committee as a \nwhole. The chairman has already summarized the provisions of the \nsubstitute amendment. Let me join him in highlighting a few of the key \npoints.\n  First, the bill provides the President's budget request for the \nDepartment of State, and it does more. We increase the authorization \nfor several programs where we believe the budget request is inadequate, \nsuch as embassy security, international exchanges, public diplomacy, \nand in certain foreign aid accounts, including programs devoted to \nnonproliferation activities. If we are going to send people overseas to \nadvance American interests, we have to protect them. We have to give \nthem the tools to do the job. That is what we attempt to do here.\n  Second, the bill authorizes establishment of a Middle East television \nnetwork. In recent years, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has done \nan incredible job in reviving our radio broadcasting in the region. \nRadio Sawa now is, if not the most popular, one of the most popular and \noft-listened-to programs in the region. I would note parenthetically \nthat as we struggle to make our case known in the Middle East, we have \nto understand who our target is. You have the vast majority of the \npeople, for example, in Iran under the age of 18. You have the vast \nmajority, 60 percent of the folks in the Arab world, under the age of \n18. We have a very young audience, an audience that if we don't begin \nto get the U.S. message across, in light of what they are being fed \nnow, these young pages sitting here who make the Senate run, they are \ngoing to, when they get to be my age, inherit the whirlwind. They will \nhave a gigantic problem.\n  The television network is a new undertaking that I and others have \nbeen pushing for some time. It is a new undertaking for the U.S. \nGovernment in broadcasting but one that I believe is clearly worth \ntrying. Most people in the Middle East get their news from television. \nThree of us, the Presiding Officer, the chairman and I, returned a week \nor so ago from Baghdad. One of the things we found out was our case has \nnot even been made there. We control the television de facto right now, \nand we are on, unless something changed in the last week, at least 4 \nhours a day with the most bland broadcasts. It is not but it seems that \nit is straight out of the public information department of one of the \nagencies in the Federal Government. We have to figure out a way to get \nIraqis on television 12, 14, 18 hours a day explaining \nstraightforwardly what is going on over there.\n  The Iraqi people right now are in 123 degree weather. They have no \nelectricity and they are wondering why Uncle Sam, who could defeat \ntheir great Satan Saddam Hussein in such a short time, rout his vaunted \narmy and Republican Guard and fedayeen, can't get everything up and \nrunning immediately for them.\n  They think like most folks in that difficult region of the world that \nthere must be some plot. What they don't know is--and we are not \nbroadcasting it--that all our efforts--not all--are being sabotaged, \nliterally blown up, blowing up the grids, blowing up the powerplants. \nThey are blowing up the oil pipelines.\n  So one of the larger points about the television network is we have \nto be in the game. We have to be in the game to be able to try to get \nour points across in a region where we don't get a very fair shake.\n  Third, the bill authorizes expanded international exchanges with the \nMuslim world, including high school exchange programs, modeled on a \nsuccessful effort that has been in place with Russia and the newly \nindependent states for some time now, and it is successful. There are a \nlot of avenues for reaching out to the Muslim world, and face-to-face \nexchanges are one of the best ways to be able to have impact on opening \npeople's minds.\n  In the foreign assistance portion of the bill, let me call attention \nto two provisions--the Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act and \nthe Global Pathogen Surveillance Act. My friend from Indiana, the \nchairman, may be quietly smiling at me for taking these two and \nfocusing on them because they are two proposals that I put forward. But \nI thank him for concluding they had merit and seeing to it they are in \nthe bill.\n  I developed these bills over the past year to address the threat of \npossible radiological terrorism and bioterrorism. The bill on \nradiological terrorism would address the threat posed by radiological \ndispersion devices, colloquially known as dirty bombs. Most people \nlistening to this do not understand when we talk about dirty bombs. A \nlot of people think it is a nuclear device, a homemade nuclear device. \nThat is of consequence, but the dirty bomb can cause incredible \neconomic dislocation, although it is not likely to kill a lot of \npeople. It is taking radioactive material and packing it around \nconventional explosives and blowing it up and ending up making the area \nin which it is dispersed have a level of radiation that exceeds what is \nsafe in the minds of the EPA and scientists for people to be engaged \nin. But it is not going to kill a lot of people if one went off, God \nforbid, in the Mall, which is not far from here. But it is a clear and \npresent danger and a concern.\n  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act is the second piece of \nlegislation which authorizes $35 million in assistance for fiscal 2004 \nfor developing nations to improve their efforts to detect, track, and \ncontain disease outbreaks.\n  As the SARS epidemic has demonstrated, viruses and pathogens do not \nrespect national borders. Without a quick diagnosis of a biological \nattack or a rapid recognition of suspicious patterns of diseases, and \nfast transmission of that information, we can see that an epidemic can \nspread very rapidly by getting people heading out of an airport not \nknowing they were exposed.\n  In dealing with dirty bombs and dangerous pathogens, it is in our \nnational interest to help other nations contain these threats before \nthey get to our shores--threats that do not respect national borders. \nThis legislation does that. It helps them set up infrastructures to be \nable to have their public health systems go out and identify the \nexistence of these pathogens. One of the things we know about SARS--and \nthe criticism of the Chinese is they didn't acknowledge what was \nhappening quickly enough. They didn't put in place quickly enough a \nnational system to contain it. You have to know the problem before you \ncan warn people of its existence. Many of these countries--a vast \nportion of them--do not have a public health infrastructure to be able \nto do this. This helps them; it is a small start of $35 million for \nthat effort.\n\n  Finally, let me say a few words about the millennium challenge \naccount. The President deserves, in my view, credit for proposing a \nsignificant increase in foreign aid, and requiring that such assistance \nbe targeted to selected countries which meet certain performance \ncriteria. I will acknowledge on the floor what both of my colleagues \nhere know. I was skeptical of whether or not the performance criteria \nwere really a way to avoid delivering foreign aid or a way to identify \nwhat we know is important. When we give foreign assistance to a country \nthat, for example, is a democracy, as opposed to a dictatorship, we \nknow that aid is more likely to meet its desired end and be used in a \nway that is efficacious than when we give it to a country that has no \nstandards, so that we can determine how the money is being dispersed. I \nhave become convinced for some time now that--and this is a President \nwho, historically, I am told has been opposed to foreign aid per se, \nand some of his predecessors share his view--this is actually a way to \nincrease not only our contribution in foreign assistance but also its \nefficacy. When we spend a dollar, we will get a dollar's worth of \nbenefit--not us, but the people who get it for the expenditure.\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n  We have learned over the last several decades that providing foreign \nassistance is important. We have learned a lot. One thing we know is \nthat assistance works best in countries that get the basics right, \ncountries that invest in the health and welfare of their people, have a \nrelatively democratic system and an economic system that is open and \ntransparent. That is what this millennium account is about--making sure \nthat more money goes to places that will be able to use it well.\n  Where the administration has taken the wrong turn, in my view, is \nwith this proposal to establish a new governmental agency to administer \nthis program. Five years ago, under the leadership of our friend and \nformer colleague, Senator Helms, Congress abolished two foreign policy \nagencies, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. \nInformation Agency, and merged them into the State Department. The \nlegislation enacted in 1998 also gave the Secretary of State more \nauthority to supervise operations of agencies; in particular, the \nAgency for International Development, so-called AID. I supported that \ninitiative as did I think both of my colleagues here.\n  The President's proposal, the Millennium Challenge Account, in my \nview, is directly contrary to the decision Congress made 5 years ago \nabout how we should organize. It would create a new agency to be \nlocated outside the State Department and outside the Agency for \nInternational Development. In my view, it would weaken the authority of \nthe Secretary of State to coordinate all foreign assistance. I find it \nironic that a Republican President would seek to expand the \nGovernment's foreign policy bureaucracy, just a few years after \nCongress voted to reduce the size of that same bureaucracy.\n  During the committee markup on this bill, the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Hagel, and I offered an amendment with the very powerful case \nhe made, which the committee adopted by an 11-8 vote, to prevent the \nestablishment of such an agency. Instead, the Hagel-Biden amendment \ngave the Secretary of State the authority to coordinate this new \nprogram consistent with the 1998 Helms reorganization legislation that \npassed. The administration responded by threatening a veto if the \nHagel-Biden amendment were to survive in conference. I must say I don't \nfind that veto threat very credible. It is easy for me to say, since I \nam not the chairman. There is a degree of sensitivity that increases \nwhen you are the ranking member and it is a President of your own \nparty. I have been there. So I am sure my friend believes that veto \nthreat is much more credible than I think it is. But that is pure \nconjecture. The reason I am doubtful is the President has yet to veto a \nbill--I would be shocked if he would veto this whole bill over that one \nissue. But that is a matter of subjective interpretation.\n  Subsequent to our markup and this veto threat, the chairman developed \na compromise text that meets Senator Hagel and me part of the way. It \nretained the provision establishing a new agency, but it does do some \ngood, in my view. It gives the Secretary of State greater authority \nover the agency by having its chief executive officer report to the \nSecretary of State, just as the AID administrator reports to the \nSecretary.\n  That is an improvement, but it still contains a fatal flaw, and that \nfatal flaw is the new agency, in my view. Moreover, it adds to the \nconfusion by having the head of the agency report to the Secretary of \nState, but then assigns several of its critical functions to a five-\nmember board on which the Secretary of State is only one of those five \nmembers and dispersing this aid through the millennium account.\n  Reluctantly, I will go along with this compromise proposed by the \nchairman. I still believe it is a mistake to create a new agency, and \nif things were to change, and if by the grace of God and the good will \nof the neighbors my party took over the Senate again, and if I were \nchairman of this committee, I must put everyone on notice that I will \ntry to eliminate that agency and try to put it back in the State \nDepartment because I think it is a mistake. But I want to deal in full \ndisclosure here.\n  I am going along with it because, quite frankly, the option is not \nparticularly acceptable. The option is not have the agency, not have \nthe money, not have the increased foreign aid, which I think is not a \nrational option.\n  If this legislation is enacted, as I said, I reserve my right to \nfight another day to attempt to reverse the decision. But based on the \nway things are going, I do not think anybody should get too worried if \nyou think having a separate agency is a good idea.\n  I have acceded to the desire of the chairman in order, as I said, not \nto let the bill get bogged down on this organizational issue. I agree \nCongress should move forward and improve this important initiative, but \nin the coming months, the President's proposal will be put to the test \nrelatively quickly. In announcing this initiative, the President \npledged to increase foreign assistance above and beyond current aid \nbudgets; in other words, not to sacrifice current programs. This is not \nwe take away from here to give to foreign aid. It is to increase \nforeign aid and maintain our commitment on other programs as well.\n  I must tell my colleagues, I am starting to doubt the President will \nbe able to deliver on that commitment. The allocations of the foreign \noperations appropriations account for fiscal year 2004 in the other \nbody, the House, is abysmally low, in my view, just $17.1 billion, a \nreduction of $1.7 billion below the President's request. The \nallocations in this body, in the Senate, are better, $18.1 billion, but \nstill three-quarters of a billion dollars below the President's \nrequest.\n  Even the bill before us falls short. It authorizes $1 billion in \nfiscal year 2004 and increases to the $5 billion level by 2006. But for \nthis fiscal year, it is $300 million below the President's request.\n  Again, this is not a criticism of the chairman. He made a very valid \npoint. We have not passed an authorization bill in a long time, and we \ndid pass a budget with which I did not agree. I voted against the \nbudget resolution, but the majority of the U.S. Senate voted for it. \nThe chairman's argument is we must stay within that budget to have \ncredibility in order to get the requisite number of votes to do \nsomething we have not done in a long time: pass an authorization bill.\n  The fact is, we are below the President's request because of being \nconstrained by the budget guidelines we passed, and the House is way \nbelow it, $1.7 billion. According to press reports, the Vice President \nof the United States was involved in negotiations with the House \nleadership over House allocations. If that is true, it does not look to \nme as if the administration is working very hard to support this \nmillennium challenge account. Again, as the old saying goes, the proof \nof the pudding will be in the eating. We are going to know very soon, \nGod willing.\n\n  It is beyond my comprehension how the Congress will adequately fund \nthe millennium account, keep our commitment to $3 billion a year to \nHIV/AIDS assistance, and not reduce any current programs. I seriously \ndoubt it can be done, but I sincerely hope I am proven wrong on that \nscore.\n  The burden, in my view, is on the President and the majority in \nCongress in both Houses to deliver on the President's promise. Just as \nthe United States will demand accountability for countries that become \neligible, the rest of the world is waiting to see if we will fulfill \nthe President's commitment that has been widely circulated at the G-8, \nwidely circulated in every international forum, and I think we will be \nmaking a gigantic mistake if we do not meet the President's commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the chairman, and I believe \nwe are ready to consider amendments. I see Senator Brownback is in the \nChamber. It is my understanding Senator Brownback may start, but we are \ngoing to, at 2 o'clock, have a vote and then go back to Senator \nBrownback.\n  I thank the chairman for his diligence, for his courtesy, and for his \nleadership in getting us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in the absence of the Senator from \nDelaware, I congratulated and commended him earlier on for his work as \nformer chairman of the committee and one who has worked so closely with \nthe chair and with myself on the MCA and so many other issues. I deeply \nappreciate that. That is the reason we are at this point.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1139 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk, \nand\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nI ask unanimous consent that it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself and Mr. \n     Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 1139.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1139) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. Senator Brownback is in the Chamber, \nand he has amendments to offer. I am hopeful he might be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar for his \noutstanding leadership on this bill and on the issues of foreign \naffairs. He has done a fabulous job, as has Senator Biden, the ranking \nmember.\n  I also thank Senator Biden for the tremendous eulogy he gave about \nStrom Thurmond at the funeral in South Carolina last week. The Senator \nreally did us very proud with his representation of this body and his \nrelationship with Strom Thurmond. It was a touching event. His eulogy \nof Strom Thurmond was beautiful. I heard a number of people comment \nabout it. It was very nice of him to do that. It was very nicely done.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. It was a great honor \nfor me to participate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1138 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1138.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow North Koreans to apply for refugee status or asylum)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . TREATMENT OF NATIONALS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF KOREA.\n\n       For purposes of eligibility for refugee status under \n     section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1157), or for asylum under section 208 of such Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1158), a national of the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea shall not be considered a national of the Republic of \n     Korea.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. I wish to \nspend a little bit of time talking about it, but it is quite \nstraightforward, it is very important, and it is quite timely.\n  This amendment regards North Korean refugees and their seeking of \nrefugee status in the United States. It is a one-paragraph amendment. \nSuccinctly put, this will allow the United States to accept as refugees \nNorth Koreans who are fleeing North Korea and accept them as refugees \ninto the United States. There currently is a legal dispute as to \nwhether they can be accepted as refugees into the United States. The \nreason is because when you are born on the Korean peninsula, under the \nSouth Korea Constitution, they are automatically citizens of South \nKorea. Under our law, if you go to another country, you can go there \nand not seek refugee status here.\n  There are exits of massive proportions taking place out of North \nKorea today. We do not know how many. Some have guessed it is as low as \n30,000 and as high as 300,000 North Koreans currently outside North \nKorea and in China living off the land. South Korea really cannot be \nexpected to take all of these refugees who are fleeing China.\n  It would be an important statement, an important gesture of the \nUnited States to be willing to accept North Koreans who are fleeing as \nrefugees into the United States. We can talk about how many at a later \ntime. This seeks to clarify the legal dispute right now so they can be \naccepted.\n  The reason I say it is important right now is because currently, at a \nBritish consulate in China, there are four North Korean refugees \nseeking refugee status in the United States, and they are being denied \nthat status of coming to the United States.\n  I think it is very important that they be allowed to come here as a \nstatement of our support for freedom and liberty and against the \ntyranny of Kim Jong-il and his regime. The story of the North Korean \npeople is one of the saddest tales on Earth, of hunger and fear and \ndesperation. Isolation, indoctrination, torture, and arbitrary \nexecutions are the means to keep North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and \nhis circle of cronies in power, and they exercise this authority and \nabuse that enormously.\n  Just the other day, the Financial Times reported on the lavish \nlifestyle of the North Korean tyrannical dictator saying that while Kim \nkept a private chef flown in from Japan to prepare his meals:\n\n       His people were forced to consume . . . tree bark, grass \n     and insects to stave off starvation.\n\n  The wretched situation inside North Korea has forced many North \nKoreans to take flight to any country that will accept them. The most \nlogical destination is China, given its porous border and proximity \nwith North Korea. Yet China refuses to acknowledge North Korean \nrefugees, instead calling them ``economic migrants,'' thereby denying \nthem protections normally afforded those fleeing political persecution. \nThis is first and foremost a humanitarian concern for the fate of \nseveral hundred thousand refugees currently hiding in fear from North \nKorea in northeast China.\n  Without forcing China to grant this opening for safe harbor, not only \nwill we be abandoning the North Korean refugees in China but we will be \nabandoning the 22 million people still inside North Korea. If a window \nfor exodus is created, then the North Korean people will want to escape \nKim Jong-il's tyranny. Though it is not yet certain, this exodus will \nlikely expose the fissures in the regime, therefore triggering its \nimplosion.\n  I rise to offer this amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization \nAct, an amendment version of the North Korean refugee bill that I \nrecently introduced along with other Members. Senator Kennedy has been \na key sponsor and supporter of this effort, which will allow North \nKoreans fleeing Kim Jong-il's tyranny to be resettled in the United \nStates.\n  Under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, any person born on \nthe Korean peninsula of a Korean father automatically retains the right \nto citizenship in the Republic of Korea, that is South Korea. That \npresents a simple problem for Koreans wishing to be resettled here in \nthe United States.\n  This past weekend, as I noted, while we were enjoying hot dogs, \nfireworks, and family during the Fourth of July Independence Day, four \nteenaged North Koreans made their way to the consulate of the United \nKingdom in Shanghai, China. These four North Koreans wanting to get \naway from the Stalinist-style repression sought refuge first with the \nBritish consulate, but expressed the desire to be resettled as \npolitical refugees in the United States.\n  According to today's Korea Times, their request to be resettled in \nAmerica was denied by the U.S. Government, reportedly saying that it is \nthe U.S. position not to ``accept North Korean defectors.''\n  These are people simply yearning to be free from a Stalinist, \nrepressive regime, one of the worst human rights situations in the \nworld, one of the worst politically oppressive situations in the world. \nIf this is the case, if they are being denied by our Government, then I \nwonder if the Department of State believes that by doing so it is \nupholding America's responsibility under international law and \nfulfilling our moral obligation to give safe harbor to anyone fleeing \npersecution, and clearly they are.\n\n  I find this report to be appalling. It is sad to me to think that of \nall the United States can do in the world, and do so correctly, it is \nto be humane and uphold the principles of human dignity.\n  On June 5 of this year, I chaired a hearing titled ``Life Inside \nNorth Korea,'' exposing the brutality of Kim Jong-il's regime. In \nJanuary, I attended the inauguration of the new South Korean president, \nPresident No, in which I asked him, a former human rights lawyer and \nadmirer of Abraham Lincoln, to have compassion for his fellow Koreans \nacross the DMZ and help them in their exodus.\n  Last December, I traveled to northeast China along the North Korean-\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nChinese border to see the situation there, to meet with local Chinese \nofficials and get input from NGOs working with North Korean refugees \ntrapped in China.\n  Finally, in June of 2002, Senator Kennedy and I held a hearing on \nNorth Korean refugees and the resettlement question.\n  My amendment would ensure that at least there is the opportunity to \ncome to the United States as refugees and it would give hope to those \nfleeing this repressive regime of North Korea.\n  There is much we could do to prioritize resettlement of North Korean \nrefugees, but this is the first, easiest, and most noncontroversial \nstep. I want to thank Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden for allowing me \nto offer this amendment and give this consideration before the \ncommittee.\n  This is a situation that needs to be addressed now. It will be an \nenormous positive statement to the world and to the Korean refugees if \nthe United States says, yes, we will accept refugees from North Korea. \nIt will be a terrible travesty if we say, no, we will not accept \nrefugees fleeing one of the cruelest, meanest dictators in the world.\n  About a third of the North Korean people right now live on \ninternational food donations, much of which are coming from the United \nStates. It is a regime that is repressive beyond belief. There are \nbooks out now--one I have read, ``Eyes of the Tailless Animals''--about \nhow the regime treats the people so horrifically, worse than animals.\n  We have had pictures of refugees coming out--they drew them. They \ncould not take pictures, but they showed how deplorable the conditions \nare.\n  I ask for a strong vote in this body to pass this amendment allowing \nthe possibility of resettlement of North Korean refugees in the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from \nKansas. Some may suggest this legislation is unnecessary, that any \nlegal right to citizenship that North Koreans may have in South Korea \nwould not necessarily bar them from eligibility for refugee or asylum \nstatus under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  However, with enactment of this legislation, certainty is provided on \nthis issue. And I believe we must do more. It is important that we \ncontinue to press China toward better treatment of North Korean \nrefugees, and I support efforts by the Administration in providing \ngreater emphasis on supporting non-government organizations assisting \nNorth Korean refugees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, very shortly we are going to have a \nrollcall vote. I am hopeful we might take action before that point. So \nI will make just a brief statement of support for the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas. He is a dedicated member of our committee, has \ntraveled to Korea as he mentioned in his statement, as well as other \nparts of Asia that are relevant to this amendment.\n  Some suggest the legislation is not necessary, that the legal right \nto citizenship North Koreans may have in South Korea would not \nnecessarily bar them from eligibility of refugee or asylum status under \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act. However, with enactment of this \nlegislation, certainty is provided on this issue.\n  I believe we must do more. It is imperative that we continue to press \nChina toward better treatment of North Korean refugees and support \nefforts by the administration in providing greater emphasis on \nsupporting nongovernmental organizations assisting North Korean \nrefugees.\n  Both managers of the bill, Senator Biden and I, are prepared to \naccept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 1138.\n  The amendment (No. 1138) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                            Child Tax Credit\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \nissue we are getting ready to vote on at 2. This is an issue we have \nhad a lot of debate on. We have certainly discussed the issue in great \ndetail about how important it is to provide the kind of tax relief to \nall working Americans trying to raise a family. This is an issue, of \ncourse, of the refundability of the child tax credit.\n  I do not know what it is going to take for this body and the other \nbody to send a bill to the President, who has already said he would \nsign this initiative. It is less than 1 percent of the overall tax \npackage that was passed and sent to the President to be signed. The \nfact is multitudes of Americans are going to get tax relief in the next \ncouple of weeks and 12 million children in this country are going to be \nleft out. These are hard-working American families who are playing by \nthe rules. They do not even qualify for this unless they have a working \nincome and they have children.\n  This is a special opportunity we have. If one individual in the House \nof Representatives can hold up providing relief to 12 million children, \n200,000 military families, not to mention well over 50 percent of the \npopulation of my State, there is no reason we should be here to begin \nwith.\n  I encourage my colleagues, let's move to proceed to the bill to \nprovide the refundability of the child credit to all working families \nand those who are working desperately to provide for their children and \nour great Nation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote to table the motion to proceed \nto the consideration of S. 1162, the Child Tax Credit bill. However, I \nam only voting in favor of the motion to table in order to give the \nconference sufficient time to create a final bill so that millions of \nAmerican families earning between $10,500 and about $25,000 will \nreceive tax relief through the acceleration of the refundable child tax \ncredit.\n  Accelerating the refundability is especially important for military \nfamilies. The Department of Defense estimates that there are \napproximately 192,000 families whose income is between $10,500 and \nabout $25,000. I believe that it is highly unconscionable that many of \nthem will not receive child tax credit relief this year unless we pass \na child tax credit bill this summer.\n  Therefore, I urge the conference to complete a final bill in a timely \nmanner. Otherwise, if there is another motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of this legislation, I will vote in favor of the motion \nto proceed.\n\n\n          Vote on Motion to table motion to proceed to S. 1162\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, \nthere will be a vote on the motion to table the motion to proceed.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, a member of our committee, is prepared to offer an \namendment, and we are eager to have that debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1141\n\n  Mrs. Boxer. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Snowe, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1141.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the remainder of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the application of certain restrictive \neligibility requirements to foreign nongovernmental organizations with \n  respect to the provision of assistance under part I of the Foreign \n                        Assistance Act of 1961)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 815. GLOBAL DEMOCRACY PROMOTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is a fundamental principle of American medical \n     ethics and practice that health care providers should, at all \n     times, deal honestly and openly with patients. Any attempt to \n     subvert the private and sensitive physician-patient \n     relationship would be intolerable in the United States and is \n     an unjustifiable intrusion into the practices of health care \n     providers when attempted in other countries.\n       (2) Freedom of speech is a fundamental American value. The \n     ability to exercise the right to free speech, which includes \n     the ``right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the government for a redress of grievances'' is \n     essential to a thriving democracy and is protected under the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (3) The promotion of democracy is a principal goal of \n     United States foreign policy and critical to achieving \n     sustainable development. It is enhanced through the \n     encouragement of democratic institutions and the promotion of \n     an independent and politically active civil society in \n     developing countries.\n       (4) Limiting eligibility for United States development and \n     humanitarian assistance upon the willingness of a foreign \n     nongovernmental organization to forgo its right to use its \n     own funds to address, within the democratic process, a \n     particular issue affecting the citizens of its own country \n     directly undermines a key goal of United States foreign \n     policy and would violate the United States Constitution if \n     applied to United States-based organizations.\n       (5) Similarly, limiting the eligibility for United States \n     assistance on a foreign nongovernmental organization's \n     willingness to forgo its right to provide, with its own \n     funds, medical services that are legal in its own country and \n     would be legal if provided in the United States constitutes \n     unjustifiable interference with the ability of independent \n     organizations to serve the critical health needs of their \n     fellow citizens and demonstrates a disregard and disrespect \n     for the laws of sovereign nations as well as for the laws of \n     the United States.\n       (b) Assistance for Foreign Nongovernmental Organizations \n     Under Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, in determining eligibility for assistance authorized \n     under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government funds for advocacy and \n     lobbying activities other than those that apply to United \n     States nongovernmental organizations receiving assistance \n     under part I of such Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the reason I was happy to have the clerk \nread the first three findings in this amendment is that I think these \nwords really speak to what the United States is all about, which is \nfree speech, the ability for people to be told the truth, and the \nability of medical professionals not to be gagged from telling the \ntruth.\n  Most unfortunately, what is happening right now, as a result of this \nadministration's policy known as the Mexico City policy, foreign \nnongovernmental organizations--in other words, nonprofit \norganizations--that received USAID family planning funding are \nrestricted in how they can help their patients.\n  Who are these patients? I will go into this later in detail. But they \nare the poorest of the poorest women in the world. What has happened, I \nwould say because of politics in this country, is we have a very \nunfortunate worldwide policy now that says to the private, nonprofit \norganizations that are helping the poorest of the poor people--mostly \nwomen--they cannot use their own money to advocate for changes in the \nabortion laws of their own country.\n  So if they believe the abortion laws in their own country are, for \nexample, killing women because they are saying there can be no abortion \never, even to save the life of a woman, they cannot use their own funds \nto advocate for change. Or if they believe the woman who comes before \nthem has decided, of her own free will and her own conscience and with \nher own religious guidance and with her own family guidance, that she \nwould like to have a legal abortion, these foreign, nonprofit \norganizations may not use their own money to help that woman. Not only \nthat--this is, to me, the worst of it all--they may not use their own \nmoney to provide full and accurate medical information about what \noptions a woman has.\n  It is hard for me to understand that in a country as free as ours, in \na country as great as ours, we would have a policy which we dare not do \nin our own country because it would be clearly unconstitutional. A \ndomestic gag rule is clearly unconstitutional. Why would we put such a \npolicy forward and tell these little nonprofit organizations, that are \nstruggling to meet the needs of the poorest of the poor, they would \njeopardize their USAID funding if they absolutely do nothing more than \neven tell a patient what her legal options are, what her safe options \nare?\n  This is known as the Mexico City policy because it came out of a \nconference in Mexico City a very long time ago. This policy ended with \nPresident Clinton in 1992, when he said he would absolutely uphold the \nlaw that we had before this global gag rule which said you cannot use \nFederal money in any way to promote abortion--that was the law, and he \ndidn't disturb that--but certainly a group could use its own money.\n  What happened is for 8 years we did not have this regressive policy \nthat turns the clock back on women's rights, and yet when President \nBush came in, it was one of the first things he did, to reinstate this \nMexico City policy.\n  I am very proud that cosponsoring my amendment, which would overturn \nthis policy, are Senator Chafee and Senator Snowe. I am very proud to \nhave them as Republican lead cosponsors. I am also very proud to have \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Murray as cosponsors. I am very happy to \nsay the ranking member of the committee has told me I may add his name \nand he will be speaking in behalf of this amendment.\n\n  Clearly, we have an opportunity to do the right thing today. We have \ndone it before. We have overturned this before. We have taken a stand \nbefore. I hope we will do it again.\n  Again, I wish to say what we are talking about here because there is \nalways confusion. This has nothing to do with Federal funds. Federal \nfunds may not be used in any way related to abortion. This only has to \ndo with the private funds of these little nonprofits that are trying to \nhelp women.\n  What has been the impact of this gag rule? You may say, Senator \nBoxer, that is very interesting, but what is really happening on the \nground?\n  Here is what is happening on the ground. With the gag rule in place,\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nthese organizations face two choices: They can either refuse U.S. \nassistance or they can limit their own services. You know how hard that \nmust be for these struggling organizations in these very poor nations.\n  Madam President, you have seen the world in your capacity as head of \nthe Red Cross. You know some of these places are struggling. You know \nvery much of it is the women who struggle the most, who are the most \npoor, who have the most health needs. We are seeing organizations \nsaying: OK, I can't take the money. I can't take USAID funding because \nI cannot limit my ability to help my patients.\n  I am going to show you a case later that is very emotional and very \ndisturbing as one example of a group that turned back this funding, and \nI will tell you why.\n  Imagine the Hobson's choice they face. Here they are, struggling, yet \nif they take this money, they can literally not tell their patients the \ntruth. They are literally barred from telling their patients what is \nthe most safe procedure for you, what are your options. They may not \ntell the patient that.\n  What is happening on the ground--and we will prove it with cases \nbefore you--we say women and families are suffering increased misery \nand even death. They are suffering this because there are clinics that \nare shutting down because they cannot take the money, and there are \nclinics that are being gagged, they cannot tell the truth.\n  Why is family planning assistance important? This is not just about \nabortion. These are clinics that help women plan their families. We \nknow family planning increases child survival rates. It improves \nmaternal health. It prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS. We have the \nPresident of the United States--and it is wonderful that he has decided \nto visit Africa. I have to say, while he talks about how much he wants \nto help HIV/AIDS, and I believe he does, he needs to understand, and \nperhaps he doesn't get the fact, if these clinics close down, we are \ngoing to see the spread of HIV/AIDS, we are going to see the spread of \nother infectious diseases.\n  International family planning funding helps save lives. On the one \nhand, to say I am here in Africa to help and on the other hand to have \nimposed a gag rule on doctors and nurses and clinicians so they cannot \ntell poor women the truth about their options or they cannot work to \nchange the regressive laws of their country--for example, to say if a \nchild is raped, if a child is the victim of incest, that child ought to \nbe able to get a safe, legal abortion--these clinics cannot even do \nthis under this global gag rule.\n  As a result of USAID funding, more than 50 million couples in the \ndeveloping world use family planning. In the last 30 years, the \npercentage of couples using family planning has risen fivefold. This is \nsomething to celebrate. We know fewer than 10 percent of couples used \ncontraception in the 1960s. We are talking about foreign countries that \nwe helped. Now 50 percent of the couples use contraception. So the word \nis getting through. But the need for family planning assistance \ncontinues because of the growth of population.\n  Why on Earth are we setting in place a vehicle, this global gag rule, \nwhich will deprive people of their health care, will deprive women of \nknowing what their options are? We don't know exactly how many \norganizations have refused funding because of this gag rule, and we \ncannot measure exactly how many abortions would have been prevented by \nfamily planning. But we know clearly whenever you cut back in family \nplanning services, you see an increase in abortions. We know 78,000 \nwomen throughout the world die each year. I want us to think about what \nthat means. Seventy-eight thousand women throughout the world die each \nyear as a result of unsafe abortions. At least one-fourth of those \nunsafe abortions in the world are girls age 15 to 19.\n\n  When we have a policy that results in clinics shutting down, we have \na policy that results in illegal abortions because if they take the \nmoney, they can't tell a young girl the truth of what her options are. \nShe may run to a back alley in desperation, and she may well die.\n  Seventy-eight thousand women throughout the world die each year from \nunsafe abortions. That is not a pro-life policy. I am sorry. That is an \nanti-life policy to put women at risk.\n  Seventy-eight thousand women die each year. That is a horrific \nstatistic. That is happening because women cannot avail themselves of \nthe family planning services they need.\n  What does our amendment do? What does the Boxer-Chafee-Snowe-\nMikulski-Murray-Biden amendment do? First, it says foreign \nnongovernmental organizations cannot be denied funding based on the \nmedical services they provide with their own funds, including \ncounseling and referral services. Withholding medical information, as I \nhave said before, to patients who need it is an intolerable situation. \nIt would be intolerable in this country. We know, because it was tried \nin this country 20 years ago. There was absolutely an uproar. Doctors \nwould say, excuse me, are you putting a gag over my mouth? Are you \nsaying I cannot tell my patients what their legal options are? The \nanswer came back: This cannot be sustained in a country that believes \nin freedom of speech. So what we couldn't do here we are doing there.\n  We say there shall be no gag rule. That is the first part of our \namendment.\n  The second part says in addition to being able to tell the patients \nthe truth about their options, an organization should be able to lobby \nin any way it wants as long as it doesn't use USAID funds.\n  We have a win-win situation in this amendment. Doctors and nurses and \nfolks who work in these nongovernmental organizations and these small \nnonprofits are going to be able to tell the truth to their patients. \nHere are your options. Treat their patients like adults. I think it is \nessential to treat a woman like an adult. This is your predicament. \nThese are the things you can do. You can have a child. You need to \nthink about that. You could keep the child. You can give the child up \nfor adoption. That is an option. You can end this pregnancy, if you end \nit early without complication. But it is your choice. I think women \nshould be treated as adults.\n  Then if these organizations see that women are dying from illegal \nabortions because this country, let us say, outlawed legal abortions, \nthey can lobby for this with their own funds. What we are doing is \nrestoring democracy to the USAID program.\n  Frankly, I can't believe this regressive policy is even here in the \n21st century. It is killing women. This is not something that is \npreventing abortions. Its impact is that women will seek illegal \nabortions. It is what happened in this country. Hundreds of women in \nthis country died every year because they could not get access to safe, \nlegal abortions until Roe v. Wade. Then we said to women, this is a \nlegal option. It is your call. It is up to you at the early stages of \nthe pregnancy. It is really a very straightforward and fair law.\n\n  What we are saying to women abroad now is if you go to a doctor, you \nshould be able to hear your options. If your organization wants to be \nable to lobby on your behalf for better laws to protect your life, they \nought to be able to do that--not with Federal funds, not with USAID \nfunds, but with your own funds.\n  The global rule is undemocratic. It is a miserable impediment to poor \nwomen. It would be unconstitutional if imposed on our own citizens. It \nis bad foreign policy. I believe our bipartisan amendment ends it and \ndoes it in a very good way--in a way everybody can be proud of.\n  I want to tell you a story and give an example that occurred in \nNepal.\n  I am so proud to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee at this \ntime. I am the only woman, which is a lonely thing. Madam President, \nyou ought to think about coming on with me. It is a great honor and \nprivilege.\n  I want to say that our chairman, Chairman Lugar, could not be a more \nfair chairman, could not be a more hard-working chairman, and could not \nhave more respect on both sides of the aisle. It is an honor to be on \nthat committee in the Senate. It is an honor to be serving with the \nranking member, Joe Biden. I think our colleagues are very bipartisan. \nIt is a tough time now in our country for bipartisanship. We really \nwork together on that committee.\n  At the time we were in the majority, we had a series of hearings on \nthis\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nglobal gag rule to see what was happening on the ground.\n  In 2001, I chaired a subcommittee hearing where we had a small \nnonprofit, nongovernmental organization from Nepal. They were faced \nwith this global gag rule. They had to make that Hobson's choice: Do \nthey take the money and then give up their right to lobby in behalf of \ntheir patients or do they turn back the money? This little organization \nturned back the money. The reason they did it was not some abstract \ntheory but a specific case. They cited how their organization was able \nto advocate on behalf of the 13-year-old girl whose name was Min Min.\n  This is a story I want to share with my colleagues. How can we turn \nour backs on this child and other children like her? How we can turn \nour backs on the organizations that are out there is beyond my \ncomprehension to understand.\n  Min Min was raped by a relative. I want to show you her face. She was \n13. Her family forced her to have an illegal abortion after the rape. \nAs a result of illegal abortion, she was arrested and she was taken to \na central jail in Nepal. In 2001, Nepal put the victim in jail--not the \nrelative who raped her. Look at this child. The girl's relatives were \nnot punished. But Min Min was sentenced to 20 years in jail, and she \nwas abandoned by her family.\n  In your life, could you even imagine such a thing? A 13-year-old girl \njailed for her life after she was raped. That was her crime.\n  This particular NGO in Nepal had refused to take USAID money because \nthey wanted to advocate to change the laws in Nepal.\n  You would think we would be on their side. You would think we would \nbe horrified that 13-year-old girls can go to jail for 20 years because \nthey are the victims of rape by a relative. You would think we would \nsay to this nongovernmental organization: We want to help you. But, no, \nunder this global gag rule put into place by this administration this \nlittle girl was left that way, without the help of USAID, without the \nfunding of USAID.\n  This NGO, which turned back the money, went to bat for her and to \nchange the law. After 2 years in prison, this child--2 years in prison, \nfrom age 13 to age 15, when a child should be home with her family, \ngetting the guidance and love of her family--after sitting in jail \nafter 2 years, finally, the laws were changed. Because the NGO, the \nnongovernmental organization, refused to take the money--because they \nknew they must work to change laws--they were free to go and do it, and \nthey got the law changed and she was released after 2 years in jail--2 \nyears in jail for being a victim of a sexual assault by a relative.\n  Now, had this NGO taken the money of USAID, they would not have been \nable to advocate on behalf of this child. We had the leader of this \norganization come before the Foreign Relations Committee, and this is \nwhat he said: ``How can we turn our back on women who die or are \ninjured daily due to unsafe abortion?'' How can we stop organizations \nfrom changing the laws?\n  The happy ending to this terrible tale is that the NGO worked with \nthe government and last year the law was changed. There will no longer \nbe lifetime jail sentences when these young girls are raped. That is \nthe good news.\n  Let me give you the really terrible news. This NGO has been forced to \nclose clinics in Nepal because of the loss of their USAID money. Now, \ncan anyone stand up here--and I would ask someone. We have a Senator in \nthe Chamber who I know opposes this and may get up and defend what we \nare doing. But it is pretty clear, my friends. You can put any fancy \nlanguage and ideology on it. I am not ideological. I just do not want \nto kill women. I just do not want to have little girls age 13 sitting \nin prison because they are raped. I just do not want to tie the hands \nof organizations to rescue girls such as this, to change the laws of \ntheir country that wind up killing women, harming women, and making \nthem sit in jail when they are raped.\n  If you can explain why that is a good law, that is your choice, and I \nrespect that and all, but I cannot understand how we would, in this \n21st century, tie the hands of small nonprofit groups that want to help \ngirls and women such as this.\n  In Zambia, the Family Life Movement of Zambia, a faith-based, \nantiabortion organization, has been unable to expand programs because \nthe global gag rule has disqualified Planned Parenthood Association of \nZambia, a partner organization. The FLMZ promotes abstinence among \nyoung people in Zambia and it does not provide contraceptives but they \nare in partnership with Planned Parenthood. They are a faith-based \nantiabortion organization.\n  I told you, I am not ideological on this point. They are in a \npartnership with Planned Parenthood. This group that believes in \nabstinence, they cannot get the funding from USAID. Now, you explain to \nme how that works.\n  What this organization does is, if they would come across a young \nperson or young people who are sexually active, they would be referred \nto this Planned Parenthood group or they could receive information \nabout contraception. But the global gag rule has forced Planned \nParenthood of Zambia to close three of its nine rural outreach programs \nand costs them more than $100,000 worth of contraceptives.\n\n  So here you see it. You see on the ground what is happening to \norganizations that are trying to help the most desperate women and \ngirls.\n  The Family Planning Association of Kenya, which does not provide \nabortion, has had to cut its outreach staff in half, close three \nclinics that served 56,000 clients in traditionally underserved \ncommunities, and they have had to raise their fees at their remaining \nclinics because they would not take the money because they did not want \nto be gagged.\n  One of the clinics that closed housed a unique well-baby center that \nprovided comprehensive infant and postpartum care, making it easier for \nwomen to receive critical followup care. The baby center is now closed.\n  What is going on? I think there is a misunderstanding in this \nadministration because they are shutting down well-baby clinics. They \nare shutting down well-baby clinics. They are shutting down \norganizations that distribute contraception. They are shutting down \norganizations that are fighting for laws that will save women's lives.\n  This is a terrible, terrible regulation. It is terrible for the \nwomen. It is terrible for the doctors there. It is terrible for the \nnurses there. It is terrible for the babies there.\n  I think it is a terrible message from our country that we are so \nideological over here that we will not let nongovernmental \norganizations that are trying to help women and families do their work \nbecause of some dispute over abortion in this country. I have some \nwords about that: Get over that dispute. That dispute will be with us \nfor a long time. We are going to have to resolve it in our way. But why \nmake women in foreign countries pay the price, children in foreign \ncountries pay the price, little girls such as Min Min pay the price \nbecause we have an argument over here over whether a woman should have \nthe right to choose?\n  We are doing things to these organizations we cannot do in this \ncountry because it is a violation of the Constitution; it is a \nviolation of freedom of speech. We are going around the world trying to \nbring democracy to countries.\n  We have soldiers dying for freedom of speech in Iraq right now--every \nsingle day. I have another 14 Californians who are dead since the war \n``ended.'' Why are they there? They are fighting for freedom and \ndemocracy and freedom of speech for the Iraqi people.\n  But we have a policy that takes away freedom of speech from folks who \nwant to help people get health care. It is a very bizarre twist in our \ncountry's history, and one that, believe me, is not lost on other \nnations.\n  Recently, the Health Minister of Kenya has suggested that abortion \nshould be made legal as a way to confront the devastation that unsafe \nabortion has on the women in that country.\n  Well, congratulations to the Health Minister of Kenya for \nunderstanding something that our Supreme Court figured out a long time \nago: that abortion should be legal and women should not be made into \ncriminals, nor should doctors who help them as long as that abortion is \nperformed in the early stages of the pregnancy. That is all that Roe \nsays in this country.\n  The Health Minister in Kenya is looking at the devastation of illegal \nabortion. He is looking at the devastation of back-alley abortion, just \nas our\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\npeople looked at that in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s and came to the \nconclusion that we ought to legalize this and keep the Government out \nof it and let the people decide such an intensely personal, private, \ndifficult, moral, religious issue.\n  He has come to the conclusion that people know better, not the \ngovernment, that there should not be a rule that you must be forced in \nany way on this issue--either to not have an abortion or to have an \nabortion--and that maybe his people should be trusted. The \norganizations that have the gag rule in Kenya cannot speak out, when \nthey know what they see and they want to help reduce maternal mortality \nand morbidity.\n\n  I am giving you these examples of various countries because I want my \ncolleagues to understand this is not about ideology. This is about \npracticality. This is about children like this. This is about women. \nThis is about families. This is about babies. This is about people \ngetting help.\n  The Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, the largest reproductive \nprovider in that country, operates 18 clinics, 24 youth service \ncenters, 671 community-based reproductive health care sites, and \nhundreds of other sites for health care. Still fewer than 20 percent of \nEthiopians live within a 2-hour walk of any health provider.\n  We are talking about countries where people can't jump in a car and \ndrive an hour to get health care. They literally have to walk to their \nhealth care. So if even a few of the clinics have to close down because \nof lack of funding, women are consigned to trouble. They are going to \nhave to go two blocks around the corner, down the street, behind a \nhouse and have an illegal abortion and maybe face death or infertility.\n  A half a million dollars has been turned away by this organization, \nthe Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, because they will not \nabide by being gagged. They will not say to their doctors: You can't \ntell women the truth. They will not say to the nurses: You can't tell \nwomen the truth. They will not say to their people: You can't lobby \nyour own government for changes in laws that will help women.\n  So what has happened? They have had to cut off the supply of \ncontraception. It is a very sad day. Since abortion is illegal in \nEthiopia, imagine what is going to happen if people can't have \ncontraception?\n  You want the world to be perfect. I well remember this discussion \nwhen my children were younger. You want your children to listen to you. \nYou want to make sure that every child is a wanted child. You want to \nmake sure that there is abstinence, yes. But it might not happen. And \nif it doesn't happen that way, the way you want it to happen, to what \nare we consigning our young people?\n  In the case of these foreign governments, we are looking at a child \nin jail, and this one was raped by a family member. What is the policy \nof our country to be that we are going to tell these young women we are \nnot on their side?\n  I cannot fathom it. A girl put in jail, served for 2 years because \nshe was raped by a relative, and the nonprofit foreign organization \nthat helped her was punished by America because they wanted to help \nher, because they wanted to get the laws changed, because they wanted \nto get her out of jail? What is wrong with us? How can we proudly stand \nby this gag rule? We should not. We should repeal it today.\n  As I say, we have bipartisan sponsorship on this bill and we have a \nchance to overturn it. The President has threatened to veto the bill if \nwe overturn this global gag rule. Can you imagine, the President has \nsaid he will veto the bill if we reverse this rule, if we want to help \nchildren like Min Min. I want to ask the President: Do you think it is \nright to put a little girl in prison because she was raped by her \nfamily? I am sure he would say: Of course not. It is awful.\n  Then I would ask him: Do you think it is a good thing for people in \nthat country to come to this little girl's rescue and help her? I am \nsure he would say: Of course.\n\n  My next question would be: Then why are you shutting off the funds to \nthe nonprofit organizations that want to help her cause? He would \nprobably say: Let me get back to you.\n  Frankly, I don't see how he could answer that without taking a long \ntime to twist it around. This isn't about ideology. This is about real \npeople. This is about the poorest children, the poorest women, the \npoorest families. This is about imposing a gag rule, which we are not \nallowed to do in this country because we have a Constitution, on other \npeople. Why? I guess because we can. It is wrong.\n  It is wrong that the largest family planning organization in \nEthiopia--God knows they have enough trouble there; they have droughts \nand everything else--loses $500,000 because they won't be gagged. And \nas a result, people cannot get contraception. And as a result, women \nare going to have to have illegal abortions because abortion is illegal \nin that country.\n  We know 78,000 women every year die across the world from illegal \nabortion. We are the United States of America. We are a good country. \nWe are a kind country. We are a generous country. We are a great \ncountry. Why would we do this to the poorest of the poor?\n  In the case of Ethiopia, 229,000 men and 300,000 women in urban areas \nare not getting served by this organization because there is some \nideological problem that we have here in this country that we should \nnot export elsewhere.\n  I am coming to the end of my examples. I have one more about Peru. \nThere is a program in Peru that is designed to engage local women from \npoor communities across the country in identifying the most pressing \nreproductive health needs. This organization, Manuela Ramos, convenes \nthe discussions and then works with the Ministry of Health to develop \nspecific responses to those needs. In many communities, women identify \nunsafe abortion as their most pressing problem. The gag rule prohibits \nthis organization from even engaging in discussions about ways to \nreduce illegal, unsafe abortion.\n  I am mortified that a decision by this administration is gagging not \nonly the people who receive USAID funds but even the people who go \nthere are not allowed to discuss together how to make life better for \nthe women of Peru, the women of the world.\n  I am taking a lot of time on this today because I am pleading with my \ncolleagues to stand up and be counted. If it is true that you are not \ngoing to vote for this because the President said he will veto the \nbill, I say: Let's go for it. Maybe he will change his mind. I am happy \nto sit down and tell him about Min Min, this 13-year-old girl. I am \nhappy to give him the statistics. I will be glad to talk to him about \nthe 78,000 women dying every single year from illegal abortions. I \nbelieve I could maybe change his mind.\n  Maybe he will change his mind--let's give it a chance--if he sees a \nstrong bipartisan vote.\n  I want to show you a couple of other charts and then I will be \nfinished, until I hear the other side and I will come back to debate.\n  This is an editorial that appeared in the Washington Post when this \nglobal gag rule was put into place. It is headlined ``Divisive on \nAbortion.''\n\n       Making an organization censor its views as a condition of \n     receiving government money would be unconstitutional on free-\n     speech grounds in this country; it should have no place in \n     U.S. foreign policy. Moreover, requiring doctors to withhold \n     information from patients violates the common conception of \n     medical ethics. There will be . . . more circulation of the \n     AIDS virus, more poverty-entrenching high birthrates and more \n     unwanted pregnancies--meaning more abortions.\n\n  I will take a minute to talk about this because this really sums up \nwhat I have been saying in a very neat little package.\n\n       Making an organization censor its views as a condition of \n     receiving government money would be unconstitutional on free \n     speech grounds in this country.\n\n  Well, you know that is true. We don't do that. We don't tell every \ngroup in this country that receives Federal funds they cannot talk \nabout anything, because this is America, the land of the free and the \nhome of the brave. Free speech is the basis of our country. It is what \nour soldiers are dying for in Iraq. So we don't tell people in this \ncountry that if you get Federal funds, if you get Social Security, you \ncannot talk about X, Y, or Z. If you get funds through Medicare, you \ncannot talk about A, B, or C. Try that on the elderly population in \nthis country. You will be out\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nof office so fast you won't know what hit you. Face it, that is what we \nare doing here.\n  They say that kind of condition on receiving money should have no \nplace in U.S. foreign policy. I agree with that. Here we are, a bastion \nof freedom and democracy and free speech, going around the world \ntelling people about that on the one hand and our soldiers are putting \ntheir lives on the line. Yet in this program, we are telling little \ncharitable, nonprofit health care centers they cannot tell their \npatients the truth. Not only that, if they see a law that is killing \ntheir patients, they cannot work to change it. What a shame on our \ncountry. They say it should have no place in foreign policy. That is \nexactly right. That should have no place in foreign policy.\n\n       Requiring doctors to withhold information from patients \n     violates the common conception of medical ethics.\n\n  How true is that? When our doctors take the Hippocratic oath, they \nsay they will do no harm, they will do everything to save the life of \ntheir patients and give them the best of health care. Imagine going to \nyour doctor and you have a terrible illness and the doctor knows four \noptions for you and he cannot talk about two of them because the \nGovernment said he could not. So you hear about two options but not the \nother two. When you found out that you didn't get the whole story, and \nsomething happened to you, your family would be in the courthouse \ndoor--and rightly so--saying: How could my doctor not have told my dad \nthat this particular type of surgery would have cured his cancer?\n  The fact is, we are gagging doctors and health care practitioners in \nforeign countries from telling patients the truth. Then this editorial \nsays:\n\n       There will be . . . more circulation of the AIDS virus, \n     more poverty-entrenching high birthrates and more unwanted \n     pregnancies--meaning more abortions.\n\n  We have a policy in our country called the global gag rule which I, \nSenator Chafee, Senator Snowe, Senator Mikulski, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Biden are trying to overturn. We hope to get a lot of you with \nus. We are trying to overturn a policy that is causing illegal, unsafe \nabortions to take place because, clearly, if you tell a nonprofit \norganization they cannot tell you the truth, you are going to be \ndesperate.\n  Seventy-eight thousand women a year die. So you are also going to see \nmore circulation of the AIDS virus. Why? Because a lot of these clinics \nthat are closing down--and it is not just about abortion; it is about \nfamily planning, contraception, and learning how to protect yourself \nfrom the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. And there \nare going to be ``poverty-entrenching high birthrates.''\n  Why would this be a policy of the United States of America? It is \nhurting people, not helping them. It is gagging people, not giving them \nfree speech. It is hurting America's reputation in the world. It turns \nthe clock back on progress.\n  Let me say very clearly as I close my opening statement that the \nWashington Post said:\n\n       Around the world, more than a half-million die from \n     pregnancy-related causes annually. A real pro-life policy \n     would focus on reducing that death toll by providing more \n     contraception and safer abortions.\n\n  That is it in a nutshell. It is not like we are dealing in mysteries. \nWe know certain truths. We know that if women have access to good \nhealth advice, they will avoid unwanted pregnancies. We know that if \nthey have access to good health advice, they will have healthy babies \nand they will be healthy. We know all those things. And we know for \nthat to happen, women have to be educated on their options. We know \nthat.\n  What else do we know? We know that some countries do terrible things. \nI want to show you again the picture of Min Min, who is 13 years old. \nShe is in prison because a family member raped her. The organization \nthat tried to help her, in order to do that, had to hand back their \nUSAID funding because President Bush said they could not help her. He \nput the global gag rule in place. He said nobody can help her. That is \nwhat it says. If I talked to him one on one, I know he would be shocked \nat this story, but the fact is that this policy of a global gag rule \nmade it impossible for the organization to help her until they gave \nback their USAID funding. What a shame on our country--to be associated \nwith such an outcome.\n  I want to be proud. This is a country I love. I want to be seen as \nhelping, as spreading democracy and freedom of speech and ideas.\n  So for all those reasons, I hope we will have a good vote that will \nget rid of this global gag rule. I don't care if there are veto \nthreats. We have to stand up for something here. This is the Senate of \nthe United States of America. This is the year 2003. Little girls such \nas this should not have to suffer because we have a policy that \npunishes folks who want to help her.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I hope we can continue this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from California \nhas presented her case, as always, with eloquence. Let me ask the \ndistinguished Senator, I understand Senator Brownback may wish to speak \non this issue, I want to speak for a short while on the issue, and the \nSenator from California perhaps wants some time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, Senator Reid \nwants to be here, and I believe Senator Biden. I can get back to the \nSenator from Indiana in short order with how much time we will need.\n  Mr. LUGAR. What I would like to propose is we plan to vote at 5 \no'clock and have 40 minutes more debate evenly divided, 20 minutes to a \nside. That would be my hope.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would think that will work, if I can just have a moment \nto get back to the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Very well. I will proceed, and then if the Senator can \ninform me, that will be helpful.\n  Mr. President, when the Mexico City policy, which is our discussion \ntoday, was restored by President Bush in 2001 when he came into office, \nhe stated once again the conviction that the U.S. taxpayer funds should \nnot be used to pay for abortions or for the advocacy, for those who \nactively promote abortions as a means of family planning.\n  The fact that this President has taken this position, as have other \nPresidents before him, does not lessen his commitment or our commitment \nto strong international family planning programs. Indeed, President \nBush's fiscal year 2004 budget requests $425 million for population \nassistance, the same funding level appropriated during fiscal year \n2001, President Clinton's final year in office.\n  President Bush has confirmed his commitment to maintaining these \nfunding levels for population assistance because he knows one of the \nbest ways to prevent abortion is by providing voluntary family planning \nservices. That is a policy of our Government now. It is a policy that \nour President advocates for the future.\n  We are all aware of the numerous attempts to reach compromise \nlanguage that would satisfy all sides on this very important issue but \nno acceptable accommodation has been found to date. Perhaps in \nrecognition of this state of affairs, the President has advised that \nany legislation that seeks to override the Mexico City language will be \nvetoed.\n  Let me make clear that the restrictions in the Mexico City policy do \nnot prevent organizations from performing abortions if the life of the \nmother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or \nabortions following rape or incest. Similarly, health care facilities \nmay treat injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions.\n  I wish to make that point because the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has told the story, and it is a tragic one, of a 13-year-old \ngirl. I simply want to clear up the point that the Mexico City policy \nhas not prevented organizations from performing abortions if the life \nof the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, or \nabortions following rape or incest.\n  The issue comes in whether taxpayer funds of the United States should \nbe utilized by organizations in the internal debates within countries. \nThat clearly is an issue upon which Senators will differ, but it is a \ndifferent issue than the issue of whether, in fact, funds might have \nbeen utilized in this particular tragedy.\n\n  There are many foreign nongovernmental organizations through which\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nUSAID can provide and does provide family planning information and \nservices to people in developing countries. The President has decided \nthat assistance for family planning will be provided to those foreign \ngrantees whose family planning programs are consistent with the values \nand the principles of his administration. And every President since \n1984 has exercised his right in that regard.\n  I wish to make clear, and the Senator from California is correct in \nthis assumption, the administration's statement of policy with regard \nto legislation that we now are engaged in states with regard to the \namendment on Mexico City policy:\n\n       The administration would strongly oppose any amendment that \n     would overturn the administration's family planning policy, \n     commonly known as the Mexico City policy, and allow U.S. \n     taxpayer funds to go to international organizations which \n     perform abortions and engage in abortion advocacy. The \n     President would veto the bill if it were presented to him \n     with such a provision.\n\n  Mr. President, as manager of this bill, I have to take that statement \nseriously, as does every Senator. The distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has indicated perhaps the President might be persuaded to \nchange his mind, and perhaps that is the case. But this President has \nbeen very clear and I think the directives with regard to policy on \nthis legislation are very clear in the language I have just read.\n  I appeal to Senators that there are so many important provisions in \nthis legislation with regard to our national security, the importance \nof our diplomacy, humanitarian concerns to international organizations, \nthe dues that are paid--a whole host of issues. I think Senators are \naware of that. I hope we will not jeopardize all of this progress. I \nhope we will continue to have honest debate on the Mexico City policy \nin other fora, and there are opportunities for Senators, simply with \nbills that are directed to this issue, as opposed to amendments added \nto legislation in which we have put together the State Department \nauthorization, the foreign assistance authorization, the Millennium \nChallenge Account, and a number of issues which are very important to \nthe future of our country.\n  I will oppose the amendment. I ask other Senators to do so for the \nreasons I have given.\n  If I may engage in colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, is there disposition that we may be able to proceed to an \nagreement on time for a vote?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have spoken with the Senator's staff, and we have made \na suggestion. They apparently are working on finding out if it is \nacceptable. I will, once there is a quorum call in place, explain the \ndetails.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just a few years ago I traveled to Nepal, a \ncountry with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, \ncertainly in Asia. More than 500 out of every 100,000 women in Nepal \ndie from pregnancy-related complications compared to 7 out of every \n100,000 women in the United States. Again, 500 women in Nepal die from \npregnancy-related complications compared to 7 in the United States.\n  Nepal is not the only place where women are at such high risk. Every \nminute of every day at least one woman somewhere in the world dies from \ncauses related to pregnancy in childbirth. Every minute of every day a \nwoman dies from causes related to pregnancy. That is 600,000 women \nevery year who die from causes related to pregnancy. I repeat for the \nthird time, 600,000 women every year.\n  Our country offers hope to women around the world. Our support for \ninternational family planning programs spells the difference between \nlife or death for women in developing countries. And family planning \nefforts prevent unintended pregnancies, save the lives of thousands of \nwomen and infants every year. Family planning also helps prevent the \nspread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n  Last summer, I traveled to South Africa: Kenya, Nigeria, and \nBotswana. The subject of AIDS and the terrible damage it has done to \nthe African people became the focus of this trip. We did not want it to \nbe the focus of the trip, but it became the focus of the trip. It \noverwhelmed everything that we talked about and saw. Africa has been \noverwhelmed by the AIDS epidemic. More than 20 million Africans have \ndied from AIDS and more than 5,000 continue to die each day from this \ndisease. It is 7 days a week. It does not matter if it is Thanksgiving, \nChristmas, or whatever holidays they might have. There are no \nvacations, no holidays. Seven days a week, every week of the year, more \nthan 5,000 Africans die, and that number is going up, not down. They \ndie from this disease we call AIDS.\n  In seven southern African countries, 20 percent or more of the adult \npopulation is infected with the HIV virus. In Botswana--and I would \nmention about Botswana, it is a democracy. It is a country that is \nbased on the rule of law. It is really a fine country with great \nleaders. We stayed for a few days in Botswana. The infection rate is \nabout 40 percent; that is, 4 out of every 10 people who live in \nBotswana are infected with the HIV virus. In other African countries, \nthe HIV infection rates are higher among women than men.\n  As a result, family planning providers are the best source of HIV \nprevention information and services. But now, the Mexico City policy \nthreatens our efforts to save the lives of women in Nepal, on the \ncontinent of Africa, and all over the world. President Bush reimposed \nthe gag rule because he wants to decrease the number of abortions \nabroad. That is a worthy goal, but restricting funds to organizations \nthat provide a wide range of safe and effective family planning \nservices can lead only to more, not fewer, abortions.\n  Cutting funding for family planning diminishes access to the most \neffective means of reducing abortion. Research shows the only way to \nreduce the number of abortions is to improve family planning efforts \nthat will decrease the number of unintended pregnancies. Access to \ncontraception reduces the probability of having an abortion by more \nthan 85 percent.\n\n  Of course, I do not support the use of a single taxpayer dollar to \nperform or promote abortions overseas, but that is what the law says. \nThe law has explicitly prohibited such activities for 20 years, from \n1973. Instead, I support family planning efforts that reduce both \nunintended pregnancies and abortions.\n  The Mexico City policy not only undercuts our country's commitment to \nwomen's health, it restricts foreign organizations in a way that would \nbe unconstitutional in the United States. This policy violates a \nfundamental tenet of our democracy: freedom of speech. That is why my \nfriend from California, the chief sponsor of this amendment, Senator \nBoxer, calls this a global gag amendment because that is exactly what \nit is. This policy violates a fundamental tenet of our democracy: \nfreedom of speech.\n  Exporting a policy that is unconstitutional in the United States is \nthe ultimate act of hypocrisy. Surely, this is not the message we want \nto send to struggling democracies that look to the United States for \ninspiration and guidance. My friend, the distinguished Senator from \nNevada--from California, Senator Boxer--I wish she were from Nevada. \nShe does a great job for Nevada, along with California and the rest of \nthe country. Senator Boxer's amendment would ensure that U.S. foreign \npolicy is consistent with American values, including free speech and \nmedical ethics.\n  I support this legislation. I support this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort to protect and defend women around \nthe globe.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the Boxer amendment \nbeing considered. I acknowledge the\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\npassion and leadership of the Senator from California. I have always \nrespected her thoughtful arguments. We have had some issues in \nagreement and some issues in disagreement. This happens to be one we \nare in disagreement but it does not reduce my acknowledging her skill \nand abilities and the heart she brings to each and every discussion she \nputs forward.\n  This is a straightforward and simple issue, one that everyone can \nclearly grasp. It is about the use of taxpayer dollars, Federal, U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas; do you agree or disagree \nwith that.\n  Some say, yes, we should do that; other people say, no, I don't think \nwe should use taxpayer dollars overseas to fund issues such as this. \nOthers say, I don't think we should use taxpayer dollars to fund \nabortion because of their deeply held feeling they are aborting a child \nand they disagree fundamentally with that. We have a clear issue before \nthe Senate.\n  I note the history behind the so-called Mexico City language. On \nJanuary 22, 2001, when President George Bush was sworn in and put into \noffice as President of the United States, in one of his first acts, he \nreinstated the Mexico City policy. I say ``reinstated''; this was a \npolicy President Reagan put in place. It was in place during President \nReagan's term in office, in place during President Bush I's first term \nin office, and immediately repealed when President Clinton came into \noffice.\n  The policy simply states that it prohibits Federal taxpayers from \nfunding foreign organizations that ``perform or actively promote \nabortion as a method of family planning in other nations.'' That is \nwhat the Mexico City language is: ``perform or actively promote \nabortion as a method of family planning in other nations.''\n  So the President is saying as part of U.S. policy that we will not \nfund private organizations, NGOs, that perform or actively promote \nabortion overseas.\n  That is the issue. That is the point of the issue. You can color it \nwith a lot of stories, you can color it with a lot of rhetoric, but the \nissue to decide in this body is, do we want to use taxpayer dollars to \nfund abortions or promote abortion overseas.\n  As I note to people, there are primarily two grounds that people \ndisagree. The first ground is as a moral objection. A number of people \njust disagree with the issue of abortion. It is probably the most \ndifficult social issue today as a society. We debate it regularly. The \nissue is, is the young child a person or a piece of property.\n  Others look at this differently. Senator Boxer and I have different \nviews on that particular issue. I think history will clearly point out \nthe side I represent is accurate and true and is the side I hope \nultimately all Americans will agree with, that we believe in the \nfundamental rights of a personhood and of dignity, of each and every \nindividual, no matter how weak or helpless they might be. It is in the \ngreat traditions of the Democratic Party to support people in a \ndifficult spot, and it should be that support for the weakest and the \nmost vulnerable which clearly that child in the womb represents. That \nis No. 1 as an issue.\n  The second issue, should you use taxpayer dollars, taxpayers from \nCalifornia, from Missouri, from Kansas, from Indiana, wherever they \nmight be, should we be using those to support a policy that funds \nabortion in Nepal and Africa or that supports organizations in various \nplaces around the world that want to either perform abortions or \npromote the use of abortion in that country and that society? A number \nof people would say yes, I am willing to use taxpayer funds to go do \nthat. Probably more people in the country, I think if you would poll \npeople in the United States, would say no. No. 1, I think you spend too \nmuch overseas the way it is right now. No. 2, I disagree with you \neither paying for abortions overseas or supporting organizations that \nare trying to promote abortion overseas. I think that is a bad use of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n\n  Those are the fundamental arguments that people bring forth in \nlooking at the Mexico City policy. I think the Mexico City policy is a \nvery commonsense policy that has been put forward by President Reagan, \nput forward by President Bush, George Bush No. 1, President Bush No. 2 \nas well. It has been in law since 1984, as an administrative act by the \nPresident. It is based in part on the belief that U.S. taxpayers should \nnot be forced to subsidize or support organizations that perform or \npromote abortions overseas for family planning programs.\n  I have noted some of the specific arguments why that takes place. I \nwant to take on one of the indirect arguments that a number of people \nraise. Some people argue incorrectly that Federal tax dollars would not \nhave to be used for the actual abortion but could still be used to \nsupport the organization's other activities. This argument fails to \nproperly understand the fungibility of money. Once you give money to a \norganization, it can use that for a broad range of causes. It can say, \nLook, we don't use this money for abortions or promoting abortions \nbecause we will use it in this sector, sector A of our organization. \nBut in sector B of our organization we do fund abortions and we do \npromote abortions.\n  This money can be used to subsidize the overhead operation of the \norganization, it can be used to subsidize a mailing, and while this \nportion doesn't support abortion, there is also an additional mailing \ninserted that does. It can be used in the fungibility of the dollars. \nThat is why we tried to put forward--why President Bush has tried to \nput forward a clear firewall on this set of funds.\n  It is not that the United States should not try to do good overseas, \nbecause we should and we are. I applaud this President for his efforts \nin global HIV, on the Millennium Challenge Account, where we are trying \nto help people in other countries to get out of these debilitating, \nhorrific situations of HIV and its spread, of trying to give them some \neconomic opportunity. The President put those forward. I strongly \nsupport those and hope those will clear through the Congress.\n  But here is one: Why would we take something so controversial, so \ncounter to so many Americans' fundamental beliefs, fundamental \nthoughts, and say to the American taxpayer: We are going to use your \ndollars to do this, and, yes, we know you disagree with it on moral \ngrounds and, yes, we know you disagree with it on fiscal grounds, yet \nwe are going to go ahead and do that?\n  If we are so concerned about the individual overseas, and we should \nbe, why not put the money in something we all agree with that is a \nterrible problem like global HIV or solving issues dealing with malaria \nor other diseases that are horrific but that do not get the number of \nresearch dollars they should for developing cures for them because they \nare in countries where people do not have enough resources to be able \nto buy the pharmaceutical drugs that would cure them? There are so many \nbetter ways you could spend this type of money than in something so \ncontroversial and so counter to what America stands for.\n\n  I think it is important for us to vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  There is a final reason here. I want to hit this point. There is \nanother one as well. The final reason here is that the President has \nstated clearly he will veto the bill if this language that funds \noverseas abortions or the promotion of abortion is included in this \nbill. If that is in this bill, the administration will veto this bill.\n  The chairman and the ranking member have worked very hard to put a \nbill together to do the authorizing on authorization instead of \nappropriations so we can get a bill through. Rather than having it \nvetoed, wouldn't it be wise for us to go ahead and get this through?\n  One of the reasons we were criticized, and I think rightfully so, in \nthe last Congress was that we didn't get anything done. There was a \nmajor Energy bill, didn't get it done; a major Medicare bill, didn't \nget it done. What the chairman and ranking member are trying to do here \nis pass a major State Department authorization, foreign assistance. We \nare trying to get it done and we can get it done. We can finish this \nand we can get it done. Yet you are trying to insert language to kill \nthe whole bill and the whole process. On top of the controversy for \nusing the funds for these purposes, the controversy about the whole \nmoral issue of abortion, you are going to cause the veto of a bill over \nthis issue.\n  I do not think that is wise legislating on our part. I do not think \nit is the appropriate way for us to go. I think the\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nAmerican people would look at that as well and say: You know, this \nisn't a life-or-death issue on the point of getting this language.\n  Some would contend it is. If that is the case, let's make a malaria \ncure a portion. That is a life-and-death issue. But you are going to \nkill a bill by including such controversial language in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to overturn President \nBush's clear language, the clear policy that I think represents, \nreally, what the American people want to see us do.\n  With that, I would like an opportunity--I think there are others who \nare going to speak on this bill--to possibly be able to rejoin the \ndebate to answer some of the points that might be put forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, just for the sake of explanation to \nSenators of what is about to transpire, I am going to move to table the \namendment that has been offered by the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. Senators will have a chance to vote. I will call for the \nyeas and nays, so it will be a recorded vote. In the event that Senator \nBoxer's amendment is not tabled, then I will move that we adopt the \namendment by voice vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator \nBoxer's amendment to the State Department authorization bill to \neliminate the so-called global gag rule to lift the restrictions for \nU.S. assistance to international family planning providers included in \nthis legislation.\n  There have been few issues in recent years that have been more \ndebated. I have come to the floor on several occasions in years past to \nexpress my deep concern for the global gag rule. Year after year, we \nhave come to the floor to try to overturn the rule.\n  Under the leadership of both Democratic and Republican Presidents, \nand under Congresses controlled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the \nUnited States has established a long and distinguished record of world \nleadership in the area of international family planning and \nreproductive health issues.\n  But the global gag rule places very limiting restrictions on U.S. \nassistance to international family planning organizations. Overseas \nfamily planning providers would be barred from using their own money to \neven provide information to patients about the availability of a legal \nabortion if these providers receive any funding or even access to \ncontraceptives from the U.S. Government.\n  International family planning providers are being faced with a very \ndifficult choice; either give up desperately needed U.S. funding or \nedit the information about reproductive health that providers share \nwith the women they are trying to help. Either choice will hurt some of \nthe poorest women in the world.\n  Family planning providers don't just lose funds under the global gag \nrule. They also lose donated contraceptives. The United States is the \nmost important donor of contraceptives to the developing world, \nproviding about 37 percent of all donations at a value of $45 to $55 \nmillion annually.\n  I was disappointed that one of President Bush's first major policy \nactions, on his first business day in office, January 22, 2001, was to \nreinstate the global gag rule.\n  I think it is important to point out that Senator Boxer's amendment \ndoes not change any laws about abortion. In fact, this amendment only \nallows for funding to organizations that provide services that are \nlegal in their own country and also legal in the United States.\n  Beginning with the reinstatement of the gag policy in January 2001, \nseveral organizations working in the developing world that have lost \naccess to much needed funding or contraceptives, including the \nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF. IPPF is made up of \nmore than 150 agencies working in 180 countries and is the largest \nprovider of reproductive health services in the world.\n  Between 2001 and 2003, this organization has lost more than $8 \nmillion in U.S. Government funds--mostly for contraceptive supplies.\n  Some country-specific examples to demonstrate the impact of the \nglobal gag rue include: Ethiopia where the Family Planning Association \nlost $56,000 in contraceptive supplies; Zambia were the Planned \nParenthood Association lost $137,092 in contraceptive supplies; Cote \nd'Ivoire where the Family Planning Association lost $186,000 in \ncontraceptive supplies which eliminated contraceptive services from \nnearly 50 percent of their 92 distribution points; Congo where the \nFamily Planning Association lost $17,000 in U.S. assistance and, as a \nresult, they had to eliminate programs that served 15,739 clients; and \nKenya where the Family Planning Association had received an average of \n$580,000 per year to fund its clinics. Three urban clinics serving \n56,000 poor and underserved clients closed.\n  The amount of funding lost may not sound like much to you. But in the \ndeveloping world, every dollar, literally, counts.\n  And every woman deprived of access to education or contraceptive \nsupplies risk an unwanted pregnancy.\n  Access to contraceptives is not only about family planning. It is \nabout reproductive health. And it is also about protecting people from \nHIV/AIDS.\n  Much of the developing world is struggling with HIV/AIDS. The loss of \nU.S. funds has reduced the capacity of many family planning providers \nto also address the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n  In Ghana, for example, 697,000 Planned Parenthood Association clients \nwill lose access to not only family planning services but also to \nvoluntary testing and counseling for HIV/AIDS as well as AIDS \nprevention education programs.\n  With the world population now at more than 6 billion, and estimates \nof this figure growing to 12 billion by 2050, we must give couples and \nwomen the resources necessary to plan the number and spacing of their \nchildren.\n  The vast majority of this population growth will occur in the \ndeveloping world, in countries that don't have the resources necessary \nor the infrastructure to provide for basic health care.\n  Limited access to family planning services results in high rates of \nunintended and high-risk pregnancy and maternal deaths.\n  Every minute around the world, 190 women face an unplanned or \nunwanted pregnancy. About 110 women experience pregnancy-related \ncomplications and 1 woman dies. This can be avoided.\n  I would ask the women of America, as they consider their own \nreproductive rights, to consider the aim and intent of a policy in \nwhich the reproductive rights of American women are approached one way \nand those of women in the developing world another.\n  Perhaps worst of all about the global gag rule is that it is a \ncynical ploy by those who would challenge domestic reproductive rights \nbut are too fearful of the political repercussions. So, instead, they \npractice the divisive politics of reproductive rights on the poor, \nsacrificing the lives of women and children overseas, where they think \nwe are not paying attention or do not really care.\n  I truly believe that the only way to help women in the developing \nword better their own lives and the lives of their families is to \nensure that they have access to the educational and medical resources \nnecessary to make informed decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \ntoday by Senator Boxer to repeal the global gag rule.\n  We take up this debate once again during the consideration of the \nState Department authorization, a bill which governs our country's \nfederally sponsored foreign aid programs. Each year, we have to fight \nfor the adoption of this amendment which would bolster these \ninternational assistance efforts, and yet each year we find ourselves \nhere again debating this same issue.\n  There is no question that U.S. population assistance is of critical \nimportance to our international aid efforts. Population assistance is \nthe primary\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\ndeliverer of health education, health care, and prenatal care to \nmillions of women in developing countries. But beyond the social and \nphysiological aid that this program brings to these nations, there is a \nreal economic benefit as well. According to USAID, studies in several \ncountries have shown that for every dollar invested in family planning \nprograms, governments save as much as $16 in reduced expenditures in \nhealth, education, and social services. This is not only an investment \nin the health of women, and their children, and their families but for \nwhole nations and their ability to stabilize and grow stronger.\n  There is also no question that U.S. population assistance efforts in \ndeveloping countries have been successful, as demonstrated by the fact \nthat the average family size in countries that have received U.S. \npopulation assistance has decreased from six children to four. AID \nassistance has increased the use of contraceptives in developing \ncountries from 10 percent of married couples in the 1970s to 50 to 60 \npercent today. This not only allows for family planning which helps \nensure healthier pregnancies, resulting in healthier babies, but is \ncritical to our efforts to fight infectious diseases like AIDS that are \nplaguing many Third World countries.\n  The discussion of contraceptives leads me to a very critical point . \n. . the issue before us today is not abortion, because current law \nalready prohibits the use of any U.S. funds for abortion-related \nactivities. This is a crucial fact that needs to be on record. Under \nthe Helms amendment of 1973, U.S. funds cannot be used for abortion-\nrelated activities and have not been permitted for that purpose for 30 \nyears. I support that law as an important guarantee that our \ninternational family planning programs stay apart from domestic debates \non the issue of abortion.\n  At the hear of the issue we are debating today is the so called \nMexico City policy because it was at the 1984 U.N. Population \nConference in Mexico City that the Reagan administration adopted this \npolicy. Under the Mexico City policy, the Reagan administration witheld \ninternational family planning funds from all groups that had the \nslightest involvement in legal abortion-related services even though \nthey were paid for with their own private funds. This was done despite \nthe fact that similar restrictions were not placed on funding programs \nrun by foreign governments that related to legal abortions. Quite \nappropriately, this policy is also referred to as the international \n``gag rule'' because it prevents organizations from even providing \nabortion counseling or referral services.\n  The need for the passage of this amendment is in part about \nleadership. The United States has traditionally been the leader in \ninternational family planning assistance. This has been the case ever \nsince this issue rose to international prominence with the 1974 U.N. \nPopulation Conference in Bucharest. At that time, a great number of the \nworld's developing countries perceived family planning as a Western \neffort to reduce the power and influence of Third World countries. \nHowever, in the years since, the need and importance of family planning \nhas been recognized and embraced by most developing nations.\n  If, as a country, we believe in volunteerism in family planning--and \nwe do--then we should maintain our leadership. Because of our leading \nrole in international family planning, we have unrivaled influence in \nsetting standards for family planning programs. A great number of other \ndonors and recipient countries adopt our models in their own efforts.\n  According to the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, the Mexico \nCity policy penalizes 56 countries whose nongovernmental \norganizations--NGOs--receive family planning assistance funds from the \nUnited States. NGOs are prohibited not only from providing abortion-\nrelated services but also counseling and referrals regarding abortions.\n  That is the policy; let's consider the real effect on people. \nAccording to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, about 4 in every 10 \npregnancies worldwide are unplanned, and 40 percent of unintended \npregnancies end in abortion. Knowing this, the net effect of the Mexico \nCity policy on these 56 nations is to limit or eliminate critical \nfamily planning work that has a very real impact on the quality of \nlife. Moreover, the absence of family planning increases the instance \nof the one thing that the advocates of the Mexico City policy are most \nopposed to--abortion.\n  The bottom line is, family planning is about health care. Too often, \nwomen in developing nations do not have access to the contraceptive or \nfamily planning services they need because contraceptives are \nexpensive, supplies are erratic, services are difficult or impossible \nto obtain, or the quality of care is poor. In a report by the \nPopulation Action Institute it was estimated that about 515,000 women \ndie each year in pregnancy and childbirth, or almost one death every \nminute, and millions more women become ill or disabled. In addition, an \nestimated 78,000 women die every year from illegal and unsafe abortion \nand thousands more are injured. How many women die because the access \nto these services is limited?\n  Quite simply, the Mexico City policy is bad public policy. That is \nwhy year after year we fight for this amendment and some years we win \nin committee and other years we don't, yet we still fight this \nimportant fight. The Mexico City policy not only limits discussion, \ncounseling, and referrals for abortion, but it also limits the ability \nof organizations, in at least 59 nations, to carry out needed family \nplanning work.\n  We must remember that family planning is about--just that--planning \none's family. By spacing births at least 2 years apart, family planning \ncan prevent an average of one in four infant deaths in developing \ncountries. Family planning provides access to needed contraceptives and \ngives women worldwide the ability to properly space out their \npregnancies so that they can have healthier babies, which will lead to \nhealthier children and healthier nations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment before \nus and ensure that international organizations are no longer forced to \nlimit or eliminate critical family planning work that has a very real \nimpact on the quality of life of women and families worldwide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it appropriate to ask unanimous \nconsent that is how we proceed; that is, a voice vote will follow if, \nin fact, the amendment is not tabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot order a voice vote by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is what I thought. That is why I asked the question. \nThe amendment can be agreed to; is that possible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BIDEN. At the time? I can't ask that now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator can ask \nthat the amendment be agreed to now, but it must be by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Indiana is about to make a motion to \ntable the Boxer amendment. It has been stated verbally that if that \ntabling motion fails, then we would move to a voice vote to accept the \nBoxer amendment. Is there any way in which to get a unanimous consent \nagreement that is how we would proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may ask that the amendment be \nagreed to by unanimous consent but cannot ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. Words make a difference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if, in fact, the Boxer amendment is not \ntabled, the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair and apologize for the clumsy way in \nwhich I phrased the question.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership on this legislation. I co-\nsponsored this bill in the last Congress and I am proud to support it \nagain.\n  The Mexico City policy, also known as the ``global gag rule,'' is bad \npolicy and a bad idea.\n  Let us be clear what this issue is not about. The issue is not about \nabortion--although it is often portrayed as\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\nsuch by the proponents of Mexico City. Rather, the provision is about \nfree speech and democratic values.\n  Longstanding law--a law authored by former Senator Jesse Helms--\nalready prohibits the use of U.S. funds to perform or promote \nabortions.\n  Let me repeat that. Current law, on the books for nearly three \ndecades and authored by our former colleague Jesse Helms, already bans \nthe use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to perform or promote abortions. Any \nassertion to the contrary is false.\n  The ``Mexico City'' policy goes much further: it demands that \nforeign, nongovernmental organizations which receive U.S. population \nassistance funds agree that they will stop using their own funds to \ndiscuss with their own governments how abortion will be regulated.\n  No such restrictions would be imposed on U.S.-based organizations, \nfor a simple reason: they would be unconstitutional under the First \nAmendment.\n  Nor are such restrictions imposed on foreign governments. If they \nwere, then U.S. assistance to countries such as Israel might be in \ndanger, because the Israeli government uses its own funds to pay for \nabortions.\n  In my view, the Mexico City policy is anti-democratic, because it \nattempts to silence foreign recipients of U.S. funds.\n  It is the policy of the United States to advance the cause of \ndemocracy by promoting the values which we hold dear--such as freedom \nof speech, freedom of association, and freedom of the press.\n  The Mexico City policy flies in the face of these fundamental values \nby attempting to restrict the speech of recipients of U.S. funds.\n  This is a gag rule, pure and simple. It restricts speech. And for the \nlife of me I cannot understand why anyone--Republican or Democrat--\nwould support a provision that would violate the First Amendment if \napplied to U.S.-based organizations.\n  Of course, foreign citizens and organizations do not have \nconstitutional rights. But just because we can legally apply this \nrestriction does not mean that it is good policy. And I do not believe \nthat it is.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank all Senators for their assistance in this \nprocedure.\n  I move to table the Boxer amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 267 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Miller\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is now \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1141) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, we have made progress on our bill. There \nare three amendments that will require some debate--but that will \ninevitably be accepted--still lined up for this evening.\n  I encourage--and I am certain the distinguished ranking member would \njoin me--all Members who want to resolve their amendments to please do \nso this evening. We will be here. We have a good opportunity to work \nthrough almost all of the known amendments this evening.\n  Having said that, the leader has told me there will be no more \nrollcall votes and authorized me to make that announcement once \nagain, We will proceed on this bill as long as it is productive. We \nhope Senators will come to the floor, offer their amendments, and have \nthem resolved.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I share the view of my friend from \nIndiana. I think of the 20-some amendments out there, 99 percent of \nthem are able to be worked out. Many of them will be accepted with a \nfew small changes. I encourage if not the Senators, the staffs who are \nauthorized to come to the floor and work them out.\n  Further, it is my understanding, regarding the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey, we should proceed on an amendment he may withdraw. \nHowever, he is prepared to speak to that amendment. He wants to do \nthat. I promised him I would try to get him up next. I am not asking \nunanimous consent but I am talking long enough so his staff can hear \nthis and get him back over here. He is ready to go.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will assist the Senator by indicating I suggest an order \nof Senator Brownback offering his amendment, then Senator Lautenberg, \nand then Senator Allen so the Senators would have some idea of the \nbatting order. Senator Brownback, I understand, is prepared to go with \nan amendment on Iran that Senator Biden and I have studied. Then we \nwould have Senator Lautenberg immediately following.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be happy to accede to that in light \nof the fact that Senator Brownback is here to go and Senator Lautenberg \nis not.\n  Mr. REID. That was just information; it was not a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  We have been on this bill for just a few hours. I know, having \nmanaged a bill or two in my day, how important it is for the two \nmanagers of this bill to get their legislation passed.\n  Everyone has to stop and pause a little bit. The last time this bill \ncame up we spent 2 weeks on it. We are not going to finish this bill in \n3 hours. Everyone should understand that. I know there are 20 \namendments and 90 percent of them will be agreed to. There may be other \namendments that the two managers are not aware of. It is important we \nmove this long and we are certainly not trying to stall this \nlegislation.\n  However, I apologize to Senator Lautenberg because I thought we were \ngoing to do no more tonight. We have a joint function that Senators are \nto attend tonight and I told Senator Lautenberg we would not be doing \nany more tonight. So that is my fault. I did not know the manager would \ntry to do other amendments. We have a lot of amendments that people \nwant to offer but I didn't believe tonight that was going to happen.\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\n  I told the two leaders I would work during the night to find out some \nindication of what we would have tomorrow but in the few minutes since \nI spoke with the distinguished majority leader there are people who \nwant to offer amendments. The vast majority of those amendments are \nrelated to this bill; they are not unrelated. Senator Murray has \nindicated she wants to offer an amendment on unemployment benefits. We \nwant to make sure she has an opportunity to do that.\n  I don't want to rain on the parade other than to say this bill is not \ngoing to be finished early tomorrow.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to make clear what I am saying. We already know \nthere are 20-some amendments out there. I believe we can settle almost \nall of those amendments by negotiation without long discussions on the \nfloor tonight or tomorrow or any time. I have no illusions, having been \nhere a long time--even longer than the assistant leader--that we are \ngoing to get this thing done quickly, nor that we may not have \nnongermane amendments that may be meritorious and may take a long time. \nI understand that.\n\n  All I am saying is what we do know is this: Let's get it done because \nmost of it is not nearly as controversial as it appears to be. That is \nthe point I am trying to make. Not that I am making any predictions. \nThere are two things I never predict. One is the weather and the second \nis what the Senate is going to do. So I am not predicting. I am saying \nwe know what we have before us; let's get it done and we can move on \ntomorrow or the next day or next week or next year to do whatever comes \nup.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand this bill is very important. \nThe two managers have both talked to me how important they think it is, \nand I acknowledge it is important. We will try to help them any way we \ncan to get this bill passed.\n  The good news is Senator Lautenberg has heard us talking and he is on \nhis way back. That is an amendment that will be disposed of tonight. I \nlook forward to working with the two managers tomorrow to see what we \ncan do to help expedite this legislation.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Senator for mentioning Senator \nLautenberg and for obtaining his attention so he will be back and we \ncan proceed.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor, and I understand Senator Brownback \nis prepared to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1145 to Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I call up for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1145.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To provide support for democracy in Iran)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following\n\n     SEC.   . IRAN DEMOCRACY ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Iran is neither free nor democratic. Men and women are \n     not treated equally in Iran. Women are legally deprived of \n     internationally recognized human rights, and religious \n     freedom is not respected under the laws of Iran. Undemocratic \n     institutions, such as the guardians council, thwart the \n     decisions of elected leaders.\n       (2) The April 2003 report of the Department of State states \n     that Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism \n     in 2002.\n       (3) That report also states that Iran continues to provide \n     funding, safe-haven, training, and weapons to known terrorist \n     groups, notably Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic \n     Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n       (B) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) currently, there is not a free and fully democratic \n     government in Iran,\n       (2) the United States supports transparent, full democracy \n     in Iran,\n       (3) the United States supports the rights of the Iranian \n     people to choose their system of government; and\n       (4) the United States condemns the brutal treatment, \n     imprisonment and torture of Iranian civilians expressing \n     political dissent.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. This concerns providing support for democracy in Iran \nand has been previously filed and been amended.\n  I worked closely with Senator Lugar, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and Senator Biden, the ranking member. Together we \nhave worked out language that we have all agreed to on an important \nissue of democracy and promotion of democracy in Iran.\n  This is a very important issue to the country and to the people of \nIran. I am very thankful to the chairman and to the ranking member and \ntheir staffs for working together to get this language put together, \nlanguage that is very strong, quite good, and makes a very positive \nstatement.\n  I rise to discuss this important issue. It is our policy toward Iran. \nAs the President rightly stated, Iran is a member of the axis of evil. \nThe terrorist atrocities it spreads around the world are equalled by \nthe horrific atrocities committed against its own people.\n  Today marks the fourth anniversary of the first major Iranian protest \nagainst a government that promised reform and utterly failed. I will \nshow a picture to my colleagues of that protest 4 years ago, 1999, July \n9--4 years ago today. The students, protesters, were out, thousands \nprotesting the Government of Iran and saying they desired freedom.\n  This is a scene of that. It is being replayed again today. Protesters \nare out in Iran, even though the regime is doing everything they can to \nstop it, having quasi-police groups--really, thugs--going around and \nbeating people with chains. They are putting people in prison. But \npeople continue to protest.\n  This is a picture of a protest taking place 2 weeks ago, not just in \nTehran now but protests are taking place all over the country, as the \nfire of democracy and liberty continues to burn aggressively among the \npeople of Iran.\n  These are people who are pro-American, as well, broadly throughout \nIran. They support the United States and our stand for freedom and \ndemocracy. It is important we stand with them.\n  The fact we continue to see protests in Iran despite very harsh \ntreatment is showing the world that these protests are growing and will \neventually lead to real change inside Iran. It is very appropriate it \nis today that we are offering this amendment to the State Department \nauthorization bill which declares firmly that America supports real \ndemocracy in Iran. What is there now is not democracy.\n  It is a very basic message. It is extremely important that this body \nsend a message to the Iranian people, and send it today, that we \nsupport their struggle for freedom.\n  This is not just an altruistic gesture of support. Supporting the \nforces of democracy in Iran is in the direct security interest of \nAmerica. As I am sure many of you have heard, there are new reports \nabout additional nuclear weapons facilities in Iran--these are based on \nmilitary complexes and there can now be no misunderstanding of the \nintent behind this technology. Estimates are that Iran could have \nnuclear weapons as early as 2005.\n  Also, Iran has just confirmed that it has successfully tested a \nmidrange missile, the Shahab-3, which is capable of hitting Israel, \nparts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, where many of our troops are stationed.\n  This means that Iran could have nuclear weapons--and the means to \ndeliver them to hit us and our allies.\n  Clearly, this is a bad situation which is growing worse by the day. \nSo, why, in this context, would we shy away from supporting pro-\ndemocracy forces in Iran that want to bring the rule of law, respect \nfor human rights and an end to support for terrorism to their country?\n  Some have said that if the U.S. supports the protestors, we will be \nbound to intervene militarily. These people have not paid attention to \nthe unique situation inside Iran or the fact that Iranians don't want \nU.S. military intervention but, rather, strong moral and political \nsupport.\n  Young people make up nearly 70 percent of the country--and they are \ntaking it back from the mullah minority. The Iranian people are a \nproud, strong, and independent people. They do not need, nor do they \nwant, an outside military force to come into their land.\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\nThey will handle this matter themselves. They have already begun to do \nso. This does not mean that the military option is off the table. \nAmerica reserves the right to protect its people and innocent civilians \nfrom a nuclear threat or further Iranian-backed terrorists, but this is \na defensive option.\n  To be honest, America hopes that the Iranian people change their \nregime themselves, and the hesitancy you see within America's foreign \npolicy circles with regard to Iran comes largely because there is such \nhope for internal change, where there was none in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  There is no division in the U.S. Government about the fact that Iran \nis a threat to its own people and certainly to Americans. The Iranian \npeople and the Iranian regime alike should know that we are united and \nresolute in our understanding of what Iran is doing. We will not allow \nIran to spread its corruption throughout the region.\n  As President Bush so clearly stated in his State of the Union Address \nthis year:\n\n       In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its \n     people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports \n     terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and \n     death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and \n     democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose \n     their own government and determine their own destiny--and the \n     United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.\n\n  That is what the President, stated in the State of the Union Address \nof January 28, 2003.\n  Recently, the President praised the Iranian people who kept up \nprotests for over a week in the face of government sponsored thugs who \nbeat innocent women with chains. The President called these protests \n``heroic'' and indeed they are.\n  Just as it was an important rhetorical step for President Reagan to \ndub the Soviet Union ``an Evil Empire,'' so too it is important for us \nto recognize the current regime in Iran for what it is--an \nillegitimate, ruling elite that stifles the growth of genuine \ndemocracy, abuses human rights and exports terrorism.\n  It is clear by the Iranian regime's treatment of its own people in \ntheir attempt to be heard, that Iran is no democracy.\n  After all, it is the State Department's own report that classifies \nIran as the largest state sponsor of terrorism. Do we really believe \nthis is the will of the entire Iranian population? If so, we are saying \nthat all Iranians are terrorists. This is wrong, and America must make \nit clear that we see the difference between the Iranian regime and the \nIranian people--and we are supporting the people.\n  You can't call a country that screens the candidates a democracy. You \ncan't call a government that tortures and kills its people openly a \ndemocracy. You can't call a country that refuses to enforce the laws \nthat the screened, elected officials pass a democracy. All this is \ncurrently going on under Iran's so-called reformers.\n  I want to show how the reformers were elected into office. I will \nshow a chart so my colleagues can easily see how we do get to the \ngovernment that is currently in place in Iran. Seven years ago \nPresident Khatami was elected by the people. But how did he even get on \nthe ballot? I want to show that, and also make some statements about \nhis election.\n  For people to be running as candidates in Iran today, they have to go \nthrough the Council of Guardians. This is six members appointed by the \nSupreme Leader and six by the judiciary. The Supreme Leader is \nappointed by the council as well and is appointed for life. Khamenei, \nSupreme Leader, appointed six and six by the judiciary. Then all the \ncandidates running for President, Assembly of Experts, 86 clerics \nelected for 8-year terms, and the Parliament, 290 members elected for \n4-year terms, all these candidates have to be vetted by this 12-member \ncouncil, so you can't get on the ballot unless you clear through the \n12-member council for any of these three--the Parliament, the Assembly \nof Experts, or the President. You can't get on the ballot unless you \nclear through these 12 people, 6 appointed by the Supreme Leader who is \nappointed by them for life, never stands for election in front of the \npeople, and 6 appointed by the judiciary. This is not a free election.\n  What about Khatami's election to President? He was elected for 4 \nyears, for a 4-year term initially. This was 7 years ago. In his \ninitial attempt he was elected. He was voted on, overwhelmingly favored \nby the people as the most reformist-minded candidate that the Council \nof Guardians would even let on the ballot. Over 60 percent of the \npeople say: This is our guy because he is the most reformist, open-\nminded of the group, even though he was not. And it turned out that he \nwas exactly what the Council of Guardians wanted: Good face, looks a \nlittle friendlier, gives the people a way to voice their thoughts. But \nhe did not reform. He did not bring democracy. He did not bring human \nrights. He did not bring rights to women within the country. And he \nkept the country continuing its movement toward terrorism.\n  Even if you take all the power of these elected officials--so-called \nelected officials--they don't have the power over foreign policy, over \nthe military, or over the Treasury. That continues to be held by the \nSupreme Leader and the Council of Guardians. So most of the power isn't \neven in the people who are so-called elected.\n  This is not a democracy, and that is why the people continue to \nprotest--because they do not get to pick their own leaders and they \nwant to pick their own leaders.\n  I want to show you what has taken place inside Iran, as a country, \nand why there is so much discontent, and why people are saying: Down \nwith the President of Iran. Down with the Council of Guardians. They \nare so actively willing to protest and risk their own lives, and risk \nbeing arrested and beaten.\n  One thing I want to point out, too, these protests that have been \ntaking place in the last couple of weeks, several sons and daughters of \nparliamentarians have been arrested as protesters. They are saying: \nLook, this government is not reform minded and we, as children of the \nparliamentarians, are saying this is not reform. And they have been \narrested. They see the fallacy of the system, that it isn't working.\n  Look at this long-term trajectory pattern that Iran is on since 1978. \nSince the last government was thrown out, the Shah, and the protests \nwere taking place, in 1979, what has happened to Iran? It was taken \nover by the ruling Mullahs, the Ayatolla at that time. They took \ncaptives of U.S. Embassy personnel for over 400-some days. Look what \nhas taken place. Per capita, GDP is 20 percent lower today than in 1978 \nin Iran. There is widespread corruption, which was a key contributor of \nthe 1979 revolution. Youth unemployment exceeds 30 percent. There has \nbeen a huge population explosion. Fifty percent of the population is \nunder age 20--50 percent of the population.\n  There are religious legitimacy problems, persistent challenges to the \nSupreme Leader's religious credentials, and most Grand Ayatollahs do \nnot approve of the Supreme Leader's doctrine on religious matters.\n  So this is really fomenting a situation. All we are doing with this \namendment, which has been agreed to, and has strong language, is saying \nthis is an illegitimate government; that we should and we do support \ntrue democracy in Iran and the right of the people to actually choose \ntheir leadership in Iran.\n  I think it is one of the most important things we can do. We need to \nshow clear moral support to the people who are risking their lives \ntoday on the streets, across the country of Iran.\n  I hope we can get this through, that we can express our clear support \nto the Iranian people. This will be a powerful statement to the people \nprotesting today.\n  I hope we can agree to this yet this evening.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me to bring it up on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKansas for his research, for his leadership on this issue, and for the \namendment he has offered.\n  On our side, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Let me inquire of the distinguished ranking member of the committee \nif he is prepared to accept it on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. We are prepared to accept the Brownback amendment.\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1145) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nvery much for allowing us to put this forward. I think it is the very \nstrong and right thing for us to do, and it is the right time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1135\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr.President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1135.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide justice for Marine victims of terror)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. JUSTICE FOR UNITED STATES MARINES ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Justice for United States Marines Act''.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 1404C(a)(3) of the Victims of Crime \n     Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10603c(a)(3)) is amended by striking \n     ``December 21, 1988, with respect to which an investigation \n     or'' and inserting ``October 23, 1983, with respect to which \n     an investigation or civil or criminal''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which we \nare calling Justice for the United States Marines. The amendment would \nmake sure that the families of the 241 U.S. marines who were killed by \nterrorists in 1983 have equal access to assistance from the Federal \ncrime victims fund.\n  In 1996, I authored a law that enabled terrorism victims' families to \nreceive assistance to file suit against foreign sponsors of terror. \nThis enabled families to receive judgments for those countries that \naided terrorists in killing their children.\n  My amendment makes two small changes in the current Victims of Crime \nAct that would allow these families the same rights as other terror \nvictims. Right now, technicalities in the current law would deny these \nrights to Marine families who lost family members in the tragic \nbarracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983.\n  My amendment is simple. First, it changes the date of eligibility in \nthe current law to terrorist acts that occurred ``on or after October \n23, 1983''--the day of the vicious attack on the U.S. Marine barracks \nin Beirut.\n  Second, my amendment clarifies an ambiguity in the original law about \nthe type of cases that are eligible for Federal funds.\n  On October 23, 1983, a suicide bomber affiliated with Hezbollah \ndetonated a truck full of explosives at a U.S. Marine barracks located \nat the Beirut International Airport. Shortly after this took place, I \nwas there and saw what remained of the building. It was almost totally \ndestroyed. Two-hundred and forty-one U.S. marines were killed that \nnight, and more than 100 were wounded the same day. They were part of a \ncontingent of 1,800 marines who had been sent to Lebanon as a part of a \nmultinational force to help separate warring Lebanese factions.\n  The loss to those families of these victims was enormous. These \nmarines were killed by terrorists as they slept in their barracks. \nTerrorists are cowards. The marines didn't even have a chance to fight \nback.\n  But now the families of these marines are able to fight back against \nthe sponsors of this terrorist act through our judicial system. On May \n30, 2003, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nfound Iran liable for the Beirut Marine Corps barracks bombing. The \ncourt found that Iran sponsored this terrorist act by Hezbollah, and \nwas, therefore, accountable to these families.\n  This trial now proceeds to the damages phase. The court wants to use \nover a dozen ``special masters'' to hear the damage claims of the \nparticipating victims' families. Each special master will hear \napproximately 15 cases.\n  The court has requested the use of the crime victims fund in order to \npay for the cost of employing these special masters. Terror victims are \ngenerally permitted to make use of this fund but a technicality in the \nlaw is preventing these families from utilizing this resource.\n  The technicality is that the law now says the crime victims fund can \nbe used to assist victims of terrorist acts occurring on or before \nDecember 21, 1988. The problem is that the Marine barracks was bombed \non October 23, 1983--approximately 5 years earlier. We need to change \nthe date so the U.S. Marine families can see justice done.\n  In finding Iran liable for this horrible terrorist act in Beirut, the \njudge said the following, which I want to read to the Senate. He said:\n       No order from this Court will restore any of the 241 lives \n     that were stolen on October 23, 1983. Nor is this Court able \n     to heal the pain that has become a permanent part of the \n     lives of their mothers and fathers, their spouses and \n     siblings, and their sons and daughters. But the Court can \n     take steps that will punish the men who carried out this \n     unspeakable attack, and in so doing, try to achieve some \n     small measure of justice for its survivors, and for the \n     family members of the 241 Americans who never came home.\n\n  I would also like to share with my colleagues the poignant words of \none victim's family member after the court's recent ruling. Captain \nVincent Smith, from Camp Lejeune's 24th Marine Amphibious Unit, was one \nof the service members killed in the bombing.\n  After the court's ruling, Captain Smith's sister said:\n\n       I think the whole family feels that the ruling gives us a \n     sense of justice after all of these years. Finally, someone \n     has been named a guilty party . . . It's a huge sense of \n     justice to say that the government of Iran is guilty.\n\n  My amendment will allow the cases of these U.S. Marine families to \nmove forward so they can hold the sponsors of this terrorist act \naccountable.\n  Since September 11, 2001, this Congress has worked hard to provide \njustice to the families and communities affected by terrorist acts. It \nis critical that we also devote attention to the losses incurred by \nmany American families in earlier terrorist incidents.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment in order to extend \njustice to the families of the 241 Marines killed in the Beirut \nbombing.\n  We need to teach sponsors of terror that they will be held \naccountable. A vote for my amendment will help further this lesson by \nbringing the perpetrators of this 1983 terrorist act to justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey. What is the desire of the \nSenator? Does he desire to proceed to a vote on his amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to see the amendment accepted. I would \nlike to have a vote on this amendment, unless, of course, the amendment \nis acceptable to both sides.\n  Frankly, I think it is a good amendment. It does justice in some \nmeasure to the memory of those who were killed. They were there as a \npeacekeeping force--1,800 of them. A quarter of the force was killed in \nthat single incident. The crime victims fund is a fund that is there to \nassist--not to provide damage awards to the people but to help them \ndiscover the evidence that is necessary. The fund has a few hundred \nmillion dollars which would assist these 15 special masters by \nproviding them per diem so they can travel and get the details from \nthese families, as they must do in order to have a sensible trial for \ndamages.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate that thought of the Senator. I \nindicate the amendment still needs to be discussed by some Members who \nhave asked for an opportunity to speak; therefore, I am not prepared to \naccept it on our side at this point. So I am hopeful the Senator will \nallow us to lay the amendment aside temporarily for action tomorrow \nmorning when others will be present to speak, and then we\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\nwould progress in the normal order to resolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lautenberg amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside and that Senator Allen be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1144 To Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1144.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself and Mr. \n     Alexander, and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1144.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To enhance efforts to combat the piracy of United States \n                         copyrighted materials)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 214. COMBATTING PIRACY OF UNITED STATES COPYRIGHTED \n                   MATERIALS.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--The Secretary may carry out a \n     program of activities to combat piracy in countries that are \n     not members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development (OECD), including activities as follows:\n       (1) The provision of equipment and training for law \n     enforcement, including in the interpretation of intellectual \n     property laws.\n       (2) The provisionof training for judges and prosecutors, \n     including in the interpretation of intellectual property \n     laws.\n       (3) The provision of assistance in complying with \n     obligations under applicable international treaties and \n     agreements on copyright and intellectual property.\n       (b) Discharge Through Bureau of Economic Affairs.--The \n     Secretary shall carry out the program authorized by \n     subsection (a) through the Bureau of Economic Affairs of the \n     Department.\n       (c) Consultation with World Intellectual Property \n     Organization.--In carrying out the program authorized by \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, consult with and provide assistance to the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization in order to promote the \n     integration of countries described in subsection (a) into the \n     global intellectual property system.\n       (d) Funding.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     for other educational and cultural exchange programs by \n     section 102(a)(1)(B), $5,000,000 may be available in fiscal \n     year 2004 for the program authorized by subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of my colleagues, Senator \nAlexander of Tennessee and Senator Graham of South Carolina, to offer \namendment No. 1144, which will provide direct assistance to developing \ncountries to combat piracy of U.S. copyrighted works, materials, and \nintellectual property.\n  Specifically, our amendment authorizes $5 million for the State \nDepartment to provide equipment and training to foreign law enforcement \nofficials--judges and prosecutors--as well as assistance in complying \nwith that foreign country's obligations under the appropriate \ninternational copyright and intellectual property treaties.\n  The United States is the world's largest creator, producer, and \nexporter of copyrighted materials. Unfortunately, this vital, important \nsector of our country's economy is at great risk due to widespread \nglobal piracy. This piracy and theft is more specifically defined as \nthe unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and sale of U.S.-made \nmovies, music, software, video games, and other creative works.\n  The widespread piracy of U.S. copyrighted works and intellectual \nproperty threatens U.S. jobs. It threatens our businesses, creativity, \nand our economic prosperity.\n  In 2001, the U.S. recording industry alone lost $4.2 billion to the \npiracy of compact discs worldwide. The U.S. motion picture industry \nlost $3 billion to videocassette piracy, and the U.S. video game \nentertainment industry lost $1.9 billion due to piracy in just 14 \ncountries.\n  In 2000, hard-goods piracy cost the U.S. business software industry \n$11.8 billion.\n  A recent study was commissioned by the Business Software Alliance, \nand it concluded that the largest trade barrier facing the U.S. \nsoftware industry is worldwide software piracy. An estimated 37 \npercent--37 percent--of all software loaded onto computers globally in \n2000 was illegal--37 percent illegal.\n  Most importantly, this report by the Business Software Alliance found \nthat by lowering the software piracy rates by just 10 percent around \nthe world, the IT industry would contribute an additional $400 billion \nin economic growth worldwide.\n  This is a very serious problem that needs to be addressed here at \nhome and internationally. Unfortunately, though, developing and \neconomically depressed countries have significant problems enforcing \nintellectual property protection laws due primarily to a lack of law \nenforcement training and expertise.\n  Under the requirements of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on \nTrade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, all WTO \ncountries must have a legal frame in place to effectively protect \nintellectual property and copyrighted works. Therefore, in order to be \ncompliant, a nation must not only have adequate civil and criminal laws \nregarding copyright protection, but it also must effectively enforce \nthose laws.\n  Our amendment would provide assistance and resources to adequately \ntrain and enforce intellectual property laws in developing countries. \nThis amendment will significantly aid efforts to protect American \ncopyright holders all around the world. Our amendment does not increase \nthe overall authorization level in this bill but, rather, constitutes a \nsmall portion--less than 2 percent of the entire budget--for \neducational and cultural exchange programs.\n  This amendment has broad support from both the content and technology \nindustries. For example, the Recording Industry Association of America, \nthe Motion Picture Association of America, the EMI Music Group, and the \nWalt Disney Company all support this amendment. Additionally, the \nBusiness Software Alliance, Apple Computers, AutoDesk, Cisco Systems, \nEntrust, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Intuit, Adobe, Network \nAssociates, Symantec, and Microsoft all support the Allen-Alexander-\nGraham amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from these groups \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to the amendment.\n  Mr. ALLEN. It would be my great honor and pleasure to add Senator \nBiden of Delaware as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, in particular \nSenator Alexander and Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as Senator Biden, \nfor their hard work. I know the Senator who is presiding over the \nSenate right now cannot respond, but I very much appreciate Senator \nAlexander's understanding, hard work, and support for this amendment. \nAnd I urge the rest of my colleagues to vote in favor of this important \nprovision.\n  Finally, I express my gratitude to our chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar, as well as the ranking member, \nSenator Biden, for their support, for their assistance in working \nthrough this amendment, and, hopefully, having it included as part of \nthis important bill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Recording Industry Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2003.\n     Senator George Allen,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: The Recording Industry Association of \n     America (``RIAA'') would like to express its strong support \n     for the Allen/Alexander amendment to the State Department \n     Authorization bill being considered by the Senate. The \n     amendment would authorize $10 million to the State Department \n     for purposes of working with law enforcement officials in \n     nations around the world to increase enforcement of \n     intellectual property laws.\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\n       One of the greatest challenges facing the music industry, \n     and other domestic industries that produce intellectual \n     property, is international physical piracy. In recent years, \n     the U.S. recording industry has lost nearly $5 billion in \n     revenues as a result of physical piracy around the world. \n     Although the RIAA and its sister international organization, \n     IFPI, continue to work cooperatively with diplomatic and law \n     enforcement entities throughout the world in an effort to \n     address this growing problem, the Allen/Alexander amendment \n     would significantly aid our efforts to protect American \n     intellectual property abroad.\n       We appreciate the leadership of Senators Allen and \n     Alexander and strongly support their amendment to the State \n     Department Authorization bill.\n                                                    Mitch Glazier,\n     Senior Vice President Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                The EMI Group,\n\n                                       New York, NY, July 9, 2003.\n     Senator George Allen,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of EMI--the world's third \n     largest music company--I am writing to express our support \n     for the Allen-Alexander Amendment to the Department of State \n     Authorization bill currently pending in the Senate. The \n     Allen-Alexander Amendment would authorize a State Department \n     program to finance technical support and assistance for \n     foreign governments that are combating intellectual property \n     theft.\n       As you know, many of the industries founded on intellectual \n     property are facing an international physical piracy crisis. \n     In the last few years, international physical piracy has \n     increased dramatically. Today, the pirate music market is \n     estimated to be worth more than $4 billion a year and is \n     having a substantial impact on our legitimate business. Many \n     legitimate international markets that were once vibrant are \n     being destroyed by physical, pirate product. Worldwide, about \n     40 percent of all music sold is pirate product. In countries \n     like Mexico, Taiwan, and Brazil, the piracy rates exceed 60 \n     percent. These were once countries where the record companies \n     could build successful businesses.\n       International physical piracy is having a real impact on \n     our companies. It contributed to our decision last year to \n     publicly and painfully cut our work force by about 20 \n     percent. As a result, hundreds of people were laid off in the \n     United States. Moreover, we had to pare our artist rosters by \n     one third. Other record companies have had to make similar \n     moves and have actually withdrawn from countries where they \n     once ran successful businesses--countries like Greece and \n     Paraguay.\n       EMI, the other record companies and our trade associations \n     are working hard to protect ourselves. The Recording Industry \n     Association of America has investigators throughout the \n     country--from Miami, to Chicago, to Los Angeles to New York. \n     The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has \n     hundreds of investigators worldwide. In the last 18 months, \n     due to their work, more than 60 illegal production lines with \n     a combined capacity of nearly 300 million CDs (equal to about \n     \\1/3\\ of the U.S. market and larger than the entire market in \n     France) were shut down. EMI has a high-ranking executive in \n     charge of worldwide anti-piracy efforts. We have full-time, \n     anti-piracy employees in every major EMI office worldwide.\n       But physical piracy has become the province of organized \n     crime, and we cannot fight it without government help. Asian \n     Triads and the American Mafia among other groups have been \n     linked to physical piracy. Drug gangs, arms dealers and human \n     smugglers have turned to music piracy to get quick easy money \n     for their activities. Many of these counterfeiting rings are \n     heavily armed. Our investigators and local law enforcement \n     officers risk their lives when they raid pirate operations. \n     Physical piracy involves complex, organized crime rings. They \n     move quickly and across international boundaries.\n       A U.S. program to provide financial assistance to foreign \n     governments fighting this crime will prove invaluable. It \n     will demonstrate the U.S. government's meaningful commitment \n     to protecting one of its vital industries, and it will \n     provide foreign government's with the resources they need to \n     fight this problem. Without this assistance and without U.S. \n     leadership, the problem will continue.\n       EMI is the only major record company whose sole business is \n     music. We are dedicated to making the music business work and \n     thrive. And we have a workable model to accomplish that goal. \n     We are aggressively distributing our product digitally and \n     physically. We have implemented significant measures to curb \n     rampant physical piracy, and we remain committed to \n     intensifying those efforts in the future.\n       We appreciate your leadership in this important area and \n     look forward to working with you to curtail the international \n     physical piracy that is afflicting our industry.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                                   Ivan Gavin,\n\n                                          Chief Operating Officer,\n     EMI Music, North America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Motion Picture Association\n\n\n                                             of America, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Allen: I write to you today to express our \n     support for the Allen/Alexander Amendment, which we feel will \n     prove to be a useful and effective tool in combating \n     international piracy of copyrighted works. As you are no \n     doubt aware, addressing the piracy of our creative works is \n     an issue of primary importance to us.\n       The corrosive fallout of copyright poses an ever-growing \n     hurdle, costing the film industry than $3 billion annually. \n     Piracy in the international realm is of particular concern, \n     since our industry earns approximately 40% of its revenues \n     outside of the United States. International piracy has proven \n     to be an enduring problem, threatening to eviscerate this \n     vital market. All too often studios must compete in these \n     foreign markets with illicit copies that have been illegally \n     available for months before films arrive in foreign theaters, \n     hit store shelves, or debut on the TV program guide.\n       The film industry is not the only victim vulnerable to \n     theft--an entire segment of the economy is jeopardized. The \n     piracy of America's intellectual property poses a grave \n     threat to all of the U.S. Copyright Industries. These \n     industries--movies, home video and television programming, \n     music and sound recordings, books, video games and software--\n     are a vital engine of economic growth for the American \n     economy and generate more international revenues than any \n     other single manufacturing sector, including automobiles and \n     auto parts, aircraft, and agriculture. They are responsible \n     for more than five percent of the nations' total GDP and are \n     creating new jobs at three times the rate of the rest of the \n     economy. The film industry alone has a surplus balance of \n     trade with every country in the world.\n       We feel this measure will help fight international piracy \n     and we support your efforts in addressing this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ken Inouye.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Walt Disney Company,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Senator George Allen,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: I am writing to express The Walt Disney \n     Company's support for the Allen/Alexander amendment designed \n     to provide direct assistance to non-OECD countries for the \n     purpose of combating piracy of U.S. copyrights works.\n       Copyright piracy costs the film industry more than $3 \n     billion annually. You and Senator Alexander should be \n     commended for your leadership in this effort. Staunching \n     copyright piracy both domestically, and internationally, \n     should be a paramount goal of our government. Piracy \n     undercuts the creative process and saps the strength of the \n     U.S. copyright industry, which is a leading source of job \n     creation and exports.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mitch Rose,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of the members of the \n     Business Software Alliance, I am writing in support of the \n     Allen-Alexander amendment to S. 925, the State Department \n     Authorization bill.\n       Piracy results in significant harms to the U.S. software \n     industry. BSA conducts an annual survey of software piracy \n     around the world. In 2002, our study identified an estimated \n     $13 billion in software piracy. This piracy results in lost \n     jobs and tax revenues at a time when economic growth is \n     critical to the continued success of our industry.\n       The Allen-Alexander amendment will authorize the State \n     Department to educate nations about the world about the \n     importance of copyright protection. The future growth of the \n     software industry will be predominantly overseas where IT \n     investments are still just beginning.

The Business Software Alliance conducts an annual \n     survey of software piracy around the world.

This effort to \n     authorize the State Department to educate foreign law \n     enforcement and judicial officials about piracy deserves full \n     Congressional support.\n       At Network Associates, we see piracy as a tool for \n     criminals to use for their own nefarious gain.

George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: The Interactive Digital Software \n     Association (IDSA) is the U.S. trade association dedicated to \n     serving the business and public affairs needs of companies \n     that publish interactive games for video game consoles, \n     personal computers, handheld devices, and the Internet. The \n     IDSA's members collectively accounted for more than 90 \n     percent of the entertainment software sold in the U.S. in \n     2002. IDSA operates an anti-piracy program aimed at combating \n     the global piracy of our members' products.\n       We are writing to convey our full support for S. 925 and \n     its provision for training resources for law enforcement \n     officials, prosecutors and judges in non-OECD countries. Many \n     non-OECD countries are the locales of some of the most \n     virulent piracy environments afflicting our industry, not \n     only from the standpoint of impeding the development of \n     legitimate local markets for entertainment software but also \n     frequently serving as the seedbed for the large-scale \n     manufacture and export of thousands of infringing copies to \n     destinations around the world.\n       A lack of knowledge of and appreciation for intellectual \n     property among local law enforcement officials, prosecutors \n     and even judges in many of these countries are frequently \n     material factors contributing to the ineffectiveness of \n     efforts to control and reduce the activities of local \n     pirates. There is no question that the allocation and \n     application of resources to address this problem would go a \n     long way to enhancing the productivity of local law \n     enforcement efforts targeting local pirate operations. \n     Accordingly, IDSA would like to express its full support for \n     the bill and its objectives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frederic Hirsch,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Entrust \n\n                                                     July 9, 2003.\n     Hon. George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of Entrust, Inc., I am \n     writing in support of the Allen--Alexander amendment to S. \n     925, the State Department Authorization bill.\n       As you know, piracy results in significant harm to the U.S. \n     software industry, which results in lost jobs and tax \n     revenues at a time when economic growth is critical to the \n     continued success of our industry.\n       The Allen-Alexander amendment will authorize the State \n     Department to educate nations about the importance of \n     copyright protection.

Burton,\n                               Vice President, Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the antipiracy \namendment that the Senator from Virginia just discussed and of which I \nam proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I am delighted that Senator Biden from Delaware, Senator Graham from \nSouth Carolina, and other Members of the Senate are either cosponsors \nor interested in this amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia has explained, very clearly, why this is \nimportant, why it is important to authorize the State Department to \nestablish an antipiracy program that will help foreign governments \nestablish and protect intellectual property rights. It authorizes $5 \nmillion for the program, which is an important amount, a good start, \nbut a relatively small amount in the overall bill.\n  The antipiracy program, as the Senator from Virginia explained, would \nhelp protect American intellectual property abroad by, first, providing \nequipment and training for foreign law enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights; second, train judges and prosecutors; and, third, \nassist foreign governments in complying with obligations under \nappropriate international copyright and intellectual property treaties \nand agreements.\n  We all know the importance of this. We have come to take it for \ngranted in our country. We are a country of inventors, of artists, of \nentrepreneurs, of creators. So much of our wealth and our uniqueness \ncomes from that. The Senator from Virginia knows that because of the \ntechnological progress in his State, as there is in mine. We know it in \nTennessee especially because of our musicians.\n\n  We know the importance of protecting physical property in America. \nThe owner has bought it or built it, and it belongs to them. \nIntellectual property should be treated no differently. Whether it is a \nsong or a computer program, a patent or a piece of art, someone has \ncreated it, and it should belong to him or to her until he or she \nchooses to sell it or to give it to someone else.\n  Nashville is the home of country music. Memphis is the home of the \nblues. A lot of our Tennessee music started in Bristol which spreads \nitself across the States of Virginia and Tennessee. We have strong \nfeelings about this in our part of the world.\n  The music business is suffering because of mass piracy of \nintellectual property. In the past 4 years, unit shipments of recorded \nmusic have fallen by 26 percent. In terms of sales, revenues are down \n14 percent, from $14.6 billion in 1999 to $12.6 billion last year. The \nmusic industry worldwide has gone from a $39 billion industry in 2000 \ndown to $32 billion in 2002, which is a decline of 18 percent. Much of \nthis decline is due to music piracy, most of which occurs on the \nInternet. Computer users illegally download more than 2.6 billion \ncopyrighted files, mostly songs, every month. At any given moment, \napproximately 4 to 5 million users are on line offering an estimated \n800 million files for copy.\n  According to a November 2002 survey by Peter D. Hart Research, by a \n2-to-1 margin most consumers who say they are downloading more music \nreport that they are purchasing less. Much of this problem is domestic. \nWe need to acknowledge that. But some of it also comes from abroad. \nAbout 25 percent of the total files available on unauthorized Internet \nservices are hosted outside the United States.\n  In my State of Tennessee, this theft of intellectual property hurts a \nkey sector of our economy. Nashville is home to more than 29 different \nmajor and independent record labels and 52 recording studios. It has \none of the Nation's largest concentrations of song writers, performers, \nand music publishers. An estimated 20,000 Nashvillians work in music \ntourism, broadcasting, and related fields. The city is home to more \nthan 1,500 entertainment companies. Musicians unions have more than \n5,500 members in Music City.\n  I think the Presiding Officer can understand, especially because of \nhis leadership on this issue, why protecting their intellectual \nproperty rights means more than just helping one artist earn money off \na hit record. It means protecting thousands of jobs and maintaining an \nindustry that brings joy to millions of fans in this country and around \nthe world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment which authorizes a \nsmall but important amount of money to protect intellectual property \nrights around the world.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we commend the distinguished Senators who \nhave offered this amendment and worked carefully through the text of it \nto an amendment that is acceptable to both sides. I indicate my support \nand we are prepared to accept the amendment. My understanding is that \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware,\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\nthe ranking member, is prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1144) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Foreign \nRelations Committee for their hard work on the legislation before us. \nSpecifically, I am pleased to see included in S. 925, the State \nDepartment authorization, a provision relating to the international \nmilitary education training and foreign military financing for \nIndonesia.\n  The committee has seen fit, and rightly so, to deny the release of \nany of these funds to Indonesia without certification from our \nPresident that the Indonesian Government has taken effective measures \nto conduct an investigation into the August 2002 attacks on American \ncitizens and to prosecute those responsible.\n  By now I know that my colleagues in the Senate are aware of the \ntragedy that occurred last August in West Papua, Indonesia, which \nresulted in the deaths of two Americans. Justice has still not been \nfound for Rick Spier or Ted Burgeon, and I am grateful that the Foreign \nRelations Committee has recognized the need for Indonesia and its \nmilitary apparatus to determine what has occurred. Hopefully, this \nprovision will demonstrate to the Indonesian Government that the United \nStates Senate will not allow this issue to fall to the wayside, and \nthat we remain committed to finding and punishing those responsible.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9111-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the urgent crisis \nin Liberia, and on my conviction that the United States has a role to \nplay in its resolution. I also rise to call for the kind of information \nand clarity that we need if we are to take effective action.\n  In recent days the newspapers have reminded Americans of the special \nrelationship that exists between America and the west African Republic \nof Liberia, a country founded by freed slaves from the United States in \n1820. But it is important to note the more recent historical links \nbetween our countries as well.\n  During the cold war, eager for reliable client states in Africa, the \nUnited States supported Samuel Doe when he seized control of Liberia in \na 1980 coup, and kept supporting him even when he stole the 1985 \nelections. In fact, in the first five years of the Doe regime, the \nUnited States contributed nearly $500 million in economic and military \naid--effectively bolstering the government's staying power. The Doe \nregime was an extraordinarily brutal one that not only disenfranchised \nmany Liberians, it also effectively erased the boundaries between \nlegitimate and illegitimate political action. When the cold war was \nover and Charles Taylor's band of rebels--some of them children--\nclashed with government forces and other ethnic militias in the \nstreets, the resulting conflict was so frighteningly gruesome that for \nmany it was almost impossible to understand.\n  And the United States, no longer concerned about Communist influences \nin Monrovia, simply evacuated American citizens and then watched the \ncountry tear itself apart from the sidelines. In the end, Taylor \nessentially held the country hostage to his desire for power, and war-\nweary Liberians elected him President in the hopes of avoiding \nconflict. Taylor's desire for power and wealth turned out to extend \nbeyond his own borders, however, and he became a primary patron of the \nbrutal Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, force in Sierra Leone, which \nprovided his regime with riches from Sierra Leone's diamond mines in \nexchange for military support and protection.\n  On November 2, 2001 the Washington Post ran a front-page article \nabout alleged connections between al-Qaida's financing and the illicit \nsale of diamonds mined by Liberian-backed rebels in Sierra Leone--\nrebels who, you may recall, are best known for cutting off the limbs of \ncivilians, including children, to make a political statement. Reports \nhave also linked illicit diamond sales to Hezbollah. Additional \narticles focused on notorious arms dealer Victor Bout, whose deliveries \nto the region may have been paid for in diamonds. Law enforcement \nofficials have suggested that Bout has been involved in arming \ninternational terrorists and the forces that harbor them worldwide. \nThese reports have been the subject of controversy, and the connections \nand relationships involved are murky at best, but the issue that they \nexpose--the vulnerability of weak states to exploitation by \ninternational criminals--is not in doubt.\n  Meanwhile, Taylor's criminal enterprise has proved the rule that \norder, when imposed through injustice and repression, tends to crumble, \nand the forces currently challenging the regime for power--the LURD and \nMODEL--appear to be have learned their abusive tactics from their \nenemies. Criminality rules, chaos threatens, and the civilians of \nLiberia--the people with a real interest in building a stable future, \nthe people who simply want a chance to send their children to school, \nare once again likely to be caught in the crossfire.\n  It is time for the international community to stand up and say, ``no \nmore'' to this cycle of chaos in west Africa. No more deals with thugs, \nno standing by as observers to cycles of slaughter, no more watching \nthe predictable fomenting of instability across borders, no more \nstanding by as organized crime expands its reach from the very seat of \ngovernment, no more opportunities for terrorists. Enough--because more \nof the same threatens our interests and denies our basic humanity.\n\n  The United States should take a leadership role in responding to the \nLiberian crisis. And that means that we need to clarify the costs and \ncommitments entailed in a response now, so that we can take informed \nand responsible action.\n  Recently the distinguished chair and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee indicated that they believe Congress should vote on \nany commitment of substantial forces in the region. I believe that they \nare right, and that United States troops must always be deployed in a \nmanner consistent with the War Powers Act of 1973. But I also know that \nwatching and waiting is not an option that will serve United States \ninterests.\n  In Liberia, we can and should act in concert with the international \ncommunity. In 2000, the British made a courageous decision and helped \nto bolster peacekeeping efforts in Sierra Leone, bringing an end to a \nviolent spectacle that had outraged the world without provoking an \neffective response for years.\n  The French deployed to Cote d'Ivoire when it fell victim to the \nforces of disorder, are trying to reverse the trend toward violence and \nchaos that recently gripped that once-stable place. African states have \nmobilized as well, and they continue to work feverishly to resist the \nspread of misery, deprivation, and violence that has spread throughout \nthis region. For historical reasons, most in the international \ncommunity looks to the United States for commitment and leadership in \nstabilizing Liberia, which is the country that is at the heart of this \nregional decline in West Africa. In fact, unlike the situation we \nrecently faced in Iraq, virtually the entire international community is \nurging the United States to act: from our closest allies in Britain to \nthe Secretary General of the United Nations. And most importantly, west \nAfricans themselves are asking for our help. Liberians are frantically \nwaving U.S. flags, hoping to get our attention, praying we will come to \ntheir aid. This is a not a situation that involves antagonizing allies \nin the fight against\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nterrorism--instead, it calls for cooperating with the diverse actors \naround the world who are already committed to fighting for stability in \nthe region.\n  And make no mistake, the United States is already among those actors. \nThis is not some new issue that just emerged over the last month, and \nwe are not at the precipice of deciding whether or not to get involved. \nLet us take just one example:\n  As of January 1 of this year, the United States had spent over $515 \nmillion on the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone and on Operation \nFocus Relief, which was devised to support that mission. Hundreds of \nmillions more have been appropriated and requested for this purpose in \n2003 and 2004. From the point of view of the United States taxpayer, we \nare already in quite deep.\n  There is no denying that Sierra Leone's long-term stability depends \nupon resolving the problem in Liberia. Over the July 4 recess, I sent a \nmember of my staff to Sierra Leone, and to the region in the east that \nborders Liberia and which was formerly a RUF stronghold, to assess the \nsituation. And I can tell you, from her report, that senior military \nexperts in the region have recently underscored this point.\n  The question before us now is whether or not we will protect our \ninvestment and our interests by addressing the foremost underlying \ncause of instability in the region; and that is, the criminal \nenterprise currently governing Liberia, and the violent and abusive \nmovements that have sprung up in resistance to it.\n  I have been to Liberia, and I have been to Cote d'Ivoire, and I have \nbeen to Sierra Leone. I have served on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on African Affairs since I came to the Senate \nin 1993. For over 7 years now I have served as either the chairman or \nranking member of the subcommittee. In this role, and in Africa, I have \nmet with amputees, refugees, widows and orphans. I have spoken with \nwest African heads of state and west African civil society leaders \nabout Liberia's influence on the region. I have no doubt in my mind \nthat the humanitarian catastrophe and the dangerous instability in the \nregion will not be resolved until Liberia is stabilized--and that means \nmore than replacing one thug with another.\n  During my chairmanship of the subcommittee last year, we held a \nseries of hearings focusing on the very real security threats that are \nposed by weak or failed states in Africa, including criminal networks \nlike those in Somalia or west Africa which can provide a safe haven for \nterrorist activities. After the horror of September 11, 2001, consensus \nbuilt across the political spectrum, acknowledging that the United \nStates was shortsighted when we disengaged from Afghanistan and \nPakistan once we no longer had cold war-related interests in those \ncountries. So what happened? What happened was that America left a \nvacuum in its wake, and some of the forces that moved to fill that \nvacuum came to threaten our security in ways we could not have \nimagined.\n  The very same thing is true in sub-Saharan Africa. Manifestations of \nlawlessness such as piracy, illicit air transport networks, and \ntrafficking in arms, drugs, gems and people simply beckon to those who \nwould operate in the shadows, beyond the reach of the law.\n\n  It only takes one look at the war-ravaged state of Congo today, or \nthe porous borders of west Africa, to see opportunities for those who \nwould do us harm. In 1998, al-Qaida seized that opportunity, \nperpetrating attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \nthat killed 223 people--Kenyans, Tanzanians, and Americans--and wounded \nthousands more. And unless we take action to make African societies \nless vulnerable to this kind of lawlessness rather than continuing our \npost-cold-war pattern of neglect, we may well reap the terrible \nconsequences here at home.\n  But a word of caution and a clarification are in order here. It is \ndifficult to verify links between west African chaos and international \nterrorism, in part because illicit diamonds are such effective money-\nlaundering instruments. And I am not saying that al-Qaida is in league \nwith Charles Taylor or the LURD or MODEL, and therefore we should go \nmarching into Monrovia for that reason. I have not seen any information \nthat would lead me to believe that to be true, and, frankly, I am not \ninterested in harnessing the power and the emotion bound up in the \nfight against terrorism to every other policy issue for the sake of \npolitical convenience. My goal here is to protect the American people \nand to ensure that our international action is responsible.\n  And I am not saying that the United States military should stand \npoised to intervene throughout the continent wherever disorder reigns. \nOf course not. But just as Australia, backed up by the international \ncommunity, responded to crisis in East Timor; just as Britain, backed \nup by the international community, responded to crisis in Sierra Leone; \nso too, sometimes, it falls to the United States to take a leadership \nrole.\n  Unlike the issue of Iraq that came before us last year, I am not \ntalking about starting a war with anyone in the face of widespread \ninternational opposition. Instead, I am talking about working with the \ninternational community to help stabilize a country that has fallen \ninto the hands of undisciplined bands of thugs. For unilateral action \nin the face of massive global opposition, I set the bar very high. For \naction in concert with others that will be widely welcomed, I still set \na high bar. It must be in our interest. And there are questions that \nmust be answered to my satisfaction before any intervention can meet \nwith my approval. And I remain very, very concerned about our \noverextension militarily around the world. I am neither a promilitary \nintervention Senator nor an antimilitary intervention Senator. \nAttaching ourselves to such labels is a mistake. I simply try to look \nat each situation and exercise my judgement. After years of studying \nthis situation, my judgement tells me that the United States has a \nmeaningful role to play here in Liberia.\n  And let us not forget that we are also talking about a human tragedy \nunfolding before our eyes. Tens of thousands are already displaced; \nhundreds died in fighting in Monrovia a few days ago. The quality of \nlife of civilians in Liberia contends for the title of worst in the \nworld. At some point, this has to matter. Common decency suggests that \nthe international community should act to stop the downward spiral.\n  It is time to say: no more. After visiting the region, I called \nCharles Taylor a war criminal here on the Senate floor in 2001, saying \npublicly what many had said privately for a long time. The Special \nCourt for Sierra Leone unsealed an indictment to this effect just last \nmonth. Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support the court. West \nAfrica must break the cycle of violence and impunity, and all of us in \nthe international community have a role to play in that effort. And I \nsupport President Bush, who is right to call on Charles Taylor to step \ndown, just as the Special Court for Sierra Leone was right to indict \nhim. But, let us be clear. Taylor should have no veto over \ninternationally backed U.S. action. His days of dictating the destiny \nof the west African people are over.\n  U.S. action may involve sending American troops. But before making \nthat decision, we need answers to several critical questions.\n  I have not seen the scenarios or projections for any kind of action \nor intervention that have surely been worked up by the administration. \nI should see them. We should all see them. And we should see them \nsooner rather than later. And we need answers to the questions: Will \nUnited States participation and leadership overstretch our resources? \nWhat are the costs? What commitments are we making? What is our exit \nstrategy? And, what are our plans for the coordination of long-term \nstabilization efforts?\n  Of course the answers should inform any decision about what we should \nand should not do. No one should understand my remarks today as some \nsort of ``anything goes'' endorsement of any and all proposals that may \nemerge. But I do believe that we must do something, and that we need to \nconfront these questions quickly. As I have noted, American inaction \nand indifference is not an option.

Mr. President, I am disappointed the Senate did not vote \nto move to full consideration of S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003, \nto address the national crisis our doctors, hospitals and those needing \nhealthcare face today.\n  One of the top issues we all hear about from doctors in our States is \nhow they are being squeezed financially by skyrocketing medical \nliability premiums. The Senate had a real opportunity to help remedy \nthis problem by passing the Patients First Act, but unfortunately, we \ndidn't even get a chance to fully consider and vote on this bill.\n  Not only is medical liability hurting doctors, but it is now starting \nto affect the quality and availability of care for patients. First, let \nme give a little background on the situation in Kentucky. I know many \nother States face the same situation.\n  In March of this year, Kentucky joined 17 other States on the \nAmerican Medical Association's list of ``crisis States.'' This means \nthat the current liability system is affecting patient care.\n  Physicians across my State are facing some hard choices trying to \nfigure out how to pay their rising premiums. Some are choosing to close \ntheir offices or retire early. Others are packing up and moving to \nother States with more sensible insurance regulations. Most concerning \nare reports of physicians no longer delivering babies because they \ncannot afford the liability insurance. This leaves expectant mothers in \nthe lurch and creates huge, frightening gaps in critical medical \ncoverage. In Kentucky, for example, Knox County hospital has stopped \ndelivering babies which is forcing expectant mothers to travel to \nneighboring counties for care.\n  The Kentucky Medical Association conducted a survey last year on the \neffects of rising medical malpractice premiums. They found that 70 \npercent of the physicians in Kentucky saw their premiums go up. In the \nworst example, there was a $476,000 increase for a six-physician \northopedic office that didn't have any settlements or judgements \nagainst it.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Catholic Healthcare Partners, a \nhospital system with about 30 hospitals and 8,900 affiliated physicians \nacross the country. In Kentucky, they own several hospitals, including \nLourdes Hospital in Paducah and Marcum & Wallace Memorial Hospital in \nIrvine.\n  According to Catholic Healthcare Partners, the hospital system's \nliability insurance premiums increased by 50 percent in 2001 and 70 \npercent in 2002. In fact, in the past 3 years, their premiums have \nincreased by almost $25 million. Unfortunately, Catholic Healthcare \nPartners is the rule instead of the exception.\n  In May, the Joint Economic Committee published a study on the impact \nof medical liability litigation. The report said the total premiums for \nmedical liability insurance more than doubled from 1991 to 2001 to \nreach $21 billion. Hospitals and doctors simply cannot continue keeping \ntheir doors open and treating patients if their premiums continue to \nrise this rapidly.\n  For example, Appalachian Regional Healthcare is one of the largest \nrural health systems in the country and employs 150 physicians in its \nnine hospitals and other healthcare outlets. ARH provides services in \nboth Kentucky and West Virginia, and employs most of the obstetricians \nand pediatricians in eastern Kentucky.\n  In January of this year, ARH made a decision to become completely \nself-insured. In 2001, the hospital system's key carrier for medical \nliability coverage dropped the hospital, and ARH couldn't find any \nother affordable coverage. For 2002, the bids for coverage the hospital \nreceived were $12 million to $13 million--which was more than the \nhospital system's net revenue and almost triple what they had paid the \nyear before.\n  The hospital system is now building an insurance reserve in case \nthere are any malpractice settlements against it. However, according to \nARH representatives, they realize that even one single case could \ncripple the system and its physicians.\n  There is no doubt the system is broken. And for many Kentuckians, \nespecially in our rural areas, there is no doubt skyrocketing insurance \nrates are making it harder for patients to get the quality care they \nneed. The rising premiums not only take a toll on physicians and \nhospitals, but it means you, me, and everyone in this country is paying \nmore for medical care. Very simply, individuals pay more for medical \ncare because of the increases in premiums doctors face.\n  Although all of us are paying more, some people are making out like \nbandits--usually the trial attorneys. It hardly seems that you can turn \non your television these days without seeing a commercial by one trial \nattorney or another looking for ``injured'' people. Some of these \nlawyers specialize in certain kinds of injuries while others aren't as \npicky and will take anyone involved in an accident. Most give a toll-\nfree number, and many promise that ``we won't get paid unless you get \npaid.''\n  In a report by the Department of Health and Human Services released \nlast year, it said the number of ``mega-verdicts is increasing \nrapidly,'' particularly within specialty areas of medicine. The report \ngoes on to say lawyers have an ``interest in finding the most \nattractive cases'' and they have ``an incentive to gamble on a big \n`win.' '' Finally, the report says ``lawyers have few incentives to \ntake on the more difficult cases or those of less attractive \npatients.''\n  Is this really the way we want our legal system to work? Are we \nreally getting the best results with this type of legal system? The \nanswer to both of these questions is no.\n  It seems like I have been voting for changes to our medical liability \nsystem since I have been in Congress, but we always seem to come up a \nfew votes short. The Patients First Act places some commonsense \ncontrols on lawsuits against doctors. This will help bring some control \nover the rising medical liability premiums, and doctors in my State \nwill be able to provide healthcare services.\n  For example, the bill places limits on noneconomic and punitive \ndamages, but does not limit economic damages. The bill also limits the \namount attorney's can collect from their clients depending on the size \nof the settlement. The bill requires lawsuits to be filed within 3 \nyears of the injury, although this time limit is extended to children \nunder the age of 6 who are injured.\n  Finally, the bill makes defendants liable for only their share of the \ninjury that occurred and allows periodic payment of future damages. \nThese changes could make a big difference in the availability and cost \nof healthcare in the United States and Kentucky. These changes could \nmean physicians in Kentucky thinking about leaving the state will be \nable to stay, and doctors thinking about leaving the profession will be \nable to continue practicing.\n  I am disappointed we did not have enough votes to proceed and fully \nconsider the Patients First Act, however, I am hopeful we can come back \nand revisit this important issue soon, and give our doctors, hospitals, \nand especially those needing healthcare a more affordable system with \nbetter access.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9113-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9113-S9114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF DAVID CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted to confirm \nDavid Campbell to a lifetime appointment on the United States District \nCourt for the District of Arizona. With this confirmation, we will fill \nthe sole vacancy on that court--which is actually not even vacant yet. \nMr. Campbell is nominated to a new position that will become vacant on \nJuly 15. I have been glad to work with the Senators from Arizona to \nconsider this nominee and provide bipartisan support. I congratulate \nthe nominee and his family.\n  The Senate has now confirmed 133 judges nominated by President Bush, \nincluding 26 circuit court judges. One hundred judicial nominees were \nconfirmed when Democrats acted as the Senate majority for 17 months \nfrom the summer of 2001 to adjournment last year. After today, 33 will \nhave been confirmed in the other 12 months in which Republicans have \ncontrolled the confirmation process under President\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\nBush. This total of 133 judges confirmed for President Bush is more \nconfirmations than the Republicans allowed President Clinton in all of \n1995, 1996 and 1997--the first 3 years they controlled the Senate \nprocess for President Clinton. In those 3 full years, the Republican \nleadership in the Senate allowed only 111 judicial nominees to be \nconfirmed, which included only 18 circuit court judges. We have already \nexceeded that total by 20 percent and the circuit court total by 40 \npercent with 6 months remaining to us this year. In truth, we have \nachieved all this in less than 2 years because of the delays in \norganizing and reorganizing the Senate in 2001. The Judiciary Committee \nwas not even reassigned until July 10, 2001, so we have now confirmed \n133 judges in less than 2 years.\n  In the first half of this year, the 33 confirmations is more than \nRepublicans allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session, when \nonly 17 district court judges were added to the Federal courts across \nthe Nation. In the first half of this year, with 9 circuit court \nconfirmations, we have already exceeded the average of seven per year \nachieved by Republican leadership from 1995 through the early part of \n2001. That is more circuit court confirmations in 6 months than \nRepublicans allowed confirmed in the entire 1996 session, in which \nthere were none confirmed; in all of 1997, when there were 7 confirmed; \nin all of 1999, when there were 7 confirmed; or in all of 2000, when \nthere were 8 confirmed. The Senate is moving two to three times faster \nfor this President's nominees than for President Clinton's, despite the \nfact that the current appellate court nominees are more controversial, \ndivisive and less widely-supported than President Clinton's appellate \ncourt nominees were.\n  The confirmation of David Campbell to the District Court for Arizona \nillustrates the effect of the reforms to the process that the \nDemocratic leadership has spearheaded, despite the poor treatment of \ntoo many Democratic nominees through the practice of anonymous holds \nand other obstructionist tactics employed by some in the preceding 6 \nyears. David Campbell is the fourth Federal judge confirmed from \nArizona for President Bush. Under Democratic control, the Senate \nconfirmed Judge David Bury, Judge Cindy Jorgenson and Judge Frederick \nMartone to the District Court for the District of Arizona.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995-97 or the period 1996-99. \nIn addition, the vacancies on the Federal courts around the country are \nsignificantly lower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end \nof 1997 or the 110 vacancies that Democrats inherited in the summer of \n2001. We continue well below the 67 vacancy level that Senator Hatch \nused to call ``full employment'' for the Federal judiciary. Indeed we \nhave reduced vacancies to their lowest level in the last 13 years. So \nwhile unemployment has continued to climb for Americans to 6.1 percent \nlast month, the Senate has helped lower the vacancy rate in Federal \ncourts to a historically low level that we have not witnessed in over a \ndecade. Of course, the Senate is not adjourning for the year and the \nJudiciary Committee continues to hold hearings for Bush judicial \nnominees at between two and four times as many as it did for President \nClinton's.\n  For those who are claiming that Democrats are blockading this \nPresident's judicial nominees, this is another example of how quickly \nand easily the Senate can act when we proceed cooperatively with \nconsensus nominees. The Senate's record fairly considered has been \noutstanding--especially when contrasted with the obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's moderate judicial nominees by Republicans between \n1996 and 2001.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on \nthe nomination of David Campbell to serve as a U.S. District Judge for \nthe District of Arizona.\n  I was unable to vote because I was returning to Washington, DC from \nofficial travel to Iraq in connection with my duties as a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  Had I been present, I would have supported Mr. Campbell's \nconfirmation to the district bench. After reviewing his credentials, I \nbelieve Mr. Campbell is well prepared to serve in this important \nposition and has the proper judicial temperament to fairly and justly \napply the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9114-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9114-S9115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN REMEMBRANCE OF SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the passing of a dear \nfriend and a leader in this Chamber, Strom Thurmond.\n  Strom retired this year at the age of 100--after more than a half \ncentury of serving the people of South Carolina and our Nation as U.S. \nSenator, as Governor of South Carolina, and as a State legislator. \nRemarkably, his career in the Senate spanned the administrations of 10 \npresidents--from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush.\n  His passing certainly will be felt by so many Members of this Chamber \nwho had grown accustomed to the courtly gentleman from South Carolina. \nBut his life leaves a lesson for us all--in compassion, civility, \ndedication, hard work, and respect.\n  Before he was elected to the Senate in 1954 as the only write-in \ncandidate in history to win a seat in Congress, Strom Thurmond was \nelected county school superintendent, State senator, and circuit judge \nuntil he resigned to enlist in the Army in World War II. He landed in \nNormandy as part of the 82d Airborne Division assault on D-day, and the \nstory goes, flew into France in a glider, crash-landed in an apple \norchard. He went on to help liberate Paris, and he received a Purple \nHeart, five battle stars, and numerous other awards for his World War \nII service.\n  My husband, Bob, and I were honored to have known Strom Thurmond for \nso many years and to count him among our friends. He and Bob shared a \ngreat deal of common history dating from their World War II days, and \nhis Southern gallantry always had a way of making this North Carolinian \nfeel right at home.\n  I first worked with Strom Thurmond when I served as Deputy Special \nAssistant to the President at the White House. Even then, he was an \nimpressive Senator. President Reagan praised his ``expert handling,'' \nas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, of nominees to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. In fact, it was Strom Thurmond's skill as chairman that \nhelped to shepherd through the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor as the \nNation's first female on the United States Supreme Court.\n  I always admired Strom Thurmond for his constant dedication to the \npeople of South Carolina and the industries of that State. Bob Dole has \njoked that ``Someone once asked if Strom had been around since the Ten \nCommandments.'' Bob said that couldn't have been true--if Strom \nThurmond had been around, the 11th Commandment would have been ``Thou \nshall support the textile industry.'' That industry still needs a lot \nof help. In fact, when President Reagan called Strom to wish him a \nHappy 79th birthday back in 1981, Strom Thurmond, with his constant \nattention to South Carolina interests, used the opportunity to talk to \nthe President about the textile industry.\n  Indeed, South Carolina is full of stories of how the senior senator \nfrom South Carolina managed to cut through red tape to make sure that \nhis residents got the things they needed. And whenever South \nCarolinians called--or anyone else for that matter--Strom Thurmond \ncould always be counted on to show up: at a Fourth of July parade, a \ncounty festival, or a State fair, armed with his trademark Strom \nThurmond key chains.\n  And North Carolinians developed a fondness for Strom Thurmond. He \noften flew into Charlotte before driving to his Edgefield, SC home. And \nhe became so familiar in the airport that many of the workers there \nknew him--and he knew them, often stopping to share a kind word or a \nfunny story.\n  And I was so honored that just before he went home for good, he came \nin his wheelchair, with Nancy's help, to visit me in my basement office \nand welcome me to the Senate.\n  Bob and I sent our heartfelt condolences to Strom's family: our dear \nfriend Nancy and the children, and daughter, Julie, who worked with me\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\nat the Red Cross. He was a loving husband, proud father, and a new \ngrandfather. And, of course, he loved the people of South Carolina--for \nwhom he worked tirelessly throughout his career in public service, and \nto whom he chose to return when his work was done in the Senate.\n  Today, as I remember him, his life, and his legacy, I think of the \nBible in the 25th Chapter of Matthew, when the Lord said, ``Well done, \nthou good and faithful servant. . . . Enter thou into the joy of the \nLord.''\n  May God bless him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9115-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a series of terrible crimes that occurred in \nAshton, MD. During September 2001, an Arab-American homemaker was \nattacked and her property vandalized by a female neighbor. The neighbor \nspread feces across the Arab Americans' porch three times, pelted the \nhome with dead plants, and doused the woman with liquid. The neighbor \ndoused the Arab-American woman a second time, this time with bleach, \nwhich burned the victim's skin and discolored her clothes.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9115-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9115-S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JUDGES ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, earlier this year, the House Republicans \nsaddled the bipartisan, non-controversial AMBER Alert bill with \nnumerous unrelated and ill-conceived provisions, collectively known as \nthe ``Feeney amendment,'' that effectively overturned the basic \nstructure of the carefully crafted sentencing guideline system. At the \ntime, we were warned by distinguished jurists that these provisions \nwould irrevocably harm our sentencing system and compromise justice. \nFor example, the Nation's Chief Justice warned that the Feeney \namendment, if enacted, ``would do serious harm to the basic structure \nof the sentencing guideline system and would seriously impair the \nability of courts to impose just and responsible sentences.'' Despite \nsuch objections, and without any serious process in the House or \nSenate, these provisions were pushed through conference with minor \nchanges and enacted.\n  We are now beginning to witness the far-reaching impact of this \nfolly. Not only have we compromised the sentencing system, but we have \nalienated and minimized the effectiveness of our Federal judges, \nprompting at least one to announce early retirement.\n  As enacted, the Feeney amendment, substantially reversed provisions \nallowing Federal judges to depart from sentencing guidelines when \njustice requires. It also created a ``black list'' of judges who impose \nsentences that the Justice Department does not like, and limited the \nnumber of Federal judges who can serve on the Sentencing Commission, \nthus reducing the influence of practical judicial experience on \nsentencing decisions.\n  In response, in a June 24 op-ed in the New York Times, Republican-\nappointed district judge and former Federal prosecutor, John S. Martin, \nJr., decried these provisions as ``an assault on judicial \nindependence,'' ``at odds with the sentencing philosophy that has been \na hallmark of the American system of justice,'' and tragically, the \nimpetus for his decision to retire from the bench, rather than exercise \nhis option to continue in a lifetime position with a reduced workload. \n``When I took my oath of office 13 years ago I never thought I would \nleave the Federal bench. . . . I no longer want to be part of our \nunjust criminal justice system.''\n  It is shameful that we have allowed such half-baked, poorly-crafted \nlegislation to lead to the loss of a judge that has dedicated his \ncareer to fighting crime and preserving justice. When he was appointed \nby the first President Bush in 1990, Judge Martin brought with him to \nthe bench years of knowledge and experience as a Federal prosecutor, \nincluding 3 years as a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New \nYork. As a former Federal prosecutor, he is no slouch on crime. He \nknows very well the importance of vigorously pursuing and punishing \nwrong-doers. But his experience has also taught him that these goals \ncannot trounce the equally-critical pursuit of justice and fairness.\n  Unless we reverse the damaging provisions in the Feeney amendment, we \nwill continue to compromise justice, alienate Federal judges, and \nthreaten the stability and integrity of our judicial system. That is \nwhy I joined Senators Kennedy, Feingold, and Lautenberg in introducing \nthe Judicial Use of Discretion to Guarantee Equity in Sentencing Act of \n2003, or the JUDGES Act. This bill would correct the Feeney amendment's \nfar-reaching provisions by restoring judicial discretion and allowing \njudges to impose just and responsible sentences. In addition, the \nJUDGES Act would reverse the provisions limiting the number of Federal \njudges who can serve on the Sentencing Commission. Finally, the JUDGES \nAct would follow through on the advice of Chief Justice Rehnquist to \nengage in a ``thorough and dispassionate inquiry'' on the Federal \nsentencing structure by directing the Sentencing Commission to conduct \na comprehensive study on sentencing departures and report to Congress \nwith 180 days.\n  In his New York Times op-ed, Judge Martin raised another important \npoint: Limiting judicial discretion and involvement in sentencing \npractices also reduces the personal satisfaction that judges derive \nfrom knowing that they are integrally involved in promoting a more just \nsociety, and in doing so removes a powerful incentive that prompts \npotential judges to accept a judicial appointment, despite inadequate \npay. ``When I became a Federal judge, I accepted the fact that I would \nbe paid much less than I could earn in private practice. . . . I \nbelieved I would be compensated by the satisfaction of serving the \npublic good--the administration of justice. In recent years, however, \nthis sense has been replaced by the distress I feel at being part of a \nsentencing system that is unnecessarily cruel and rigid.''\n  We all know that judicial pay is a challenging issue. Indeed, this is \nwhy I introduced a bill, S. 787, to restore the many cost of living \nadjustments that Congress has failed to provide the judiciary, and have \njoined Chairman Hatch and many other members of the Judiciary Committee \nin sponsoring S. 1023 to increase the annual salaries of Federal judges \nand justices. I encourage my colleagues to support these efforts. But I \nask them not to make the challenge of judicial pay worse by taking away \nthe intangible compensation that is the satisfaction from serving the \npublic good. Unfortunately, the Feeney amendment has done just that.\n  I again urge my colleagues to support the JUDGES Act, and I ask \nunanimous consent that Judge Martin's June 24 op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 24, 2003]\n\n                        Let Judges Do Their Jobs\n\n                        (By John S. Martin Jr.)\n\n       I have served as a federal judge for 13 years. Having \n     reached retirement age, I now have the option of continuing \n     to be a judge for the rest of my life, with a reduced \n     workload, or returning to private practice. Although I find \n     my work to be interesting and challenging, I have decided to \n     join the growing number of federal judges who retire to join \n     the private sector.\n       When I became a federal judge, I accepted the fact that I \n     would be paid much less than I could earn in private \n     practice; judges make less than second-year associates at \n     many law firms, and substantially less than a senior Major \n     League umpire. I believed I would be compensated by the \n     satisfaction of serving the public good--the administration \n     of justice. In recent years, however, this sense has been \n     replaced by the distress I feel at being part of a sentencing \n     system that is unnecessarily cruel and rigid.\n       For most of our history, our system of justice operated on \n     the premise that justice in sentencing is best achieved by \n     having a sentence imposed by a judge who, fully informed \n     about the offense and the offender, has discretion to impose \n     a sentence within the statutory limits. Although most judges \n     and legal\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\n     scholars recognize the need for discretion in sentencing, \n     Congress has continually tried to limit it, initially through \n     the adoption of mandatory-minimum sentencing laws.\n       Congress's distrust of judicial discretion led to the \n     adoption in 1984 of the Sentencing Reform Act, which created \n     the United States Sentencing Commission. The commission was \n     created on the premise, not unreasonable, that uniformity in \n     sentencing nationwide could be promoted if judges and other \n     criminal law experts provided guidelines for federal judges \n     to follow in imposing sentences. However, Congress has tried \n     to micromanage the work of the commission and has undermined \n     its efforts to provide judges with some discretion in \n     sentencing or to ameliorate excessively harsh terms.\n       For example, when an extensive study demonstrated that \n     there was no justification for treating crack cocaine as 100 \n     times more dangerous than powdered cocaine, the ratio adopted \n     by Congress in fixing mandatory minimum sentences, the \n     commission proposed reducing the guideline ratios. However, \n     the proposal was withdrawn when Congressional leaders made it \n     clear that Congress would overrule it.\n       Congress's most recent assault on judicial independence is \n     found in amendments that were tacked onto the Amber Alert \n     bill, which President Bush signed into law on April 30. These \n     amendments are an effort to intimidate judges to follow \n     sentencing guidelines.\n       From the outset, the sentencing commission recognized the \n     need to avoid too rigid an application of the guideline \n     system and provided that judges would have the power to \n     adjust sentences when circumstances in an individual case \n     warranted. The recent amendments require the commission to \n     amend the guidelines to reduce such adjustments and require \n     that every one be reported to Congress. They also require \n     that departures by district judges be reviewed by the \n     appellate courts with little deference to the sentencing \n     judge.\n       Congress's disdain for the judiciary is further manifested \n     in a provision that changes the requirement that ``at least \n     three'' of the seven members of the sentencing commission be \n     federal judges to a restriction that ``no more than'' three \n     judges may serve on it. Apparently Congress believes \n     America's sentencing system will be jeopardized if more than \n     three members of the commission have actual experience in \n     imposing sentences.\n       Every sentence imposed affects a human life and, in most \n     cases, the lives of several innocent family members who \n     suffer as a result of a defendant's incarceration. For a \n     judge to be deprived of the ability to consider all of the \n     factors that go into formulating a just sentence is \n     completely at odds with the sentencing philosophy that has \n     been a hallmark of the American system of justice.\n       When I took my oath of office 13 years ago I never thought \n     that I would leave the federal bench. While I might have \n     stayed on despite the inadequate pay, I no longer want to be \n     part of our unjust criminal justice system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9116-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERAN'S MEMORIAL\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

A \nbeautiful memorial in Saline County, AK, has been built, and will be \ndedicated on July 10, to honor those who have protected and served our \ncountry. All service men and women are being honored, including my \nfather, who served in Korea. He taught me at a very early age to have \ntremendous respect for those who have fought to defend our freedom. Not \nonly will this memorial honor our veterans, it will also remind future \ngenerations of the sacrifices that were made for this great country.\n  I also wish to recognize those who brought this day together for our \nVeterans. Judge Lanny Fite, State Representative Dwight Fite, the \nSaline County Veteran's Board, Jack McCray, Gary Ballard, and many \nothers have given of themselves to make this memorial possible. I am \ngrateful for their efforts to honor the men and women who serve our \nNation in uniform. This memorial is a fitting tribute of which Saline \nCounty and our entire State can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9116-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          HONORING THE GENERAL MOTORS CORVETTE ASSEMBLY PLANT\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have the privilege and honor of \nrising today to recognize the hard work of those at the Corvette \nassembly plant in Bowling Green, KY, on the 50th anniversary of the \nCorvette.\n  America's love for the Corvette began in 1953, when the first \nAmerican sports car took over the highways. Since then, the automotive \nindustry has never been the same. Kentucky became part of this American \nicon in 1981, when an old air-conditioner manufacturing plant, located \nin western Kentucky, was converted into an automobile assembly plant. \nThe Bowling Green plant holds the proud honor of being the sole \nCorvette producer. Another state-of-the-art renovation in 1996 once \nagain placed the Bowling Green plant on the road to excellence in \npreparation for production of the latest Corvettes.\n  Each year, milestone after milestone, and award on top of award, the \nBowling Green plant consistently shines. For 2 years Corvettes produced \nin Kentucky have captured Motor Trend Magazine's highly respected ``Car \nof the Year'' designation. In 1992, the Bowling Green plant produced \nthe one-millionth Corvette.\n  However, the secret of their success lies in the hard work and \ndetermination of the Bowling Green team. Without skillful minds and \ndriven hands, innovative ideas and quality-built cars would never come \nto fruition.\n  It is not often we have the chance to honor such a milestone. Please \njoin me in congratulating all those who have worked at the General \nMotors Bowling Green assembly plant. I am pleased they are continuing \nthe Corvette tradition with a Kentucky touch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/09/senate-section/article/S9116-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S FISCAL YEAR 2004 BUDGET REQUEST ACT--PM 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with my constitutional authority and sections 202(c) and \n(e) of the District of Columbia Financial Management and Responsibility \nAssistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of the District of Columbia \nSelf-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am \ntransmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Request \nAct.\n  The proposed Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Request Act reflects the major \nprogrammatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of \nColumbia.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of veterans who became disabled for life while \nserving in the Armed Forces of the United States; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nVeterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act of 2003. This bill \nwill authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a commemorative \ncoin honoring the millions of veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who \nwere disabled while serving our country. Revenues from the surcharge on \nthe coin would go to the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to \nhelp cover the costs of building the American Veterans Disabled for \nLife Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  The three-acre site for the Memorial is located on Washington Avenue \nat 2nd Street, SW., across from the U.S. Botanic Gardens, and in full \nview of the U.S. Capitol Building. Federal legislation for the \nMemorial, Public Law 106-348, was signed into law by President Bill \nClinton on October 24, 2000. Sponsors included Senator John McCain, \nSenator Max Cleland, Congressman Sam Johnson, and Congressman Jack \nMurtha. The National Capital Planning Commission unanimously approved \nthe Capitol Hill location on October 10, 2001.\n  The mission of the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation is to \ncommemorate the selfless and continuing sacrifice of America's 2.3 \nmillion living disabled veterans, ensuring they will always be \nremembered; to provide all Americans with a place to express their \nappreciation for the men and women who came home from war bearing the \nscars of our great Nation's defense, and to serve as an eternal \nreminder of disabled veterans' honor, service, and sacrifice.\n  Recent events have brought about a renewed reverence and respect for \nthe men and women who gave so much in service of our Nation. This \nlegislation would help bring national attention to America's disabled \nveterans, and would serve as a fitting tribute to their sacrifice.\n  The Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation was co-founded in 1996 \nby the Lois Pope Life Foundation and the Disabled American Veterans. \nLois Pope, one of America's leading philanthropists, is the founder and \nPresident of the Lois Pope Leaders in Furthering Education Foundation. \nIn addition to supporting veterans programs, this organization provides \nawards for medical research, scholarships, and summer camp programs. \nFormed in 1920, the Disabled American Veterans is a nonprofit \norganization representing America's disabled veterans, their families, \nand survivors.\n  The drive to build the Memorial, which is scheduled for completion \nwithin the next several years, is well under way, but has a long way to \ngo. Prominent national figures including Retired Army General H. Norman \nSchwarzkopf, Poet Laureate Dr. Maya Angelou, and New York Giants star \ndefensive end Michael Strahan are lending their support to this effort.\n  We have an obligation to assure that men and women who each day \nendure the cost of freedom are never forgotten. The American Veterans \nDisabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act of 2003 will honor these \nveterans and help fund the American Veterans Disabled for Life \nMemorial. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting \nAmerica's disabled veterans with this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to distribute universal service support equitably \nthroughout rural America, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise in support of fairness for \nrural America and introduce the Rural Universal Service Equity Act of \n2003.\n  Universal service is a decades old Federal program intended to keep \ntelephone service available and affordable across America. The Federal \nUniversal Service Program has been a tremendous success. America's \ntelephone network is the envy of the world. However, the program faces \nchallenges, and it is imperfect.\n  The Rural Universal Service Equity Act addresses an inequity in the \nway Universal Service support is distributed to rural customers served \nby larger phone companies. Under the program, only eight States receive \nfunding. Three of those States receive more than 80 percent of the \nfunds and one State receives more than half of all dollars available \nunder the program.\n  Yet many of the most rural States in America the very States the \nprogram was intended to assist--receive no funding at all. North \nDakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Iowa, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, \nNebraska and other rural States receive no funding under this program.\n  My State of Oregon is an example of the unfairness of the program. \nOregon has an average of 36 residents per square mile, according to \nU.S. Census Bureau data. Oregon has many rural and remote areas but \ndoes not receive any funding under this program for larger carriers. \nHowever, States with between 60 and 101 residents per square mile or \nmore than twice the density of Oregon--receive 90 percent of the \nfunding.\n  How could this happen? When the FCC created this program in 1999, it \ndetermined which States would be eligible for funding by comparing the \naverage cost of providing telephone service per line in each State to a \nbenchmark tied to the national average cost per line. If a State's \naverage cost of service per line exceeded the benchmark, that State \nwould be eligible for funding. If the average cost was below the \nnational benchmark, it would not be eligible.\n  This method is skewed, in part, because telephone service in a \nmetropolitan area is less expensive to provide than service in a rural \narea. Customers in cities are closer to one another, and the same \nfacilities can serve more people at a lower cost.\n  As a consequence, if you are served by a larger carrier and you live \nin a State with a city--no matter how rural an area, or no matter how \nfar from the city you live--your State probably receives no support.\n  This problem is exacerbated because the FCC formula also doesn't \nfully account for the actual cost of providing service in rural areas \nwith natural obstacles such as mountains, lakes and rivers.\n  In short, the formula is flawed, and the result is unfair to millions \nin rural America: Three States that are not among the 15 least \npopulated States--receive more than 80 percent of the fund.\n  The Rural Universal Service Equity Act of 2003 would make this \nprogram fair. The Act directs the FCC to replace the current state-wide \naverage formula with a new formula that distributes funds to telephone \ncompany wire centers with the highest cost.\n  Wire centers are the telephone facilities where all of the telephone \nlines in a given area converge. And because funds would be directed to \nhigh-cost wire centers, as opposed to States with the highest average \ncosts, rural residents would no longer be penalized if they lived in a \nState with a city hundreds of miles away.\n  The Act also: directs the FCC to develop rules to implement a program \nthat is equitable among States; delegates to the FCC the determination \nof what an appropriate benchmark for what a high cost wire center \nshould be; directs the FCC to not increase the size of the current \nprogram for high cost carriers; ensures a minimum level of support for \nStates that currently receive funding under the program; and\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\nrequires GAO to study and report back to Congress on the need for \ncomprehensive universal service reform.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the Universal Service Program has \nchallenges beyond the inequities of the program for larger carriers. I \nlook forward to participating in the broader debate on how to reform \nthe Universal Service Program and ensure its long term viability and \neffectiveness. This bill will help further that debate.\n  However, broadly reforming the Universal Service Program is complex \nand divisive. It may take years. And I do not believe the inequities of \nthe program for larger carriers should be allowed to continue while \nCongress grapples with the broader issues. Millions of rural Americans \nare being disserved, and we can solve this one problem today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and support the Rural Universal \nService Equity Act of 2003. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1380\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Communications Commission's high cost \n     program for certain carriers provides no Federal support to \n     42 States.\n       (2) Federal universal service support should be calculated \n     and targeted to small geographic regions within a State to \n     provide greater assistance to the rural consumers most in \n     need of support.\n       (3) Local telephone competition and emerging technologies \n     are threatening the viability of Federal universal service \n     support.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To begin consideration of universal service reform.\n       (2) To spread the benefits of the existing Federal high \n     cost support mechanism more equitably across the nation.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REPORT ON NEED TO REFORM HIGH \n                   COST SUPPORT MECHANISM.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the need to reform the high cost support mechanism \n     for rural, insular, and high cost areas. As part of the \n     report, the Comptroller General shall provide an overview and \n     discuss whether--\n       (1) existing Federal and State high cost support mechanisms \n     ensure rate comparability between urban and rural areas;\n       (2) the Federal Communications Commission and the States \n     have taken the necessary steps to remove implicit support;\n       (3) the existing high cost support mechanism has affected \n     the development of local competition in urban and rural \n     areas; and\n       (4) amendments to section 254 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 254) are necessary to preserve and advance \n     universal service.\n\n     SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT FOR HIGH \n                   COST AREAS.\n\n       Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     254) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(m) Universal Service Support for High Cost Areas.--\n       ``(1) Calculating support.--In calculating Federal \n     universal service support for eligible telecommunications \n     carriers that serve rural, insular, and high cost areas, the \n     Commission shall, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), revise \n     the Commission's support mechanism for high cost areas to \n     provide support to each wire center in which the incumbent \n     local exchange carrier's average cost per line for such wire \n     center exceeds the national average cost per line by such \n     amount as the Commission determines appropriate for the \n     purpose of ensuring the equitable distribution of universal \n     service support throughout the United States.\n       ``(2) Hold harmless support.--In implementing this \n     subsection, the Commission shall ensure that no State \n     receives less Federal support calculated under paragraph (1) \n     than the State would have received, up to 10 percent of the \n     total support distributed, under the Commission's support \n     mechanism for high cost areas as in effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this subsection.\n       ``(3) Limitation on total support to be provided.--The \n     total amount of support for all States, as calculated under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2), shall be equivalent to the total \n     support calculated under the Commission's support mechanism \n     for high cost areas as in effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this subsection.\n       ``(4) Construction of limitation.--The limitation in \n     paragraph (3) shall not be construed to preclude fluctuations \n     in support on the basis of changes in the data used to make \n     such calculations.\n       ``(5) Implementation.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this subsection, the Commission \n     shall complete the actions (including prescribing or amending \n     regulations) necessary to implement the requirements of this \n     subsection.\n       ``(6) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     `Commission's support mechanism for high cost areas' means \n     sections 54.309 and 54.311 of the Commission's regulations \n     (47 CFR 54.309, 54.311), and regulations referred to in such \n     sections.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. NO EFFECT ON RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the \n     support provided to an eligible telecommunications carrier \n     under section 214(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 214(e)) that is a rural telephone company (as defined \n     in section 3 of such Act (47 U.S.C. 153)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Smith, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Miller, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Collins, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Shelby,  and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1381. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \ncertain provisions relating to the treatment of forestry activities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reforestation \nTax Act of 2003, and I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lincoln, \nSmith, Breaux, Miller, Chambliss, Pryor, Collins, Landrieu, Shelby and \nCraig.\n  The U.S. forest products industry is essential to the health of the \nU.S. economy. It employs approximately 1.5 million people, supports an \nannual payroll of $40.8 billion, and ranks among the top ten \nmanufacturing employers in 46 States. This includes the State of Maine \nwhere 89.2 percent of the land is forested. Without fair tax laws, \nfuture growth in the industry will occur overseas and more and more \nlandowners will be forced to sell their land for some other higher \neconomic value such as development. The loss of a health and strong \nforest products industry will have a long-term negative impact on both \nthe economy and the environment.\n  The legislation I am introducing today partially restores the balance \nbetween corporate and private landowners in terms of capital gains tax \ntreatment by reducing the capital gains paid on timber for individuals \nand corporations. The bill is also intended to encourage the \nreforestation of timberland, whether it has been harvested or \npreviously cleared for other uses, such as agriculture.\n  Trees take a long time to grow, anywhere from 15 years to, more \ntypically in Maine, 40 to 50 years. During these years, the grower \nfaces huge risks from fire, pests, weather and inflation, all of which \nare uninsurable. This legislation helps to mitigate these risks by \nproviding a sliding scale reduction in the amount of taxable gain based \non the number of years the asset is held.\n  Specifically, the bill would change the way that capital gains are \ncalculated for timber by taking the amount of the gain and subtracting \nthree percent for each year the timber was held. The reduction would be \ncapped at 50 percent bringing the effective capital gains tax rate to \n7.5 percent for most non-corporate holdings and 17.5 percent for \ncorporations.\n  Since 1944, the tax code has treated timber as a capital asset, \nmaking it eligible for the capital gains tax rate rather than the \nordinary income tax rate. This recognized the long-term risk and \ninflationary gain in timber. Tax bill enacted in 1997 and in 2003 \nlowered the capital gains rate for individuals, but not for \ncorporations. As a result, individuals face a maximum capital gains \nrate of 15 percent, while corporations face a maximum rate of 35 \npercent for the identical asset.\n  As this difference in rates implies, non-corporate timberland owners \nreceive far more favorable capital gains tax treatment than corporate \nowners. In addition, pension funds and other tax-exempt entities are \nalso investing in timberland, which only further highlights the \ndisparity that companies face.\n  Secondly, reforestation expenses are currently taxed at a higher rate \nin the U.S. than in any other major competitor country. The U.S. \ndomestic forest products industry is already struggling to survive \nintense competition from the Southern Hemisphere where labor and fiber \ncosts are extremely low, and recent investments from wealthier nations \nwho have built state of the art\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\npulp and papermaking facilities. While there is little Congress can do \nto change labor and fiber costs, Congress does have the ability to \nlevel the playing field when it comes to taxation.\n  This legislation encourages both individuals and companies to engage \nin increased reforestation by allowing all growers of timber to deduct \nall reforestation expenses in the year such costs are incurred. \nCurrently, only the first $10,000 of reforestation expenses is eligible \nfor a ten percent tax credit and can be amortized over seven years.\n  Eligible reforestation expenses are the initial expenses to establish \na new stand of trees, such as site preparation, the cost of the \nseedlings, the labor costs required to plant the seedlings and to care \nfor the trees in the first few years, as well as the cost of equipment \nused in reforestation.\n  The planning of trees should be encouraged rather than discouraged by \nour tax system as trees provide a tremendous benefit to the \nenvironment, preventing soil erosion, cleansing streams and waterways, \nproviding habitat for numerous species, and absorbing carbon dioxide \nfrom the atmosphere.\n  Tax incentives for planting on private lands will also decrease \npressure to obtain timber from ecologically sensitive public lands, \nallowing these public lands to be protected.\n  Finally, the bill would notify the passive loss rules for small, \nclosely-held landowners to allow them to deduct normal operating \nexpenses pertaining to management of their timber lands.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support for private landowners and for \nthe U.S. forest products industry that is so important to the health of \nthe our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1384. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide \nState and local authorities a means by which to eliminate congestion on \nthe Interstate System; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as the month of August nears and the \nremaining summer days dwindle, many Americans are turning their \nattention to the highway as they plan family vacations and road trips, \nsetting their sights on destinations that may be close to home or \nseveral States away. As they plot their travel plans, they must take \ninto account several road-related factors, including, what route to \ntake, which highway to use and how long it will take to get to their. \nRoad safety, highway quality and congestion will undoubtedly be major \nconsiderations that will enter this equation.\n  In addition to personal mobility, roads also serve as the backbone of \nthe national economy. Our economic success depends on a sound \ntransportation system that efficiently carries goods to and from the \nmarketplace. We must work diligently throughout the upcoming highway \nre-authorization to provide a policy framework that facilitates access \nto both markets for goods and places for people.\n  It is for these reasons, among others, that I rise today to introduce \nthe Freeing Alternatives to Speedy Transportation Act, or for short, \nthe FAST Act--legislation that will ease and alleviate traffic \ncongestion, increase highway capacity, decrease pollution and improve \nthe quality of life for millions of Americans. The legislation has \nalready been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman \nKennedy of Minnesota. His bi-partisan version of the bill has gained \nstrong support and momentum, and I thank him for his leadership on \ntransportation matters.\n  It is easy to say how important our roads are to our success. But the \nquestion that has everyone stumped is how to pay for it all. We must \nlook to creative policies that place the State in the drivers seat \ntoward ending the transportation funding dilemma--policies that \ncapitalize on user choice and private financing. The FAST Act provides \njust that--flexibility and innovation to move forward with important \nInterstate highway expansion projects--projects that would not be \npossible with out the FAST Act--to ease congestion and alleviate the \nstrain on our roads.\n  The FAST Act removes the obstacles that prevent States from \ncollecting user fees on Interstate highway expansion projects. It \nallows a State to create an authority that collects user fees to \nfinance expansion lanes on Interstates, while building in several \nprotective measures that boost consumer confidence and protection. The \nfees are collected only on the expansion land--the existing lanes \nremain open and free of charge. Fees can be used only for the \nconstruction of the FAST lane and accompanying structures--the money \ncannot be diverted to other accounts or projects. It allows the State \nto collect, as part of the fee, a maintenance reserve for that lane, \nand guarantees that the fee will be removed once the project is paid \noff. In other words, the fee pays for the project, ends, and the FAST \nlane then becomes available to everyone free of the fee. While I \nrealize this bill is but one avenue in bridging our highway policy \nneeds, the options it opens through user-choice and dedicated funding \nwill promote sound State planning and decision making.\n  The FAST Act has the support of the Colorado Department of \nTransportation, think tanks, State governments and many others who hope \nto find new ways to expend highways. Tom Norton, Executive Director of \nthe Colorado Department of Transportation, wrote in support of the FAST \nAct, ``With nationwide transportation needs continually increasing, \nFederal Government, as well as the States, must seek new funding \nsources to keep up with this demand. This needed legislation provides \nStates the ability to explore a new source in order to fund highway \nexpansion.'' In addition to the backing the legislation has received \nfrom the Colorado Department of Transportation, both the Minnesota and \nWashington DOTs support the bill as well.\n\n  Earlier this week, the Joint Economic Committee released a white \npaper, noting ``roads are deteriorating while congestion worsens every \nyear.'' The paper highlights the FAST Act as a new funding mechanism \nfor highways, noting that many economists believe that the new \nauthorization bill should grant the states more flexibility in raising \nmoney for funding transportation projects. It concludes by stating that \nthe FAST Act is a modest measure that can help bridge the financing \nchasm.\n  Numerous organizations and associations across the country have \neither endorsed the FAST Act or have strong and positive interest in \nthe legislation. These groups include: Americans for Tax Reform, \nAmerican Highway Users Alliance, Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica, National Taxpayers Union, Association for Commuter \nTransportation, and the American Association of State and Highway \nTransportation Officials.\n  As the population of the United States continues to surge and miles \ntraveled by automobiles increase every year, transportation planners \nmust find new and innovative ways to expand highway congestion. With \ntoday's budget crisis, this task becomes even more formidable as States \nlook for new ways to stretch every dollar. The FAST Act give States one \nmore tool in their battle against congestion. It creates a new source \nof revenue through user choice. It give them flexibility in managing \nconstruction and maintenance, encourages public-private partnerships \nand speeds traffic through a series of electronic gateways instead of \ncreating logjams at toll booths. It is one more tool in the toolbox of \ninnovative finance options that will lead to a more efficient, safer \nhighway system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that supporting documents and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                 Department of Transportation,\n\n                                       Denver, CO, April 25, 2003.\n     Hon.

Con. Res. 95.\n\n                  a new funding mechanism for highways\n\n       There are other ways to fund transportation spending \n     increases that should be explored. For instance, many \n     economists believe a new transportation authorization bill \n     should grant the states more flexibility in raising money for \n     funding transportation projects. To that end, Reps. Mark \n     Kennedy (R-MN) and Adam Smith (D-WA) have proposed the \n     Freeing Alternatives for Speedy Transportation (FAST) Act \n     (H.R. 1767). The bill would remove the current prohibition on \n     tolls for federal highways, as well as ensure that states \n     wouldn't be penalized for coming up with innovative ways to \n     fund transportation construction. While toll lanes alone \n     cannot make up the projected shortfall between the various \n     spending proposals and revenues that will be generated by the \n     gas tax, the judicious use of tolls would raise significant \n     revenue.\n\n\n                 efficient tolls can reduce congestion\n\n       Ideally, the toll charge would vary based on the current \n     congestion level on the road--the more cars on the road, the \n     higher the price of the toll lane. As the toll increases, \n     drivers will change their behavior; when the toll is \n     relatively high people will use car pools, take mass transit, \n     or postpone unnecessary trips. In high-traffic corridors the \n     market can pay the bulk of the cost of constructing and \n     maintaining the road.\n       Since roads are not continuously congested, variable tolls \n     reduce traffic and spread it out more evenly over the course \n     of the day. In essence, properly managed fares can reduce the \n     level of lane expansion necessary by maximizing the \n     efficiency of the current infrastructure. The idea of \n     variable pricing for toll lanes is the same principle that \n     dictates lower ticket prices for movie matinees and discounts \n     for ``early bird'' dining specials at restaurants: price \n     differentials over the course of a day can alleviate crowds.\n       Regardless of the degree of success, innovative congestion \n     pricing would not come close to alleviating the need for new \n     roads. Most large cities desperately need new and improved \n     highways to deal with the immense increases in traffic that \n     have occurred in recent years.\n\n\n                          Tollbooths are passe\n\n       When most people think of tolls they associate it with long \n     queues of cars waiting to pay 50 cents to cross a bridge, \n     thereby increasing congestion on roads. In reality, leaps in \n     tolling technology have made cumbersome tollbooths \n     unnecessary. Today, cars can use transponders to \n     electronically pay tolls without stopping the flow of \n     traffic. Transponders are inexpensive and the tolling \n     authority often provides them at no cost to drivers. Drivers \n     can either receive a monthly bill or else pre-pay \n     (anonymously, should they wish) for a certain number of \n     trips.\n       Proposals, like the FAST Act, encourage states to take \n     advantage of this innovative technology by allowing them to \n     toll new lanes on the federal interstate provided that they \n     use an electronic tolling system.\n\n\n                    Tolls are not the same as taxes\n\n       Some politicians resist any legislation that might lead to \n     an expansion of tolled lanes on the principle that tolls \n     merely represent a new form of taxation. However, it is \n     important to note that tolling is not just another name for a \n     tax. When used on newly built lanes financed by toll \n     revenues, tolls serve as a voluntary access charge for \n     drivers who choose to use a lane that is less congested. In \n     essence, when people use a toll lane they are buying time.\n       Dedicated toll lanes function much the same as FedEx and \n     other next-day shipping companies. Someone wishing to send a \n     package via U.S. mail can do so at an inexpensive price, but \n     the delivery will take longer and the ultimate delivery date \n     will be less predictable. However, someone who absolutely \n     needs a package delivered overnight can guarantee an on-time \n     delivery by paying extra and using FedFx.\n       Those who worry that states will exploit tolls to fund \n     revenue shortfalls by gouging citizens should be heartened to \n     know that the FAST Act specifically addresses this temptation \n     in its legislation. The FAST Act requires that all revenues \n     raised from tolls be dedicated only to the lanes where the \n     tolls are collected. States are also constrained from \n     charging unreasonably high access charges by the marketplace. \n     Because tolls are added only on new lanes, drivers will \n     always have a choice whether or not to pay the toll. If the \n     toll is set at a price drivers are not willing to pay, the \n     newly added lane will be underutilized, costing the state \n     potential revenue and drawing the ire of its citizens.\n\n\n                        tolling success stories\n\n       Various permutations of congestion pricing have been in \n     place since Singapore's Area Licensing Scheme was introduced \n     in 1975. With electronic tolling, Singapore managed to reduce \n     the number of single drivers and better utilized its road \n     capacity by distributing trips more evenly throughout the \n     day.\n       Domestically, there have been several value pricing \n     projects established under the Value Pricing Pilot program. \n     Perhaps the most successful pilot project is the High \n     Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes on Interstate 15 in San Diego. The \n     program allowed two lanes, previously reserved for carpools \n     with at least two passengers, to provide access to all \n     drivers willing to pay a toll to enter the lane. The toll was \n     set at a level so as to ensure that traffic in the lanes \n     traveled near the speed limit.\n       The project was immensely successful and led to several \n     dramatic improvements in road performance. The number of \n     people carpooling increased and rates of carpooling \n     violations decreased. Drivers believed that the toll lanes \n     were safer and more reliable. Revenues generated were high \n     enough that an express bus was added to I-15, providing \n     another alternative for commuters. An overwhelming 94 percent \n     of transit riders, 92 percent of carpoolers, and over 70 \n     percent of all commuters felt that congestion pricing was a \n     ``fair'' system given that travelers choose to pay the \n     charge. The managed lanes on I-15 have proven so successful \n     that the San Diego Association of Governments plans to expand \n     its value pricing system by replacing the two HOT lanes with \n     four new HOT lanes.\n       Most recently, in February 2003 London introduced a \n     congestion-pricing scheme that charges vehicles entering the \n     central city. Though met with intense skepticism by political \n     opponents, the pricing experiment has proven to be even more \n     successful than its designers had anticipated. The average \n     driving speed in London's central city has increased 37 \n     percent and the total number of cars entering Central London \n     has decreased by 20 percent.\n\n\n                           freedom for states\n\n       The FAST Act and similar proposals encouraging greater \n     utilization of toll lanes do not seek to mandate the \n     wholesale use of tolls by states. However, states should have \n     the option to use tolls to finance the reconstruction of new \n     roads and should incur no penalty for doing so. In a federal \n     system of government, states should be encouraged to pursue \n     innovative methods for financing and providing essential \n     services to the citizenry, and this is indeed what the FAST \n     Act would achieve. Given the significant difference between \n     proposed highway spending plans and projected gas tax \n     revenues, the FAST Act is a modest measure that can help \n     bridge the chasm.\n\n\n                            further reading\n\n       Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Financing Our Nation's \n     Roads--http://jec.senate.gov/hearings/hearings__may06.html.\n       Getting Unstuck: Three Big Ideas to Get America Moving \n     Again, by Robert D.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MAGEN DAVID ADOM \n                   SOCIETY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, in light of the findings \n     of fact set out in section 690(a) of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228; 116 \n     Stat. 1414) and the fact that the Federation of Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Societies has not granted full membership to the \n     Magen David Adom Society, the United States should continue \n     to press for full membership for the Magen David Adom Society \n     in the International Red Cross Movement.\n\n     SEC. 813. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the average \n     temperature on Earth can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''. The \n     National Academy of Sciences also noted that ``because there \n     is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how \n     the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions \n     of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the \n     magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative \n     and subject to future adjustments upward or downward''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) In October 2000, a United States Government report \n     found that global climate change may harm the United States \n     by altering crop yields, accelerating sea-level rise, and \n     increasing the spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ultimate \n     objective of which is the ``stabilization of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would \n     prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \n     system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame \n     sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate \n     change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and \n     to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable \n     manner''.\n       (7) The UNFCCC stated in part that the Parties to the \n     Convention are to implement policies ``with the aim of \n     returning . . . to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions \n     of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases'' under the \n     principle that ``policies and measures . . . should be \n     appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and \n     should be integrated with national development programmes, \n     taking into account that economic development is essential \n     for adopting measures to address climate change''.\n       (8) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases, and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (9) The UNFCCC further stated that ``developed country \n     Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and \n     the adverse effects thereof'', as these nations are the \n     largest historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases. \n     The UNFCCC also stated that ``steps required to understand \n     and address climate change will be environmentally, socially \n     and economically most effective if they are based on relevant \n     scientific, technical and economic considerations and \n     continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in \n     these areas''.\n       (10) Senate Resolution 98 of the One Hundred Fifth \n     Congress, which expressed that developing nations must also \n     be included in any future, binding climate change treaty and \n     such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the United \n     States economy, should not cause the United States to abandon \n     its shared responsibility to help reduce the risks of climate \n     change and its impacts. Future international efforts in this \n     regard should focus on recognizing the equitable \n     responsibilities for addressing climate change by all \n     nations, including commitments by the largest developing \n     country emitters in a future, binding climate change treaty.\n       (11) While the United States has elected not to become a \n     party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time, it is the position \n     of the United States that it will not interfere with the \n     plans of any nation that chooses to ratify and implement the \n     Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n       (12) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will address the risks of climate change.\n       (13) The United States benefits from investments in the \n     research, development, and deployment of a range of clean \n     energy and efficiency technologies that can reduce the risks \n     of climate change and its impacts and that can make the \n     United States economy more productive, bolster energy \n     security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should demonstrate international leadership \n     and responsibility in reducing the health, environmental, and \n     economic risks posed by climate change by--\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, tradable credits for emissions reductions and \n     carbon sequestration projects that will reduce, avoid, and \n     sequester greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal to the Conference of the Parties, \n     with the objective of securing United States participation in \n     a future binding climate change Treaty in a manner that is \n     consistent with the environmental objectives of the UNFCCC, \n     that protects the economic interests of the United States, \n     and that recognizes the shared international responsibility \n     for addressing climate change, including developing country \n     participation; and\n       (4) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group \n     designated by the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to monitor any \n     international negotiations on climate change, to ensure that \n     the advice and consent function of the Senate is exercised in \n     a manner so as to facilitate timely consideration of any new \n     treaty submitted to the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 814.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for \n     the 21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 902. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of United \n     States volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows:\n       (A) To help people in developing nations meet basic needs.\n       (B) To promote understanding of America's values and ideals \n     abroad.\n       (C) To promote an understanding of other peoples by \n     Americans.\n       (3) The three goals, which are codified in the Peace Corps \n     Act, have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, and worked in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (4) Since its establishment, approximately 165,000 Peace \n     Corps volunteers have served in 135 countries.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier\n\n[[Page S9137]]\n\n     international service organization dedicated to promoting \n     grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (8) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to \n     accomplish any goal other than the goals established by the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (9) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps must not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the \n     Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the \n     security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget \n     System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy \n     Analysis should continue its focus on strategic planning.\n       (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers and other individuals, with diverse \n     backgrounds and expertise, can be a source of ideas and \n     suggestions that may be useful to the Director of the Peace \n     Corps in discharging the Director's duties and \n     responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 903.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen \n     Surveillance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2402. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the \n     likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the \n     underpreparedness of the domestic public health \n     infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences \n     following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.\n       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in another \n     country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the \n     realities of international travel, trade, and migration \n     patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world \n     can spread to United States territory in a matter of days, \n     before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be \n     implemented.\n       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen \n     the domestic public health infrastructure and improve \n     domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely \n     essential, are not sufficient.\n       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and \n     individual countries, including data sharing with appropriate \n     United States departments and agencies, to help detect and \n     quickly contain infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism \n     agents before they can spread.\n       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an \n     impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks \n     around the world, including the recent emergence of the \n     Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, \n     particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of the \n     Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.\n       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are \n     inherently limited by the quality of the data and information \n     it receives from member countries, the narrow range of \n     diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon which its \n     disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and the \n     consensus process it uses to add new diseases to the list. \n     Developing countries in particular often cannot devote the \n     necessary resources to build and maintain public health \n     infrastructures.\n       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting based on symptoms and signs (known as \n     ``syndrome surveillance''), affording the earliest possible \n     opportunity to conduct an effective response;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome \n     surveillance capabilities and real-time information \n     dissemination to public health officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national and regional health networks, including \n     inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems \n     (GIS) and relevant telephone-based systems for early \n     recognition and diagnosis of diseases.\n       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and \n     quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer \n     dividends not only in the event of biological weapons \n     development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the \n     more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease \n     outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore, \n     a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist \n     use of biological weapons, as early detection will help \n     mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       (1) To enhance the capability and cooperation of the \n     international community, including the World Health \n     Organization and individual countries, through enhanced \n     pathogen surveillance and appropriate data sharing, to \n     detect, identify, and contain infectious disease outbreaks, \n     whether the cause of those outbreaks is intentional human \n     action or natural in origin.\n       (2) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based and other electronic syndrome \n     surveillance systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology \n     methods, so that they may better detect, diagnose, and \n     contain infectious disease outbreaks, especially those due to \n     pathogens most likely to be used in a biological weapons \n     attack.\n       (3) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment \n     necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology, including, as appropriate, relevant computer \n     equipment, Internet connectivity mechanisms, and telephone-\n     based applications to effectively gather, analyze, and \n     transmit public health information for infectious disease \n     surveillance and diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of United States \n     Government public health professionals to international \n     health organizations, regional health networks, and United \n     States diplomatic missions where appropriate.\n       (6) To establish ``lab-to-lab'' cooperative relationships \n     between United States public health laboratories and \n     established foreign counterparts.\n       (7) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense \n     entities, to enhance the disease surveillance capabilities of \n     developing countries.\n       (8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money \n     for new regional networks.\n\n     SEC. 2403.

It largely was ineffective as a \n     deterrent to human rights abuses or as a corrective force.''\n       (4) The Department of State's 2002 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices in Rwanda states that ``there were credible \n     reports that Rwandan Defense Force units operating in the \n     [Democratic Republic of the Congo] committed deliberate \n     unlawful killings and other serious abuses, and impunity \n     remained a problem,'' and that ``the Government continued to \n     conduct genocide trials at a slow pace.''\n       (5) The Department of State's 2002 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices in Uganda states that ``security forces used \n     excessive force, at times resulting in death, and committed \n     or failed to prevent extrajudicial killings of suspected \n     rebels and civilians. The Government enacted measures to \n     improve the discipline and training of security forces and \n     punished some security force officials who were guilty of \n     abuses; however, abuses by the security forces remained a \n     problem.''\n       (6) Ongoing human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo, including ethnically-based conflict in Ituri \n     province, threaten the integrity and viability of the \n     Congolese peace process.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States Government to support--\n       (1) efforts aimed at accounting for the grave human rights \n     abuses and crimes against humanity that have taken place \n     throughout the central African region since 1993;\n       (2) programs to encourage reconciliation in communities \n     affected by such crimes; and\n       (3) efforts aimed at preventing such crimes in the future.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report on the \n     actions taken by the United States Government to implement \n     the policy set out in subsection (b).\n       (d) Authorization.--Of the amounts made available under \n     chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.), up to $12,000,000 may be made \n     available for fiscal year 2004 to support the development of \n     responsible justice and reconciliation mechanisms in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and \n     Uganda, including programs to increase awareness of gender-\n     based violence and to improve local capacity to prevent and \n     respond to such violence.\n       (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 2517.

The President also called for a ``new compact \n     for global development, defined by new accountability for \n     both rich and poor nations'' and pledged support for \n     increased assistance from the United States through the \n     establishment of a Millennium Challenge Account for countries \n     that govern justly, invest in their own people, and encourage \n     economic freedom.\n       (2) The elimination of extreme poverty and the achievement \n     of the other international development goals of the United \n     Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the United Nations \n     General Assembly on September 8, 2000, are important \n     objectives and it is appropriate for the United States to \n     make development assistance available in a manner that will \n     assist in achieving such goals.\n       (3) The availability of financial assistance through a \n     Millennium Challenge Account,\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\n     linked to performance by developing countries, can contribute \n     significantly to the achievement of the international \n     development goals of the United Nations Millennium \n     Declaration.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to provide United States assistance for global \n     development through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, as \n     described in section 3102; and\n       (2) to provide such assistance in a manner that promotes \n     economic growth and the elimination of extreme poverty and \n     strengthens good governance, economic freedom, and \n     investments in people.\n\n     SEC. 3003.

GLOBAL DEMOCRACY PROMOTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is a fundamental principle of American medical \n     ethics and practice that health care providers should, at all \n     times, deal honestly and openly with patients. Any attempt to \n     subvert the private and sensitive physician-patient \n     relationship would be intolerable in the United States and is \n     an unjustifiable intrusion into the practices of health care \n     providers when attempted in other countries.\n       (2) Freedom of speech is a fundamental American value. The \n     ability to exercise the right to free speech, which includes \n     the ``right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the government for a redress of grievances'' is \n     essential to a thriving democracy and is protected under the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (3) The promotion of democracy is a principal goal of \n     United States foreign policy and critical to achieving \n     sustainable development. It is enhanced through the \n     encouragement of democratic institutions and the promotion of \n     an independent and politically active civil society in \n     developing countries.\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\n       (4) Limiting eligibility for United States development and \n     humanitarian assistance upon the willingness of a foreign \n     nongovernmental organization to forgo its right to use its \n     own funds to address, within the democratic process, a \n     particular issue affecting the citizens of its own country \n     directly undermines a key goal of United States foreign \n     policy and would violate the United States Constitution if \n     applied to United States-based organizations.\n       (5) Similarly, limiting the eligibility for United States \n     assistance on a foreign nongovernmental organization's \n     willingness to forgo its right to provide, with its own \n     funds, medical services that are legal in its own country and \n     would be legal if provided in the United States constitutes \n     unjustifiable interference with the ability of independent \n     organizations to serve the critical health needs of their \n     fellow citizens and demonstrates a disregard and disrespect \n     for the laws of sovereign nations as well as for the laws of \n     the United States.\n       (b) Assistance for Foreign Nongovernmental Organizations \n     Under Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, in determining eligibility for assistance authorized \n     under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government funds for advocacy and \n     lobbying activities other than those that apply to United \n     States nongovernmental organizations receiving assistance \n     under part I of such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1142.

The September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks on the United States have rightfully increased the \n     awareness of the need to ensure that all aliens seeking \n     admission to the United States would not endanger the United \n     States. In order to ensure that the refugee admissions \n     program remains available in a timely way to deserving and \n     qualified refugee applicants, all personnel involved in \n     screening such applicants should closely coordinate their \n     work in order to ensure both the timely and complete \n     screening of such applicants.\n       (5) Private voluntary agencies have and continue to provide \n     valuable information to State Department officials for \n     refugee processing, and along with Embassy personnel, can be \n     utilized to assist in the preliminary screening of refugees \n     so that State Department officials can focus to a greater \n     extent on security.\n       (6) In order to meet the ceiling set by the Administration, \n     which has been 70,000 refugees in recent years, a broader \n     cross-section of the world's 15,000,000 refugees could be \n     considered for resettlement in the United States if the \n     Department of State were to expand existing refugee \n     processing priority categories in a reasonable and \n     responsible manner. Expansion of refugee selection should \n     include the expanded use of both the existing category \n     reserved for refugees of special interest to the United \n     States as well as the existing categories reserved for family \n     reunification.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to provide \n     the Department of State with tools to enable it to carry out \n     its responsibilities with greater efficiency with respect to \n     the identification and processing of refugee applicants.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Annual Admission of \n     Refugees.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) efforts of the Department of State to admit 70,000 \n     refugees, as allocated through presidential determinations, \n     for fiscal year 2003 are strongly supported and recommended; \n     and\n       (2) the Administration should seek to admit at least 90,000 \n     refugees in fiscal year 2004 and at least 100,000 in fiscal \n     year 2005.\n       (d) Refugee Security Coordinator.--\n       (1) Establishment.--In order to further enhance overseas \n     security screening of the United States Refugee Resettlement \n     Program, there shall be within the Bureau of Population, \n     Refugees, and Migration, a Refugee Security Coordinator who \n     shall report to the Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Population, Refugees, and Migration.\n       (2) Responsibilities.--The Refugee Security Coordinator \n     referred to in paragraph (1) shall be responsible for--\n       (A) ensuring that applicants for admission to the United \n     States undergo a security review to ensure that the admission \n     of such applicants would not pose a security risk to the \n     United States;\n       (B) ensuring that, to the greatest extent practicable, such \n     security reviews are completed within 45 days of the \n     submission of the information necessary to conduct such a \n     review;\n       (C) providing appropriate officials in the Department of \n     Justice and the Department of Homeland Security pertinent \n     information for conducting security reviews for applicants; \n     and\n       (D) making recommendations on procedural and personnel \n     changes and levels of appropriations that the Refugee \n     Security Coordinator considers appropriate for the various \n     agencies of government involved in conducting security \n     reviews for refugee applicants in order to ensure that such \n     reviews are complete and accurate, protect the security of \n     the United States, and are completed in a timely manner.\n       (3) Authority.--In carrying out the responsibilities set \n     forth in paragraph (2), the Refugee Security Coordinator \n     shall have full authority to work with the various agencies \n     of government to ensure that security reviews are conducted \n     in a complete and timely manner, including authority to \n     inquire about, and require action on, any particular \n     application.\n       (e) Use of Nongovernmental Organizations in Referral of \n     Refugees.--\n       (1) Private voluntary organization referrals.--The \n     Secretary of State shall develop and utilize partnerships \n     with private voluntary agencies that permit such agencies to \n     assist in the identification and referral of refugees, \n     through the creation of networks of field-based \n     nongovernmental organizations with immediate and direct \n     knowledge of refugees in need of a durable solution.\n       (2) Use of voluntary agencies in overseas refugee \n     processing.--In processing refugees for admission to the \n     United States, the Department of State shall utilize private \n     voluntary agencies with ties to domestic constituencies.\n       (3) Refugee response teams.--\n       (A) Establishment.--In order to make the processing of \n     refugees more efficient and effective, enhance the quality of \n     refugee resettlement programs, and to augment the capacity of \n     the United States Government to identify, process, assist, \n     and counsel individuals for eventual adjudication by the \n     Department of Homeland Security as refugees, the Secretary of \n     State shall establish and utilize the services of Refugee \n     Response Teams (in this section referred to as ``RRTs''). \n     RRTs shall be coordinated by the Assistant Secretary of State \n     for Population, Refugees, and Migration, or the Assistant \n     Secretary's designee, and work with the Refugee Security \n     Coordinator.\n       (B) Composition.--RRTs shall be comprised of \n     representatives of private voluntary organizations that have \n     experience in refugee law, policy, and programs.\n       (C) Responsibilities of the rrts.--RRTs shall be \n     responsible for--\n       (i) monitoring refugee situations, with a view toward \n     identifying those refugees whose best durable solution is \n     third country resettlement;\n       (ii) preparing profiles and documentation for resettlement \n     consideration by the United States Government;\n       (iii) augmenting or establishing an overseas operation, \n     especially in response to urgent developments requiring quick \n     responses or more staff resources than are available in the \n     existing processing entities;\n       (iv) assisting with training and technical assistance to \n     existing international organizations and other processing \n     entities; and\n       (v) such other responsibilities as may be determined by the \n     Secretary of State.\n       (D) Responsibilities of the secretary.--The Secretary of \n     State shall establish appropriate training seminars for RRT \n     personnel and make use of RRTs in situations where existing \n     mechanisms are unable to identify and process refugees in a \n     timely manner.\n       (f) Performance Standards.--In consultation with private \n     voluntary organizations, the Secretary of State shall \n     establish performance standards to ensure accountability and \n     effectiveness in the tasks carried out in subsection (e).\n       (g) Consideration of Various Groups.--To ensure that there \n     is adequate planning across fiscal years and that both the \n     Department of State's planning and processing operations \n     result in adequate numbers of travel-ready refugees to \n     fulfill the admissions goals set forth in the determinations \n     on refugee admissions required by sections 207(a) and 207(b) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(a) and \n     (b)), the Secretary of State shall work to ensure that--\n       (1) those refugees in special need, including long-stayers \n     in first countries of asylum, unaccompanied refugee minors, \n     urban refugees, and refugees in women-headed households be \n     given special attention for resettlement processing;\n       (2) attempts are made to expand processing of those \n     refugees of all nationalities who have close family ties to \n     citizens and residents in the United States, including \n     spouses, unmarried children, or parents of persons lawfully \n     admitted to the United States, regardless of their country of \n     nationality, country of habitual residence, or first country \n     of asylum, as well as grandparents, grandchildren, married \n     sons or daughters, or siblings of United States citizens or \n     other persons lawfully admitted to the United States;\n       (3) attempts are made to expand the number of refugees \n     considered who are of special concern to the United States;\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\n       (4) individuals otherwise eligible for access to the United \n     States refugee admissions program seeking admission to the \n     United States as refugees are not excluded from being \n     interviewed because of such individual's country of \n     nationality, country of habitual residence, or first country \n     of asylum; and\n       (5) expanded access is provided to broader categories of \n     refugees seeking admission to the United States, thus \n     reducing instances of relationship-based misrepresentation by \n     persons who art bona fide refugees but who resort to such \n     misrepresentation merely as a way to be interviewed for \n     refugee status.\n       (h) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to Congress that includes information concerning the \n     following:\n       (1) Efforts of the Refugee Security Coordinator in assuming \n     the responsibilities set forth in subsection (d) that \n     includes--\n       (A) a description of the process involved in conducting \n     security reviews for refugee applicants;\n       (B) a listing of the various agencies of the Federal \n     Government that are involved in conducting security reviews \n     for refugee applicants;\n       (C) a listing for each agency described in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B) of the number of personnel involved in \n     conducting security reviews for refugee applicants;\n       (D) a listing for each agency described in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B) of the amount of funding in the previous \n     fiscal year for conducting security reviews for refugee \n     applicants;\n       (E) the average amount of time that it takes to conduct \n     security reviews for refugee applicants; and\n       (F) a plan on how the Refugee Security Coordinator will \n     fulfill the responsibilities set forth in paragraphs (1), \n     (2), and (3) of subsection (d).\n       (2) Efforts of the Secretary to utilize private voluntary \n     organizations in refugee identification, utilize private \n     voluntary agencies in processing refugees, and an explanation \n     of the rationale for not using such organizations and \n     agencies in situations where the Secretary of State has made \n     such a determination.\n       (3) Efforts of the Secretary of State implement performance \n     standards and measures are described in subsection (f) and \n     the success of private voluntary organizations in meeting \n     such standards.\n       (4) Efforts of the Secretary of State to expand \n     consideration of various groups for refugee processing as \n     described in subsection (g).\n       (5) Efforts to ensure that there is planning across fiscal \n     years so as to fulfill the refugee admissions goals set forth \n     by the President in the President's annual presidential \n     determinations on refugee admissions, including efforts to \n     reach at least 70,000 admissions in fiscal year 2003, 90,000 \n     in fiscal year 2004, and 100,000 in fiscal year 2005 as \n     recommended by Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1148. Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 925, to \nauthorize appropriations for the Department of State and international \nbroadcasting activities for fiscal year 2004 and for the Peace Corps \nfor fiscal years 2004 through 2007, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OIL \n                   RESERVE FUND FOR IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Coalition forces have liberated the Iraqi people from \n     the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n       (2) The vast mineral resources, including oil, of Iraq \n     could enrich the present and future generations of Iraqis.\n       (3) Iraq has one of the largest known petroleum reserves in \n     the world, and those reserves could be used to foster \n     economic development and democratization in Iraq.\n       (4) Very little of the potential of the oil sector in Iraq \n     has actually been harnessed.\n       (5) Under Saddam Hussein's regime, the proceeds from those \n     resources were used to build palaces, enrich the members of \n     the Republican Guard, oppress the Iraqi people, and stifle \n     their desires for a democratic government.\n       (6) As many of the nations of the Persian Gulf demonstrate, \n     possession of large petroleum reserves alone does not ensure \n     economic development or democratization.\n       (7) The development of a vibrant democracy requires a \n     strong middle class, a free press, and free and fair \n     elections.\n       (8) The future Government of Iraq will face a variety of \n     reconstruction challenges ranging from restoring \n     infrastructure to providing basic human services like \n     education and healthcare.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Energy should develop a proposal for \n     the establishment of an oil reserve fund for Iraq and submit \n     the proposal to appropriate representatives of the Iraqi \n     people, the Director of the Office of Reconstruction and \n     Humanitarian Assistance, and the President's Envoy to Iraq;\n       (2) the proposal should take proper account of the need of \n     Iraq for funding of reconstruction, meeting its international \n     financial obligations, and providing essential human services \n     such as education and health care;\n       (3) the fund should be called the Iraqi Freedom Fund and \n     should be based on models such as the Alaska Permanent Fund, \n     as well as other appropriate models;\n       (4) the fund should be managed on a for-profit basis to \n     produce additional revenues;\n       (5) a portion of the annual earnings of the fund should be \n     distributed to the Iraqi people as direct payments, or \n     through programs designed to promote the establishment of a \n     permanent middle class, with the remainder of the fund to be \n     capitalized to allow the fund to grow for future generations; \n     and\n       (6) the goal of the fund should be to encourage maximum \n     participation by the people of Iraq in the operation of their \n     government, to promote the proper use of the natural \n     resources of Iraq, and to ensure that the Iraqi people \n     benefit from the development of the natural resources of \n     Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1149.
