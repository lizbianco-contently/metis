Mr. President, this morning we will be in a period of \nmorning business to allow Senators to speak for up to 10 minutes each. \nAs I announced last night, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session.\n  Last evening, after a lengthy session with 14 rollcall votes, we were \nable to finish work on a number of items. We were able to pass the \nHealthy Forests bill as well as complete action last night on the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill. We were also able to reach \nagreements on a number of other important matters, including the Iraq-\nAfghanistan supplemental, the Interior appropriations conference \nreport, the continuing resolution, as well as the Internet tax \nmoratorium legislation.\n  Earlier in the day, the Senate considered the climate change bill and \nfailed to invoke cloture on the nomination of Charles Pickering.\n  As a reminder, the next vote will occur on Monday at some point, most \nlikely between 5:30 and 6 o'clock. That vote will be on the adoption of \nthe conference report to accompany the Interior appropriations. Also on \nMonday, the Senate will consider the Iraq supplemental conference \nreport; however, that conference report will be completed without a \nrollcall vote.\n  I also remind my colleagues that earlier in the week we reached a \nconsent on a fair credit reporting bill. I expect the Senate would turn \nto that measure on Tuesday.\n  I mentioned a few moments ago the Internet tax moratorium bill. What \nwe agreed to last night was that we would address that bill next week, \nand as part of that agreement, that we would not address it prior to \nThursday. With the current extension expiring, it was my hope that the \nSenate could have finished that bill last night or today, prior to that \ndeadline, but a few Members have raised concerns and desire amendments. \nThus, it will be our intent to finish that bill at the end of next \nweek, rather than this week. The agreement, again, will lead us to turn \nto that on Thursday, and I expect, after giving Senators the \nopportunity to offer, hopefully, relevant amendments, that we would \nmove that bill toward passage on either Thursday or Friday.\n  Another item that will demand the Senate's attention next week is the \nSyria accountability bill. Senator Santorum has been working on getting \nthat measure cleared, and we hope to schedule that vote very early next \nweek.\n  Finally, I add we will continue to consider the available \nappropriations conference reports as they become available.\n  Having said all that, you can see that next week is shaping up to be \nanother very active week of floor action. With Members' continued \ncooperation, we can finish our business and still adjourn at the \nearliest opportunity this year. I do thank Members for their \ncooperation and participation in allowing\n\n[[Page S13700]]\n\nus to proceed with the business of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13700-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The deputy Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one question I have gotten over here several \ntimes, and I have raised this issue on the floor, Senator McConnell has \nsaid on two separate occasions that a week from this Monday, we will be \nworking. People are changing schedules and all.\n  My personal feeling is we should be working. I hope the leader, \nwhatever the final decision--I understand the preliminary decision is \nwe would be working a week from Monday, more so than just 5 o'clock at \nnight.\n\n  If we are to have any hope of getting out of here in time for \nimportant events such as people's birthdays and events of that nature, \nwe have to really move forward. I say that actually recognizing the \nPresiding Officer has a very important date coming up--it is the 18th \nor 20th, or something like that.\n  Seriously, if we can have a signoff on what you are going to do that \nday, it would be important to everybody.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, through the Chair, the \nintention right now is to work Monday, make that a full working day. As \nwe finished last night at about midnight, a lot of people were saying \nwe can't work any harder than what we are doing right now in terms of \ntaking these bills one by one, and that is the way we are going to have \nto work, unfortunately--or fortunately--in order to complete what we \nhave before us; thus the intentions for the day before Veterans Day.\n  The real issue, obviously, for our colleagues, because they \nunderstand, but for others who are listening to understand, Veterans \nDay is a day we want to be able to honor, and a lot of people will have \nto change their plans because they have to be flying to the west coast. \nBut I want to make it clear our intention is to stay here and work. In \ntruth, that is what the people around the country expect us to do. We \nhave work right now. We have the Nation's business before us, in terms \nof the appropriations bills, the many conference reports that we are \nwaiting for, the very important conference in terms of energy and \nMedicare, which is underway. So it is critical that we continue work on \nthat Monday.\n  It is my intention, of course, on Veterans Day, to be able to respect \nthat day accordingly, as we go forward. I think we will be able to \nannounce more about that in the early part of next week. The schedule \nconstantly changes. I was very hopeful we could complete this Internet \ntax issue. That was really our goal. We worked very hard, but, again, \nout of consideration for our Members, we have had to move that forward \na week. We intend to finish that the end of next week, and it is \ncritical we do so.\n  It is important for our colleagues to understand because about this \ntime of the year everybody is sort of sitting and waiting to see who is \ngoing to make the next move. At this point, we are trying to wrap \neverything up for the session. It means everybody needs to recognize \ndecisions have to be made, very tough decisions. I am speaking in part \nto the conferees who are addressing issues right now. There are one or \ntwo outstanding issues in these conferences. Now is the time to make \nthose decisions. If not, we will be here all the way up to \nThanksgiving, and after Thanksgiving, and up to the December holidays. \nThat is really unacceptable to me. But now is the time to wrap things \nup, over these next several weeks.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said on the floor previously that the \nveterans of America recognize how important our work is here. So much \nthat we do reflects on these different programs. I also think if things \nare as difficult as they appear, we may have to do something on that \nTuesday. That will certainly be up to the leader. But I also recognize \nthat other than Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, no one has had a \nmore difficult job these last few weeks than the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Byrd. Trying to marshal through these appropriations bills is \nextremely difficult.\n  But we have made really good progress. To think we have been able in \njust the last few weeks to do as much as we have here on the Senate \nfloor with the appropriations bills is significant. Debating the \nInterior appropriations conference report this coming Monday is also \nimportant. I think there is light at end of the tunnel. With the \nchairman cajoling, along with the Presiding Officer, we can continue to \nmake progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13700-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week a memorandum on the war on \nterrorism from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to his top subordinates \nwas leaked to the press. In that memo, Secretary Rumsfeld asked a \nnumber of questions, including the following: Is our current situation \nsuch that ``the harder we work, the behinder we get?'' Then he asked: \n``What else should we be considering?''\n  Well, I am dismayed that Secretary Rumsfeld says publicly something \nso differently than what he has said privately. I am glad he is looking \nfor new direction since our post-Saddam policy is not working well, \ngiven the sustained and increasing attacks on our forces.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld asked--again--``What else should we be \nconsidering?'' Well, the President of the Iraqi Governing Council has \nmade a specific recommendation for us to consider: that the regular \nIraqi Army units be called up to assist our troops in providing \nsecurity for the reconstruction of their country.\n  Surely it is worthy of our consideration, when Iyad Alawi, this \nmonth's serving President of the Iraqi Governing Council--the 25-member \nbody selected by the United States to represent the Iraqi people--is \nmaking a suggestion to change course.\n  He wrote an important opinion piece entitled ``America Must Let Iraq \nRebuild Itself,'' which was published by the New York Times on October \n19. The main premise of the article is that ``ultimately, only Iraqis \nthemselves can restore security, rebuild national institutions, enact a \nconstitution and elect a democratic government.''\n  I believe all of us would agree with that premise. For Mr. Alawi, the \nvital step is to ``call up the Iraqi Army and the national police force \n[for] at least up to the mid-officer level'' to deal with the \ninsecurity and chaos in the country.\n  Mr. Alawi believes the Iraqi officer corps will have to be vetted to \nremove those who have committed crimes under the old regime. He points \nout that most of the Iraqi Army's soldiers are ``Iraqi patriots who \nchose not fight for Saddam Hussein'' and ``would probably return to \ntheir units and contribute to their country's future.'' He argues that \nit would be ``much easier and quicker to retrain and reequip them \nwithin their existing organizational structure than to start from \nscratch.''\n  Mr. Alawi argues that these steps would not only relieve the burden \non American troops but also would gain substantial good will among \nIraqis.\n  Tom Friedman, writing in the New York Times, on October 23, is of a \nsimilar mind. He urges the administration to declare the following: \n``We thank all the nations who offered troops, but we think the Iraqi \npeople can and must secure their own country. So we're inviting all \nformer Iraqi Army soldiers (not Republican Guards) to report back to \nduty. For every two Iraqi battalions that return to duty (they can weed \nout\n\n[[Page S13701]]\n\ntheir own bad apples), we will withdraw an American one. So Iraqis can \nliberate themselves. Our motto is Iraq for the Iraqis.''\n  That is from Tom Friedman, who has been a very strong supporter of \nthe administration's military actions in Iraq and the decision to \nattack Iraq.\n  The administration and the Coalition Provisional Authority have taken \na different tack in reorganizing Iraqi security, particularly with \nregard to the Iraqi Army. They are essentially starting from scratch to \nbuild a completely new Army of 40,000 people who are being trained and \nequipped as a motorized infantry.\n  The goal is to form nine brigades by the end of 2004, but thus far \nonly one battalion of 750 soldiers has been trained and equipped.\n  Additionally, the Coalition Provisional Authority is creating an \nIraqi border patrol force, only 5,000 to date, with the need to expand \nto more than 20,000 sometime in the future. A 20,000-person Facilities \nProtection Service is intended to take over security at fixed site \nlocations from coalition forces, and an Iraqi civil defense corps of \n6,600, expanding to more than 15,000 in 2004, is being integrated into \ncoalition military units to provide local intelligence and help with \nsecurity patrolling.\n\n  While I have some questions regarding the need for four distinct \nsecurity forces, including a new Iraqi Army, in addition to a new \nnational police force, I am open to arguments that this approach to \nbuilding a new army may be desirable in the long run. A better \neducated, trained, equipped, and motivated army, whose members are more \nrepresentative of the diverse Iraqi population, and which was created \nexpressly to serve the people of the new Iraqi state, may be more \nideal.\n  However, in the short term, I believe Mr. Alawi's recommendation to \nreconstitute units of the old regular army is surely worthy of \nconsideration. No one, including Mr. Alawi, argues for a continued role \nfor those portions of the old army that were part of the repressive \nsecurity apparatus of the Saddam regime--units such as the Special \nSecurity Guards, the Special Republican Guards, and the Fedayeen \nSaddam.\n  In fact, those units were created by Saddam because he did not trust \nhis regular army. In that portion of the State Department-sponsored \n``The Future of Iraq Project,'' dealing with Iraqi Armed Forces, the \nWorking Group that wrote this part of the report, discussed this issue.\n  They noted the following: ``Saddam Hussein realized, with his sense \nof security, that he will not be able to earn the loyalty and trust of \nthe army with its varied character in spite of many attempts to purify \nor clean the army from the disloyal elements--as he called them--in \norder for the army to become an army of ideology to protect the party \nand the revolution and defend the nation's values.'' They added that \n``Thus the army remained a source of worry, suspicion and threat to \nSaddam; in spite of the fact that the army got into its many wars \nbecause Saddam desired it. There are some who think that the army was \npushed into these wars to keep it continuously busy confronting outside \naggressions.'' Finally and in view of these findings, the Woking Group \nconcluded that ``In any event we think it necessary to keep the basic \nstructure of the army, which can be easily rehabilitated. . . .''\n  That regular army, below the midofficer level, after vetting, could \nserve a useful role by putting trained Iraqi forces into the field to \nmore quickly enhance overall security. The regular Iraqi Army was a \nsizable force of approximately 80,000 officers, 130,000 noncommissioned \nofficers, and 400,000 conscript soldiers.''\n  We probably made a mistake in formally disbanding the Iraqi army in \nMay. I wonder if Ambassador Bremer doesn't tacitly believe the same, \ngiven the quick decision that was made by him shortly thereafter by \nagreeing to pay monthly allowances to officers and noncommissioned \nofficers after the unrest that was unleashed by that decision.\n  Beginning in July, monthly payments were made according to a rank-\nbased scale, ranging from $50 for a noncommissioned officer to $150 for \na general, somewhat below the base pay for the various ranks. \nAdditionally, a one-time $40 stipend was paid to former conscripts. \nSince July, the Coalition Provisional Authority has paid from Iraqi \nfunds approximately $78 million to about 260,000 individuals and just \nover $15 million to approximately 375,000 conscripts. The estimated \ncost for the stipend during the next year will be $190 million, if \npayments continue throughout the year.\n  In other words, we know where the men and women--mainly men--in the \nIraqi regular army are located. They came for those payments, and we \nknow how to locate them, should we make a decision to reconstitute \nunits of that Iraqi army.\n  That money was well spent. There is ample evidence from other \nconflicts that unemployed former soldiers can be a destabilizing and a \ndisruptive influence, as some believe is currently the case in Iraq \ntoday. In view of the $156 billion that is likely to be appropriated \nfor U.S. military forces in Iraqi reconstruction in fiscal years 2003 \nand 2004, paying those sums to members of the old regular Iraqi army \nwould be a modest expenditure.\n  But would it not make more sense to pay those sums to soldiers who \nare actually doing something? Would it not make sense to quickly \nreconstitute recently disbanded Iraqi regular army units to take on \nsecurity tasks that are within their capabilities? Would it not be \npossible that recently disbanded Iraqi army units would be able to more \nquickly assume duties for which the border patrol, the facilities \nprotection service, and the civil defense corps are intended, including \npatrolling Iraqi streets with our own soldiers? Would this not more \nquickly give Iraqis the responsibility for and a stake in securing \ntheir own country? And, more importantly, wouldn't it be better for all \nconcerned if primarily Iraqi soldiers and not Americans were acting to \nrestore security in Iraq and dealing with those who would seek to \ndisrupt it?\n  The Governing Council President thinks so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article written by the current \nPresident of the Iraqi Governing Council, Iyad Alawi, entitled \n``America Must Let Iraq Rebuild Itself,'' which appeared in the New \nYork Times on October 19, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I asked Ambassador Bremer when we met with him: At a \nminimum, would he not raise this issue with the Governing Council to \nsee whether or not the views of the President of the Governing Council, \nthat the Iraqi army regular units should be reconstituted, represent \nthe views of the Governing Council itself. We surely should listen to \nthose views. These are the folks we put in office there as representing \nthe Iraqi people. At a minimum, I urged Ambassador Bremer to find out \nformally from that Governing Council whether or not the President's \nviews, as represented by this article in the New York Times--that the \nregular units of the army, properly vetted to make sure we don't hire \nold members of the Saddam leadership--should be reconstituted to help \nus maintain order and security in Iraq.\n  I believe Ambassador Bremer will in fact make that request of the \nGoverning Council--not the request to reconstitute the army, because I \ndon't think Ambassador Bremer is there yet, but the request of the \nGoverning Council to see if they agree that it would be wise for those \nunits below the mid-level officer level to be reconstituted, properly \nvetted, to help us on the streets of Baghdad and in the areas which are \nvery dangerous, and to take some of the pressure off our troops to make \nus less of a target and to have Iraqis gradually but more quickly take \nover their own security so that we are not a lightning rod for the \nfolks who are trying to destroy us.\n\n  I look forward to the response of the Governing Council of Iraq to \nAmbassador Bremer's request. We know that as a new Iraqi army is \nformed, some of the existing units will be retrained and equipped to \nexpand that army. But it is critically important that we have this \nquestion put before that Governing Council. The creation of a new Iraqi \narmy is going very slowly. We are at less than a thousand. We must move \nmore quickly.\n  The question is, since most of the members who we are hiring for that\n\n[[Page S13702]]\n\nnew army are members of the old army in any event, would it not be much \nquicker to reconstitute the units of that old army--again, below the \nmid-officer level, so we don't have the Saddam regime involved--would \nit not be much quicker to follow the suggestion of the President of the \nGoverning Council, reconstitute the units and move on from there?\n  The Secretary of Defense asked, in his leaked memorandum, if what the \nU.S. is doing is enough and what else should be considered. I am glad \nhe asked those questions. As I said before, I am sorry he has not said \npublicly what he said privately in terms of his doubts and concerns. \nBut having said that, I am glad he is raising questions. I am glad he \nis asking questions about whether we should change course in some way.\n  I have written to the Secretary of Defense to solicit his views on \nMr. Alawi's proposal. Again, I hope Ambassador Bremer does consult with \nthe Iraqi Governing Council, seek their recommendations on this issue, \nand not only solicit their recommendations but seriously consider ways \nto formulate an integrated and comprehensive plan to move more quickly \nto involve Iraqis in their own security and in their overall \ngovernance.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 19, 2003]\n\n                  America Must Let Iraq Rebuild Itself\n\n                            (By Iyad Alawi)\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq.--No Iraqi will ever forget the momentous \n     April day when a crowd of hundreds of cheering Baghdadis, \n     helped by an American armored vehicle, pull the huge statue \n     of Saddam Hussein to the ground. With this act, we tore down \n     three decades of tyranny and repression and began building in \n     its place a foundation for freedom, democracy and a better \n     future for our children.\n       To see that this goal is achieved, the Bush administration \n     has challenged me and my colleagues on the Iraqi Governing \n     Council to draft a permanent constitution within six months \n     and to move as quickly as possible to hold internationally \n     monitored, free elections. We gladly accept that challenge, \n     and welcome the vital assistance of the United Nations, \n     through the Security Council resolution passed on Thursday, \n     to see through to completion the enormous task ahead.\n       But we also realize that there are obstacles on Iraq's \n     march toward democracy. In the months since Iraq was \n     liberated, jubilation has given way to insecurity and chaos. \n     When my fellow Iraqis finally go to the polls to elect their \n     government, they must have confidence that state institutions \n     are not only legitimate and independent, but robust enough to \n     guarantee safety and civil rights. That is why the coalition \n     and the council must take several immediate steps to \n     establish these necessary conditions for the constitutional \n     process to succeed.\n       First, it is vital to call up the Iraqi Army and the \n     national police force, at least up to mid-officer level. The \n     coalition's early decision to abolish the army and police was \n     well intended, but it unfortunately resulted in a security \n     vacuum that let criminals, die-hards of the former regime and \n     international terrorist flourish. And the coalition's plan to \n     build a 20,000-member lightly armed force mostly responsible \n     for security and border control could make poor use of a \n     valuable resource: the 300,000 Iraqi soldiers who simply went \n     home with their weapons in the face of the American-led \n     invasion.\n       Most of these soldiers are Iraqi patriots who chose not to \n     fight for Saddam Hussein. Americans should not confuse the \n     Iraqi Army with the hated Republican Guard, which Saddam \n     Husseim created precisely because he distrusted the \n     legitimate military. In one simple process, the coalition \n     authority can support the governing council to call the army \n     back to its barracks for retraining and, ultimately, for \n     redeployment. Most soldiers and their officers will proudly \n     return to their units and contribute to their country's \n     future.\n       The coalition and the Iraqi Interior Ministry can vet \n     officers to remove those who committed crimes under the old \n     regime, and then rapidly redeploy the most capable units to \n     work with, and progressively relieve, American troops of \n     security duties. Iraqi Army units have an established chain \n     of command and esprit de corps. Not only can they be recalled \n     to barracks immediately, but it would be much easier and \n     quicker to retrain and re-equip them within their existing \n     organizational structure than to start from scratch.\n       By supporting the recall of army units, the United States \n     would not only speed the process of relieving the burden on \n     its troops, it would also gain substantial good will in Iraq. \n     In contrast, any American-led military presence, even if \n     complemented by the United Nations, will never have the \n     credibility and legitimacy that the Iraqi Army has among the \n     people.\n       In addition, the Iraqi national police must also be \n     recalled. Most Iraqi policemen--as opposed to Saddam \n     Hussein's feared intelligence and security organs--are \n     dedicated to law and order. The United States does not have \n     the time or money to create a police force from the ground \n     up, nor is it necessary, because we have a large, organized \n     force that is ready and willing to serve.\n       Many other Iraqi governing institutions should also be \n     reactivated by the governing council, with the support of the \n     coalition authority. Special priority must be given to the \n     Ministries of Interior, Justice, Finance, Oil and Education. \n     The Iraqi bureaucracy must also be called back to work, \n     although of course after screening to disqualify serious \n     offenders of the former regime. Together, the council and the \n     coalition leaders can modernize the state apparatus, phase \n     out obsolete policies and practices, and encourage a new \n     mindset of transparency and efficiency.\n       Finally, as security improves, Iraqi institutions are re-\n     established and the constitutional drafting process is \n     completed, the United States should support international \n     recognition of Iraqi sovereignty. Then a recognized interim \n     government could quickly present a popular referendum, under \n     United Nations monitoring, on the new national constitution. \n     It would be a grave mistake for the United States to hold out \n     sovereignty and international recognition as the reward for \n     passage of a constitution. Rather, making Iraqis once again a \n     part of the international system is the prerequisite of \n     successful reconstruction and a durable democratic system.\n       Iraqis are grateful for the tremendous efforts and \n     sacrifices the United States is making on our belief. Yet, \n     ultimately, only Iraqis themselves can restore security, \n     rebuild national institutions. enact a constitution and elect \n     a democratic government. America must not rebuff Iraqis who \n     are eager to have a stake in this intimate national process. \n     Like any free people, we want to ensure that we are in \n     control of our own destiny.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Madam President, a week ago today, I came to the Senate \nfloor to honor and to remember a young Ohio soldier who lost his life \nwhile bravely serving our Nation in Iraq. That young man, PFC Branden \nOberleitner, had served proudly in the Army's 101st Airborne Division, \nbased out of Fort Campbell, KY.\n  Today, I come again to the floor of the Senate to honor and to \nremember another young Ohio soldier who served proudly in the 101st \nAirborne Division, another young soldier who lost his life bravely \ndefending our Nation and fighting to give a better life, freedom, and \nliberty to the people of Iraq.\n  Madam President, SGT Brett Thomas Christian was born on December 5, \n1975. Growing up, Brett's life was not always easy. Like a lot of \nfamilies, he and his mother Tess and brothers Sloan and Derek moved \naround a lot. As a young child, Brett was in and out of a number of \nschools, leaving old friends and making new ones each time. The family \neventually settled in the Cleveland, OH, area, where, for a time, Brett \nattended Richmond Heights High School.\n  Brett adapted well to new environments and knew how to quickly make \nnew friends. People liked Brett; they were drawn to him. He had a great \nsense of humor and an easy-going demeanor. The first thing people \nremember about Brett is his whit, his smile, his charm. His brother \nDerek said, ``You couldn't be sad around him. He was just a funny \nguy.''\n  But Brett also had a serious side. He was a smart person, a smart \nkid. He read a lot. In fact, he started reading at a very early age and \nended up 2 years ahead in school. As his brother Sloan said, ``He was \nalways so smart. He blew away all the tests he took.''\n  Brett was also a hard worker. His uncle remembers how he took a \nphysically demanding job at a tropical fish farm. Each day, Brett would \ntravel on his bike 5 miles there and 5 miles back. Rain or shine, Brett \nroad those 10 miles to and from work, laboring tirelessly to get the \njob done and, yes, done well. He dreamed of opening a restaurant one \nday with his Richmond Heights High School buddy, Jonathan Wilke.\n  Brett completed his GED and decided to enlist in the U.S. Army. \nBrett's mom Tess said he was born to serve; that he always wanted to be \na soldier. She said, ``My son believed in honor, loyalty, good \ncharacter, all those things.''\n\n[[Page S13703]]\n\n  Brett was assigned to Company C, 2nd Battalion of the 502nd Infantry \nof the 101st Airborne Division. He trained to be a sniper and served a \nyear in Korea before being called to Iraq.\n  Brett's job in Iraq was to drive a 2\\1/2\\-ton diesel carrier. It was \ngrueling and dangerous work. SGT Shane Harris described Brett as one of \nhis most dependable drivers. He was able to log 20-hour days moving \nsoldiers, loads of ammunition, thousands of gallons of fuel, and \npallets of bottled water, MREs, and other supplies.\n  Brett was one of the first American soldiers to cross the line into \nIraq. SGT John Ryan recalled how he sent Brett in to push a line \nforward to secure a bridge. He said that he chose Brett because he was \ncertainly up for it:\n\n       He believed in what we were there for. He knew what needed \n     to be done. He knew how to lead from the front. He was \n     sniper-qualified. He was mission-responsible. He was good \n     under stress. He had a good head on his shoulders. He could \n     always analyze and develop a course of action quickly.\n\n  On that same mission, it was later learned that some of our trucks \ngot lost in Iraq after crossing the line. Not surprisingly, it was \nBrett who found them and, yes, got them out.\n  On July 23, 2003, SGT Brett Christian was killed and seven others \nwere wounded near Mosul, Iraq, when his convoy was ambushed by rocket-\npropelled grenades and small arms fire. He was 27 years old.\n  Madam President, Brett Christian was buried on the hollowed ground of \nArlington National Cemetery on August 7, 2003. At that service, MAJ \nDouglas Fenton called Brett an American hero. He received a Purple \nHeart and Bronze Star.\n  There is no question that Brett Thomas Christian was a good man, a \ngood son, brother, grandson, friend, and soldier. He was kind. He was \ncompassionate. As his mother said:\n\n       They say the eyes are the windows of the soul. His eyes \n     swelled with emotion. They were bright and welcoming.\n\n  At a memorial service for Brett in Ohio, Pastor Rick Duncan movingly \ndescribed the kind of man Brett Christian became. This is what he said:\n\n       He was resourceful. He was gracious, never malicious. He \n     never showed any sort of prejudice about anyone. He was \n     responsible, uplifting, and thoughtful. He was a man of \n     action. He was a charmer.\n\n  Ultimately, Brett Christian was a true warrior. Brett Christian made \na lot of choices in his life. He chose to look at the positive, not the \nnegative. He chose to see the good things in life and in people, not \nthe bad. He chose to face fear and adversity head on and fight against \nthe evil in our world. According to Brett's grandmother Eileen, the \nlast time he was home he explained to his younger brother, who had \nindicated an interest in joining the military, exactly why he joined \nthe Army. He wanted his brother to understand that he believed in what \nhe was doing, that he believed in helping people and serving our \ncountry.\n  Let me conclude with something Sloan said about his beloved brother:\n\n       Brett had the most potential of anyone in the family--\n     anyone I know. He's a beautiful soul who could have changed \n     so much of the world. He had the love and ability to change a \n     lot of the world.\n\n  Madam President, Brett Christian did change the world. Brett \nChristian did make a difference.\n  Brett's family--his mother Tess; his brothers Derek and Sloan; his \ngrandparents Thomas and Eileen--remain in my thoughts and my prayers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13703-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13703-S13705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, one of the facts that those of us who \nlive in the Washington area have grown accustomed to is that the world \nlooks different through the eyes of the reporters for the Washington \nPost and the reporters for the Washington Times. My wife and I \nsometimes play the little game of opening both papers simultaneously \nand looking at the two headlines side by side. Usually, the Washington \nTimes says things that sound good from the Republican point of view and \nthe Washington Post says things that sound good from the Democratic \npoint of view.\n  The interesting thing this morning is that both papers covered the \nsame story, and both papers said basically the same thing.\n  I went into the cloakroom, and I gathered some other papers to see if \nthe headlines were the same there as well. I have them here. Let's \nstart with the Washington Times and the Washington Post.\n  The Washington Times says:\n\n       Growth Erupts in Summer Order. Consumers, Businesses, Go on \n     a Spending Spree.\n\n  Out of the Washington Post--they treat that not quite as \nenthusiastically, but they say:\n\n       U.S. Economic Growth Surges. Output Rises at the Highest \n     Rate Since 1984, but Jobs Still Decline.\n\n  So the Washington Post puts in a little bash there for the President \nthat the Washington Times does not.\n  If we go to the Wall Street Journal, which some think of as a \nmouthpiece for the Republican National Committee, their headline is:\n\n       Higher Gear, Economy Turned in its Best Quarter in Nearly \n     Two Decades. GDP Surged 7.2 Percent in Quarter on Broad Based \n     Gains. Bush Team Trumpet Data.\n\n  To balance that from the Wall Street Journal, let's go to the \nnewspaper some consider the house organ of the Democratic National \nCommittee, the New York Times, and their headline is:\n\n       Economy Records Speediest Growth Since the Mid-80's. Is \n     Good News Here for Good? Bush Hopes So. Third Quarter Data \n     Surge in Spending Helped by Rebates May Not Persist.\n\n  Then I picked up USA Today, the screaming headline:\n\n       7.2 Percent GDP Growth, Fastest in 19 Years. Economists \n     Credit Tax Relief and Shoppers.\n\n  For one day at least, everybody agrees that the No. 1 story is the \ntremendous performance turned in by the American economy in the third \nquarter, and the headlines trumpet the numbers, 7.2 percent GDP growth.\n  I would like to go behind the numbers. I would like to add a few \nnumbers and do what I can to try to put this performance in \nperspective.\n  No. 1, we have to recognize what even the New York Times has \nrecognized, which is this is an extraordinary accomplishment, and this \nis a sign of very good times.\n  I notice a quote from Howard Dean, who is running for President on \nthe Democratic side, that indicates he is a little disappointed in \nthis; he is a little unhappy that Americans are earning more money, \nthat disposable income is up, that the economy is booming. Perhaps he \nwas hoping he could ride into the White House on a wave of consumer \ndissatisfaction. If that is his hope, at least the third-quarter \nnumbers say he has to find something else for which to hope.\n  But it is true that the numbers we have here are not sustainable long \nterm, and that is not necessarily bad because what we are looking for \nis not a single quarter of extraordinary growth. What we are looking \nfor is a sustained period of recovery. The signs are there that we are, \nindeed, in such a period. It is not just the 7.2 percent growth in GDP \nwe need to pay attention to; it is some other numbers. Let me address \nsome of those numbers.\n  They are in the newspaper stories, some of them buried a little \nfurther than I would do it if I were writing the story, but the first \nnumber that is of significance is the growth in business investment. \nYes, as the headlines indicate, the tax relief and the shoppers are \nresponsible for this, but the tax relief is, indeed, something of a \none-time phenomenon. The mailing out of the checks for the child tax \ncredit put more money in the hands of parents just before back-to-\nschool shopping, and that showed up in the shopping figures.\n\n  Furthermore, the combination of the lowering of withholding rates \nalong with the child tax credits causes people to go out and make some \nvery significant purchases. New cars went up as a significant part of \nthis performance in the third quarter, and you don't buy a new car \nevery quarter. Undoubtedly, you will see some tapering off of some of \nthese major purchases. So we can say that the fourth quarter will not \nbe at the 7.2 percent level as far as GDP is concerned.\n  One of the newspapers says it will fall all the way down to 4 \npercent. Madam President, 4 percent on an annual basis is very robust \nand wonderful growth for an economy as mature as ours. If we could \nmaintain a 4 percent average for the next 2 or 3 years, we\n\n[[Page S13704]]\n\nwould all be very happy about that. So those who are saying the 7.2 \nwon't last and we will fall all the way down to 4 percent should \nremember there was a time not far distant in our history when we would \nhave been very happy with 3.5 percent. I will take 4 percent any day as \na steady, stable growth in the economy.\n  Let's go back to the business investment number, the number that did \nnot get as much attention as the 7.2 percent GDP number. Business \ninvestment grew at 11.1 percent, up from 7.3 percent the previous \nquarter. The thing to remember is that 7.3 percent is, in and of \nitself, considered a very strong indication of further growth, and this \nis the number that holds the promise of future jobs because if business \nis investing, business eventually is going to have to start hiring.\n  Let me put the 7.3 percent number in some perspective. As I say, in \nhistoric terms, 7.3 percent would be a good number, but we have seen \nbusiness investment go down, not a positive number of any kind, a \nnegative number for 9 out of the last 11 quarters. To have it come out \nof negative territory, be so strongly positive as to be at 7.4 percent, \nand then see the next quarter come in at 11.1, this is as strong a \nsignal as we are going to get that the economy, which has been in \nrecovery but struggling ever since the recession ended, is now in a \nperiod of takeoff for sustained growth for the coming year.\n  One of the other numbers the economists always look at is the \nquestion of inventories: How many goods do you have on the shelf, Mr. \nor Mrs. business person? How many goods do you have that are waiting to \nbe sold? If the shelves are full, you are probably not going to be \nbuying any more until they start to come down, until your inventories \nstart to fall. Usually when you have a period of growth like we have \nexperienced in the third quarter, your inventories go up because people \nare stocking their shelves as the sales are strong.\n  Inventories went down in the third quarter. The sales were so strong \nthat they not only took everything we could produce but they reduced \ninventories that were already low even further, which means that for \nthe fourth quarter and into the next year--first, second, and third \nquarters--businesses have a major challenge to restock those depleted \ninventories, which is another sign that there will be growth, another \nsign that there will be jobs, another sign that this recovery is well \nunderway and has firm traction.\n  Take the three numbers and put them together: 7.2 percent increase in \nGDP, substantially more than anybody anticipated; 11.1 percent increase \nin business investment, substantially more than anybody had \nanticipated; and a reduction in inventory of .67 percent from the \nprevious level, and you have the profile of a recovery that is very \nrobust.\n  What caused this recovery? Certainly, one can say it was due. \nCertainly one can say this was part of the business cycle reasserting \nitself. We had the excesses of the 1990s that felt so wonderful while \nwe were in them but that were so excessive that the reaction to them \nfelt painful when it came.\n  It now appears we have worked through most of those excesses. We have \npaid the price for the bubble of the late 1990s and we are beginning to \nget back on solid footing. However, one must credit President Bush's \ninitiative in pushing tax cuts at the right time and at the right level \nto accelerate this growth.\n  Virtually every one of these papers I have gone through at one place \nor another in the story will admit, triumphantly in the case of the \nWashington Times, grudgingly in the case of the New York Times, that \nthe Bush tax cut made a significant contribution to this growth.\n  I have already recited how it works with respect to consumer \nspending, but the consumer spending could be a one-time phenomenon and \nnot hold if it is indeed tied to the receipt of checks such as the \nchild credit. However, if the consumer spending has been accelerated by \nvirtue of the reduction in withholding rates, something President Bush \ninsisted on over and over again and that had the greatest resistance in \nthis Chamber, we can say that portion of the tax cuts will, in fact, \nhave a permanent impact on the growth; that that is a gift that will, \nin fact, keep on giving and we will see continued consumer spending as \npeople have more money left in their paychecks.\n  What is the outlook in terms of the other political number we hear \nover and over again in this Chamber, which is the deficit? One of the \ngreatest arguments that was made as we were debating the Bush tax cut \nwas it would make the deficit swell and soar beyond all comprehension \nand ultimately leave us bankrupt as a nation.\n  There is another interesting number, one that has not received this \nkind of headline throughout the country but that is very important. At \none point, as the economists were making their projections with respect \nto the deficit, they said the deficit for this fiscal year, the year \nthat ended September 30, 2003, would be as high as $455 billion. That \nwas a number that came out of the Office of Management and Budget at \none point, as they made their guess as to what the economy would be \ndoing and how much money would be available.\n  We have heard that $455 billion figure repeatedly, particularly from \nthose who were opposed to the President's tax cut and who have been \nopposed to the supplemental appropriation for Iraq. They are saying we \nhave a $455 billion deficit and we are going to try to add $87 billion \non top of it; that is irresponsible; we cannot possibly do that.\n  Well, an interesting thing happened on the way to the closing of the \nbooks. With a stronger economy and with spending coming in at lower \nlevels, we began to see higher revenues and, therefore, lower \nestimates. As the year got nearer to its close, some economists were \nsaying the deficit might even be as low as $400 billion instead of the \n$455 billion; we might even be below the magic $400 billion number. I \ndo not know what is magic about the $400 billion number, but it sounds \ngood to pick that number.\n  Then we began to hear from the Congressional Budget Office: yes, the \ndeficit will clearly be below $400 billion. How much? It could be as \nmuch as $20 billion below $400 billion. It could be as low as $380 \nbillion.\n\n  The numbers are now in. The books have been tentatively closed, and \nit is $374 billion. It is $26 billion below the $400 billion mark and \nit is $81 billion below the $455 billion that was being talked about \njust a few months ago.\n  It is purely a coincidence--there is no connection whatsoever--but it \nis interesting that the actual number below the highest amount that was \nforecast is almost identical to the $87 billion of the Iraq \nsupplemental. In other words, if we take the actual number of $374 \nbillion and add the $87 billion, we come to the theoretical number \nclose to the $455 billion we were talking about.\n  All of us would love to sponsor legislation that could cut $80 \nbillion a year out of the deficit. We would stand before our \nconstituents and take enormous credit. We would say, are we not \nwonderful? We have eliminated $80 billion of the deficit.\n  The economy did it for us. I think we have to credit the combination \nof the Bush tax cuts with the growth of the economy in the business \ncycle, with making us a little bit humble, of telling the politicians \nwe do not control the events nearly as much as we pretend to in our \nspeeches.\n  The most important thing to remember is it is the economy itself that \ncreates all Federal revenue. Money does not come from the budget. Money \ncomes from the economy. Our job is to do whatever we can to get out of \nthe way of intelligent market forces and allow the economy to grow as \nstrongly as it can on its own. I think that is what Alan Greenspan has \ndone at the Federal Reserve. I think that is what President Bush has \nled us to do in the Congress with the tax cuts, and I think the \nunanimous statements out of all of the papers today indicate it is \nworking.\n  I send my congratulations to Chairman Greenspan, my congratulations \nto President Bush, and my best wishes for all of us that this will, in \nfact, continue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity while we \nare in the quorum call to come to the floor and comment briefly on what \nwe have done in the last several days and look ahead as to next week. \nWe won't actually be closing here for a little bit as we are working on \na couple of issues.\n  I want to thank everybody formally for the hard work they put forward \nthis week. It was an aggressive week in terms of what we set out to \naccomplish, and we were able to finish everything we said we were going \nto do, with one exception, and that is set up to complete at the end of \nnext week. People worked very late last night, with 14 rollcall votes, \nfinishing close to midnight. I thank everybody for that commitment \nmanifested over the last several days.\n  The days have been very long. Everybody's schedules are full with \nactivities not just on the floor. There is this constant balancing act. \nWe had to deal with three or four issues and bills at the same time. It \nseems to individual schedulers of Senators that things are somewhat \ndiscombobulated. Despite all that, we were able to finish a number of \nissues.\n  The Healthy Forests legislation was accelerated into the schedule \nbecause we had not planned exactly when we were going to do that. That \ntook a lot of cooperation. We were able to take it to the floor and \ncomplete it, which is especially important with the recent fires that \nare and have been burning in California. As we have watched those \nimages, we could not help but extend our prayers to the families, for \nthe individuals who are so directly affected in that part of the \ncountry and also by fires in other States. With those images now that \nwe see every morning, every night, and over the course of the day, we \nextend our heartfelt prayers to those affected.\n  On the Foreign Operations bill, our majority whip did a tremendous \njob in ushering that bill through. We had the bill on the floor. We \ncame to a point where we had certain challenges in terms of funding and \npaying for a particular very important amendment on HIV/AIDS, and the \ncooperation there on both sides of the aisle in being able to move off \nthat bill for a period of time while that was resolved with the \nPresident pro tempore, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Ted Stevens, coming forward and working out a proposal that \nallowed us to reach out and send a strong message across the world that \nthis little virus, HIV/AIDS, is something we are going to beat over \ntime; and then, with all that cooperation, coming back to the floor and \npassing that amendment, and ultimately the Foreign Operations bill last \nnight, gives me a great deal of satisfaction because it shows \ncooperation, partnership, working together, and the attention to \npeople's schedules on the floor, an efficient use of everyone's time.\n  I congratulate Senator McConnell, the majority whip, who did a superb \njob in that regard.\n  The nomination of Michael Leavitt, now Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, was an issue we addressed, and it took \na lot of work both behind the scenes and on the floor of the Senate. We \nwere able to vitiate cloture and we were able to give him an up-or-down \nvote, which I would like to see more of in other nominations, and we \nwill continue to fight for that. Michael Leavitt, now Administrator, \ngot that up-or-down vote. That stresses the importance of having that \nsort of process of an up-or-down vote for all of the President's \nnominees.\n  In the Leavitt debate, there were disagreements on various policy \nissues, but we had a qualified nominee at the time. He deserved that \nvote and he got it, and I was pleased that he was confirmed by a large \nbipartisan vote.\n  The Iraq supplemental is coming to a close, and through the agreement \nlast night, we will deliver on the President's request in terms of \nsupporting our military women and men overseas and doing everything we \npossibly can from a legislative and financial standpoint to ensure \ntheir safety, but to maximize the safety of the Iraqi people and the \nreconstructive efforts promoted aggressively and entirely consistent \nwith what Ambassador Bremer told us was necessary, our military leaders \ntold us was necessary, our Commander in Chief told us was necessary.\n  There are a number of issues we debated in terms of how we monitor \nthe spending of this money, which has been resolved, and whether it \nshould be grants versus loans. There was a lot of good debate, and the \nissue was ultimately resolved right where the President said it would \nbe most useful. We will complete that Monday. There will be no rollcall \nvote because both sides of the aisle have agreed to that, but we will \ntalk further about the issue Monday. By Monday early evening or late \nafternoon, that bill will pass and that will bring that issue to a \nclose.\n  We will spend a little time on the Interior conference report on \nMonday, and we will have a vote on that late Monday afternoon, \nsomewhere between 5 and 6, probably 5:30 to 6 p.m.\n  We have the fair credit reporting bill on which we have agreement to \nbring to the floor, and that will probably be Tuesday.\n  Then we have the Internet tax moratorium which, as I said earlier \nthis morning, I would have liked to have addressed today or last night, \nbut because there are a number of Members who feel very strongly that \nwe have to have a different time for debate, we all agree we will be \ndoing that bill probably Thursday of next week. As I expressed this \nmorning, my intention is to finish that either Thursday or Friday.\n  Last night, we did act on the continuing resolution, and that will \nfund our Governmental operations until November 7, and that will allow \nus to continue our work on the remaining business.\n  I also spoke earlier this morning about the urgency that I feel, \nwhich I want to express to my colleagues, to stay focused, to complete \nthe appropriations process, as well as the work in the various \nconferences so we can adjourn at a reasonable time.\n  All of this work--again, most of this is just from the last several \ndays--means that we have had to work throughout the day each day this \npast week and into the evening.\n  Also, because a lot of things we handle in wrap-up, and people are \nnot generally aware because they are not done with a lot of fanfare but \nare done by unanimous consent of the entire body, I find it useful each \nevening when I close, but especially at the end of the week, to look at \nsome of those bills.\n  This week the Senate passed S. 1194, Senator Mike DeWine's Mentally \nIll Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. I mentioned earlier \nthat Senator DeWine was instrumental in putting together the amendment \non HIV/AIDS to the foreign operations bill, which we passed as well.\n  The bill S. 1768, the National Flood Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act, which was introduced by Senator Bunning, was \npassed.\n  We are still hoping today to make progress on the military tax \nfairness bill. This bill is intended to hopefully level the playing \nfield with respect to tax policy for many members of the Armed Forces. \nI know there is currently an objection, but I encourage those people \nwho objected to in the next few minutes or hours, whatever it takes, \nlook at that bill and hopefully be able to clear that as soon as \npossible.\n  Senator Inhofe's bill, S. 1757 relating to the Kennedy Center \nreauthorization, was just cleared by both sides. There was another bill \nfrom Senator Specter and the Veterans' Committee, S. 1132, the veterans \nbenefits bill, an important\n\n[[Page S13706]]\n\nbill that we need to finish as we approach November 11. That will be \nfinalized shortly.\n  The point is, we are able to proceed in a bipartisan manner, and we \nare making progress. We must continue to do that to get the needed work \ndone as we try to work out or work through the host of complicated \nissues which are inevitable when we deal with legislation.\n  We will continue to work across the aisle to do the necessary work of \nthis body as we move through these final days.\n  Again, we will not close the Senate until we work through a few \nremaining items of business, but I say thanks to my colleagues. We are \nmaking progress. We have a lot of work to do over the coming days, but \nwe are going to be able to adjourn in a reasonable period of time if we \nstay focused and stay disciplined as we go forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13706-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PLASTIC GUN OR TOY GUN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Department of Justice, while failing to endorse Senator \nKennedy's permanent ban, has indicated its support for extending the \ncurrent ban.\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress to act quickly to pass the Terrorist \nFirearms Detection Act, so that hopefully President Bush can sign it \ninto law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13706-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13706-S13707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY IN 1942\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues a \nfascinating article by Dr. James Schlesinger, who served our Nation in \na number of prestigious positions, such as Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary of Energy, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. \nThe article, ``Underappreciated Victory,'' was published in the October \n2003, issue of the Naval History magazine, a publication of the Naval \nInstitute Proceedings. The article calls for the recognition of the \nworld-historic significance of the Battle of Midway in 1942 because it \nwas the turning point in our Nation's war in the Pacific, which, in \nturn, proved critical to our efforts in the European theater of war. \nYet the Battle of Midway, which played such a crucial strategic role \nfor both the European and Pacific war, scarcely gets mentioned in the \nhistory books. I wish to submit a copy of Dr. Schlesinger's article to \nbe printed in the Record. This brilliant article sets the record \nstraight.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Naval History Magazine, Oct. 2003]\n\n                        Underappreciated Victory\n\n                         (By James Schlesinger)\n\n       As we honor those who turned the tide of World War II with \n     a victory over ostensibly overwhelming force at the Battle of \n     Midway in 1942--61 years ago--too few of us understand the \n     battle's world-historic significance. It is essential, \n     therefore, for us to go forth and proselytize.\n       I continue to be puzzled over the fact that it comes as \n     something of a revelation to many people that this battle \n     played such a crucial strategic role for the war in Europe. \n     So the question before us is: Why is Midway not recognized as \n     the crucial battle for the West in World War II, just as \n     Stalingrad is recognized as a crucial battle for the Soviet \n     Union? The comparative neglect of Midway is a great \n     historical puzzle and, in a sense, a great injustice.\n       In relation to what British Prime Minister Winston \n     Churchill and others called Grand Strategy, Midway was far \n     more than a decisive naval victory. It was far more than the \n     turning of the tide in the Pacific war. In a strategic sense, \n     Midway represents one of the great turning points of world \n     history. And in that role, the battle remains \n     underappreciated.\n       Consider the Grand Strategy of the Allies, which Churchill \n     naturally preferred and President Franklin D. Roosevelt was \n     eager to endorse. It was, quite simply, to deal with Adolf \n     Hitler and with the German threat in Europe first. It has \n     been embraced shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, at the Arcadia Conference. President Roosevelt \n     clearly recognized and acted on the conviction that the Third \n     Reich was the greater menace. Dramatic as the Japanese \n     advance after Pearl Harbor had been, it was into slightly \n     developed colonial regions--to be sure, those possessing \n     rubber and tin. Yet, at its base, it was far less dangerous \n     than Hitler's continuing advance, crushing and then \n     organizing the industrial nations of Europe, while to that \n     point almost entirely obliterating far more formidable \n     resistance. But it was Japan that had attacked the United \n     States, and it was Japan on which the anger of the American \n     people had focused.\n       Though Churchill could almost automatically concentrate on \n     Europe, it required considerable courage for President \n     Roosevelt to carry through on the Grand Strategy. Germany's \n     declaration of war on the United States on 8 December 1941 \n     provided a small opening. Yet, had it not been for Midway, \n     President Roosevelt could not have persevered with a Europe-\n     first policy. Public opinion would not have allowed it. \n     Indeed, even after Midway, he paid a substantial political \n     price. In the mid-term election of 1942, the Democrats lost \n     44 seats in the House of Representatives, barely retaining \n     control, with comparable losses elsewhere. In a subsequent \n     poll of all the Democratic congressional candidates, the \n     principal reason given for the debacle: ``frustration'' and \n     fury at Roosevelt's Germany-first strategy, which translated \n     into failure to punish the Japanese more aggressively for \n     Pearl Harbor.\n       Nonetheless, despite the inclinations of the public, \n     President Roosevelt recognized that the larger threat lay \n     elsewhere, and he was prepared to pay the domestic political \n     price for that larger national objective, defined by his \n     Grand Strategy.\n       Consider the overall military situation in spring 1942, \n     Japan was on a roll. The Philippines had fallen, including \n     the final outposts of Bataan and Corregidor. The Japanese had \n     swept through the Malay Peninsula from French Indochina, and \n     on 15 February the supposedly ``impregnable fortress'' of \n     Singapore had fallen to numerically inferior Japanese forces. \n     The Dutch East Indies had been captured. Japanese forces were \n     advancing into Burma and threatening India. Even Australia \n     appeared to be a target. U.S. naval forces significantly \n     weakened by the attack at Pearl Harbor, appeared vastly \n     inferior to the armada that Japan was gathering to advance \n     eastward in the Pacific toward Midway--then possibly to the \n     Hawaiian Islands or even to the U.S. West Coast. Additional \n     Japanese victories would have made it politically impossible \n     for President Roosevelt to continue to pursue the Grand \n     Strategy of Europe-first.\n       Then came Midway. Through an extraordinary combination of \n     the skill and courage of our pilots, splendid intelligence, \n     prudent risk-taking by our commanders that paid off, and \n     sheer good luck, the apparently inferior U.S. forces were \n     victorious. This victory occurred despite inferior aircraft, \n     ineffective torpedoes, the substantial absence of backup \n     surface ships, and our overall numerical inferiority. The \n     rest is well known. Four Japanese carriers had been sunk, \n     confirming the dictum of Otto von Bismarck: ``the Lord God \n     has special providence for fools, drunkards, and the \n     United States of America.'' The Japanese offensive had \n     been blunted. The Japanese fleet turned back toward the \n     home islands, their opportunity for victory lost forever. \n     President Roosevelt could then execute his Grand Strategy, \n     with all that was to imply regarding the condition of \n     postwar Europe.\n       After Midway, the United States could, to the chagrin of \n     General Douglas MacArthur, turn its primary attention back to \n     the European theater. After the stunning surrender of Tobruk, \n     which appeared to jeopardize both\n\n[[Page S13707]]\n\n     Cairo and the Suez Canal, President Roosevelt thus could \n     accommodate the somewhat distraught Churchill's request for \n     300 of the new Sherman tanks to bolster the defenses in \n     Northeast Africa, ultimately leading to the victory at El \n     Alamein. The Battle of the Atlantic gradually turned with the \n     steady improvement in antisubmarine warfare, thereby helping \n     to ease the shipping shortage. By the fall, Operation Torch, \n     the landings in North Africa, initiated offensive operations \n     that ultimately led to the destruction of Field Marshal Erwin \n     Rommel's Afrika Korps. The invasion of Sicily soon followed, \n     succeeded by the invasion of Italy and eventually the \n     landings in Normandy.\n       Had these events not taken place or been much delayed, it \n     is possible the Soviet Union would not have survived. But if \n     it had, and succeeded in its march westward, the face of \n     postwar Europe would have been vastly different. Soviet \n     forces would have deployed farther to the west. Germany \n     likely would have been occupied in its entirety. The West's \n     foothold in Europe would have shrunk, perhaps dramatically. \n     The ability of France and Italy to survive communist \n     pressures, precarious as it was in 1947, would have been much \n     reduced. In brief, it was Midway, a battle in the distant \n     Pacific, that shaped the face of postwar Europe.\n       Despite its crucial historic role, Midway gets scarcely \n     more attention in our history books than the War of 1812 \n     naval battles on Lake Champlain or Lake Erie--let alone the \n     scant attention Europeans have paid to it. Let us reflect on \n     a few other notable battles that turned the tide of history.\n       In 480, B.C., Athens had fallen to the Persian army, but \n     Athens had in a sense survived in the form of its 200 naval \n     vessels that Athens, prodded by Themistiocles, an early \n     apostle of naval construction, had created. On 28 September \n     in the straits of Salamis, before the very eyes of the \n     Emperor Xerxes, the combined Greek naval force delivered a \n     devastating blow, sinking some 200 Persian ships, with the \n     loss of only 40 of their own. Xerxes, as Herodotus describes, \n     had wanted to rule Europe as well as Asia. Fearing an attack \n     on its bridges over the Hellespont, the Persian army largely \n     withdrew. Greek (and European) civilization had been \n     preserved. Indeed, begging pardon for a lapse from political \n     correctness, Europe had been saved from Oriental Despotism. \n     It was a naval battle that decided the fate of a \n     civilization, a turning point in history.\n       Each year, the English-speaking world celebrates Trafalgar. \n     Yet, it is not clear that even in the absence of victory \n     England would not have survived. Midway, at a minimum, was \n     the most decisive naval victory since Trafalgar, and perhaps \n     the most strategically decisive victory since Salamis.\n       What of the crucial battles here in the United States? The \n     Revolutionary War Battle of Yorktown is, of course, \n     celebrated appropriately. Yet, after the Battle of the Capes, \n     Yorktown was but the frosting on the cake, an almost \n     inevitable triumph. The Battle of Saratoga, by contrast, is \n     seen rightly as the turning point of the Revolution.\n       One is no doubt obliged to speak also of the Civil War \n     Battle of Gettysburg. Yet, while Gettysburg may have been the \n     high-water mark of the Confederacy, the outcome of the war \n     was never much in doubt. Just recall the remarks of that \n     military logistician, Rhett Butler, at the beginning of Gone \n     With the Wind, when he rebukes some Southern hotheads by \n     pointing to the overwhelming industrial domination of the \n     North.\n       They why, if Midway had such world-historic strategic \n     significance, has it received so much less attention than it \n     deserves? A recent documentary supposedly detailing the \n     Pacific War, produced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen \n     Ambrose, moves smoothly from Pearl Harbor to island hopping \n     in the western Pacific, with scarcely a mention of Midway. \n     How could such a momentous victory come to be overshadowed? \n     There are, I believe, three prominent reasons.\n       First, the Europeans are quite naturally even more \n     Eurocentric than we are. For them, the crucial battle for the \n     European theater had to begin the European theater itself and \n     not some remote spot in the Pacific. There is still little \n     sense in Europe of what a vast enterprise the war in the \n     Pacific was. El Alamein continues to be celebrated in the \n     United Kingdom. Similarly, the Battle of the Bulge is \n     celebrated annually here. But the outcomes of both those \n     battles were almost foreordained by the balance of forces.\n       Moreover, the most prominent, indeed almost the canonical, \n     history of World War II was written by Winston Churchill \n     himself. And where would Churchill look? Not to some purely \n     American engagement in the distant Pacific. Midway is \n     mentioned only in Churchill's six-volume history, with no \n     indication of how it shaped the outcome in Europe.\n       Second, Midway always has lain in the shadow of D-Day, \n     which occurred 2 years later, but which has an anniversary \n     that coincides with Midway in the calendar year. D-day, which \n     was truly touch-and-go, deserves all the attention it has \n     received. But it should not come at the detriment of Midway \n     itself. For without Midway, there would have been no D-Day on \n     6 June 1944, with all that that implies about the condition \n     of postwar Europe.\n       Third, it is also in a sense the fault of the U.S. Navy \n     itself. The Navy (take no offense) is both too shy in blowing \n     its own horn and too complacent. Naming a carrier after a \n     battle, for example, is considered so high an honor that \n     nothing more needs to be said.\n       Midway may be the victim of intraservice politics or more \n     exactly, intertribal fights. If one glorifies what was so \n     dramatically a carrier victory, it might be interpreted to \n     the detriment of the surface Navy and/or the submarine force. \n     So tact required a relatively discreet silence. Thus, \n     regarding the crucial significant of Midway in world history, \n     more than the submarine force has been the ``Silent \n     Service.''\n       Our British allies perennially have demonstrated a masterly \n     touch in displaying, not to say marketing, their armed forces \n     and their accomplishments. Go to London. See the centrality \n     of Trafalgar Square in the city. Observe that obelisk for \n     Admiral Horatio Nelson towering over the Square. It all \n     provides a setting and reinforcement for the annual \n     celebration of the naval battle itself. By contrast, Farragut \n     Square in Washington is a very dim competitor. And where, \n     pray tell, is Midway? It is, of course, the Midway, a part of \n     Chicago, named after the 1893 World's Fair--or a nearby \n     airport, a transition point halfway across the United States.\n       Now hear this! It is time to go forth and proselytize and \n     underscore the world-historic role of Midway. The battle and \n     its veterans deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13707-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13707-S13708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE VETERANS BENEFITS ENHANCEMENTS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition today to explain briefly the \nprovisions of S. 1132, the proposed Veterans Benefits Enhancements Act \nof 2003. This legislation, which was approved by the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs on September 30, 2003, incorporates provisions drawn \nfrom 13 different bills that were considered by the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs over the course of the first session. S. 1132, as so \namended, is a lengthy bill--almost 50 pages--and so I will not endeavor \nin this statement to explain in detail each and every provision of the \nbill. Rather, I will discuss the highlights in this statement, and \nrefer my colleagues to the committee report that accompanied approval \nof the bill for a more extended explanation of the bill.\n  The starting point for S. 1132, as reported, was S. 1132, the \nproposed ``Veterans' Survivors Benefits Enhancements Act of 2003,'' \nwhich I introduced on May 22, 2003. That bill, as its title indicates, \nfocused on the needs of the surviving families of veterans who were \ngravely injured or killed in war. It contained provisions to increase \nwidows' and orphans' educational assistance benefits, and to increase \ndependency and indemnity compensation (so-called ``DIC'') benefits--\nbenefits provided to the widows and surviving children of service \nmembers whose deaths are service related--in cases where the widow has \nat home at least one dependent child. The bill, as introduced, would \nhave also extended eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery to \nall surviving spouses of veterans, including a group now denied \neligibility--service members' widows who are remarried at the time of \ntheir deaths. And finally, S. 1132, as introduced, would have extended \nbenefits now provided to spina bifida-afflicted children of Vietnam \nveterans who were exposed to Agent Orange to the children of veterans \nwho served in another area where Agent Orange was widely used in 1967-\n1969, the Korean demilitarized zone, and who are afflicted with the \nsame birth defect.\n  I am pleased that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs approved all but \none of these provisions; one provision--the proposed increase in DIC \nbenefits for widows with dependent children--was, unfortunately, too \ncostly to proceed with at this time. I am pleased, as well that at mark \nup, the committee's members approved the addition of a number of other \nmeasures which were drawn from other bills that had been referred to \nthe committee for consideration. Among those provisions are the \nfollowing:\n  Provisions derived from bills introduced by Senators Murray (S. 517), \nCraig (S. 1239), and Graham of Florida (S. 1281) to improve medical \ncare and compensation benefits afforded to former prisoners of war;\n  Provisions derived from administration-requested legislation (S. \n1213) to increase benefits afforded to Filipinos who fought alongside \nU.S. troops in World War II;\n  Provisions derived from administration-requested legislation (S. \n1133) to improve the VA's educational assistance, life insurance, and \nState cemetery grant programs; and\n  Provisions derived from a bill introduced by Committee Ranking \nMember,\n\n[[Page S13708]]\n\nBob Graham, (S. 1281) to authorize further funding and oversight of the \nDepartment of Defense and Institute of Medicine activities to identify \nthe causes of, and treatments for, injuries related to exposures to \nAgent Orange, radiation, and other environmental dangers by service \nmembers.\n  The bill also contains various measures to assure that, despite the \nenactment of the significant improvements contained within the bill, \nthe bill will nonetheless be in compliance with Budget Enforcement Act \nstrictures against the enactment of ``mandatory account'' spending \nmeasures without accompanying ``pay-go'' offsets.\n  S. 1132, as amended, is good legislation that is supported, on a \nbipartisan basis, by all of the members of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. Further, its key provisions are supported by VA Secretary \nAnthony J. Principi and by the major veterans' service organizations. I \nask that the Senate approve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13708-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION FOR THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

According to Solucient, the Top 100 \nhospitals treat more, and sicker, patients with better survival rates \nand fewer complications.\n  I am pleased to acknowledge Solucient's selection of Colorado \nhospitals for its quality service, dedication, and commitment to \nproviding quality health care for Colorado, the Nation, and the world. \nFirst, Solucient has recognized Saint Joe's Hospital in Denver in its \nstudies of orthopedic and intensive care units. According to the \nhospital, Saint Joe delivers more babies than any other Colorado \nhospital, serves more patients in gastroenterology, general surgery, \npulmonology, cardiac care, nephrology and rheumatology than any other \nacute care hospital in the Denver metropolitan area, and for the past 5 \nyears the hospital has cared for more cardiology and open heart surgery \npatients than any other acute care hospital in the metro area.\n  Second, Exempla Lutheran Medical Center specializes in cardiology, \noncology, orthopedic services, and women's health care. Lutheran \nMedical also provides special care to the community through its \ncommunity clinics, special programs and services for the elderly, and \nhospice care. In addition, Lutheran Medical Center's Emergency \nDepartment has the second highest patient load in the Denver \nmetropolitan area.\n  Third, with a mission of commitment to patients, Rose Medical Center \nin Denver asserts a reputation for high quality health care and quality \ncustomer service. Rose Medical Center specializes in women's health \nservices, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatric care, and \nemergency services. Rose Medical Center also partners with \nphilanthropic organizations to help offer services to the Colorado \ncommunity. Further, Rose Medical Center is the official health care \nprovider for the Denver Nuggets professional basketball team and the \nColorado Avalanche professional hockey team.\n  Fourth, Solucient recognized a teaching hospital in Englewood, \nColorado, Swedish Medical Center, which has six ``Centers of \nExcellence:'' the Colorado Neurological Institute, adult & pediatric \ntrauma services, advanced radiology capabilities, cardiology services, \ncancer treatment services, and women's and children's services. In \naddition, Swedish is a Level I Trauma Center and is a leading referral \ncenter for neurotrauma. Swedish also offers services for the elderly, \nemergency medical service education, and has a Family Medicine \nResidency Program.\n  I am pleased these Colorado hospitals have been recognized as leaders \nin quality, efficiency, and financial responsibility in institutional \nhealth care. I laud their work and am expectant for their continued \nhigh quality of care and progress for Colorado and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13708-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13708-S13709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HONORING DR. MARTHA RHODES ROBERTS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \nfine humanitarian and Floridian, Dr. Martha Rhodes Roberts, who is \nretiring on October 31. Throughout her 34-year career with the Florida \nDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Dr. Martha Rhodes \nRoberts has contributed to Florida's agriculture food safety industry \nas a scientific authority, industry counselor, strategist, and partner \nin the endeavors of Florida agricultural producers. She has become an \nexpert on minimizing food contamination for consumers, by helping to \ndevelop safer standards in food processing. Dr. Rhodes Roberts' \ndedication to safe food practices has enriched the lives of Floridians \nand Americans.\n  Since beginning her career with the Florida Department of Agriculture \nand Consumer Services as a microbiologist in the Food Laboratory in \n1968, Dr. Roberts has been a tireless advocate to ensure the food \nAmericans eat is safe and abundant while at the same time helping the \nagricultural community to minimize their impacts on the environment. In \naddition to these achievements, she has the distinction of serving as \nthe first female Assistant Commissioner of Agriculture for a State \nagency in the country. During her tenure at the Florida Department of \nAgriculture and Consumer Services, Dr. Roberts was instrumental in \nFlorida's food safety program becoming one of the preeminent State food \nsafety programs in the country. She also has overseen the divisions of \npesticides, fertilizers, seeds, agricultural water policy, soil and \nwater conservation, animal feeds, aquaculture and dairy and animal \nindustries during her long career with the department.\n  Dr. Roberts has served on several Federal advisory groups for the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and she has served as president of the \nAssociation of Food and Drug Officials, comprised of all States, FDA \nand USDA. She was instrumental in organizing the Conference for Food \nProtection, a national body to set food safety standards for all \nStates. Dr. Roberts is a member of the Institute of Food Technologists' \nScience Advisory Board, which provides scientific review and analysis \nof issues in food safety, food processing\n\n[[Page S13709]]\n\nand human health. Dr. Roberts has utilized her expertise in food safety \nto assist producers, packers and processors in implementing new \ntechnologies designed to minimize food contamination, ensuring the \nhighest quality and safest food products for consumers.\n  In 1996, recognizing that natural resource management was critical \nfor Florida agriculture's long term viability, Dr. Roberts advocated \nthe creation of the Office of Agricultural Water Policy within the \nDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Today it remains the \nonly water policy office housed within a State department of \nagriculture. She also spearheaded the formation of the Suwannee River \nBasin Nutrient Management Working Group, a 26-member public-private \npartnership formed to assess nutrient loadings to the Suwannee River \nWatershed and effect reductions via voluntary, incentive-based \nprograms. This innovative approach has resulted in dramatic \nenvironmental benefits to the watershed as a whole. Dr. Roberts was \ninstrumental in the establishment of the Commissioner of Agriculture's \nAg-Environmental Leadership Awards Program. This program, now in its \nninth year, annually recognizes those Florida growers and ranchers who \nemploy innovative management practices designed to optimize the \nprotection of wildlife, effectively manage pesticides and nutrients, \nprotect water quality, and conserve soil and water.\n  Dr. Roberts has been recognized with numerous awards and \ncommendations for her efforts. In 2003, she received Florida's \nagriculture industry's highest honor when she was inducted into the \nFlorida Agricultural Hall of Fame. Dr. Roberts has been a strong \nadvocate of using a common sense approach when implementing a \nregulatory program. She helped win passage of Florida's country of \norigin labeling law in 1979 and worked to see this law become a Federal \nreality in 2002. For her many years of service ensuring the food \nAmericans eat is safe, abundant and affordable, I am proud to \nacknowledge the work of Dr. Martha Rhodes Roberts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13709-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message for the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13709-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \na massage from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13709-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 3289) making emergency supplemental appropriations for defense \nand for the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker of the House has signed \nthe following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1610.

A bill to require criminal background checks on all firearms \ntransactions occurring at events that provide a venue for the sale, \noffer for sale, transfer, or exchange of firearms, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I take a backseat to no one in my support \nof Second Amendment rights. But this right, which Americans have fought \nand died for, does not extent to terrorists, criminals and illegal \naliens. That is why I am pleased to announce today a landmark agreement \non gun show legislation that I have reached with Senators Jack Reed, \nMike DeWine, and Joe Lieberman.\n  The bill accomplishes two critical goals: It protects gun shows as a \nviable business and ongoing enterprise, and it slams the door on \ncriminals, terrorists and illegal aliens who have successfully \nexploited a loophole in our gun\n\n[[Page S13712]]\n\nsafety laws to acquire firearms at gun shows for nefarious purposes.\n  I know the gun safety issue is controversial in Congress and that \nthere is a great deal of passion on both sides. This legislation \nreplaces passion with pragmatism. It stakes out a sensible middle \nground to solve the real problem of criminals and terrorists getting \nguns at gun shows without burdening gun show operators with punishing \npaperwork or treating enthusiasts who attend these shows as pariahs.\n  For gun rights advocates like myself, this bill does not retreat one \ninch in the battle to protect our Second Amendment rights. It treats \ngun show operators and patrons with respect and requires simply that \nbackground checks be performed on all firearms sales at gun shows. For \nthose who are rightly concerned about gun violence, this bill simply \nand straightforwardly accomplishes the goal of closing a loophole that \nhas fueled illegal gun trafficking in America.\n  I am a gun owner and I have attended many gun shows in my state of \nArizona. More than most people, I know that the majority of gun show \npatrons and sellers are honest, law abiding citizens. But I also know \nthat there is a sinister element that attends these shows and exploits \nthis loophole.\n  Defenders of gun shows, like myself, cannot ignore the staggering \nstatistic that gun shows are the second leading source of firearms \nrecovered in illegal gun trafficking investigations conducted by ATF. \nJust this week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that ATF agents \nseized 572 firearms from five unlicensed sellers who were exploiting \nthe gun show loophole in ways that threaten the safety of American \ncitizens. The same article quoted an ATF agent saying ``crime guns do \noriginate at gun shows. That's been documented.''\n  The fact that gun shows are a leading source of crime guns is reason \nenough to close the gun show loophole, but we also know of at least \nthree cases where alleged terrorists used the gun show loophole to \npurchase firearms and that makes closing this loophole imperative.\n  On September 10, 2001, a Federal court in Detroit convicted Ali \nBoumelhem, a known member of the terrorist group Hezbollah on seven \ncounts of weapons charges for smuggling shotguns, ammunition, flash \nsuppressors, and assault weapons parts to Lebanon.\n  FBI agents followed Boumelhem to at least three Michigan gun shows in \nOctober 2000. According to the Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, the \nshipment in which he was finally arrested was part of a pattern--\nBoumelhem ``traveled frequently to gun shows to buy arms and then hid \nthem in cargo crates bound for Lebanon.'' According to the Associated \nPress, ``Federal agents say they watched Boumelhem, a resident of \nDetroit and Beirut, travel to gun shows to buy gun parts and ammunition \nfor shipment overseas.''\n  On October 30, 2001, Muhammad Asrar, a Pakistani national with \nsuspected al-Qaeda ties, pleaded guilty in Federal court in Texas to \nfirearms-related charges. He was convicted of illegally possessing 50 \nrounds of 9mm ammunition. He was also convicted on an immigration \ncharge--illegally overstaying his student visa since 1988.\n  Asrar was arrested after an anonymous informant told authorities that \nAsrar had asked him whether he would smuggle a foreign national across \nthe border from Mexico. Asrar also allegedly asked the informant if he \nwould take pictures of tall buildings for him during his travels. \nPolice seized several photos of tall buildings from Asrar's store.\n  Asrar admitted to authorities that he had bought and sold a variety \nof guns at Texas gun shows over the previous 7 years, including a copy \nof a Sten submachine gun, a Ruger Mini-14 rifle, two handguns, and a \nhunting rifle.\n  Despite the final adjudication of the ammunition and immigration \ncharges, which can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, Asrar \nremains under investigation by a Federal grand jury. According to the \nNew York Times, Asrar is being investigated for possible links to al-\nQaeda.\n  Connor Claxton is an Irish national and an admitted member of the \nIrish Republican Army who is currently serving a prison term for \nattempting to smuggle guns bought in Florida to Ireland. At his trial \nhe testified about how he came to the United States on IRA orders to \nbuy weapons and ammunition for shipment back to Ireland and that he \nchose to come to Florida because ``we don't have gun shows in Ireland, \nand you see things here like you never imagined.''\n  According to his co-conspirator Siobhan Browne, Claxton ``spent more \nthan $100,000 off the books on semi- and fully automatic weapons in \nsales from private dealers'' who are not required to perform background \nchecks. Browne also said that Mickey Couples, a senior IRA leader, told \nher that ``the gunrunning mission had been going on for four years and \nthat there were 50 IRA volunteers involved.''\n  In an era where America is right to be concerned about security, it \nis absolutely imperative that we close this dangerous loophole that \nallows criminals, terrorists, and illegal aliens to claim a right that \nthey don't deserve.\n  The McCain-Reed-DeWine-Lieberman bill requires instant criminal \nbackground checks for all firearm sales at gun shows. For licensed \ndealers selling at gun shows, this bill creates no new burdens. For \nunlicensed sellers, they will simply need to have an instant background \ncheck performed before they transfer a firearm. The instant check could \nbe performed by a licensed dealer, local law enforcement, or by a new \nentity created by this bill called a special licensee--an individual or \ngun show employee who may perform instant background checks at gun \nshows only.\n  The bill also defines a gun show in a fair and rational way. Any \npublic event where 75 or more firearms are offered for sale is defined \nin the legislation as a gun show. Collectors who sell their own guns \nfrom their own homes are exempt. In addition, private hunt clubs that \nbuy, sell, or trade firearms between members are also free from the \nrequirements of this bill.\n  Paperwork requirements under the bill are the minimum necessary to \nensure compliance with the law. I made sure that gun show operators \nwould not be buried under an avalanche of paper.\n  Finally, the bill allows States to seek a waiver to make the instant \ncheck even quicker for unlicensed sellers at gun shows once that State \nhas automated the records necessary to make the check as accurate as \npossible. I am aware that some sellers are concerned that the law \nallowing up to three business days to complete a background check is \nburdensome for weekend gun shows.\n  Currently, because of improvements made by Attorney General John \nAshcroft, 91 percent of all background checks are completed within five \nminutes and 95 percent are completed within two hours. For all intents \nand purposes, we now have a viable instant check system. But I would \nlike to get that 95 percent success rate up to 100 percent and this \nbill will help entice States to get their felony, domestic violence and \nmental health records in order so that no one has to wait days to be \napproved or denied a firearm under instant check.\n  This legislation should appeal to all but those who either hate guns \nand believe that no one should own them or those who believe that even \nterrorists, criminals and illegal aliens are protected under the Second \nAmendment. In 1999, every member of the Senate voted for some form of a \nbill to close the gun show loophole, but neither side was willing to \ncompromise for the sake of America. Let's stop playing politics with \nguns and support a bill that closes a serious loophole while respecting \nthe rights of those who enjoy gun shows. This is our chance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator McCain \nin introducing the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2003. We offer this \nlegislation to strengthen our Nation's gun laws by closing a loophole \nthat has allowed criminals to buy firearms at gun shows for far too \nlong. I look forward to working with Senator McCain and our fellow \ncosponsors to offer this legislation to the first appropriate vehicle \nthat comes before the Senate. In particular, it is our intention to \noffer this bill as an amendment to the gun industry immunity bill, S. \n659. If the Senate is going to consider granting immunity from civil \nliability to the firearms industry--an industry that Congress already \nexempted from the consumer product safety laws that apply to virtually \nevery other product sold in this country--it is critical that we \nprotect\n\n[[Page S13713]]\n\nthe American people by improving law enforcement oversight of commerce \nin firearms.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reported to Congress in \n2000 that gun shows are a major gun trafficking channel responsible for \nmore than 26,000 illegal firearms sales during the 18-month period ATF \nstudied. The FBI and ATF tell us again and again that convicted felons, \ndomestic abusers, and other prohibited purchasers are taking advantage \nof the gun show loophole. At least three suspected terrorists that we \nknow of have also exploited this loophole to acquire firearms, \nincluding one suspected al Qaeda member.\n  Under Federal law, Federal Firearms Licensees are required to \nmaintain careful records of their sales, and under the Brady Act, to \ncheck a purchaser's background with the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System before transferring any firearm. However, a \nperson does not need a Federal firearms license--and the Brady Act does \nnot apply--if the person is not ``engaged in the business'' of selling \nfirearms pursuant to Federal law. These unlicensed sellers make up one \nquarter or more of the sellers of firearms at thousands of gun shows in \nAmerica each year. Consequently, felons and other prohibited persons \nwho want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchases buy \nfirearms at gun shows.\n  Four years ago, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people at \nColumbine High School with weapons purchased from an unlicensed seller \nat a gun show. The woman who purchased those guns on behalf of Harris \nand Klebold testified to the Colorado legislature that she never would \nhave purchased the weapons had she been required to undergo a \nbackground check.\n  We have united behind this bipartisan legislation--which brings \ntogether provisions from several previous gun show bills--to make gun \nshow transactions safer for all Americans. The bill would require Brady \nLaw background checks on all firearms transactions at any event where \n75 or more guns are offered for sale. Three years after enactment, \nStates could apply to the Attorney General for certification for a 24-\nhour background check for unlicensed sellers at gun shows. In order to \nbe eligible for 24-hour certification, a State would be required to \nhave 95 percent of its disqualifying records automated and searchable \nunder NICS, including 95 percent of all domestic violence misdemeanor \nand restraining order records dating back 30 years. Before certifying \nany State for 24-hour background checks, the Attorney General would be \nrequired to establish a toll-free telephone number to enable State and \nlocal courts to immediately notify the NICS system any time a domestic \nviolence restraining order is filed, and courts within a certified \nState would be required to use the telephone number immediately upon \nthe filing of such an order. The bill also directs the Attorney General \nto work with States to encourage the development of computer systems \nthat would allow courts to provide electronic records to NICS \nimmediately. The Bureau of Justice Statistics would conduct an annual \nreview of all certified States to ensure they continue to meet the \nconditions for 24-hour background check certification.\n  Some will say that this legislation is an attempt to end gun shows, \nbut the experience of States that have closed the gun show loophole \nproves otherwise. California, for example, requires not only background \nchecks at gun shows but a 10-day waiting period for all gun sales, yet \ngun shows continue to thrive there. No, we are not trying to end gun \nshows. What we are trying to end is the free pass we're giving to \nterrorists and convicted felons that allows them to simply walk into a \ngun show, find a private dealer, buy whatever weapons they want and \nwalk out without a Brady background check.\n  In overwhelming numbers, the American people believe that background \nchecks should be required for all gun show sales. The people of \nColorado confirmed this after the Columbine tragedy when they approved \na ballot initiative to close the gun show loophole. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2003 so that \nwe can finally close this loophole in every State and make sure that \nconvicted felons, domestic abusers, and other prohibited persons do not \nuse gun shows to purchase firearms without a Brady background check.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of \nthe Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2003. I would like to thank \nSenators McCain, Lieberman and Reed for also sponsoring this common \nsense piece of legislation that aims to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and out of the hand of kids. It is a good bill--an important \nbill.\n  Gun ownership rights are clearly established in the United States \nConstitution. And, I am a firm supporter of the Second Amendment. I \nalso strongly believe that we have an obligation to protect the safety \nof law-abiding citizens and the safety of our most precious resource, \nour children.\n  As a former county prosecutor, I learned that the best way to reduce \nthe illegal and often fatal use of guns is to pass and enforce tough \nlaws that severely punish criminals who use them. That is why I \nconsistently have supported measures that keep firearms from getting \ninto the wrong hands in the first place and that increase the \npunishment of those who use firearms in the commission of a crime. The \nGun Show Loophole Closing Act helps achieve that goal.\n  Under the existing Brady law, when a purchaser buys a gun from a \nlicensed dealer, he or she must undergo a background check through the \nFederal Government's National Instant Criminal Background Check System \n(``NICS''), into which States feed records of certain criminals and \nothers not qualified to own a gun. NICS has up to three days to inform \nthe dealer as to whether the buyer is qualified to purchase a gun. If \nthe dealer receives no response by the end of the three-day period, the \ndealer is allowed to the sell the gun to that buyer. Ninety-five \npercent of NICS checks, however, do not take three days. They come up \nwith an instant or near instant response.\n  This bill we are introducing today simply applies the same common-\nsense checks to gun show sales. Right now, there is no statute \nrequiring that all sellers at gun shows run NICS checks on potential \ngun buyers; however, according to Federal officials, gun shows are the \nsecond leading source of illegal guns recovered from gun trafficking \ninvestigations. By leaving this loophole open--by not requiring all gun \nshow sellers to run NICS checks--we are presenting gun traffickers and \nother criminals with a prime opportunity to acquire firearms. This is \nterrifying and this is unacceptable. Only last week, Federal \nauthorities arrested a Georgia man who sold large quantities of \nfirearms at Georgia gun shows. These firearms have been recovered in \nsubsequent crimes in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and here in \nWashington, DC.\n  Furthermore, following the attacks on September 11th, it came to \nlight that Al Qaeda produced a handbook in which it advised terrorists \nto purchase firearms at gun shows in the United States. In fact, at \nleast three suspected terrorists have exploited this loophole to \nacquire firearms. Therefore, it is imperative, now more than ever, to \nenact legislation to protect our citizens from this potential area of \nterrorist exploitation.\n  This bill is common sense. The laws for purchasing firearms at gun \nshows and stores should be the same. We have the same responsibility to \nmake sure that gun owners are qualified--regardless of where they buy \ntheir guns. This bill closes the gun show loophole in a way that \nrespects the Second Amendment and honest, law-abiding Americans' right \nto buy and sell guns and attend gun shows. That's good law. That's good \npolicy. That's why we should pass this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators McCain, \nReed, DeWine, Lautenberg, Schumer and Chafee in introducing this \nimportant legislation. This bill aims to build common ground on gun \nviolence--a problem that has too often divided Members of Congress. As \ncitizens of this great Democracy, we have rights and we have \nresponsibilities. We have the right to own guns, but we have a \nresponsibility not to sell them to criminals. That is the simple but \nimportant set of values on which the legislation we introduce today is \nfounded.\n  For several decades, our Nation has had a clear policy against \nallowing\n\n[[Page S13714]]\n\nconvicted felons to buy guns, because we know that mixing criminals and \nguns far too often yields violent results. Through the Brady law, we \nestablished what seems like an obvious corollary to that policy--a \nrequirement that those selling guns determine whether someone trying to \nbuy a firearm isn't supposed to get one before they sell it to them. \nThe Brady law has been an enormous success. Since its enactment, \nbackground checks have stopped almost one million gun sales to those \nwho by law aren't allowed to own guns--convicted felons, spouse \nabusers, fugitives from justice, among others. This has saved an untold \nnumber of our citizens from the violence, injury or death the sale of \nmany of these guns would have brought.\n  But the Brady law contained an unfortunate loophole that has since \nbeen exploited to allow convicted felons and other people who shouldn't \nown guns to evade the background check requirement by buying their guns \nat gun shows. The problem is that Brady applies only to Federal \nFirearms Licensees, so-called FFLs--people who are in the business of \nselling guns. Brady explicitly exempts from the background check \nrequirement anyone ``who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or \npurchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or \nfor a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of \nfirearms.'' As a result, any person selling guns as a hobby or only \noccasionally, whether at a gun show, flea market or elsewhere, need not \nobtain a Federal license and therefore has no obligation to conduct a \nbackground check. This means that any person wanting to avoid a \nbackground check can go to a gun show, find out which vendors are not \nFFLs, and buy a gun. This situation is dangerous not only because it \nallows convicted felons and other prohibited persons to buy guns, but \nalso because--in contrast to FFLs--non-FFLs have no obligation to keep \nrecords of the transaction, thereby depriving law enforcement of the \nability to trace the gun if it later turns up at a crime scene.\n  Our bill will change that. We will make sure that no one will be able \nto buy a gun at a gun show without it first being determined whether \nthat person is a convicted felon, a spouse abuser or a member of one of \nthe other categories of people we all agree should not be allowed to \nbuy guns.\n  Our bill does this, though, by taking into account some of the \nconcerns that were expressed about previous efforts to close this \nloophole.\n  First, our bill has a simple definition of a gun show--an event where \n75 or more guns are offered or exhibited for sale--and we make clear \nthat that definition doesn't include sales from a private collection by \nnonlicensed sellers out of their homes.\n  Second, to respond to the argument that previous proposals made it \ntoo difficult for nonlicensed sellers to fulfill the background check \nrequirement, our bill makes sure that nonlicensed sellers will have \neasy access to someone who can initiate background checks for them, by \ncreating a new class of licensee whose sole purpose will be to initiate \nbackground checks at gun shows.\n  Third, we have tried to respond to those who say that a three-day \ncheck is too long for gun shows, because those events only last a \ncouple of days. It is worth noting that the length allowed for the \ncheck doesn't affect the overwhelming majority of gun purchasers, \nbecause over 90 percent of checks are completed almost instantly. But \nto allay the concerns that have been expressed, we have come up with a \ncompromise that authorizes a State to move to a 24-hour check for \nnonlicensed dealers at gun shows when the State can prove that a 24-\nhour check is feasible. A State can prove that by showing that 95 \npercent of the records that would disqualify people in that State from \nbuying guns are computerized and searchable by the NICS system. And, \nbecause of the particular need to keep guns out of the hands of spouse \nabusers, the bill specifically provides that a State must have \ncomputerized 95 percent of its domestic violence misdemeanor and \nrestraining order records dating back 30 years before it is eligible to \ngo to a 24-hour check at gun shows.\n  One significant difference between the bill Senator McCain and I \nintroduced last Congress and the one we introduce today is that my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, has worked with us to craft \na single gun show loophole closing bill. I am truly pleased that we can \nnow all go forward together in a unified effort to bring greater \nresponsibility to our gun laws.\n  Now I know that there are many, including President Bush, who argue \nthat what we need to solve the gun violence problem are not new laws \nbut the enforcement of existing ones. I agree with part of that \nstatement, and firmly support efforts to crack down on those who \nviolate our gun laws. But I believe we must go farther than that, \nbecause we will never be able to enforce existing laws unless we close \nthe loopholes in them that criminals exploit. And we all know that \nthere is a big loophole in the provision saying that felons and spouse \nabusers aren't supposed to buy guns, and that is that criminals know \nthat if they go to a gun show, they will be able to avoid the \nbackground check that was set up to keep them from getting guns.\n  Gun crime remains a critical public safety problem. For too long, \ndifferences over finding a solution to that problem have unnecessarily \ndivided the Congress, and the American people have been left to suffer \nthe violent consequences. But the reality is that most of us agree on \nmost of the critical questions. We agree that the laws on the books \nshould be enforced, that the rights of law-abiding gun owners should be \nprotected, and that convicted felons and spouse abusers shouldn't be \nable to get guns. The bill we are introducing today would write those \nprinciples into law. I hope all of my colleagues support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lott, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Inhofe, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 1808. A bill to provide for the preservation and restoration of \nhistoric buildings at historically women's public colleges and \nuniversities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I rise to re-introduce legislation \nto help preserve the heritage of seven historic women's colleges and \nuniversities. The legislation would authorize the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development to provide restoration and preservation grants \nfor historic buildings and structures at seven historically women's \npublic colleges or universities. The bill directs the Secretary to \naward $14 million annually from fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to the \nseven institutions.\n   The sweeping changes of the industrial revolution prompted Congress \nin 1862, with further action in 1887 and 1890, to provide Federal \nsupport for the establishment of agricultural and mechanical colleges \nwith growing emphasis on industrial and technical education. \nUnfortunately, these ``land-grant'' schools were only for men, leaving \nwomen untrained as they entered the expanded work force. Women's \nadvocates, such as Miss Julia Tutwiler in Alabama, immediately \nrecognized the need for institutions where women could receive an equal \neducation. Beginning in 1884, seven institutions in seven separate \nStates were established as industrial schools for women. These \ninstitutions include the Mississippi University for Women, the \nUniversity of Montevallo in Alabama, Georgia College and State \nUniversity, Winthrop University in South Carolina, University of North \nCarolina at Greensboro, Texas Women's University, and the University of \nScience and Arts of Oklahoma. These seven institutions remain open, \nproviding a liberal arts education for both men and women, but retain \nsignificant historical and academic features of those pioneering \nefforts to educate women. Despite their continued use, many of the \nstructures located on these campuses are facing destruction or closure \nbecause preservation funds are not available. My legislation would \nenable these buildings to be preserved and maintained by providing \nfunding for the historic buildings located at the colleges and \nuniversities I have identified. No more than $14 million would be \navailable and would be distributed in equal amounts to the seven \ninstitutions. My bill also requires a 20 percent matching contribution \nfrom non-Federal sources and assures that alterations to the properties \nusing the funds\n\n[[Page S13715]]\n\nare subject to approval from the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and reasonable public access for interpretive and \neducational purposes.\n  These historically women's colleges and universities have contributed \nsignificantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through \npostsecondary education for women, many of whom would not have had the \nopportunity otherwise. I believe it is our duty to do all we can to \npreserve these historic institutions, and I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13715-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13715-S13719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 256--OBSERVING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MUTUAL \n  DEFENSE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, \nAFFIRMING THE DEEP COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF THE \nUNITED STATES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, AND THANKING THE \nREPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM \n  AND TO THE STABILIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nDodd, and Mr. Hagel) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 256\n\n       Whereas October 1, 2003, marked the 50th anniversary of the \n     signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United \n     States of America and the Republic of Korea, signed at \n     Washington October 1, 1953, and entered into force November \n     17, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as the ``Mutual Defense \n     Treaty'');\n       Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea have \n     formed a bond through the common struggle against communist \n     aggression;\n       Whereas more than 34,000 Americans lost their lives \n     fighting in the Korean War, and approximately 37,000 men and \n     women of the United States Armed Forces are still deployed on \n     the Korean peninsula, enduring separation from their families \n     and other hardships in the defense of freedom;\n       Whereas the Mutual Defense Treaty has been instrumental in \n     securing peace on the Korean peninsula and providing an \n     environment in which the Republic of Korea has become an \n     economically vibrant, free, democratic society;\n       Whereas the foundation of the Mutual Defense Treaty rests \n     not only on a common adversary, but more importantly on a \n     shared interest in, and commitment to, peace, democracy, and \n     freedom on the Korean peninsula, in Asia, and throughout the \n     world;\n       Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea are \n     working closely together to find a diplomatic solution to the \n     threat posed by North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and \n     the export by North Korea of ballistic missiles;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea is making valuable \n     contributions to the global war on terrorism, including the \n     contribution of logistics support for international forces \n     operating in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea has pledged $260,000,000 and \n     has already sent 700 military engineers and medical personnel \n     to assist in the United States-led effort to stabilize and \n     reconstruct Iraq; and\n       Whereas South Korea President Roh Moo-hyun pledged on \n     October 18, 2003, to dispatch additional troops to work \n     alongside United States and coalition forces in Iraq: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes the 50th anniversary of the Mutual Defense \n     Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic \n     of Korea, signed at Washington October 1, 1953, and entered \n     into force November 17, 1954;\n       (2) reaffirms the deep cooperation and friendship between \n     the people of the United States and the people of the \n     Republic of Korea; and\n       (3) thanks the Republic of Korea for its contributions to \n     the global war on terrorism and to the stabilization and \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this resolution is cosponsored by my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, Senator Lugar, as well as Senators Kerry, Brownback, Dodd, \nand Hagel. It recognizes the 50th anniversary of the United States-\nRepublic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty and is thanking the Republic of \nKorea for its contributions to the global war on terrorism.\n  The United States has no better friend in Asia than the Republic of \nKorea. South Koreans have been there for us time and again, just as we \nhave been for them.\n  Our alliance has paid dividends on and off the Korean Peninsula. Most \nrecently, South Korea has aided the U.S. effort in Afghanistan and \nIraq. South Korea has already sent 700 military engineers and medical \npersonal to Iraq, and President Roh pledged on October 18 to dispatch \nadditional troops to work alongside U.S. forces there. South Korea has \nalso pledged $260 million in grants to help reconstruct Iraq.\n  The resolution I offer today observes the 50th anniversary of our \nalliance, thanks South Korea for its contributions to the global war on \nterrorism, and reaffirms the deep cooperation and friendship that \nexists between our two countries.\n  That cooperation and friendship are sorely needed now, given the \nchallenges posed by North Korea. North Korea today is on the verge of \nbecoming a nuclear bomb factory. The United States needs to redouble \nits diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to change its course.\n  President Bush, I note, has repeatedly called for a ``peaceful, \ndiplomatic'' solution to this crisis, and has worked with our friends \nand allies in that region toward that goal. I believe President Bush's \ninstincts are correct on this issue.\n  Last week President Bush told the leaders of Asia that the United \nStates is prepared to provide security assurances to North Korea if \nNorth Korea takes tangible steps to dismantle its nuclear program. I \nfind that very encouraging. But in my view we need to do more. That is \nessentially where we left off at the end of the last administration, \nwhen we were working within the Agreed Framework.\n  What we need to do is have more contact with North Korea. There were \nonly 40 minutes of one-on-one dialog with North Korea last August in \nBeijing. That, with the translation requirements in such an exchange, \nis barely enough time to clear one's throat.\n  Second, we should use the combination of carrots and sticks to \nconvince North Korea to change its course. The sticks are in play, \nincluding the proliferation security initiative and a coordinated \ncrackdown on the North's elicit activities, including narcotics \ntrafficking and counterfeiting, among others.\n  We need to identify as well some incentives for the good behavior \nthat would come if, in fact, there is a verifiable North Korean effort \nalong the path toward nuclear disarmament. This is not giving in to \nblackmail. It is a positive reinforcement, and there is a huge \ndifference between the two.\n  Third, we need to sustain and consider increasing humanitarian food \nand medical aid to North Korea. Nothing about this crisis will be \nimproved by having more hungry or sick North Korean children. This \nyear, the United States provided only 40,000 tons of food aid to the \nNorth a generous donation, to be sure, but a pittance against the world \nprogram appeal of more than 600,000 tons is needed, and far below the \nfood aid levels the United States has provided in previous years.\n\n  I note there is some dispute about the access of this food aid to the \npeople of North Korea, people we need to help. The fact is the World \nFood Program and the director have reported significant progress \ntowards monitoring delivery of food and ensuring that the aid reaches \nthose most in need. Further, the food aid we have provided we seem \nfairly well assured is in fact getting where it is intended.\n  Finally, we need to speak with one voice. The administration has yet \nto fully resolve the deep internal divisions over the direction of the \nPresident's policy. Some senior officials in the administration \ncontinue to argue against this policy of engagement. As a matter of \nfact, they seem to occasionally look forward to tweaking the North \nKoreans. I might add there is very little social redeeming value in the \npolicies of Kim Jong Il in North Korea. I am not arguing he is a \nparticularly reasonable man, but it seems to me there should be one \nvoice and one policy coming out of the administration. Prospects for \ndiplomatic solutions are in direct proportion to one voice.\n  To state the obvious, as I know the Presiding Officer knows, time is \nnot our ally in this crisis. The United States needs to communicate \nboth the risks of North Korea's current path and the benefits North \nKorea could enjoy if it chooses to verifiably abandon its\n\n[[Page S13716]]\n\npursuit of nuclear weapons and its export of ballistic missiles. Since \nthe United States first confronted North Korea with allegations about \nits illegal program to produce highly enriched uranium last October, \nthe North has ended its safeguards agreement with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, taken its plutonium reprocessing plant out of mothballs, begun \nto reprocess at least some of its 8,000 spent-fuel rods, and has \nactivated its Yongbyon nuclear reactor to produce still more spent \nfuel.\n  I am not suggesting we should not have pointed out their violation. I \nam not suggesting their response is remotely approaching anything \nrational. What I am suggesting is a sense of urgency and a requirement \nfor us to be on the same page with our South Korean and Japanese \nfriends as well as continuing to engage the Chinese and the Russians in \nattempting to come to a resolution here.\n  The North's pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a great threat to the \ninterests not only of the United States but to the entire region. As \nthe North's stockpile of fissile material grows, the likelihood the \nNorth will test a nuclear weapon and prove the viability of its design \nincreases, as does the difficulty of securing the North's fissile \nmaterial in any crisis. Moreover, we have no guarantee North Korea will \nnot export fissile material. All we know for certain is if the North \nputs a nuke on the auction block, the bidders are not likely to be our \nfriends.\n  Finally, the North's nuclear ambitions could prompt other countries \nin the region--notably Japan and South Korea--to rethink their own \nopposition to nuclear arms. I don't only think that is probable but I \nthink that is likely. As we all know, once Japan made that decision, it \nwould be a matter of months before Japan would be a nuclear armed \npower. We think that would be a very bad idea. That, in my view, is why \nthe Chinese have become so engaged now in helping us put some pressure \non these multilateral talks with South Korea to get them to change \ntheir behavior. I believe China understands that if North Korea \ncontinues down this path, there is almost a certainty Japan will. Japan \nbecoming a nuclear power would change the dynamic and the equation for \nthe Chinese, and the race will be on.\n  The President has the right goal--to complete verifiable and \nirreversible dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons program. The \nonly debate is how do we get there. I think the way we get there is the \nPresident should either endow Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly \nwith more authority to drive North Korean policy or, alternatively, \nappoint a special envoy with access to the President to represent the \nUnited States in future negotiations. Second, we should strive for a \nnoncoercive negotiating environment.\n  This means that North Korea should freeze its reactor, cease all \nreprocessing and uranium enrichment activities, and place under \nsafeguards any fissile material that it has acquired since the Agreed \nFramework of 1994 was signed. For our part, the United States should \nreiterate that it has no hostile intent toward North Korea and pledge \nnot to launch any military strikes or seek new sanctions so long as the \nfreeze remains in place and talks to resolve the crisis continue.\n  Finally, we should pursue a phased, reciprocal, verifiable agreement \nto eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program, terminate its \nexport of ballistic missiles, and more closely integrate the North into \nthe community of nations.\n  Some say North Korea cannot be trusted. They are right. Modifying \nPresident Reagan's maxim, we should mistrust, and verify.\n  But the alternatives to negotiating are grim. Our current approach \nleads to one of two undesirable outcomes: Either the United States will \nessentially acquiesce to the North's serial production of nuclear \nweapons or we may find ourselves in a military confrontation with a \ndesperate, nuclear-armed regime. Any preemptive military strike option \nwould place millions of South Koreans and tens of thousands of \nAmericans at risk.\n  How do we go to war with the North if the South does not support it, \nif that were the second option?\n  Negotiations with North Korea are not easy, but they offer us the \nbest chance--I believe the only chance--to avoid a nuclear nightmare on \nthe Korean peninsula.\n  I would like to submit a bipartisan staff report by the members of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee who traveled to North Korea \nimmediately following the six-party talks in Beijing in August. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my marks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying today's paper \ncarries the news that the quixotic and unreliable and often inscrutable \nactions of the North Koreans have brought the Supreme Leader of North \nKorea to the position where he is now saying he will engage in \nmultilateral talks again and resume those talks, and that he is ready \nto consider what has been rejected before.\n  That is the sense of the article.\n  I have no inherent faith that we can rely upon the President of North \nKorea. But it seems to me we have everything to gain and nothing to \nlose by continuing to pursue these talks. We give nothing, and at a \nminimum what we do is put ourselves in the position where the most \nisolated remaining country in the world at least is exposed to the \nnotions of other major nations in the world, including China, Russia, \nSouth Korea, Japan, and the United States as to what we consider to be \nappropriate behavior. Hopefully, that will have a salutary impact on \nthe willingness to negotiate an end to these programs.\n  The alternative of not pursuing that is bleak. Therefore, I encourage \nthe President of the United States to continue down this path and to \ncontinue down the path more quickly than we have thus far.\n\n                                Exhibit 1\n\n           Six Party Talks and the North Korean Nuclear Issue\n\n                                                 October 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       Dear Senators Lugar and Biden: In late August, Keith Luse \n     and Frank Jannuzi traveled to China and North Korea, and Mr. \n     Jannuzi traveled to South Korea, to examine the prospects for \n     a peaceful negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear \n     issue and to follow-up on an earlier set of visits to North \n     Korea in an effort to gain greater transparency on food aid \n     issues. Throughout the course of the visit, the staff \n     delegation received commendable support from U.S. Diplomatic \n     personnel. The delegation enjoyed high level access to \n     Chinese, North Korean, and South Korean government officials, \n     and also met with numerous academics, think tank specialists, \n     and employees of non-governmental organizations concerned \n     with developments on the Korean Peninsula. Our key findings, \n     including some recommendations for next steps on the Korean \n     Peninsula, are reported below.\n           Sincerely,\n     Keith Luse,\n       Professional Staff Member, Majority Staff, East Asian and \n     Pacific Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n     Frank Jannuzi,\n       Professional Staff Member, Minority Staff, East Asian and \n     Pacific Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff members \n     Keith Luse and Frank Jannuzi traveled to Northeast Asia \n     August 21-September 2 to examine the prospects for a peaceful \n     negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear issue and to \n     follow-up on their earlier set of visits to North Korea \n     designed to push for greater North Korean transparency and \n     accountability on food aid and humanitarian relief. The \n     delegation expresses its appreciation to U.S. diplomatic \n     personnel at Embassies Beijing and Seoul who helped set up \n     productive meetings and coped with the vagaries of arranging \n     travel to and from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     (DPRK).\n       Over the course of three days in Pyongyang, the delegation \n     held a variety of meetings with officials representing the \n     DPRK, the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations \n     (see list of interlocutors, attached). The delegation told \n     senior DPRK officials that the United States views North \n     Korea's nuclear ambitions as a grave threat to international \n     peace and stability and urged the DPRK to seek a peaceful, \n     negotiated solution to the crisis through multilateral \n     dialogue. The delegation visited select humanitarian relief \n     operations, making\n\n[[Page S13717]]\n\n     the point that such efforts are tangible proof that the \n     United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea. SFRC \n     staff strongly advised DPRK officials that they should permit \n     greater transparency for food aid deliveries under the \n     auspices of the World Food Program and various non-\n     governmental organizations. The delegation pressed DPRK \n     officials to adhere to international standards of human \n     rights, including respect for religious freedom, and \n     emphasized that the United States' concern for the human \n     rights situation in North Korea reflects the deeply held \n     convictions of the American people.\n\n\n                              key findings\n\n       Six party talks in Beijing helped improve coordination \n     among the five nations trying to reign in North Korea's \n     nuclear ambitions, but DPRK officials left the talks \n     unconvinced that the United States genuinely seeks a \n     peaceful, negotiated solution to the crisis. DPRK officials \n     told the staff delegation that they believe the true aim of \n     the United States is ``regime change,'' and that de-\n     nuclearization is just the first step toward that objective.\n       Under pressure from China, the DPRK probably will come to \n     another round of multilateral talks. However, China's \n     encouragement for DPRK's participation will be contingent on \n     the United States outlining specific steps it will take once \n     the DPRK pledges to dismantle/eliminate its nuclear program. \n     Talks could easily be derailed should North Korea decide to \n     launch a ballistic missile or even test a nuclear weapon. \n     Moreover, North Korea might scuttle the talks in response to \n     the appropriate and necessary U.S. efforts to enforce the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and the \n     Illicit Activities Initiative, both of which the North \n     interprets as attempts to ``strangle'' the regime.\n       Some North Korean officials believe that the United States \n     continues to station nuclear weapons in South Korea.\n       Decision-making in the DPRK is centralized and ultimate \n     authority rests with Kim Jong-il.\n       Top officials in North Korea are carefully monitoring \n     polling data reflecting opinion on domestic politics in the \n     United States, Japan and South Korea.\n       The World Food Program has taken some small, but \n     significant steps in recent months to enhance its operations \n     in the DPRK and reduce the likelihood of diversion of food \n     aid. The significant reduction in U.S. food aid to North \n     Korea (from a high of more than 300,000 tons/year to this \n     year's 40,000 tons) may have undercut United States leverage \n     in pressing for greater transparency on food aid. North \n     Korean officials are convinced the United States is using \n     food as a weapon.\n       Humanitarian operations run by non-governmental \n     organizations--such as the Nautilus Institute's Village Wind \n     Power Pilot Project and the Eugene Bell Foundation's \n     tuberculosis treatment programs--are making important \n     contributions to the welfare of the North Korean people and \n     help allay DPRK suspicions about the intentions of the United \n     States, thereby contributing to an overall political \n     environment conducive to resolution of sensitive security \n     issues.\n       After extensive discussion with the delegation, Vice \n     Minister Kim Gye Gwan advised the DPRK would allow NGO access \n     to some prison camps on a ``case by case'' basis.\n       There were two key differences to our earlier trips. While \n     we were not allowed to make purchases, street vendors were \n     present throughout Pyongyang and in Nampo, selling food and \n     other small items. Additionally, the DPRK military appeared \n     to be at a higher state of alert. More soldiers were armed \n     than during our previous visits.\n\n\n                               discussion\n\n     North Korea isolated . . . \n       Over the course of three days in North Korea, the staff \n     delegation found DPRK officials to be disappointed by the six \n     party Beijing talks, which they described as ``five against \n     one.'' In both formal meetings and informal settings, DPRK \n     officials described the Beijing talks as ``pointless'' and \n     cast doubt upon whether the North would be willing to engage \n     in future rounds of multiparty dialogue. DPRK officials were \n     critical of the fact that they had only 40 minutes of \n     ``direct'' dialogue with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State \n     James Kelly over the course of three days of talks in \n     Beijing, and said they had been misled into believing the \n     multilateral talks would provide a venue for substantive \n     one-one-one discussions with the U.S. envoy.\n       In one particularly blunt exchange, DPRK Vice Foreign \n     Minister Kim Gye Gwan told the staff delegation that the \n     Beijing talks had ``confirmed'' the North's assessment that \n     the United States has no intention of changing its ``hostile \n     policy.'' Kim said the DPRK, ``had no choice but to maintain \n     and reinforce its nuclear deterrent.''\n       The SFRC delegation conveyed their personal views that a \n     North Korean decision to enhance its nuclear weapons \n     capabilities would be viewed by the United States as a grave \n     threat to international peace and security and would be \n     interpreted by Americans as a hostile act. The delegation \n     urged the DPRK to proceed with multiparty dialogue and to \n     refrain from any provocative actions.\n       DPRK officials were non-committal with respect to any \n     future dialogue, but after the staff delegation's departure, \n     the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming that \n     the North remains ``equally prepared for dialogue and for a \n     war.'' This statement represented a slight softening of the \n     stance articulated immediately after the Beijing talks, and \n     certainly leaves the door open to another round of multi-\n     party talks in Beijing or some other venue.\n       With strong encouragement from China (a senior delegation \n     from China visited the DPRK in late September), the DPRK may \n     agree to another round of six-party talks, if only to avoid \n     being held directly responsible for a breakdown of the \n     diplomatic process. It remains unclear what stance the DPRK \n     will take at any future talks, and at what level they will be \n     represented. Decision-making in the DPRK is highly \n     centralized, with Kim Jong-il wielding the ultimate \n     authority. Junior level DPRK officials such as Kim Yong-il, \n     who represented the DPRK in Beijing in August, often are \n     unable to engage in substantive dialogue, a fact which argues \n     for the United States to try to elevate the talks to engage \n     officials with real authority and the ear of Kin Jong-il.\n     . . . and wary of U.S. intentions\n       The difficult of communicating with the North Koreans was \n     evident throughout the staff delegation's visit to Pyongyang, \n     highlighting the risk that conflict could arise from \n     miscalculation or mis-communication. North Korean officials \n     with whom we met had an imperfect understanding of United \n     States security policy, especially the recently issued \n     National Security Strategy and Nuclear Force Posture Review. \n     They repeatedly expressed their belief that both documents \n     called for pre-emptive nuclear strikes against North Korea, \n     and said the North's own nuclear program was necessary to \n     counter this United States ``nuclear threat.''\n       Sometimes, confusion arose out of the imprecision of \n     different English terms. DPRK officials asked the staff \n     delegation to clarify the different meanings \n     ``simultaneous,'' ``synchronous,'' ``phased,'' and \n     ``reciprocal.'' Attention to such detail suggests the DPRK is \n     actively studying how the nuclear issue might be resolved \n     given what they characterized as the ``zero trust'' which \n     exists between the two parties.\n       DPRK officials took note of recent U.S. efforts to curtail \n     North Korean involvement in narcotics trafficking, \n     counterfeiting, and other illicit activities. DPRK officials \n     flatly denied North Korean involvement in such illicit \n     activities, and alleged that the United States had trumped up \n     the charges as part of a more general campaign to ``stifle'' \n     the DPRK.\n     Food aid: slow progress on transparency and accountability\n       The staff delegation met with the Flood Damage \n     Rehabilitation Committee (FDRC) director Jong Yun-hyong, who \n     oversees agricultural reconstruction as well as foreign food \n     aid programs. The delegation explained to Yum that it as \n     essential for the DPRK to enhance transparency for food aid, \n     to open up counties currently off-limits, and to provide \n     random access to WFP monitors seeking to verify food aid \n     deliveries. The delegation told Yum that the level of \n     monitoring requested by WFP was consistent with international \n     norms, and that the DPRK could not expect donors and \n     potential donors to contribute food aid if they did not have \n     high confidence that the aid was reaching its intended \n     recipients.\n       Yun said that security issues are paramount for the DPRK, \n     and that the military would not permit international access \n     to certain sensitive regions of the country. He also said \n     that monitoring had greatly improved since food aid began to \n     flow during the North Korean famine of the mid-1990's. Yun \n     specifically cited the recent U.N. nutritional survey, and \n     reported that ``security officials'' had initially objected \n     to the survey, but that FDRC officials had prevailed in an \n     inter-agency battle in order to permit the survey to be \n     conducted. Yun argued that recent significant reductions in \n     WFP food aid--just 300,000 metric tons in 2002, down from \n     811,000 tons in 2001--had made it more difficult for him to \n     push for greater numbers of monitors and greater access for \n     international observers. Nonetheless, Yun promised progress \n     on monitoring in the future, and invited the international \n     community to shift its humanitarian aid strategy away from \n     food donations and toward ``sustainable development,'' \n     including agricultural reforms, new seek varieties and \n     planting techniques, and ``food for work.''\n       The delegation met with World Food Program country director \n     Rick Corsino, who reported slow, but significant progress \n     toward enhanced monitoring of food aid and ensuring that aid \n     reaches those most in need. These are the highlights:\n       First, WFP has terminated food aid to 17 of 21 districts of \n     the capital city of Pyonghang after concluding that residents \n     of the capital are on average better fed than those of \n     outlying areas. This is an important step, both symbolically, \n     and substantively.\n       Second, with the full knowledge and support of DPRK \n     authorities, WFP is conducting Korean language training for \n     food aid personnel stationed inside the DPRK. The DPRK \n     continues to object to WFP bringing in Korean-speaking \n     experts from overseas, but the growing language facility of \n     WFP's foreign staff allows for smoother interaction with DPRK \n     officials and higher quality monitoring in the field.\n       Third, WFP has increased the number of monthly inspection \n     visits and now has approximately 50 international staff in \n     residence in Pyongyang and at five sub-offices located in \n     Sinuiju, Wonson, Hamhung, Chongjin, and Hyesan. WFP is the \n     only\n\n[[Page S13718]]\n\n     international agency working in the country with \n     international staff permanently placed outside the capital.\n       Fourth, WFP has sustained its access to 162 of 206 total \n     counties in North Korea. WFP does not deliver food aid to \n     those counties that remain off limits, most of which are \n     concentrated along the sparsely populated mountainous \n     ``spine'' of the country and along the DMZ (see attached \n     map).\n       Finally, through its inspection visits, WFP is gradually \n     building a detailed database of schools, hospitals, \n     orphanages, and other institutions receiving WFP assistance. \n     Although the DPRK still has not provided a comprehensive list \n     of aid recipients--a list long requested by WFP officials--\n     the WFP is essentially building its own list with each \n     inspection visit.\n     NGO's making contribution to welfare of average North Koreans\n       Although WFP is the largest humanitarian organization \n     working in North Korea, they are not the only international \n     organization operating in North Korea. The staff delegation \n     made a point of visiting two humanitarian operations \n     supported by U.S. non-governmental organizations; the Village \n     Wind Power Pilot Project run by the Nautilus Institute (with \n     significant financial support provided by the W. Alton Jones \n     Foundation) and a tuberculosis treatment hospital and mobile \n     van sponsored by the Eugene Bell Foundation. These \n     initiatives have fostered good will on a ``people-to-people'' \n     basis, and have measurably improved the quality of life for \n     the North Korean beneficiaries.\n     Wind power\n       The US-DPRK Village Wind Power Pilot Project was the first \n     attempt by a United States NGO to work side-by-side with \n     North Koreans in cooperative development. Previously, non-\n     governmental organizations had been limited by both \n     Washington and Pyongyang to delivering food aid to North \n     Korea. The project installed seven technologically advanced \n     wind turbine towers in a rural village on the west coast of \n     North Korea near the port of Nampo. This region is known as a \n     bread basket for North Korea, rich in arable land and other \n     natural resources, including steady breezes off of the Korea \n     Bay. The turbines provide clean, renewable energy to the \n     village's medical clinic, kindergarten, and 67 households. \n     In addition, a wind-powered water pump irrigates the \n     village's fields, and has significantly boosted yields, \n     according to villagers. The combined generating capacity \n     of the turbines is 11.5kW.\n       Since the wind power project was completed in 1999, it has \n     had its share of ups and downs. At present, the delegation \n     found that the facility was not operating at full capacity \n     due to maintenance problems with two inverters and damaged \n     batteries. North Korea lacks adequately trained technicians \n     to service the equipment, and the nuclear stand-off has \n     disrupted visits by foreign experts needed to assess the \n     maintenance requirements and make needed repairs.\n       Despite these difficulties, the DPRK participants in the \n     project remain enthusiastic about it as a model for rural \n     electrification, and hope to press ahead with a major \n     windpower survey project along the west coast in coming \n     months. DPRK authorities told the visiting Senate staff \n     delegation that deciding to proceed with the wind power \n     survey requires approval from military officials worried \n     about the collection of militarily sensitive meteorological \n     information. Notwithstanding the sensitive nature of the data \n     to be collected, DPRK officials believe the project will move \n     ahead. Wind power projects could alleviate severe shortages \n     of power in rural areas, and have the advantage of not \n     requiring major upgrades in North Korea's electric power \n     grid--a grid that experts have found to be in need of major \n     overhaul before it could accommodate the introduction of \n     large new power plants such as the light water nuclear \n     reactors contemplated under the Agreed Framework.\n     Tuberculosis treatment\n       Since 1995, the Eugene Bell Foundation has been working \n     inside North Korea to fight deadly diseases like tuberculosis \n     (TP). Eugene Bell foundation currently coordinates the \n     delivery of TB medication, diagnostic equipment, and supplies \n     to 1/3 of the North Korean population and approximately 50 \n     North Korean treatment facilities (hospitals and care \n     centers). The staff delegation visited one such hospital in \n     Pyongyang, and also inspected one of the 17 mobile x-ray \n     vehicles designed to navigate the North's antiquated road \n     network.\n       The delegation found the Eugene Bell project to be \n     characterized by high standards of transparency and \n     efficiency. The foundation conducts regular site visits (more \n     than 60 since 1995) and is able to donate goods directly to \n     recipients rather than through third parties or government \n     intermediaries. Staff at the hospital we visited appeared \n     well trained and highly motivated. They were deeply \n     appreciative of the support they receive from the United \n     States and recognized that this humanitarian outreach occurs \n     even at a time when the two nations do not maintain normal \n     diplomatic relations. The Eugene Bell foundation supports 16 \n     TB hospitals and 64 TB care centers in the DPRK. More than \n     200,000 patients have been treated. Moreover, serving as a \n     conduit, the Eugene Bell foundation is currently responsible \n     for sending tuberculosis medicine, medical aid, and equipment \n     for approximately 1/3 of the North Korean population.\n     Joint recovery operations\n       The staff delegation met with Sr. Col. Kwak Chol-hui of the \n     Korean People's Army, the director of the Joint Recovery \n     Operation searching for the remains of U.S. servicemen left \n     behind after the Korean War. The United States estimates that \n     as many as 8,000 remains of U.S. servicemen are on DPRK soil. \n     So far, only 378 of these remains have been recovered. More \n     than 200 remains were found as the result of unilateral DPRK \n     searches and returned to the United States. Just over 170 \n     sets of remains have been recovered through the joint \n     recovery operation.\n       The recovery operations are laborious. Historical records \n     can indicate likely search areas, but only eye witnesses can \n     pinpoint the possible locations for remains. As the \n     population ages and the terrain of North Korea is shaped by \n     construction, erosion, flooding, and other forces, it is \n     becoming increasingly difficult to locate remains. Even after \n     likely sites are identified, time-consuming excavations and \n     careful forensic work are necessary to find and identify \n     remains. U.S. and North Korean military personnel work side \n     by side in the field during the recovery operations. \n     According to U.S. participants in the operation, this \n     interaction in the field has been constructive, deepening our \n     understanding of the Korean People's Army.\n       Colonel Kwak told the delegation that the DPRK would like \n     to expand the joint recovery operation, employing as many as \n     2,700 investigators to scour the country to conduct \n     interviews with those elderly North Korean who might have \n     knowledge of the location of U.S. remains. He indicated that \n     the DPRK's commitment to the recovery operations is \n     independent of the nuclear issue, and, in his opinion, should \n     remain so. It is unclear, however, what role the DPRK \n     envisions for U.S. forces in such an expanded operation. The \n     staff delegation believes that any expansion should be made \n     contingent on greater U.S. access to those North Korean \n     citizens claiming to have first-hand knowledge of the \n     whereabouts of remains.\n\n\n                           staff conclusions\n\n       So as to reduce what we believe is a significant risk of \n     conflict arising out of miscalculation or mis-communication, \n     the United States should greatly expand dialogue with North \n     Korea, both within the framework of multi-party talks, as \n     well as through informal or ``Track II'' bilateral \n     negotiations.\n       The United States should appoint a senior official to \n     represent the United States solely on issues related to the \n     Korean Peninsula. Alternatively, the Administration should \n     endow the current negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State \n     James Kelly, with greater authority to direct and coordinate \n     the President's North Korea policy and gain access to more \n     senior North Korean officials.\n       The United States should acknowledge recent improvements in \n     WFP operations and continue food aid to the DPRK under UN \n     auspices. The United States should also consider funneling a \n     portion of future U.S. food aid through non-governmental \n     organizations, some of which have been able to achieve \n     strong monitoring capability for their humanitarian \n     relief.\n       The U.S. should search for ways to expand outreach efforts \n     by NGOs in the fields of rural energy development, \n     agriculture, and public health.\n       The Joint Recovery Operation to identify the remains of \n     U.S. servicemen from the Korean War affords the United States \n     valuable contact inside North Korea. Any expansion of the \n     operation, however, should be made contingent upon greater \n     U.S. access to those North Korean citizens claiming to have \n     first-hand knowledge of the whereabouts of remains.\n\n\n                         list of interlocutors\n\n     In Beijing, China\n     Michael Green, Director Asian Affairs, National Security \n         Council\n     David Straub, Korea Desk, U.S. Department of State\n     Wang Yi, Vice Foreign Minister, Chinese Ministry of Foreign \n         Affairs\n     Fu Ying, Director General, Asian Department, Chinese Ministry \n         of Foreign Affairs\n     He Yafei, Director General, North American Department, \n         Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n     Liu Jinsong, First Secretary, Asian Department, Chinese \n         Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n     Piao Jianyi, Executive Director, Center for Korean Peninsula \n         Issues, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\n     Gu Guoliang, Director, Center for Arms Control and \n         Nonproliferation Studies, Deputy Director, Institute of \n         American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\n     Wang Jisi, Director, Institute of International Strategic \n         Studies, Central Party School\n     Wu Baiyi, Deputy Director, Research Division, China Institute \n         of Contemporary International Relations\n     Yang Mingjie, Director, Division of Arms Control and Security \n         Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International \n         Relations\n     Wei Zonglei, Deputy Director, Center of U.S.-European \n         Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International \n         Relations\n     Shi Yinhong, Director, Center for American Studies, People's \n         University\n     Ruan Zongze, Vice President, China Institute of International \n         Studies\n\n[[Page S13719]]\n\n     Liu Xuecheng, Director of American Studies, China Institute \n         of International Studies\n     Shen Dingli, Deputy Director, Center for American Studies, \n         Fudan University\n     Zhu Feng, Director of International Security Program, Beijing \n         University\n     In North Korea\n     Kim Gye Gwan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs\n     Jong Dong-hok, First Secretary, United States Department, \n         Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n     Lee Yong Chol and Kim Yong Nam, United States Department, \n         Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n     Jong Yun-hyong, Director Flood Damage, Reconstruction \n         Committee\n     Sr. Col.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S13725]]\n\n       (1) high levels of tree mortality resulting from insect \n     infestation (including the interaction between insects and \n     diseases) may result in--\n       (A) increased fire risk;\n       (B) loss of old trees and old growth;\n       (C) loss of threatened and endangered species;\n       (D) loss of species diversity;\n       (E) degraded watershed conditions;\n       (F) increased potential for damage from other agents of \n     disturbance, including exotic, invasive species; and\n       (G) decreased timber values;\n       (2)(A) forest-damaging insects destroy hundreds of \n     thousands of acres of trees each year;\n       (B) in the West, more than 21,000,000 acres are at high \n     risk of forest-damaging insect infestation, and in the South, \n     more than 57,000,000 acres are at risk across all land \n     ownerships; and\n       (C) severe drought conditions in many areas of the South \n     and West will increase the risk of forest-damaging insect \n     infestations;\n       (3) the hemlock woolly adelgid is--\n       (A) destroying streamside forests throughout the mid-\n     Atlantic and Appalachian regions;\n       (B) threatening water quality and sensitive aquatic \n     species; and\n       (C) posing a potential threat to valuable commercial timber \n     land in northern New England;\n       (4)(A) the emerald ash borer is a nonnative, invasive pest \n     that has quickly become a major threat to hardwood forests \n     because an emerald ash borer infestation is almost always \n     fatal to affected trees; and\n       (B) the emerald ash borer pest threatens to destroy more \n     than 692,000,000 ash trees in forests in Michigan and Ohio \n     alone, and between 5 and 10 percent of urban street trees in \n     the Upper Midwest;\n       (5)(A) epidemic populations of Southern pine beetles are \n     ravaging forests in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, \n     Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, \n     Tennessee, and Virginia; and\n       (B) in 2001, Florida and Kentucky experienced 146 percent \n     and 111 percent increases, respectively, in Southern pine \n     beetle populations;\n       (6) those epidemic outbreaks of Southern pine beetles have \n     forced private landowners to harvest dead and dying trees, in \n     rural areas and increasingly urbanized settings;\n       (7) according to the Forest Service, recent outbreaks of \n     the red oak borer in Arkansas and Missouri have been \n     unprecedented, with more than 1,000,000 acres infested at \n     population levels never seen before;\n       (8) much of the damage from the red oak borer has taken \n     place in national forests, and the Federal response has been \n     inadequate to protect forest ecosystems and other ecological \n     and economic resources;\n       (9)(A) previous silvicultural assessments, while useful and \n     informative, have been limited in scale and scope of \n     application; and\n       (B) there have not been sufficient resources available to \n     adequately test a full array of individual and combined \n     applied silvicultural assessments;\n       (10) only through the full funding, development, and \n     assessment of potential applied silvicultural assessments \n     over specific time frames across an array of environmental \n     and climatic conditions can the most innovative and cost \n     effective management applications be determined that will \n     help reduce the susceptibility of forest ecosystems to attack \n     by forest pests;\n       (11)(A) often, there are significant interactions between \n     insects and diseases;\n       (B) many diseases (such as white pine blister rust, beech \n     bark disease, and many other diseases) can weaken trees and \n     forest stands and predispose trees and forest stands to \n     insect attack; and\n       (C) certain diseases are spread using insects as vectors \n     (including Dutch elm disease and pine pitch canker); and\n       (12) funding and implementation of an initiative to combat \n     forest pest infestations and associated diseases should not \n     come at the expense of supporting other programs and \n     initiatives of the Secretary.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to require the Secretary to develop an accelerated \n     basic and applied assessment program to combat infestations \n     by forest-damaging insects and associated diseases;\n       (2) to enlist the assistance of colleges and universities \n     (including forestry schools, land grant colleges and \n     universities, and 1890 Institutions), State agencies, and \n     private landowners to carry out the program; and\n       (3) to carry out applied silvicultural assessments.\n\n     SEC. 402.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Highlands Conservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Highlands region is a physiographic province that \n     encompasses more than 2,000,000 acres extending from eastern \n     Pennsylvania through the States of New Jersey and New York to \n     northwestern Connecticut.\n       (2) The Highlands region is an environmentally unique area \n     that--\n       (A) provides clean drinking water to over 15,000,000 people \n     in metropolitan areas in the States of Connecticut, New \n     Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania;\n       (B) provides critical wildlife habitat, including habitat \n     for 247 threatened and endangered species;\n       (C) maintains an important historic connection to early \n     Native American culture, colonial settlement, the American \n     Revolution, and the Civil War;\n       (D) contains recreational resources for 14 million visitors \n     annually;\n       (E) provides other significant ecological, natural, \n     tourism, recreational, educational, and economic benefits; \n     and\n       (F) provides homeownership opportunities and access to \n     affordable housing that is safe, clean, and healthy;\n       (3) An estimated 1 in 12 citizens of the United States live \n     within a 2-hour drive of the Highlands region.\n       (4) More than 1,400,000 residents live in the Highlands \n     region.\n       (5) The Highlands region forms a greenbelt adjacent to the \n     Philadelphia-New York City-Hartford urban corridor that \n     offers the opportunity to preserve water, forest and \n     agricultural resources, wildlife habitat, recreational areas, \n     and historic sites, while encouraging sustainable economic \n     growth and development in a fiscally and environmentally \n     sound manner.\n       (6) Continued population growth and land use patterns in \n     the Highlands region--\n       (A) reduce the availability and quality of water;\n       (B) reduce air quality;\n       (C) fragment the forests;\n       (D) destroy critical migration corridors and forest \n     habitat; and\n       (E) result in the loss of recreational opportunities and \n     scenic, historic, and cultural resources;\n       (7) The water, forest, wildlife, recreational, \n     agricultural, and cultural resources of the Highlands region, \n     in combination with the proximity of the Highlands region to \n     the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, make the \n     Highlands region nationally significant.\n       (8) The national significance of the Highlands region has \n     been documented in--\n       (A) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study \n     conducted by the Forest Service in 1990;\n       (B) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study: 2002 \n     Update conducted by the Forest Service;\n       (C) the bi-State Skylands Greenway Task Force Report;\n       (D) the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment \n     Plan;\n       (E) the New York State Open Space Conservation Plan;\n       (F) the Connecticut Green Plan: Open Space Acquisition FY \n     2001-2006;\n       (G) the open space plans of the State of Pennsylvania; and\n       (H) other open space conservation plans for States in the \n     Highlands region;\n       (9) The Highlands region includes or is adjacent to \n     numerous parcels of land owned by the Federal Government or \n     federally designated areas that protect, conserve, or restore \n     resources of the Highlands region, including--\n       (A) the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (B) the Shawanagunk Grasslands Wildlife Refuge;\n       (C) the Morristown National Historical Park;\n       (D) the Delaware and Lehigh Canal Corridors;\n       (E) the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area;\n       (F) the Delaware River Basin;\n       (G) the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area;\n       (H) the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River;\n       (I) the Appalachian National Scenic Trail;\n       (J) the United States Military Academy at West Point, New \n     York;\n       (K) the Highlands National Millenium Trail;\n       (L) the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (M) the proposed Crossroads of the Revolution National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (N) the proposed Musconetcong National Scenic and \n     Recreational River in New Jersey;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Observation and \n     Coastal Systems Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is \n     vital to the Nation's homeland security, transportation, \n     trade, environmental and human health, recreation and \n     tourism, food production, scientific research and education, \n     historical and cultural heritage, and energy production.\n       [(2) More than half the Nation's population lives and works \n     in coastal communities that together make up 11 percent of \n     its land and its most ecologically and economically important \n     regions, supporting approximately 190 sea ports, containing \n     most of our largest cities, and providing access to coastal \n     waters rich in natural resources.\n       [(3) More than 95 percent of the Nation's trade moves by \n     sea and nearly half of all goods, including energy products, \n     carried in maritime commerce are hazardous materials.\n       [(4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms provides \n     society with essential food resources, a promising source of \n     marine products with commercial and medical potential, and an \n     important contribution to the national economy.\n       [(5) The oceans drive climate and weather factors causing \n     severe weather events and threatening the health of coastal \n     ecosystems and communities by creating or affecting both \n     natural and man-made coastal hazards such as hurricanes, \n     tsunamis, erosion, oil spills, harmful algal blooms, and \n     pollution, which can pose threats to human health.\n       [(6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard relies on \n     ocean information to save 4,380 people, conducts over 65,000 \n     rescue missions, and carries out more than 11,680 \n     environmental cleanups and responses to pollution.\n       [(7) Safeguarding homeland security requires improved \n     monitoring of the Nation's ports and coastline, including the \n     ability to track vessels and to provide rapid response teams \n     with real-time environmental conditions necessary for their \n     work.\n       [(8) Advances in ocean technologies and scientific \n     understanding have made possible long-term and continuous \n     observation from space and in situ of ocean characteristics \n     and conditions.\n       [(9) Many elements of an ocean and coastal observing system \n     are in place, though in a patchwork manner that is \n     fragmented, intermittent, incomplete, and not integrated.\n       [(10) Important coastal uses, such as tourism, recreation, \n     and fishing, require assurance of healthy coastal waters, and \n     while the interagency National Coast Condition Report \n     provides an annual assessment of the status and quality of \n     coastal waters, substantial data gaps exist that could be \n     reduced through measurement of coastal quality through a \n     coordinated observing system that incorporates Federal, \n     State, and local monitoring programs.\n       [(11) National investment in a sustained and integrated \n     ocean and coastal observing system and in coordinated \n     programs of research would assist this Nation and the world \n     in understanding the oceans and the global climate system, \n     strengthen homeland security, improve weather and climate \n     forecasts, strengthen management of marine resources, improve \n     the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and \n     mitigate coastal hazards.\n       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       [(1) development and maintenance of an integrated system \n     that provides for sustained ocean and coastal observations \n     from in situ, remote, and vessel platforms, and that promotes \n     the national goals of assuring national security, advancing \n     economic development, conserving living marine resources, \n     protecting quality of life and the marine environment, and \n     strengthening science education and communication through \n     improved knowledge of the ocean;\n       [(2) implementation of a research and development program \n     to enhance security at United States ports and minimize \n     security risks; and\n       [(3) implementation of a data and information system \n     required by all components of an integrated ocean and coastal \n     observing system and related research.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I thank you for allowing the Senate to \nconsider\n\n[[Page S13739]]\n\nS. 1400, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2003. I would \nalso like to thank several of my colleagues for co-sponsoring this \nbill, including Senators Kerry, McCain, Hollings, Breaux, Inouye, Lott, \nBoxer, and Collins.\n  Those familiar with the challenges of trying to monitor and predict \nocean and marine environmental conditions--whether for marine science, \nresource management, and maritime transportation and safety--are aware \nof our tremendous need for better collection of basic ocean data. This \nbill, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2003, would \ndevelop and formalize an integrated network of ocean observing systems \naround our Nation's coastlines, thereby allowing comprehensive and \nconsistent ocean data to be gathered and fulfilling this critical \ninformation need. It would revolutionize our Nation's efforts in \ncollecting, processing, and communicating ocean and coastal data.\n  Like other coastal states, Maine has an enduring connection to the \nocean. We are highly dependent on the fisheries resources and other \nessential services provided to us by the sea, and we understand that \nour lives and livelihoods are firmly rooted in how well we understand \nand adapt to ocean conditions. This became much easier to do in 2001, \nwhen the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, or GoMOOS, deployed ten \nobservation buoys in the Gulf of Maine. This prototype system has \ntransformed how we gather information about the ocean and track ocean \nconditions over time. On the surface, these buoys measure currents, \ntemperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and other key \nenvironmental variables. By modifying the instrumentation, other data \ncan be gathered from these platforms.\n  What sets the GoMOOS observation system apart from the traditional \ndata gathering approach, however, is that it takes all these ocean and \nsurface condition measurements on an hourly basis through a network of \nlinked buoys, and these near real-time measurements can be monitored \nand accessed by the general public through the internet. GoMOOS thereby \nprovides a tremendous public service.\n  The need for this type of ocean data gathering and access is not \nlimited to the Gulf of Maine. The U.S. coastline spans 95,000 miles, \nand all States that border our oceans and Great Lakes would benefit \nfrom this service. Ocean and coastal observing systems have been \nplanned or developed for other coastal regions, many in conjunction \nwith the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, State coastal \nmanagement agencies, universities, and other regional partners. These \nsystems, however, use different approaches for collecting, managing, \nprocessing, and communicating data through their network, and these \ndata are often incompatible with data from other regions. As a result, \nwe lose a valuable opportunity to develop a comprehensive picture of \ncoastal and ocean conditions around the Nation.\n  S. 1400, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act, seeks to \nsolve this problem. This bill would coordinate ocean and coastal \nobservation efforts with the support of the Federal Government. It \nwould help develop regional observation systems, link them through a \nnationwide network, and provide public access to the information so \nanyone can better understand and track ocean and coastal conditions. It \nwould call on the National Ocean Research Leadership Council to design, \noperate, and improve a Nationwide observation system, as well as \nadminister an ocean data research and development program. This Council \nwould plan these activities through a collaborative interagency \nplanning office and carry them out through a joint operations center.\n  The American public--over half of which lives along our coastlines--\nwill be very well served through the many uses and applications of this \nsystem. Fisheries, scientists, and managers can use this information to \npredict ocean conditions that affect productivity and utilize this \ninformation in resource management. Fishermen, sailors, Coast Guard \nsearch-and-rescue units, the military, and others who traverse the \nocean can better predict safe sea conditions, and shippers can \ntransport goods more efficiently, Ocean scientists and regulators can \nbetter understand, predict, and rapidly respond to marine pollution. \nEducators and students can learn more about marine science. Clearly, \nanyone who relies upon the ocean stands to benefit from this Nationwide \nobservation system.\n  Mr. President, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, and \nCoast Guard and as a coastal State Senator, I am extremely proud to \nsponsor and support this bill. Considering the tremendous public good \nand services that these systems provide, it is imperative that we in \nCongress facilitate the development and funding of a national, \nintegrated, and sustained ocean observation network. We can do this by \npassing the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act. Following action \nby the Senate, I encourage the House of Representatives to take action \non this bill to facilitate its passage into law. I am confident that \nthis bill, once enacted, will serve the public well by facilitating \nbetter understanding of our Nation's oceans and coasts, and I thank my \ncolleagues for supporting it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1400), as amended, was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13739-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13739-S13740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE JOHN F.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) marine turtle populations have declined to the point \n     that the long-term survival of the loggerhead, green, \n     hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, and leatherback \n     turtle in the wild is in serious jeopardy;\n       (2) 6 of the 7 recognized species of marine turtles are \n     listed as threatened or endangered species under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and \n     all 7 species have been included in Appendix I of CITES;\n       (3) because marine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, \n     and highly migratory, marine turtles are particularly \n     vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation and habitat \n     loss;\n       (4) illegal international trade seriously threatens wild \n     populations of some marine turtle species, particularly the \n     hawksbill turtle;\n       (5) the challenges facing marine turtles are immense, and \n     the resources available have not been sufficient to cope with \n     the continued loss of nesting habitats caused by human \n     activities and the consequent diminution of marine turtle \n     populations;\n       (6) because marine turtles are flagship species for the \n     ecosystems in which marine turtles are found, sustaining \n     healthy populations of marine turtles provides benefits to \n     many other species of wildlife, including many other \n     threatened or endangered species;\n       (7) marine turtles are important components of the \n     ecosystems that they inhabit, and studies of wild populations \n     of marine turtles have provided important biological \n     insights;\n       (8) changes in marine turtle populations are most reliably \n     indicated by changes in the numbers of nests and nesting \n     females; and\n       (9) the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing \n     of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of \n     marine turtles will require the joint commitment and effort \n     of--\n       (A) countries that have within their boundaries marine \n     turtle nesting habitats; and\n       (B) persons with expertise in the conservation of marine \n     turtles.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist in the \n     conservation of marine turtles and the nesting habitats of \n     marine turtles in foreign countries by supporting and \n     providing financial resources for projects to conserve the \n     nesting habitats, conserve marine turtles in those habitats, \n     and address other threats to the survival of marine turtles.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nVeterans Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH. Con. Res. 159 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 159) declaring \n     Emporia, Kansas, to be the founding city of the Veterans Day \n     holiday and recognizing the contributions of Alvin J. King \n     and Representative Ed Rees to the enactment into law of the \n     observance of Veterans Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of \nEmporia, KS, for its significant role in the establishment of Veterans \nDay. The people of Emporia take great pride in their city's \ncontribution to the founding of this national holiday, and, while they \nmay be modest, I would like to trumpet the work of my fellow Kansans.\n  As all of us in this Chamber are aware, Veterans Day was once \nArmistice Day, a day set apart by this Congress to commemorate the end \nof World War I, which our Nation once hoped would be ``the war to end \nall wars.'' Just a few years after Armistice Day was made a legal \nholiday, our Nation was engulfed in the Second World War. Shortly \nthereafter our soldiers were fighting bravely to repel the communist \nadvance on the Koran Peninsula. These two conflicts added millions to \nthe number of war veterans in the United States. Certainly, it seemed \nappropriate that these new veterans, like the veterans of World War I, \nshould be honored for their service to our country.\n  The man who initiated the effort to honor all of these veterans was a \nKansan. Congressman Ed Rees, a native of Emporia, acted on the call of \nhis constituents, particularly that of his fellow Emporian, Alvin J. \nKing, to introduce legislation to officially change Armistice Day to \nVeterans Day. In 1954, another Kansan, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \nsigned this legislation into law.\n  Since 1954, Veterans Day has been a day set apart to honor the valor \nand sacrifice of all America's veterans. At all times our Nation relies \non the courage and selflessness of the members of our Armed Forces, so \nI am thankful that Congressman Ed Rees, at the behest of his fellow \nEmporians, worked so diligently to establish one special day when all \nour veterans are recognized for their faithful service to the United \nStates. I thank the people of Emporia, and I thank the millions of war \nveterans who inspired them.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this resolution declares Emporia, KS, to \nbe the founding city of Veterans Day. In addition, the resolution \nrecognizes the contributions of Alvin J. King and Representative Ed \nRees from Emporia, KS, to the enactment into law of the observance of \nVeterans Day.\n  On October 8, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, also a Kansan, \nsigned\n\n[[Page S13743]]\n\ninto law a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. President \nEisenhower stated, ``On that day let us solemnly remember the \nsacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the \nair, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and \nlet us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring \npeace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain.''\n  With the soon-to-be return of our service men and women from the war \nin Iraq, Veterans Day takes on a new meaning. These men and women who \nserve in Iraq today, join the other millions that have come before \nthem. I am proud that President Eisenhower, Representative Rees, and \nAlvin King, all from the great state of Kansas, took the idea for the \ncelebration of Veterans Day from conception to fruition.\n  Emporia, KS, organized and celebrated Veterans Day in 1953, one year \nbefore the rest of the United States. Alvin J. King, the man behind the \nidea, was a shoe cobbler in Emporia. Mr. King befriended many veterans, \nthus realizing that we needed a national holiday to commemorate all \nveterans of all wars, not just those of World War I. With support from \nthe community of Emporia, Mr. King took his idea to Washington. There, \nhe found a close ally in Representative Ed Rees, who introduced a bill \nto change the holiday. Mr. Rees said, ``The United States has now been \ninvolved in many great military efforts, and each has produced its \nnumber of veterans. We all realize that it would not be feasible to \nestablish a national holiday to commemorate the closing of each war. \nThis legislation does not establish a new holiday. Rather it expands an \nexisting holiday so that we may honor all veterans at the same time.''\n  On November 11 of each year, we pay tribute to our veterans. \nAmericans, as in all wars have rallied behind the men and women who \nwent off to defend the American way of life. And, as some of those \nsoldiers returned, we embraced and thanked them for their sacrifice. \nAnd for those that did not come home we remembered them in somber \nceremonies, silent prayers, and grieving moments. On November 11 we pay \nreverence to anyone that has wore the uniform. We should, also, \nrecognizes the shoe cobbler from Emporia, who had a vision for a \nnational holiday; a representative, who listened to his hometown; and a \nPresident, who a veteran himself, saw the completion of this idea.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 159) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/31/senate-section/article/S13743-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13743-S13749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENTS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, would the Senator from Florida \nbe willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today \nto speak about important language included in this year's veterans \nbenefits bill that must be included in the final conference report. \nThis language addresses a situation that I feel demands our immediate \nattention--the protection of our veterans and their benefits from the \npredatory lending practices of some unscrupulous businesses.\n  Mr. President, over a year ago, a group of disabled veterans in \nFlorida brought to my attention the issue of benefits buy-out schemes \nthat target our most vulnerable disabled veterans. These scams offer to \nadvance to a veteran a lump-sum amount of money for access to the \nveterans' future disability compensation often at outrageous interest \nrates of 30 percent or more.\n  I thank the Veterans Affairs Committee and the distinguished \nchairman, Arlen Specter, and the ranking member, Senator Bob Graham, \nfor their leadership in support of this effort. These Senators and \ntheir staffs have worked tirelessly to craft this language in a manner \nthat will stop these scams without adversely affecting a veterans' \nability to use credit.\n  I respectfully request that the distinguished ranking member continue \nthis effort and support this language during conference in the interest \nof our veterans and the protection of their benefits and pensions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to add my voice of support and \ncommitment to this important language. I will work to ensure the final \nconference report includes this language. We can no longer wait to \ninstitute these important policies that will serve to protect our \nveterans from benefits buy-out schemes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like to thank the distinguished \nranking member for his efforts and I look forward to the final \nconference report on the veterans benefits bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about important language included in \nthis year's veterans benefits bill that must be included in the final \nconference report. This language addresses a situation that I feel \ndemands our immediate attention--the protection of our veterans and \ntheir benefits from the predatory lending practices of some \nunscrupulous businesses.\n  Over a year ago, a group of disabled veterans in Florida brought to \nmy attention the issue of benefits buy-out schemes that target our most \nvulnerable disabled veterans. These scams offer to advance to a veteran \na lump sum amount of money for access to the veterans' future \ndisability compensation, often at outrageous interest rates of 30 \npercent or more.\n\n[[Page S13749]]\n\n  In order to avoid Federal laws prohibiting veterans from assigning \ntheir benefits to another party, these scams require the veteran to \nopen a joint account from which the lending company automatically \nwithdraws the veterans benefits.\n  We can all agree that a law preventing veterans from assigning their \nbenefits to another individual should also bar this type of an \narrangement--where money is directly withdrawn before the veteran can \naccess their benefits or pension.\n  Last May the National Consumer Law Center, NCLC, released a report \nabout financial and commercial scams directed at our military, veterans \nand their families--this report included an examination of these \nveterans benefits buy-out schemes.\n  The NCLC concluded that lump sum pension schemes are illegal under a \nvariety of Federal and State truth in lending, usury or consumer laws, \nand that remedies exist, but require burdensome and costly court action \non the part of the veteran.\n  I was not surprised to see that they agree with my findings that the \nassignment of veterans benefits is indeed illegal under current law.\n  But they also agree that due to a lack of clarity in the law and, \ntherefore, the absence of any enforcement efforts, veterans are left \nopen to unscrupulous exploitation and the loss of their benefits.\n  The analysis and conclusion in the report by the National Consumer \nLaw Center have removed any doubt about the risk to our disabled \nveterans and the need for congressional action.\n  I want to make it abundantly clear that we are not trying to deny \nveterans access to normal credit systems: credit cards, personal loans, \nor home loans. We are trying to ensure that loans made to veterans are \nnot out of the reach of State usury laws, which protect all types of \nconsumers.\n  Greater protection is needed for our most vulnerable veterans--the \ndisabled and the elderly. They are among the most needy and, once \nensnared by these schemes, intimidated and threatened with lawsuits.\n  As you know, I introduced similar legislation last year, cosponsored \nby Senator McCain and others that would tighten our laws and better \nprotect our veterans from these schemes. Although we adopted this \nlegislation in the Senate as part of last year's veterans benefits \nbill, the House conferees would not agree to include it in the \nconference report.\n  This year, we must ensure that the conference report includes this \nlanguage and that we are doing all we can to protect veterans from \nthese unscrupulous and predatory practices.\n  I thank the Veterans Affairs Committee and for Senator Specter's and \nSenator Graham's leadership in support of this effort. I respectfully \nrequest that they continue this effort and fight for this language \nduring conference in the interest of our veterans and their benefits.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
