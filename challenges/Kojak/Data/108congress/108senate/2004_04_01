That bill will be followed by \nthe final passage of the FSC/ETI legislation. Upon completion of the \nFSC/ETI bill, we will proceed to the nominations and agreement to the \n22 judicial nominations that are available on the calendar.

Mr. President, is this the unanimous consent agreement you \nare going to offer?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is my opening statement for April 1, \nand I will withdraw any request for those consent agreements.\n  It is an April 1 wish. It is what we should be doing. But we will \nproceed in the normal order.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a brief comment, every \nThursday morning Senator Ensign and I hold a breakfast for Nevada \nconstituents. Today we had a very large crowd. Probably there were 60 \npeople there, plus our staffs. I opened it by calling on a doctor who \njust returned from the USS Boxer, from sea, introduced our Cherry \nBlossom Princess, and then I asked this gentleman to come up. I said: \nJohn, you remember this thing we talked about--and gave him this \ncertificate.\n  The man's name was a mixture between a Hungarian and a Hawaiian \nname--real long. And John stumbled through that reading, but what a \nhero he was. You can tell John was so flustered. When he stopped for a \nsecond I said, ``April Fools'.''\n  I have to say, it was probably the greatest April Fools' joke I have \never been involved in.\n  Senator Daschle just came on the floor. He, Senator Frist, just \noffered what we would accomplish today. It was just an April Fools' \njoke, even though he meant it sincerely.\n  Mr. FRIST. I did mean it sincerely, and it included all, I say to the \nDemocratic leader. It included welfare, FSC/\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nETI, the 22 judicial nominations.

With that, Mr. President, this morning there will be a \nperiod of morning business for up to 60 minutes, and that morning \nbusiness will be followed by an additional 60 minutes of debate with \nregard to the cloture motion with respect to the welfare \nreauthorization bill. At the conclusion of that 60 minutes of debate \ntime, we will proceed to a rollcall vote on invoking cloture on the \ncommittee substitute to H.R. 4. That is the welfare legislation.\n  As I stated in closing last night, if we invoke cloture on this bill, \nI hope we will be able to finish it this week. Over the last few days I \nhad hoped we could reach an agreement to finish the bill in reasonable \nfashion, but because we were unable to reach a formal consent \nagreement, we will go forward with the procedural vote in hopes of \nbringing this bill to a conclusion. If we do invoke cloture, Senators \nwill still be able to bring forward their amendments, and I believe we \ncould finish the bill this week.\n  If cloture is not invoked, it will be clear that this legislation \nwill be gridlocked by these unrelated matters and therefore will be \ndifficult to finish.\n  We also continue to seek ways to finish and complete the JOBS bill, \nthe FSC/ETI bill from last week. That bill has been held up as Members \ninsist on offering amendments that have little to do with the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Additional procedural votes will occur in relation to that bill as we \ntry to find a way to get the FSC bill done.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, in order to facilitate the use of our time this \nmorning, I ask unanimous consent that during the period for morning \nbusiness the Republican-controlled time be divided in the following \nmanner: Senator Cornyn, 5 minutes; Senator Ensign, 5 minutes; Senator \nThomas, 5 minutes; Senator Smith, 10 minutes; Senator Cochran, 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I also have a statement I will make, but \nas I understand it, the first hour will be divided equally between the \nRepublicans and Democrats. Is it my understanding the second one will \nalso be divided equally in time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Debate for reauthorization.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is debate on the cloture vote itself?\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I will be making my comments on leader \ntime. We will have the hour of morning business as laid out in the \nunanimous consent for our side so people can plan their morning. My \nremarks will only be about 10 minutes or so.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the Democrats' \ndecision last week to filibuster the JOBS Act, the FSC/ETI and the \nJumpstart JOBS bill. It is a bill that goes right at the heart of \nmanufacturing job creation in this country. It is critical to our \nmanufacturing jobs base. As has been pointed out again and again, it \nwas developed in a strong, bipartisan fashion under the leadership of \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee. It is \ncritically important. It has broad support, yet every Senate Democrat \nexcept Senator Miller from Georgia voted to sustain the Democrat-led \nfilibuster.\n  Since that time we tried to work out some sort of agreement so we \ncould consider this bill and have debate on germane amendments, but \nevery time we attempt to do so we are met with an increasing list of \nirrelevant, mainly political message amendments that the other side \ninsists be a part of this bill. Last week a filibuster was open on the \nfloor. This week, in a less obvious way, it continued by foot dragging.\n\n  What does a filibuster mean? What are the practical implications of \nthis filibuster? It means leaving in place a Euro tax the European \nUnion began imposing on March 1 last month against the U.S. \nmanufacturers. The Europeans have been authorized by the WTO to impose \n$4 billion in sanctions that began March 1--30 days ago. The tariff \nstarted at 5 percent of the $4 billion authorized and will increase 1 \npercent on the first of every month thereafter.\n  Thus, in supporting this filibuster, whether it is the active \nfilibuster last week or the more passive filibuster of this week, the \nDemocrats are supporting the sanctions. Again, today being April 1st, \nit will kick up another 1 percent, another $40 million increase, in \nthose sanctions because of the delay.\n  If the other side of the aisle is not in favor of this JOBS bill, \nthen what do they support? Let me look at some of the legislation that \nhas been introduced and statements made in the Senate. As of late, a \nlot has been made about outsourcing--a lot of conversation, a lot of \nproposed amendments--regarding the whole issue of offshoring. Time and \nagain, the Senate Democrats have introduced amendments, bills, and \nstatements expressing grave concern over this issue.\n  The conversation has, unfortunately, been quite one-sided. When we \nlook at the numbers--and increasingly people are looking at the \nnumbers--we learn foreigners outsource far more work to the United \nStates than American companies actually send abroad.\n  Indeed, the value of insourcing, what is coming into the United \nStates--including legal work, computer programming, banking, \ntelecommunications, engineering, management consulting, other private \nservices--was $133 billion in 2003. Outsourcing of such private \nservices was valued at $77 billion and $133 billion for insourcing.\n  When measuring outsourcing to insourcing, the United States posted a \n$54 billion surplus last year in trade and private services with the \nrest of the world. Again, look at both sides of the equation.\n  Far from being bad for the economy as a whole, this balance of \noffshoring and insourcing creates a net additional value for the United \nStates economy, lowering prices to consumers who are making purchases \nand, in effect, increasing their standard of living. Each dollar of \ncost that is outsourced creates $1.46 of value globally. Of that $1.46, \nthe United States captures $1.13 and the receiving country captures the \n33 cents.\n  These numbers suggest, by the way I have described it, that efforts \nto restrict outsourcing will backfire by provoking a retaliation which \nis detrimental to our economy and our trading partners.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan captured the gist in these \nwords on this issue: These alleged cures would make matters worse, \nrather than better. They would do little to create jobs. And if \nforeigners were to retaliate, we would surely lose jobs.\n  Where would the jobs be lost? Everywhere. The Census Bureau says in \nthe year 2000, 6.4 million Americans were employed in jobs that were \ninsourced by foreign companies operating in the United States. Mr. \nPresident, 223,000 of the jobs were in Massachusetts; 246,000 were in \nMichigan. Washington State had 104,000. Pennsylvania had 281,000. My \nhome State of Tennessee had almost 149,000 insourced jobs, but that is \nless than half of the 307,000 jobs in Florida and well behind the \n259,000 in Ohio.\n\n  When we talk about outsourcing, we need to remember there is another \nside of the equation, a side representing 6.4 million jobs. We cannot \nlose sight of that.\n  While we all agree the loss of any job to outsourcing is regrettable, \nwe need to focus on the training, retraining, and education. If we look \nat the solutions offered by our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, we find them to be surprising and startling.\n  Senator Kerry has introduced S. 1873, requiring operators at call \ncenters to disclose their physical location. Senator Kerry described \nthis bill as being necessary to ``address the growing problem of United \nStates corporations moving hundreds of thousands of service sector jobs \nabroad.''\n  I have to admit Senator Kerry's premise strikes me as a bit unusual. \nIt\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\nseems there should be some sort of assumption that if Americans \ndiscovered a foreigner was on the other end of that telephone, they \nwould either hang up the telephone or otherwise lodge some sort of \nprotest upon hearing that foreigner was in another country. The only \nway this bill would save jobs is if we assume Americans are so \nviolently xenophobic we do not and would not tolerate even this modest \nlevel of international agreement.\n  Senator Kerry's legislation is indicative of the choice we face as a \ncountry. We can choose the path of freedom, where every individual and \nevery company can do as he or she sees fit and trust that people are \ngoing to work hard on their own behalf, and in doing so promote the \ncommon good or we can choose a path of more Government, more Government \nmandates with less freedom, with less prosperity, and fewer jobs, one \nin which every time you call a company to see if they have an item in \nstock, the Federal Government will force you and the company to \nidentify the exact longitude and latitude of the operator who is on the \nother end of that telephone call.\n  The reality is we compete today in a global economy. We cannot close \nour borders to the world. Some think we can retreat into economic \nisolationism, but we simply cannot. Times are different. We shouldn't. \nThat, in many ways, given our world economy, would be a declaration of \ndefeat.\n  We are the most innovative society in the world today. Our workers \nlead all others in the world in productivity. If we are allowed to \ncompete on a fair playing field, United States manufacturers can and \nindeed will lead the world.\n  We had a chance last week to help U.S. manufacturers by repealing the \nEuro tax on our U.S. manufacturers. Unfortunately, we were met by \nobstruction on the other side. While I was disappointed at this \noutcome, recent history indicates that should not have been much of a \nsurprise. If there has been one thing consistent over the last several \nmonths, it has been the Democrats' steadfast refusal toward legislation \nthat would help reduce the cost of manufacturing in the United States. \nEvery time we attempt to move legislation forward that addresses the \nconcerns of manufacturing, we have been met by obstruction. With class \naction, with energy, with medical liability, to Workforce Investment \nAct, we have been blocked. It is either by filibuster or by objections \ngoing to conference.\n  Next month we are going to be addressing issues that I hope will \nbring some fairness and justice to certain challenges that we have \ntoday.\n  I have pointed out that we would like to address the issue of \nasbestos litigation reform. I look forward to hopefully being able to \naddress that in a bipartisan way.\n  The loss of a few hundred thousand jobs per year to offshoring is a \nsmall part of the constant pace of job creation and destruction that \ngoes on in the U.S. labor market. We need to address dislocation. We \ncan do that with aggressive education and training.\n  But it is precisely because each job loss is painful that we need to \nfocus on ways to stimulate employment generally rather than focusing on \nlegislation to address a tiny percent of the population.\n  In closing, we need to keep our focus on proposals that look to the \nfuture to help companies create and keep new jobs. We cannot be focused \non the past but really the present. We need to be looking ahead all the \ntime.\n  As Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan stated earlier this \nmonth:\n\n       Time and again through our history, we have discovered that \n     attempting merely to preserve the comfortable features of the \n     present, rather than reaching for new levels of prosperity, \n     is a sure path to stagnation.\n\n  We only need to look across the Atlantic to see the results of those \npolicies of stagnation. Instead, Republicans will keep working for \npolicies of growth and for innovation to help America compete and win \nin the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3521-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the desire of the \nmajority leader and our friends on the other side of the aisle in \naddressing many of these issues. He mentioned the JOBS bill, welfare \nreform reauthorization, and the importance of reaching some agreement \non energy. I have indicated on several occasions that we are more than \nprepared to work through each one of these bills. We simply want to be \nheard on amendments about which we care a great deal.\n  I will not ask consent to do it this morning, but I would entertain a \nunanimous consent agreement to go to the energy bill today and work \nthrough the amendments. I think there would be a good debate. \nUltimately, there could be a conclusive debate about the energy bill.\n  We will see what happens in our work with the House, which we have \nhad to do now on several occasions. The same is true with the FSC/ETI \nbill. We would be prepared to go to the floor with a number of \namendments.\n  People on the other side of the aisle, for whatever reason, have \nrefused to allow us an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on \nprotecting worker's overtime, on minimum wage, and on unemployment \ncompensation.\n  There are other outsourcing amendments that we think ought to be \ndebated. What better place to debate them than on a bill that relates \nto international commerce.\n  It isn't our unwillingness to have a good debate; it is our \nunwillingness to be locked out of the process. Whether it is in \nconference or whether it is on the floor, we have been prevented \nclosure on each of these bills. I am hopeful that over the course of \nthe next 2 days we can reach some accommodation.\n  I have indicated that I thought we could finish the welfare bill by \nthe end of next week. We will work to see that happens. But \nunfortunately, we are not at a point where any kind of procedural \nagreement has been reached to allow that to happen, either. I will \ncontinue to talk with the distinguished majority leader about ways in \nwhich to accommodate our concerns and his very understandable concerns \nabout completing the work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3521-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3521-S3523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the House was scheduled to take up its \nversion of the transportation bill yesterday.\n  At the eleventh hour--or rather at 7 a.m. this morning--the Rules \nCommittee met and appears to have finally found a way to bring the bill \nto the House floor and allow for debate, although they will not allow a \nclear vote on a key amendment that would raise the level of investment \nin the bill.\n  Let me just say, this is astounding.\n  We have already gone 184 days with one temporary extension after \nanother. These unnecessary delays have cost our Nation roughly 100,000 \njobs.\n  State and local governments could not begin the contracting process, \nand employers couldn't plan ahead. As a result, there are 100,000 fewer \nAmericans working today than there should be.\n  Unless we agree on a transportation bill before the end of April, \nwhen the current extension expires, tens of thousands more jobs will be \nlost.\n  Let us put this delay in perspective.\n  First, let us all remember who controls not only the House and Senate \nbut the executive branch of our government--one party controls all \nthree.\n  The President has claimed he was going to change the way government \nworks. Well, he has everything he needs--control of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate.\n  And how has he done on changing the way government works? In the \ninstance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, he has steered \nus toward a real-life work stoppage.\n  It was 184 days ago that the law that governs our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and all of the programs that deal with \ntransportation expired.\n  We have been operating on temporary extensions to the law for 184 \ndays.\n  Is the delay because Democrats have blocked a bill or used \nparliamentary tactics? No.\n  In fact, it wasn't until November that a bill was even reported by a \nSenate committee and not until February when we passed the bill in the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\n  That was a good bill and Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords \nand others--including Senators Frist, Bond and Reid--deserve high \npraise for finally getting the bill finished.\n  That bill garnered 76 bipartisan votes.\n  The delay that occurred in the House was certainly not due to \nDemocrats.\n  A bill that was introduced and appeared to have a majority of support \nwas scrapped by the Republican leadership at the behest of President \nBush and slashed by $100 billion.\n  And the new reduced bill wasn't passed by the House committee until \nlast week.\n  One-hundred and eighty-four days behind schedule as we continue to \ninch toward actually shutting down the Department of Transportation.\n  I have hopes that we will get a bill approved by the House this week \nso we can begin to pre-conference the two bills and get a bill to the \nPresident before the most recent short-term extension expires at the \nend of April.\n  But as recently as this morning, it is still unclear if the House \nwill complete their work before they leave town for 2 weeks.\n  One-hundred and eighty-four days without passing a transportation \nbill. Simply amazing on a bill that is critical to our Nation.\n  Why the delay? One reason. The opposition of President Bush himself.\n  A veto has threatened the Senate bill--a bill that, as I said, was \napproved with Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  The President opposed the original House bill, and now, to the dismay \nof almost the entire transportation community--including many groups \nsuch as the Chamber of Commerce who have long supported the President--\nthe administration is even threatening a veto by President Bush of the \nscaled back $275 billion bill that the House is set to consider.\n  It appears the President would rather not have a transportation bill \nthat would create 1.7 million jobs--this in light of the 3 million \nprivate sector jobs already lost under this administration's watch.\n  Let us be clear. It has been 184 days since those who control the \nHouse and Senate and the Presidency have not been able to move a \ntransportation bill onto the President's desk--and it has not been as a \nresult of Democrats in any way.\n  There are some serious politics being played here with peoples lives, \nand I, for one, don't want to be a part of it.\n  This inaction has made it nearly impossible for us to even think \nabout approving another short-term extension--because that may be the \nonly thing that places pressure on Congress to approve the longer-term \nbill.\n  It has been 184 days and there is still a month to go before the \nRepublicans let the law lapse and shut down the Department.\n  There is still time before the extension runs out to move a good \nbill. But, I will not be a part of another extension that encourages \nfurther inaction and shortchanges our transportation infrastructure and \ndenies Americans the jobs that they so desperately need and deserve.\n  One-hundred and eighty-four days so far. We will keep counting.\n  But let us all know what is going on here. The delays are due to the \nPresident's opposition to approving a thoughtful transportation bill.\n  This, despite the majority in Congress who want to address this \nfundamental issue.\n  Why is the majority so strong for a transportation bill and the \nadministration so out of step?\n  There are many reasons, but to make it simple, the Bush \nadministration is focused like a laser beam on tax cuts for the most \naffluent--the privileged few--and they do not have time or want to \nbother with investments in our Nation's infrastructure.\n  The transportation investment proposal that the Bush administration \nput forward was dead on arrival in the Congress because it wouldn't \neven keep up with inflation.\n  At a time when 9 million Americans are out of work and job creation \nis virtually nonexistent, any more delays are unconscionable. And if it \nwere not for the President, we could avoid that.\n  In many States, such as my home State of South Dakota, the \nconstruction season is short--sometimes only 6 months.\n  If contracts are not entered into in April, it will be nearly \nimpossible to plan and get the work completed before the construction \nseason comes to an end early next fall.\n  Another year could be lost.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to get together and \napprove a bill that brings new investments to our decaying \ntransportation infrastructure and new jobs to the American economy.\n  The Senate's transportation bill would create 1.7 million jobs this \ncoming year. It would bring welcome relief from the longest jobs slump \nour Nation has endured since the Depression. So in addition to \nrepairing America's transportation infrastructure, this legislation \nwill reinvigorate the economy.\n  In States such as Texas, California, and Florida, the Senate bill \nincreases transportation investment by roughly 40 percent--four times \nthe increase proposed by the House, the House level the President \nopposes.\n  We are not just talking about numbers on a budget spreadsheet; the \nadditional investment in the Senate bill translates into hundreds of \nthousands of jobs for Americans.\n  In Florida, for example, the Senate bill would create 44,000 jobs, \nwhile the House bill would create 13,000. In Texas, the Senate bill \nwould create 80,000 jobs; the House bill 13,000. In Missouri, 22,000 \nversus 6,000; Illinois, 45,000, versus 10,000; California, 90,000 \nversus 25,000; Tennessee, 20,000 versus 6,000; and in my State of South \nDakota, 6,500 versus 1,500.\n  In all, the House bill falls 500,000 jobs short of the Senate bill. \nWe have all heard from the administration, and all we have heard they \noppose both the Senate and House versions of the bill. For the Bush \nadministration, it appears it is their way or--if you might pardon the \npun--the highway, or, in this case, no highway funding.\n  We cannot afford to let our transportation investments fall victim to \nthis kind of rigid partisanship. Every day we fail to make investments \nin our transportation infrastructure, every hour Americans lose in \ntraffic, every delay in the shipment of goods, carries a cost to the \nAmerican economy and slows job growth.\n  There is a broad coalition of groups and industries--including the \nChamber of Commerce, the Association of General Contractors, the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, and the International Union \nof Operating Engineers--who are united in their support of the Senate \nlevel of $318 billion.\n  They recently delivered a letter that was unequivocal. They wrote:\n\n       As business and labor organizations, we cannot support any \n     legislation below the Senate investment level for a six-year \n     bill.\n\n  Time is running short, but, as I said, we can still deliver real \nrelief to the American economy. If the House passes a bill this week, \nand staff and Members would start working immediately, there is \nabsolutely no reason we should not be able to complete this bill in \nApril. We can avoid letting the President and the Republican House \nleadership singlehandedly shut down the Department of Transportation.\n  It has been 184 days since the Republican Congress and President Bush \nbegan failing our Nation's transportation system and all who rely upon \nit. I know we can do better than this, put aside partisan politics, and \nbegin to focus on the important work that is before us all. I hope that \ncan be done in the next day.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the distinguished Democratic leader aware that the work \ndone in the Senate bill--$318 billion for transit and highways--was \ndone on a bipartisan basis? I have been chairman of that full committee \non two occasions. I understand it. I understand the committee very \nwell. But there was cooperation such as I have never seen. With Senator \nInhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, and me being ranking member on \nthe subcommittee now, there was no partisanship.\n  Is the Senator--I am sure--also aware this bill does not increase \ntaxes at all, it is paid for with existing dollars, plus trust fund \nmoneys? So anyone who thinks this is breaking the bank simply is \nmistaken. This is no new taxes, totally funded, no deficit spending. Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I answer the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader by saying that is exactly the case. We had an \nextraordinarily effective demonstration of bipartisanship in taking up \nthe highway bill. I worked closely with Senator Frist. I say to the \nSenator, you worked closely with Senator Inhofe. We got the job done on \ntime and, as you say, on budget.\n  This does not represent 1 dollar of additional deficit spending. It \nis a commitment to jobs. It is a commitment to infrastructure. It is a \ncommitment to our fiscal soundness that I think is one of the best \nmoments we have experienced in this Congress to date. It demonstrated \nagain Democrats and Republicans can truly work together.\n  I only hope we could do the same in the House, and we will certainly \ndo the same as we try to resolve whatever differences there will be \nwith the House, including the amount committed to infrastructure in the \ncoming days.\n  I thank the Senator for his excellent question.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3523-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will yield very quickly. I want to say \nthis. I understand the procedures here in the Senate. I certainly \nunderstand the majority has the right of first recognition. If the \nmajority decides they do not want us to participate in debate, it is \ndifficult for us to be part of the debate.\n  But I want the Record to be spread with the fact today we have \nheard--and I hope it is wrong--when we complete action today on the \nunderlying bill, that is, the welfare bill, the majority is going to go \nto the floor and prevent us from being part of the debate; they are \ngoing to talk about what Democrats are doing is wrong and what they are \ndoing is right, and not allow us to have recognition. Now I say, as the \nChair is aware, that we heard once before, not long ago, the majority \nwas going to do this, and you will recall at that time I got the floor \nand kept the floor for a long time. That did not set a good tone, that \nthe majority was, in effect, trying to force us out of the debate. The \nSenate is a debating body, and we should be part of that.\n  I say for the second time this morning, we know the majority can keep \nus from being recognized. It would set a very bad tone. I do not think \nit would be appropriate or fair, and we would do whatever we could to \nprotect our right, and everyone should understand that.\n  Mr. President, I yield, on the time we have remaining, 20 minutes to \nthe Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, many years ago when I was a schoolgirl, \non this day someone might come up to me in the hallway and say: \nHillary, your skirt is ripped. I would turn around in panic, and they \nwould say: April Fools'. Or maybe somebody would stop me after class \nand say: Hillary, I heard Janie is really mad at you, and I don't know \nwhat you did to her, but you'd better talk to her. I would feel \nterrible. Before I could do anything about it, someone would say: April \nFools'.\n  Well, today is April 1, and there is a long tradition of people \nplaying jokes on each other, pulling stunts, and then causing someone \nto be upset or worried or anxious or maybe even happy that they have \nbeen told something is going to happen, only to have the rug pulled out \nfrom under them when someone says, either jokingly or sometimes a \nlittle cruelly: April Fools'.\n  Thankfully, that day only came once a year, so you only had to endure \nyour friends or maybe your not-so-friendly classmates' jokes and stunts \nfor 24 hours. But I sometimes feel that it is April Fools' Day every \nsingle day here on Capitol Hill, on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue in the White House, because on issue after issue of profound \nimportance to the American people, our Government is basically saying: \nApril Fools'.\n  Do you remember when they introduced their budget in 2001 and said: \n``If you drastically cut taxes on the wealthiest of Americans, why, my \ngoodness, revenues will increase in the budget. You don't have to worry \nabout all the expenses that we have keeping this great country going \nbecause this will work''? Well, 3 years later, we are facing a $500 \nbillion deficit. Guess what. April Fools' on us.\n  Do you remember when they said: ``Our policies are going to generate \njobs''? Well, we saw during the 1990s 22 million new jobs created in \nAmerica. What a difference that made in so many people's lives. What \nhave been the results of this administration's economic policies? The \nloss of nearly 3 million jobs.\n\n  So for all those Americans who believed this administration's \npolicies would work to create jobs and economic opportunity, guess \nwhat. April Fools' on you.\n  When it comes to the Medicare prescription drug benefit, the \nadministration knew there was an estimate by the man responsible for \ncalculating how much Medicare will cost that was much higher than what \nhad been discussed in the debate over the bill. Here in this Chamber we \nwere told the bill would cost $400 billion. That is a lot of money. It \nwas a lot of money for what, frankly, our seniors are going to get, \nwhich is going to be a lot of confusion because so much of the money is \ngoing to drug companies and insurance companies. But, lo and behold, we \nwake up and find out that it was not a $400 billion bill; it was a $534 \nbillion bill. And the actuary, the civil servant at Medicare--he is not \npolitical; he works year in and year out for whoever is in office--was \nordered not to tell the truth to the American Congress or the people \nabout the cost of the Medicare prescription drug benefit or he would be \nfired.\n  So we passed the bill. I didn't vote for it but a majority did. We \npassed it. The President signed it. Guess what. April Fools': It is not \ngoing to cost $400 billion, it is going to cost $534 billion.\n  Then, of course, we have No Child Left Behind, which many of us so \nhoped would make a difference in the education of our children. But we \nconditioned our support for this education reform on the promise by the \nPresident that it would be fully funded, that the money our teachers \nand principals and superintendents and school boards, but particularly \nour children, would need would be there.\n  Well, no longer is that promise even credible. The President signed \nthe bill and then presented a budget which didn't provide the money \nrequired to fully implement No Child Left Behind. Once again, April \nFools' on us.\n  Americans have been fooled time and time again by this \nadministration, fooled by promises and fooled by predictions. Indeed, \nfor 3\\1/2\\ years, this administration has said one thing and done \nsomething else. The list is far longer than what I have even mentioned. \nThis was an administration that said: We are going to do something \nabout global climate change and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that \nis warming our climate. We just received a report from the Pentagon \ntalking about what that means to our national security. So the \nPresident gave speeches when he was running for office saying we are \ngoing to deal with that. Lo and behold, he gets into office, and forget \nit. April Fools': climate change, no such thing is going forward under \nthis President.\n  We have just seen some recent examples with respect to rising gas \nprices. That is a big concern. It is a concern in my State and around \nthe country. We are seeing OPEC cutting production which will cause \neven higher prices for gasoline. When the President was running for \noffice, he said: Why doesn't anyone do anything to get these gas prices \ndown? When I am elected, I will\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nmake sure OPEC doesn't raise gas prices on us.\n  Well, OPEC did it. They cut production. All the President said was \nhow disappointed he was. That doesn't sound like much of a strong case \nbeing made on behalf of the American people. Again, what should we \nexpect? It is the same story from this administration. Say one thing, \ndo something differently; fool the people, not just one day a year but \nevery single day.\n\n  It is as if words don't matter anymore with the administration--and, \nregrettably, with the Republican leadership in Congress. There are a \nlot of serious issues facing the people I represent. We are losing \njobs. A lot of people are losing their health care benefits. The cost \nof education to send a child to college is going up. We have a lot of \nchallenges we should be working together to meet.\n  On this side of the aisle we have tried to raise the minimum wage. \nWhy have we done that? Because it has not been raised for about 8 \nyears. There are a lot of decent, hard-working people who are falling \nfurther and further behind because their costs are going up, but their \nincomes sure are not.\n  We also want to do something about overtime because what this \nadministration has done is to say: We want to change the rules which \nwould take away overtime compensation from about 8 million Americans. \nCan you imagine what a horrible experience that would be for somebody \nworking a shift as a police officer or a firefighter or a nurse to be \ntold: Well, your Government, your President doesn't want you to be paid \nfor the hours you have to work extra. April Fools' on you. You are \ngoing to work but not get paid for it.\n  We don't like that. Is that obstructionist, that we Democrats think \nit is not fair that people should have to work and not be paid for it? \nI don't think so. I think that is in the tradition of American fair \nplay. But we can't get a vote on it here because the Republicans know \nthat if they had to have a vote on it, it would actually pass. That \nwould really embarrass the President and his administration. So they \ndon't want us to vote on it.\n  Unemployment benefits, it is the same thing. A lot of people are not \nonly out of work, but they can't find work because there are so few \njobs being created in this economy. The administration doesn't want to \nhelp these people. They don't want to give them that extra unemployment \nbenefit that can tide them over until maybe we can start seeing some \njobs created that will put people back to work. So our friends on the \nother side of the aisle don't want to vote on that because the \nadministration would be embarrassed, because they know if Republicans \nhad to vote on it, they would actually vote for it. So they don't want \nthat to happen.\n  Time and time again, we have seen the President and the majority say \none thing and do something else. It is April Fools' Day today, but that \nis no way to run a government. It is no way to run a great country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from New York, through \nthe Chair, is there not also an important issue that affects families \nand businesses across the United States with the increase in gasoline \nprices? If I recall correctly, Governor Bush, when he was a candidate \nfor President, said, in Manchester, NH, he thought in that \ncircumstance, the President should use the power of his office to force \nthe OPEC nations to try to expand their exports of oil so gasoline \nprices did not go up in America. Isn't it true at this point that this \nadministration not only has failed to do what the President promised as \na candidate he would do, but, in fact, OPEC has announced it is going \nto reduce their exports to the United States and force greater \nincreases in gasoline prices which will hurt the American economy and \nAmerican families?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. Not only \ndid the President, when he was running for office, say that he would \njawbone and fight back hard against OPEC if they tried to limit supply \nor raise prices, he even said he would use his connections in the oil \nindustry to make sure that got done. We all know about his connections \nand the Vice President's connections. There has never been an \nadministration in our history that is so closely connected to big oil \nand big gas and big coal and everything else.\n  So what happens? OPEC meets. Whatever they tried to do behind the \nscenes sure didn't work because they voted to cut production 4 percent. \nWhen that was announced, what did the President do? He said he was \ndisappointed.\n  There has also never been a President or anyone in any administration \nwho is closer or whose family is closer to many of the big oil-\nproducing countries such as Saudi Arabia. They have connections and \nrelationships and friendships going back decades. One would think that \nif any President could force OPEC not to take this damaging action \nagainst the American consumer, it would be this President.\n  But I see no signs of that. I see no real effort in that. Once again, \nit is say one thing, do something else. April Fools' on the American \npeople.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield. I also believe, in \nIllinois, as I travel around and speak to families and businesses, \nthere is one consuming issue, and that is the cost of health care, the \ncost of health insurance. Small businesses see these dramatic increases \nin health insurance premiums, and with these increases they are faced \nwith the terrible prospect of either reducing or eliminating coverage \nfor their employees; that has, unfortunately, led to more and more \nuninsured Americans.\n  Is it not true that, given the chance on the floor, with the \nprescription drug bill, where the Bush administration could have \nstepped forward and spoken for these families and businesses and said \nto pharmaceutical companies that you have to, as Canada has done, \nrestrain drug price increases, is it not true that on this issue \nrelating directly to the competitiveness of American products, the \nwelfare of American families, and the future of businesses and jobs, \nthat this administration has once again caved in to the special \ninterest groups--the drug companies and HMOs in this case--at the \nexpense of the American economy?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Once again, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely \ncorrect. As he well remembers, the debate on the floor concerning \nprescription drugs benefited many opportunities to try to rein in the \ncost of prescription drugs, to try to give permission to Medicare to \nnegotiate, as any big institutional buyer would have the right to do, \nand also to import the drugs that are American-made, American-approved, \nback from Canada so we could get the lower prices.\n  Again, this administration and the Republican majority steadfastly \nstood against the American public, against our seniors, and stood for \nthe pharmaceutical industry. As a result, the cost is going to be much \ngreater, and much of that increased cost is not going to help our \nseniors and lower drug costs so we can perhaps have even more \nprescription drugs available for our people. Instead, it will go right \ninto the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies and insurance \ncompanies.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not also the case that this administration took \ntaxpayer dollars to buy advertising on television for their \nprescription drug program and, frankly, misrepresented what the program \nmeant in terms of savings for seniors? It is bad enough that the bill \nitself didn't keep the cost of prescription drugs under control. The \nadministration took taxpayer dollars and used them to basically put a \nmessage out that at least wasn't complete, and perhaps was distorted, \nmisleading many seniors into believing that this prescription drug bill \nis going to be of some benefit?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Well, the Senator from Illinois has raised another \nimportant issue because the administration is using taxpayer dollars to \nconvey a misleading impression of the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, and to do so as a way of boosting the President's reelection \nopportunity. So taxpayer dollars, instead of his campaign dollars, are \nbeing used to try to persuade the American people against the evidence \nthat this massive bill, with so many benefits for the pharmaceutical \nindustry and insurance companies, is good for them. It is regrettable. \nAs the Senator knows, many of us tried to prevent that from happening \nand say let's do this right, in a bipartisan, unified manner, where we \nreally provide a prescription drug benefit for our seniors.\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\n  As the Senator also is aware, in the last several weeks, the \nPresident's campaign has been accusing one of our colleagues, the \nDemocratic nominee for President, of flip-flopping, saying one thing \none day and saying something else at a later date. It is the pot \ncalling the kettle black at the very least because it is this \nadministration which, on every important issue to the American people, \nhas either changed position or has persisted in providing a misleading \nand inaccurate argument on behalf of a position they have taken.\n  The long and distinguished career in public and military service of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, is one that needs no \ndefense from me or anyone else. It stands on its own merits. It is \nregrettable that an administration, increasingly known for its two-\nsided approach and its talking out of both sides of its mouth at the \nsame time, saying one thing and doing something else, would be accusing \nanyone of engaging in that kind of behavior.\n  Mr. President, it is April Fools' Day once a year. Thankfully, that \nis only once a year in most of our lives. Here in Washington, it is \nevery single day, 365 days a year. The administration has engaged in \nApril Fools' tricks on the people of this country repeatedly. But I \nthink people are waking up and starting to say:\n  Wait a minute, where is that big surplus you promised if we did \neverything you said?\n  How come my taxes are going up as a middle income American while \ntaxes on the richest are going down?\n  How come this is the first President in our Nation's history that has \nled us to war and cut taxes at the same time?\n  How come the White House didn't tell us the truth about the cost of \nthe Medicare prescription drug?\n  How come the administration didn't fund No Child Left Behind the way \nit had been promised?\n  How come we are having a transportation bill that the President \nthreatened to veto when it is the only jobs bill on the horizon that \ncan put people to work and repair the infrastructure and modernize our \ntransportation system in a way that will make us richer and stronger in \nthe future?\n  Well, the April Fools' Day jokes are coming to an end. Fool me once, \nshame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The American people are \nstarting to ask the hard questions. They are not just questions coming \nfrom Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, and coming from \nlongtime Government employees who don't have any partisan affiliation, \nlike Richard Clarke, asking hard questions that deserve honest answers.\n  At the end of the day, what really matters is that the American \npeople have trust in their Government and believe their President when \nhe talks to them about matters of life and death. That is what we are \ntalking about--life and death. So let's hope that when this day ends, \nmaybe we can have some good news from this administration in the form \nof admissions and some corrections that will put us back on the path of \nunity, that will create the tone the President promised that would be a \npositive tone in Washington, where we could deal with the real problems \nfacing Americans.\n  I am not optimistic, but I am hopeful that we could see that happen \nbecause these are matters of profound importance. It is imperative that \nwe as a Nation have faith in our leaders in these dangerous and \ndifficult times.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate needs to pass this bill now.\n  Since the World Trade Organization has ruled against the United \nStates over our foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income \ntax rules, we have had ample time to address this issue. The Senate \nFinance Committee reported legislation which would bring the United \nStates into compliance with our trade obligations on October 1, 2003.\n  Today, the European Union's 5-percent tariff will increase to 6 \npercent, and every month it will increase another percent. This will \nmake American agricultural and manufactured products increasingly less \ncompetitive in international markets.\n  Exports of U.S. agricultural products will approach $60 billion this \nyear. If we allow the EU to continue with these tariffs, we will \ncontinue to lose market share and export opportunities. When our farm \nexports are pressured, the truckers, rail lines, and shippers feel the \nill effects.\n  The EU retaliation list includes about 400 agricultural, food, and \nforest product tariff lines of imports from the United States.\n  These are very serious threats to our American agricultural economy, \nand this is why. The values of our annual exports to the EU are live \nanimals, $23.7 million; meat and meat products, $44.4 million; \nvegetables, $35.6 million; oil seeds, $64.6 million; rawhides and \nskins, $41.3 million; wood products, $140 million; sugar and \nconfectionery products, $21.2 million. The annual total of all these \nand other agricultural products amounts to more than $691 million a \nyear.\n  Let me also remind everyone that much of the food industry operates \non very small profit margins. So the initial tariff increase of 5 \npercent, plus the additional 1 percent per month, can have a serious \neffect.\n  Also, the EU currency has been very strong against the U.S. dollar. \nThis means it has been comparatively easier for our trading partners in \nEurope to buy our products, but the import tariff erodes that advantage \nand makes it easier for competitors--other countries--to take away our \nmarkets in the European area.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will complete action on the JOBS bill \nwithout any further delay so we can send that bill to the President, \nwhich he is prepared to sign immediately, so we can avert the lost \nsales, regain lost jobs in the agricultural sector, and restore hope in \nAmerica's farms and factories.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is day 7 of the Democratic \nleadership's unprecedented obstruction of President Bush's nominees for \nvarious executive positions and judicial nominations. In fact, I have \nin my hand the Executive Calendar which reflects 46 of the President's \nnominees who stand ready to be confirmed by the Senate so they can get \nto work on behalf of the American people. But unfortunately, as appears \nto be a growing trend and one where our Democratic colleagues continue \nto dig in their heels, the answer to every entreaty we might offer, \nevery suggestion we have in terms of creating jobs, in terms of putting \npeople on the bench to decide cases that go unheard because judges are \nnot being confirmed to these posts, we continue to get a consistent \nresponse on behalf of our Democratic colleagues of ``no.''\n  The answer they give to jobs and manufacturing, medical liability \nreform, a national energy policy, workforce investment, judges, small \nbusiness, class action reform, and faith-based and charities \nlegislation is ``no.''\n  Particularly on the judicial nominees, I point out, once again, that \nthis obstructionism is unprecedented in the history of the Senate. \nWhere we have a bipartisan majority in the Senate who stand ready to \nconfirm highly qualified nominees, such as Justice Priscilla Owen of \nthe Texas Supreme Court of my home State, people such as Janice Rogers \nBrown who serves on the California Supreme Court, or people such as \nMiguel Estrada who, after waiting\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nfor so long to have his confirmation heard on the Senate floor, finally \nhad to give up and go about his daily life because of this \nunprecedented obstruction.\n  The worst part of this is that it has not only been about blocking \nPresident Bush's highly qualified judicial nominees and other people \nwho he has proposed for various boards and commissions serving the \nAmerican people, this, unfortunately, has also involved a character \nassassination as well. Judicial nominees have been called names by \nSenators on the other side of the aisle that are really unbecoming of \nthe dignity of this body, names such as ``kooks,'' ``Neanderthals,'' \n``turkeys,'' and other names that are just entirely inappropriate to \nthe civil discourse and debate that people have come to expect and \ndeserve a right to hear from Members of the Senate.\n  We can disagree about policy matters. We can have a different \nproposal for the American people about which direction this country \nshould go on a number of these issues. But surely--surely--the Senate \nshould continue to conduct its discussions in a civil way and one that \nallows majorities to govern, not that allows obstinate minorities led \nby the Democratic leadership to block vote after vote on matters that \nare important to the people of the United States.\n  The problem we now hear is they are objecting to proceeding on any \nnominees because President Bush has used the authority given to him \nunder the Constitution to make recess appointments. They act as if this \nhas never been heard of, that it is unprecedented in U.S. history. The \nfact is, there have been more than 300 recess appointments made during \nthe course of this Nation's history, including by President Clinton, \nbefore President George W. Bush, and others. Indeed, this is a \nconstitutional response to unconstitutional filibusters.\n  Unfortunately, we know the nature of this process is such that if the \nDemocrat obstructionists get away with blocking President Bush's \nnominees, not from voting against them but by preventing a vote on them \nat all, this is a tactic once determined to be successful that will \nlikely be employed by others when the shoe is on the other foot.\n  When the next Democrat is President of the United States and \nRepublicans are in the minority in the Senate, how is it we are going \nto explain to our Republican colleagues that, no, you should not use \nthis tactic which, up until now, has been out of bounds but which has \nnow been employed successfully against the Democratic minority against \nthis President?\n  We ask for an up-or-down vote today on President Bush's judicial \nnominees, and we would ask that rather than answering ``stop'' to all \nof the Republican agenda on behalf of the American people, we could at \nleast get an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 5 minutes under the \nprevious order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3526-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3526-S3527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the theme we are talking about this \nmorning is obstructionism. We have heard about judges. Later on we are \ngoing to hear about the Democrats obstructing legislation that would \ncreate jobs in the United States. It is called the FSC/ETI bill. It \nreally is a jobs bill. This is legislation that will actually bring \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs back home to the United \nStates. Democrats have been blocking, as far as jobs are concerned, \nasbestos reform, bankruptcy reform, class action litigation reform--all \nof those items make American companies less competitive and make it \ntougher to have new job growth in the United States.\n  Outsourcing is a big issue. As we hear more and more about this \nissue, we have to understand some of the reasons surrounding it. Right \nnow the other side of the aisle is blocking a lot of the legislation \nthat would allow companies to bring new jobs to this country to make \nour country more competitive.\n  What I want to talk about this morning very briefly is the answer to \nwhat has caused a severe access to care crisis in many States, and that \nis the issue of the medical liability reform. My home State, the State \nof Nevada, is one of those 19 States that are truly in crisis. In fact, \nonly five States across the United States are showing no signs of a \ncrisis. Unfortunately, the rest of the states are all headed in \nNevada's direction, and it is only going to continue to get worse \nunless we fix the problem right here in Washington, DC. This is a \nnational problem and it requires an immediate national solution.\n  One of the main reasons we need a national solution is because the \nFederal Government now pays 60 percent--60, 6-0 percent--of all the \nmedical bills in the United States with regard to Medicare, Medicaid, \nand the Veterans Administration. There is a huge amount of money the \nFederal Government pays in taxpayer dollars that goes toward paying \nmedical bills in this country.\n  For this and many other reasons this is a national problem that \nrequires a national solution. We are losing doctors and other medical \nprofessionals at an alarming rate all over America. They are not going \ninto the specialty and high-risk fields, especially in the numbers that \nwe need in this country. There used to be a huge demand for many of \nthese residencies. Now, some of our schools cannot even fill their \nresidency programs. Unbelievably, often times they are not even getting \nany applications for these residencies.\n  A few weeks ago I heard about the problems in Utah. There are \ntremendous medical facilities there. They are having problems getting \ndoctors to go into some of the fields we want our best and our \nbrightest to go into--those fields that require the most technically \nbrilliant people--because of the fear that when they get out of medical \nschool they will not be able to afford to practice because the medical \nliability premiums are too high.\n  Why are the medical liability premiums too high? Well, it is pretty \nsimple. It is because we have an overly-litigious society where \nunscrupulous trial lawyers basically say bring your Rolodex and we will \nfind out who we can sue. More and more, this practice has spread into \nthe medical profession where hard-working and honest professionals are \nbeing subjected to frivolous lawsuits.\n  I am a veterinarian, and I know medicine is not an exact science. \nMistakes are made. If there is medical malpractice, the patient \ndeserves to get compensated, no questions asked, and our civil justice \nsystem has the ability to do that. But because the courts are so filled \nup with frivolous lawsuits these days, and some of the jury awards are \nso incredibly high, it motivates people to basically say let's go hit \nthe lawsuit lottery because the system is broken. It is a situation \nwhere because of the backlog, the people who are really injured die \nbefore they ever get compensation. It can take 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years in \nthe courts before their case actually has a final resolution, and that \nis unacceptable for those patients who are injured. That is one of the \nmajor reasons we need to have medical liability reform. Unfortunately, \nthe other side continues to obstruct our efforts in this area.\n  If opponents want to debate differences, if they want to amend the \nbill, fine, but they will not even let us go to a vote on a bill. In \nfact, they keep obstructing us even moving to debate a bill. They are \nfilibustering, just as they are doing on judges and many other things. \nIt is a shame because it is a crisis. It is a crisis with OB/GYNs--\narguably the most dire of circumstances with regard to access to care--\nbut it is also a crisis with trauma doctors, neurosurgeons, and even \nwith general surgeons.\n  Some of the best people who practice medicine in my State are either \nleaving practice or now, unfortunately, not going into those high-risk \nspecialties. We need to enact reform to protect every American's access \nto quality care, and to keep the best and the brightest practicing and \nentering into the medical profession. In order to so, this \nobstructionism by our opponents must stop, and it must stop right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about where we are, where \nwe are going, and some of the difficulties we are finding in getting \nthere. I was listening earlier as the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from Illinois were discussing some of the issues they consider \nto be problems with this administration.\n  They talked about the cost of energy. One of the reasons we are \nhaving some problems with the cost of energy is we have not been able \nto get an Energy bill passed that gives us any direction because it has \nbeen obstructed by the other side of the aisle, and it continues to be. \nSo that is not a surprise.\n  They talked a lot about the health care problems. One of the reasons \nwe have health care problems is the obstruction on the other side that \nwill not allow us to move forward with malpractice insurance.\n  The same thing, of course, is true with Medicare. They were critical \nof doing something with Medicare. I remind my colleagues this is the \nfirst time in 30 years we have done something to help change Medicare, \nand it is going to be implemented over a period of time because there \nwill need to be some changes in it. For the first time, people will be \ngiven an opportunity to get pharmaceuticals at less cost, and we will \nbegin to have an opportunity to change Medicare from the way it was \noriginally structured. It is very difficult to do that with the \nobstruction on the other side.\n  It is frustrating to be in the Senate where we are supposed to be \nmaking decisions, supposed to be moving forward. We do not all agree, \nthat is certainly true, but we do have a system that allows us to go \nforward. That is what votes are for, but we cannot take votes. We \ncontinue to sit here and only talk about things.\n  I am particularly interested in the energy issue, of course. I think \nit is certainly one that we have talked about for a very long time. It \nnow becomes more important because of the cost increases, because of \nthe difficulties we are having with energy. It begins to be more \napparent that we need to have an energy policy that has some plans for \nwhere we go over the next 5 or 10 years. We need to do that as soon as \nwe can.\n  One of the things the Bush administration, Vice President Cheney and \nthe President, did was to seek to have an energy policy. All we have \nheard are complaints and criticisms and still there is obstruction to \nhaving an energy policy, when it is so clear that that is precisely \nwhat we need to have.\n  We have higher gas prices at the pumps, partly because OPEC has \nbacked off somewhat, but also because we have made it necessary for \nrefiners to put into place about 18 different combinations of fuel. \nThere have been unexpected disruptions from Venezuela and elsewhere. We \nare having higher home heating bills because of the stress on natural \ngas where the consumption is going up much faster than the production, \nand it is predicted to do that in the future for some time.\n  So we are still talking about these issues. People are more aware of \nthem because of the blackout, because of the cost, and because of the \ndifficulties. So we need to make some changes, but we need a policy. We \nare not talking about all that we can do instantly. We are saying we \nneed a general policy, and that is what this policy is. It has to do \nwith alternative sources. It has to do with efficiency. It has to do \nwith conservation. It has to do with more research so that, for \ninstance, there can be more clean coal burned.\n\n  Today, the Wall Street Journal said finally people are saying we are \nhaving trouble with natural gas because of the demand, but coal is the \nfuel that we have with the most fossil reserves in this country, and we \ncan do it in a clean way. Particularly, western coal is low in Btu and \nlow in C02.\n  We need to be moving in that direction. We need a balanced bill, and \nthere are things we can do to accomplish that. We are going to have to \nchange the fuels over a period of time.\n  Some, particularly on the other side of the aisle, say: Oh, well, we \nhave to start using alternatives up to 40 percent in the next 5 years.\n  Right now, of all of our energy production, 3 percent is produced by \nalternatives such as wind. We can do much more in the future, and we \nhope that we do, but we cannot turn that corner right away. It is a \nvery difficult thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the new year arrived, I looked to coming \nback to Congress with, frankly, a sense of dread because I knew we were \nentering a political year, a year where the stakes are high, and the \nPresident stands for reelection. I knew there would be an awful lot of \nmy work and the work of all of us tied up in partisan gamesmanship.\n  I will confess to my colleagues, I do not much enjoy it. I look at my \nfriend from Nevada, Senator Reid, and I see a great human being. When I \nlook at Senator Feingold, I see another great human being. I love the \nmessage of compassion of the Democratic Party. I know where their \nhearts are. This is not about good people or bad people. This is about \ncompeting ideas.\n\n  But because I had that view--my father was a Republican, and my \nmother, a Udall from Arizona--I understand good people can differ on \nthese issues. Because of that sort of bipartisan approach to life I \nhave always had, in my former life as a businessman, as candidates for \npublic office would come to our company and ask to meet with us and our \nemployees, I welcomed Democrats and Republicans alike equally.\n  Unfortunately, what I often came away with was the feeling those on \nthe Democratic side loved my employees but they hated employers. That \nis because they would demand we create jobs and then they would say the \nway you do that is you raise the minimum wage, increase your \nregulations, and raise your taxes. I came to understand by doing the \nbooks, by doing accounting, one of my most significant costs was \nGovernment overhead.\n  All of them are well meaning. But all of them make it more difficult \nfor capital to come together so labor can be given work to do.\n  As my colleagues have come to the floor and complained about various \naspects of this current obstructionist period--you know, we talk about \nmedical liability, the Senator from Wyoming talked about energy, others \nhave talked about judges--I have to talk today about the whole issue of \nFSC/ETI and how critical it is we find a way through this morass of \npartisanship to getting this bill done. What we do by failing the \nAmerican people is to impose on manufacturers a European tax and a \npenalty to American potential for creating jobs. I don't think that is \nwhat Senators intend, but that is what is happening if we don't get \nFSC/ETI through this process.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I love the compassion I hear from my \nDemocratic friends. Yet when I look at some of the policies that are \nadvanced, what I see are policies designed to make the United States \nmore like Western Europe, more like socialist democratic welfare \nstates.\n  I recently had an experience on a trip with Senator Shelby and \nSenator Cantwell when we had traveled to\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nBerlin to meet with Gerhard Schroeder. The German Chancellor was \nexplaining to us his policies to reduce taxes, to reduce regulation, to \nreform medicine and Social Security. I said in humor, Mr. Chancellor, \nyour policies would make Ronald Reagan smile.\n  His response was: It isn't because I want to do this, but I must do \nthis because Germany no longer grows. We no longer have opportunity for \nour people. Our economy is dead in the water and yours is growing at a \nspectacular rate.\n  He even commented to the effect: You worry about losing jobs? We \nwonder why Mercedes and BMW are building plants in South Carolina.\n  It is because you can get a return on investment here.\n  I think we have to get beyond this lamentable side of the Democratic \nmessage, we love employees but we hate their employers, because the \ntruth is both have to win and there is room for both. These policies \nthat are punitive are well-intended. They want a vote on the minimum \nwage. I am ready to vote on that. They want to vote again on the \novertime provision. We have voted on all these things before. These are \nnot reasons to hold up progress on FSC/ETI. But that is what is \nhappening.\n  We have to vote two, three, four times on policies already decided by \nthis bicameral Capitol Hill. It is so very frustrating. I don't want \nAmerica to become a democratic socialist welfare state. I don't care \nhow well meaning all that was when they constructed the French and \nGerman economies, but I know, as Vice President Cheney pointed out last \nweek, while our economy was growing at nearly 8 percent in the last \nhalf of last year, their economies were growing at 1.4 percent.\n\n  So as we look to where these policies that are being proposed lead, \nlet's understand we don't want to become like that. We want to be \nAmericans. We want the American economy to produce jobs and to ensure \nfreedom. All the well-intentioned taxes, regulations, and burdens of \ncosts that are put upon employers ultimately translate into harm to \nemployees. I think we have to start pointing that out.\n  In the FSC/ETI bill we passed through the Finance Committee, there \nwas included in that a very important provision I was proud to sponsor. \nIt was the repatriation provision. One of the good things the Europeans \ndo and many of the other countries with whom we compete do, when their \ncompanies invest over here they let them take the money back to their \nhome country without a tax. They let it be taxed once here. They don't \nretax it.\n  As to American companies who compete overseas, we allow them to be \ntaxed over there and then we tax them again when they come back. So \nthis repatriation provision, which for 1 year would have treated our \ncompanies like our competitors treat their companies, would have \ndropped the tax from 35 percent to 5.25 for 1 year. That would have \ncreated over 650,000 jobs. All the economists said that. It would have \nbrought $300 billion into the economy, and it would have increased \nFederal tax receipts by nearly $12 billion a year. It is a win-win. Yet \nwe are stuck trying to re-vote on votes we have already voted, holding \nup this critical legislation, which I promise you is a vote against \njobs. To obstruct this bill is a vote against American jobs. It is a \nvote for a European tax increase on American workers.\n  Repatriation is a component of ending the FSC regimen that promoted \nexports by helping to bring into balance with our competitors American \ntaxation on our companies which export abroad.\n  I listened with some humor last week when my colleague Senator Kerry, \nthe Democratic nominee for President, introduced his tax plan. It \ncontained my repatriation provision. But when we put it through the \nFinance Committee, Senator Kerry voted against it. But now it is \nincluded. I don't know. I am glad he changed his mind, but I don't know \nwhy the flip-flop. It is a great idea. It is important to do. I am glad \nhe is now with us. I wish he were here today to vote on it. We could \nuse his vote to get this off the Senate floor, to a conference, and \ninto the American economy. It truly does produce jobs.\n  While I think it is easy to hate employers, it is easy to bash \ncorporations, at the end of the day that is how American free \nenterprise does its work.\n  I know not all corporations are perfect. There is always a rotten \napple or two to spoil the barrel. But most employees don't hate their \nemployers, and most employers care about their employees. Most American \ncompanies are anxious to see America succeed. These are patriotic \npeople. We have to understand there needs to be a win-win here. Right \nnow the obstruction on FSC/ETI is a lose-lose for the American people.\n  If we want to see jobs created, we need to pass this bill. We need \nnot to accede to a European tax through the WTO on the issue of FSC/\nETI. We need to fix it now. We needed to fix it yesterday. We need to \nget it to the House so we can get it to the President and then get it \nto the union shop, the corporate board room, so labor can be \nreemployed, because American capital comes home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Corps of \nEngineers Modernization and Improvement Act of 2004, S. 2188, which I \nintroduced right before the March recess. I am pleased that the senior \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and senior Senator from South \nDakota, Senator Daschle, joined me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n   This legislation is particularly timely because it comes at a time \nwhen Congress is debating the Nation's budget, and when we cannot \nignore the record-breaking deficits that the Nation faces. Time and \ntime again we have heard that fiscal responsibility and environmental \nprotection are mutually exclusive. Through this legislation, however, \nwe can save taxpayers billions of dollars and protect the environment. \nAs evidence of this fact, this bill is supported by Taxpayers for \nCommonsense, the National Taxpayers Union, the National Wildlife \nFederation, American Rivers, the Corps Reform Network, and \nEarthjustice.\n   Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers will be a difficult task for \nCongress. It involves restoring credibility and accountability to a \nFederal agency rocked by scandals and constrained by endlessly growing \nauthorizations and a gloomy Federal fiscal picture, and yet an agency \nthat Wisconsin, and many other states across the country, have come to \nrely upon. From the Great Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps \nprovides aid to navigation, environmental remediation, water control \nand a variety of other services in my State alone.\n   My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock \nIsland, and St. Paul district offices that service Wisconsin, and I \nwant the fiscal and management cloud over the Corps to dissipate so the \nCorps can continue to contribute to our environment and our economy.\n   This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an \namendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to create \nindependent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. In response to \nmy initiative, the bill's managers, which included the former Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith, and the senior Senator from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their \nmanagers' package to require a National Academy of Sciences study on \nthe issue of peer review of Corps projects.\n   S. 2188 includes many provisions that were included in two bills, \none of which I authored and the other I cosponsored, in the 107th \nCongress. It codifies the idea of independent review of the Corps, and \nit provides a mechanism to speed up completion of construction for good \nCorps projects with large public benefits by deauthorizing low priority \nand economically wasteful projects.\n   The bill puts forth bold, comprehensive reform measures. It \nmodernizes the Corps project planning guidelines, which have not been \nupdated since 1983. It requires the corps to use sound science in \nestimating the costs and evaluating the needs for water resources \nprojects. Under this bill, a project's benefits must be 1.5 times \ngreater than the costs to the taxpayer, which alone would save the \ntaxpayers over $4 billion. And, to receive Federal project funding, \nlocal communities\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nmust take on a greater share in the costs of the project.\n   The bill requires independent review of Corps projects. The National \nAcademy of Sciences, the General Accounting Office, and even the \nInspector General of the Army agree that independent review is \nessential to assure that each Corps project is economically justified.\n   The bill also requires strong environmental protection measures. S. \n2188 requires the Corps to mitigate the environmental impacts of its \nprojects in a variety of ways, including by avoiding damaging wetlands \nin the first place and either holding other lands or constructing \nweltands elsewhere when it cannot avoid destroying them. The Corps \nrequires private developers to meet this standard when they construct \nprojects as a condition of receiving a federal permit, and the federal \ngovernment should live up to the same standard.\n\n  Too often, the Corps does not complete required mitigation and \nactually enhances environmental risks. I feel strongly that the Corps \nmust complete its mitigation and the public should be able to track the \nprogress of mitigation projects. In addition, the concurrent mitigation \nrequirements of this bill would actually reduce the total mitigation \ncosts by ensuring the purchase of mitigation lands as soon as possible.\n  This bill streamlines the existing automatic deauthorization process \nfor the $58 billion project backlog, and it will keep the Corps focused \non its primary missions of flood control, navigation, and environmental \nprotection. Under the bill a project authorized for construction but \nnever started is deauthorized if it is denied appropriations funds \ntowards construction for 5 straight years. In addition, a project that \nhas begun construction but been denied appropriations funds toward \nconstruction for 3 straight years is deauthorized. The bill also \npreserves congressional prerogatives over setting the Corps' \nconstruction priorities by allowing Congress a chance to reauthorize \nany of these projects before they are automatically deauthorized. This \nprocess will be transparent to all interests, because the bill requires \nthe Corps to make an annual list of projects in the construction \nbacklog available to Congress and the public at large.\n  This measure will bring about a comprehensive revision of the project \nreview and authorization procedures at the Army Corps of Engineers. My \ngoals for the Corps are to increase transparency and accountability, to \nensure fiscal responsibility, and to allow greater stakeholder \ninvolvement in their projects. I remain committed to these goals, and \nto seeing Corps reform enacted as part of this Congress' water \nresources bill.\n  I feel that this bill is an important step down the road to a \nreformed Corps of Engineers. This bill establishes a framework to catch \nmistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps \nofficials to justify questionable projects, end old unjustified \nprojects, and provide planners desperately needed support against the \nnever-ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters, include \ncongressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to \nchampion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork \nand no substance. All too often Members of Congress have seen Corps \nprojects as a way to bring home the bacon, rather than ensuring that \nthe taxpayers get the most bang for their Federal buck.\n  I wish it were the case that the changes we are proposing today were \nnot needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is need for this bill. \nI want to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to \nproduce predicted benefits, stop costing the taxpayers more than the \nCorps estimated, do not have unanticipated environmental impacts, and \nare built in an environmentally compatible way. This bill will help the \nCorps do a better job, which is what the taxpayers and the environment \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4) to reauthorize and improve the program of \n     block grants to the States for temporary assistance for needy \n     families, improve access to quality child care, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Boxer/Kennedy amendment No. 2945, to amend the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the \n     Federal minimum wage.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senators Boxer and Kennedy to raise the minimum wage.\n  The last time we increased the minimum wage was in 1997, and workers \nhave already lost all of those gains of that increase. To have the \npurchasing power the minimum wage had in 1968, the minimum wage would \nhave to be more than $8 an hour, not the $5.15 today.\n  In 1968, we could afford it. In 1968, we could provide the wages that \nwould enable Americans to save for homes, to purchase homes, to save \nfor college education, and to educate young people. Today, working \nAmericans do not have that opportunity because the minimum wage is not \nsufficient to support a family and support the aspirations that all \nAmericans have to better themselves and their children.\n  Indeed, what is very startling is if we had increased the minimum \nwage at the same rate CEO compensation had increased, the minimum wage \ntoday would be $22 an hour. In fact, it raises the fundamental question \nwe will address over many months and years ahead, which is whether the \nrest of the world is going to become like the United States with a \nstrong middle class with opportunities to move forward or will we \nbecome more like the rest of the world with a huge divergence between \nthe very wealthy and those who are working for very little.\n  I believe we have to have a society that continues to produce a \nstrong middle class, that continues to make work something that allows \nan individual to provide for their families and to aspire to all of the \ndreams of American home ownership, education for their children, and a \ncomfortable and secure retirement.\n  Indeed, the fact that the minimum wage has relatively decreased has \ncontributed to a doubling of poverty. A minimum wage earner for a \nfamily of three who works 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year earns \n$10,700. That is $4,500 below the poverty line. Today, if you are \nworking 40 hours a week for minimum wage, you are in poverty.\n  The proposed increase would bring the minimum wage to $7 an hour, and \neven this modest increase would only raise the annual salary of \nfamilies to about $14,000.\n  It is not sufficient to replace what people had in 1968. It is not \nsufficient to ensure all families are above poverty. But increasing the \nminimum wage will at least give more opportunity, more hope, and more \nsustenance to the families in America.\n  Today, one in five children lives below the poverty line in our \nNation. This is the richest Nation in the world. That poverty has an \neffect on them; indeed, in the long run, it has an effect on everyone. \nThere is an adage: You can pay now or you can pay later. We are not \npaying now and we will pay later. We pay later in terms of children who \ndo not have the educational skills or the health to become the most \nconstructive workers in our society they could become. In fact, some of \nthem, unfortunately, wander into crime and other areas which cost us \nimmensely. We have to be able to ensure people can afford to live in \nthis country.\n  One of the other aspects of the minimum wage is a family earning a \nminimum wage in this country cannot effectively afford a two-bedroom \napartment in any of the major metropolitan areas and in many rural \nareas. That is unfortunate. Without proper housing,\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nhow can one ensure family stability and the opportunity to move up in \nsociety?\n  We all understand and we all praise the hard-working Americans who, \nday in and day out, go to their jobs and labor for their families and \ncommunities. But too many of them are working at wages that do not \nreward this great effort. We can do something and should do something \nabout that by increasing the minimum wage.\n  We should recognize and understand by increasing the minimum wage, we \nare not likely to have any negative impact on our economy. In fact, we \nwill probably stimulate our economic activity. In the 7 years after the \nlast minimum wage increase was enacted, there were nearly 11 million \nnew jobs added at the pace of 218,000 jobs per month. There was no \nbreak in employment because the minimum wage went up. There were more \nAmericans with more disposable income, buying more goods and services \nin our economy.\n  Most people, through my experience, who are working in jobs that pay \nthe minimum wage or slightly above the minimum wage, tend to spend a \ngood deal of their income on taking care of children, on taking care of \ntheir rent, on taking care of things that put money into our economy \ntoday.\n  We have to do this. Indeed, it would benefit our economy, not just \nthose recipients of increased wages.\n  There are about 7 million workers and a third of working women who \nwill benefit. I hope we can move forward and ensure this minimum wage \nis increased.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are facing a filibuster on an amendment \nI offered with Senator Kennedy, with great support across the board. I \nthank Senator Reed for his support of this very simple amendment.\n  We are facing a filibuster on whether we can vote on raising the \nminimum wage. I cannot think of a more cruel filibuster in my life. Why \non Earth would anyone, Republican or Democrat, try to block a vote on \nthis very important matter? I hear all about compassionate \nconservatism. Fine. Show it to me. Where is it?\n  People at the minimum wage have been stuck there for 7 years. That is \nhow long it has been since we raised it. Give us a chance to have an \nup-or-down vote on raising the minimum wage. I ask my colleagues to try \nand live on $10,800 a year. Think about your rent or your mortgage \npayment. If it is $800 a month, that is it. You use up all of your \nmoney.\n  Some Members say we are trying to raise it way out of proportion. We \nare not. It is a rather modest increase, from $5.15 to $7 an hour.\n  I will show a few charts that tell the story better. People who work \nat the minimum wage are working well below the poverty line. This red \nline on this chart is the poverty line for a family of three. A family \nof three is way below the poverty line. They are headed straight down, \nas shown on this chart. I do not understand why we want to keep people \nbelow the poverty line.\n  Nearly three-quarters of minimum wage workers are adults. We are not \ntalking about kids. When I was a kid, I used to work at the minimum \nwage. Fine. It was great. I made 50 cents an hour. That gives away my \nage. Imagine if those Members of the Senator were still in the Senate. \nWe would still have a minimum wage of 50 cents an hour. My goodness, we \nneed to raise the minimum wage.\n  Seventy-two percent are adults. How can we look at these people and \ntell them they do not deserve an increase? By the way, they will still \nbe below poverty even after we raise them to $7.\n  Every day we delay, minimum wage workers fall further behind. All the \ngains of the 1996 minimum wage increase have been lost already. The \ntime is long overdue that we raise the minimum wage.\n  People are working hard but losing ground. The real value of the \nminimum wage: Today it is worth $4.98. That is what hard-working people \nare getting, $10,800 a year for a family of three. With our minimum \nwage increase, there would be a $3,800 yearly increase in wages. That \nwould pay far more than 2 years of childcare.\n  We talk about how important this welfare bill is. As a matter of \nfact, my friend from Pennsylvania had a chart showing how wonderful it \nhas been that children have been lifted out of poverty. Of course, we \nare seeing now an increase in poverty. During the Clinton years, that \nwas true. There were so many jobs, 22 million jobs created, compared to \n3 million jobs lost under Bush. Kids were lifted out of poverty.\n  This minimum wage increase would give children more childcare. That \nis important. It provides 2 years of health care; provides full tuition \nfor a community college degree; provides a year and a half of heat and \nelectricity; provides more than a year of groceries; provides more than \n9 months of rent.\n  When we give to people at the lower echelon an increase in the \nminimum wage, they will spend it, and that will fuel our economic \nrecovery. I ask our friends on the other side, Why are you opposing us?\n  We will look at which Presidents have signed minimum wage increases \ninto law: FDR, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Republican; John \nKennedy, Democrat; Lyndon Johnson, Democrat; Gerald Ford, Republican; \nJames Carter, Democrat; George H.W. Bush, Republican; William Clinton, \nDemocrat.\n  The people who are trying to stop an increase in the minimum wage are \ngoing against a whole array of Democratic and Republican Presidents. \nOur increase is quite modest as shown by my chart.\n  American families are suffering since the Bush administration took \nhold. Look what has happened: 13 million children hungry; 8 million \nAmericans unemployed; 8 million workers losing overtime. That is what \nthey want to do. There are 7 million low-wage workers, some waiting 7 \nyears for a minimum wage increase. All we want is an up-or-down vote. \nThey are filibustering it. There are 3 million more Americans in \npoverty since President Bush took office and 90,000 workers a week \nlosing unemployment benefits.\n  I hope compassionate Senators on both sides of the aisle, I hope \nsavvy Senators on both sides of the aisle, will definitely allow a vote \non this very simple proposition. Seven years ago we raised the minimum \nwage. It is time to do it again.\n  Take it to the people in your States. Ask them how they feel. The \npolls are overwhelming. More than 70 percent of the people want to see \nan increase in the minimum wage. Yet in this Chamber, one would think \nwe are asking for something that makes no sense. We want to get people \noff of welfare. That is the point of the underlying bill. Let's get \nthem into work that pays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of our time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would ask the Senator from California--she suggested we are not \ngoing to allow a vote. I would be very happy to allow a vote. We \nsuggested we would be happy to give a vote on the issue of minimum \nwage. But I think it is important, if we are going to give a vote on a \n``message amendment''--that is the term that has been used by Members \non your side of the aisle, a message amendment--we would be happy to \ngive you a vote on your message amendment in exchange for you giving us \na vote on something that is actually going to help people in poverty; \nthat is, passage of this bill and going to conference. In fact, we have \noffered to the Democratic leader that in exchange for a vote on your \nmessage amendment, you allow us to pass and go to conference on a bill \nthat is actually going to help low-income people get out of poverty.\n  So I would be happy to offer, as I did yesterday, a unanimous consent \nrequest to give you a vote on your amendment, in exchange for you \nallowing us to have a vote on passage, at a time certain, and a \ncommitment to go to conference on this legislation.\n  I ask the Senator: Would you agree to such a proposal?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much for asking. We are ready to vote on \nthe minimum wage right now. We do not need any more debate time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to----\n  Mrs. BOXER. The message we are sending is to the people in America\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nwho need to have an increase. That is the message. We want to have that \nvote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have a \nvote on the minimum wage Boxer amendment, followed by a vote on the \nMcConnell amendment on minimum wage, and then a vote on passage of the \nwelfare reform bill, with the appointment of conferees, three \nRepublicans and two Democrats. And then, on top of that, let's get \neverything done. Let's move, then, to the FSC/ETI bill, have a \ncommitment to pass that bill by Thursday of next week, and a final \nvote, let's say, at 5 o'clock on Thursday.\n  So if you are committed to getting things done and helping \nmanufacturing jobs, and you are committed to helping get welfare reform \ndone, I offer that as a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, there are a series of amendments that \nare important to the working people of this country. Overtime--the Bush \nadministration is trying to take away overtime--we want a vote on that. \nThe unemployment insurance, which has run out for millions of \nAmericans, we want a vote on that. There are a series of amendments \nthat deal with making lives better for the people.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This Senate is not the House. We are Senators. We are \nfree to offer amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I absolutely would agree if he would modify his request. \nWe can agree on time agreements for these and keep it open for the rest \nof the amendments, and then we will agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object, as he has done it. But I will agree to modify \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Senator Frist has offered to the Democratic leader a \nvote on all three of the amendments that the Senator from California \nasked for; that is, minimum wage, the issue of overtime, as well as the \nissue of unemployment insurance. We have agreed to votes on all three \nof those amendments, in exchange for votes on two things we would like \nto do; that is, pass a welfare reform bill that is actually going to \nhelp reduce poverty in America, help stabilize and build families, \nreconnect fathers with their children, and to pass a JOBS Act otherwise \nknown as the FSC bill, which will help manufacturers compete in the \ninternational marketplace, save jobs, and create new jobs, and avoid \nharmful tariffs which are now in the process of being assessed against \nAmerican workers by the European Union.\n  We have agreed to pay a ransom, to get two victims returned. The \nvictims of the filibuster are the victim of welfare and the JOBS Act to \nhelp create manufacturing jobs. But we are not going to pay a ransom \nand not get a victim back. We are not going to pay a ransom to have \nvotes on theme or message amendments and not get back for the American \npublic two things that are absolutely necessary to help alleviate \npoverty and create jobs. This is not just going to be a political \nexercise.\n  The leader and the Republicans want to get things done. We are not \nhere to message for Presidential politics. We are here because we want \nto do a job for the American people. We have a welfare bill that has \nworked--the 1996 welfare bill.\n  I will quote--by the way, not a Republican--June O'Neill, who was at \nthe Congressional Budget Office, who said:\n\n       Politicians and experts from the left and the right \n     acknowledge that welfare reform has succeeded beyond the most \n     optimistic expectations.\n\n  The 1996 Welfare Act, which Members on the other side of the aisle \nsay: ``We are not trying to block. Oh, yes, we'll eventually get to \nit''--they say they are not trying to block it, so what do they do? \nRight out of the box, they offer an amendment and say: You either give \nus a vote on this amendment or we can't move forward on the bill.\n  They did not wait until we worked our will, until we had several \namendments we were trying to work through. There are supposedly 30 \ngermane amendments on the other side of the aisle. They did not wait to \noffer their 30 germane amendments. They did not work through the \nprocess.\n  Right out of the box comes an amendment that has nothing to do with \nwelfare, that we said, from the very beginning, if you offer this \namendment, then we will be happy to vote on it in exchange for a \ncommitment to finish this bill. But no. No. We have to get our message \namendments out. Why? Because I believe there are many on the other side \nof the aisle who do not want a welfare bill, who want message \namendments instead of improving a bill that we know works for the \nAmerican public.\n\n  Now, why would I say that? Well, let's listen to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, 8 years ago, on the floor of the Senate, dealing with \nthis first welfare bill that we are trying to reauthorize and modestly \nimprove. I underscore modest. This is not a major revamp of welfare in \nthis bill. There are some modest improvements, tinkering, because we \nknow what is out there is working. We want to make sure what has been \nput in place stays in place and make some minor tinkering to try to \nimprove it. That is why this bill came out of the committee in a \nbipartisan basis, because these are not major changes. These are minor \nchanges which amplify what we know has already been working out among \nthe States.\n  But what did the Senator from Massachusetts say about this bill in \n1996, which he voted against?\n\n       These provisions are a direct assault on children and have \n     nothing at all to do with meaningful reform.\n\n  Let's see if they had anything to do with a direct assault on \nchildren. Children in America who were at the highest poverty rates, \nwhen this bill passed, were African-American children. Let's see if \nSenator Kennedy's assault, as he termed it, came to be. No. Wrong. The \nassault was on poverty, not on children. The assault that Senator \nKennedy foretold never happened. Over 40 percent of poverty was among \nAfrican-American children in 1996. Now the rate of poverty among \nAfrican-American children is the lowest ever recorded--the lowest ever \nrecorded. Why? Because this bill works. Why? Because requiring work \nworks. That is what this bill did. And that is what Senator Kennedy was \nvehemently against--vehemently against.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Here we are talking about American children living in \n     poverty, the innocent victims of fate.\n\n  ``[T]he innocent victims of fate.''\n\n       If this bill passes, they will be the innocent victims of \n     their own Government.\n\n  Let me change that around. For 30 years, African-American children in \npoverty were the innocent victims of their Government, in programs \ncreated by the Senator from Massachusetts, which locked them in \npoverty. And we have the courage on this floor to say: Stop this \n``compassion'' that is killing America's children. We stood up and \nsaid, just because you are poor, you are not disabled, that we do not \nhave a prejudice against you because you are poor, but we believe you \ncan achieve just like the rest of Americans, if given the chance.\n  So we passed a bill that fundamentally changed the structure that the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Massachusetts, and far too \nmany others, believed was the best for children--well-meaning but very \nwrong.\n  Instead of admitting this is the proper course, they now offer an \nextraneous amendment, having nothing to do with welfare, to block this \nhugely successful program in helping millions of families--millions of \nfamilies--get off of welfare. How many millions? Two point eight \nmillion families. So 2.8 million families who used to get a welfare \ncheck now bring home a paycheck.\n  You ask, How big a difference is that in our world? I will give you a \nstory of a young lady who told her story. She works for CVS. She had \nbeen on welfare for many years. She said after she\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\nhad her first week of work and got her first paycheck, all of the \nchildren piled into her car and wanted to go to the store. Why? They \nwanted to go to the store because they wanted to go through the \ncheckout line and have their mom pay with cash instead of food stamps. \nThey wanted not to feel looked at as someone who was using the person \nbehind them and their money to help pay for their food, but they had \nearned it themselves.\n  You don't think that has an impact on a little child's life? You \ndon't think that being dependent upon the Government has an impact on \nthe psychology of little children who grow up in that environment? Do \nyou think we are doing people a favor by saying, We will take care of \nyou?\n  If we don't pass this welfare reform bill today, the majority of \nAmericans on welfare will no longer have a work requirement. If we \ndon't pass a welfare reform bill, a majority of Americans on welfare \nwill be in the old welfare system prior to the reform in 1996.\n  You say, well, this bill doesn't really make any difference? It makes \na huge difference because the incentives will not be there anymore. I \ncan't tell you the number of welfare mothers I have talked to. As I \nmentioned before, we have employed nine in my State office. I have \nworked personally, hand in hand, in trying to deal with the \ndifficulties of taking people from welfare to work. It makes an \nenormous difference in their lives. They have said to me, one after \nanother: I probably would not be where I am today had welfare reform \nnot passed and the Government changed their expectation of me. I had to \nlook at myself differently. It forced me to do something I never had \nthe courage to do because to get that first job is scary.\n  It is a frightening thing, if you have very little skills, to go out \nand hold yourself up to failure. Let's be honest. Remember your first \njob. You knew nothing about what it meant to work. You knew nothing. \nHow did you sign up? Where did you get your paycheck? What timecard did \nyou fill out? There are so many things in the world of work that you \nhave no concept of if you have no experience in it. That first job can \nbe frightening, particularly if you are unskilled. Taking that first \nstep or staying at home and letting the Government send you a check, \nthat is an option that far too many people took.\n  Well, we didn't allow that in this bill. And it was not cruel. It was \na step in the right direction for 2.8 million families, 2.3 million \nchildren out of poverty, 700,000 African-American children out of \npoverty. And we are blocking a bill that would make this a reality for \nfuture generations of people who may have to go through the welfare \nsystem?\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa. I thank the chairman for \nhis tremendous effort in bringing this bill to the floor and fighting \nto get it through cloture and on to passage and to reality. He has been \na warrior for children on this issue. I thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for managing the bill while I \nhad to be in a conference to work out compromises on the pension bill. \nBut more importantly, going back to his days in the House of \nRepresentatives, he has been a trailblazer in the cause of moving \npeople from welfare to work so that those people have an opportunity to \nmove themselves up the ladder.\n  Families on welfare and low-income families need childcare, and they \nneed it now. This bill will help do that. If Democrats obstruct passage \nof this welfare bill, we risk losing a significant opportunity to \nsubstantially increase childcare funding for welfare families as well \nas for poor working families. If we simply continue the level of \nchildcare funding under current law, hundreds of thousands of children \nand working families will lose their childcare. Estimates have been \nmade that nearly 225,000 children could lose childcare assistance by \nthe year 2006, and more than 360,000 children could lose it by the year \n2008.\n  Is that what the Democrats want? Is that what they stand for in their \nvote against cloture on this legislation? That is playing politics on \nthe welfare bill, and playing politics will not get this bill passed.\n  This bill is good policy. Democrats know that. And good policy is \ngood politics.\n  Let me be clear: If Democrats succeed in their efforts to derail \nconsideration of the welfare bill, hundreds of thousands of children \nwill lose childcare. In other words, in order to score political \npoints, Democrats are leaving poor children and their working single \nmoms out in the cold. Without additional childcare resources, many \nStates will be forced to make painful childcare cuts or institute \nwaiting lists or increase copays.\n  If childcare funds are not available, low-income families, working \nfamilies trying to do the right thing will be unable to help pay for \nchildcare. Children work; children suffer. Or else children don't \nsuffer and parents don't work.\n  Under this situation, they would be forced to resort to inadequate, \nunstable, probably unsafe childcare arrangements, or even be forced to \ngive up their jobs and return to welfare, all so that political points \ncan be made. That doesn't make sense to me, especially for a party that \nbrags about putting the care of the people in need uppermost in their \nplatform.\n  I think that is shameful. Democrats ought to be ashamed of themselves \nfor making political hay on the backs of these low-income people.\n  In addition to the loss of childcare funding increases, if we are not \nable to enact this legislation--and you have to have cloture to get to \nfinality, or else you have to have an agreement on the number of \namendments and their germaneness to move ahead. So without one or the \nother, we are not able to enact welfare reform. In addition, we would \nalso fail to make needed improvements to child support enforcement \nprograms. We would fail to provide transitional medical assistance for \n5 years as well as give States access to the contingency funds they \nhave not been able to use because we liberalized States' access to \nthose contingency funds. We leave States in the dark about what a \nreauthorization bill next year would look like. Why leave 50 State \nlegislatures in a lurch when if we acted, they can put their State \nprograms in place and move on with certainty?\n  When this is all added together--and there are a lot of other things \nwe could say--it is an extraordinarily irresponsible policy that ends \nup with the lack of finality on the part of this Senate on welfare \nreform.\n\n  But then maybe welfare reform has never been a priority for \nDemocrats. In the 107th Congress, even though my friend, Senator \nBaucus, reported a bill out of committee with $5.5 billion for \nchildcare, welfare never made it to the floor of the Senate. This year, \nthe Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill with significant \nDemocratic priorities in it, but no Democrat voted for it.\n  Our Republican leader, Senator Frist, gave us a week out of a very \ncrowded legislative schedule because welfare reform--taking care of the \nneeds of the poor, the needs of children--is high on the agenda of \nSenator Frist. But it also has to be worked in with a very crowded \nlegislative schedule. But he gave us time. He has many Members and many \ncommittee chairmen besides this Senator pressuring him for floor time \nto take up their bills, to consider legislation; yet, this had the high \npriority of our Republican leader.\n  We passed the bipartisan and Republican-sponsored Snowe amendment, \nincreasing childcare by $6 billion, and still it looks like Democrats \nare prepared to block action on this bill, this bill that helps poor \npeople, because they have an agenda that somehow outranks welfare. \nObviously, their agenda is to make political points. I am sad to say \nthat ultimately children and their working moms are the ones who will \npay the price for this political grandstanding.\n  I hope we can do better by them, Mr. President. I have worked hard so \nthat we could in fact do better for these people. It would be a shame \nif we are prevented from passing a bill that would genuinely help those \nin need just so the other side can score political points, or at least \nwhat they perceive to be political points.\n  The question is whether the Democrats will be held accountable if \nthey\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nsucceed in killing welfare reform and killing an additional $7 billion \nfor childcare. This issue is not about a vote on minimum wage. \nRepublicans are willing to take a vote on minimum wage. As my colleague \nfrom Missouri, Senator Talent, said yesterday, ``We are willing to pay \nthe ransom. We just need some assurances that we get the victim back.'' \nWe need to know we can pass this bill and get it to conference. That is \nthe issue over which Democrats are obstructing.\n  It is very unprecedented that Democrats are objecting to appointing \nconferees. Let me say that more broadly. It is almost unprecedented for \nthe legislative process not to work the way the Constitution writers \nintended, and that is you get to a point where you work out compromises \nbetween the other body and this one, and that takes a conference \ncommittee to do it. If you want a product instead of politics, you go \nto conference. That begs the point, are we ever, then, going to be able \nto pass anything around here? In order to get a bill enacted, it has to \npass both bodies.\n  We have $7 billion in childcare on the table right here. In order to \nscore political points, Democrats are going to leave this banquet that \nis out there for people in need.\n  Again, the issue is not about getting a vote on minimum wage. \nRepublicans are willing to take a vote on minimum wage. The issue is \nabout getting a bill done, reaching finality. Democrats are preventing \nus from getting a welfare bill through the legislative process. I hope \nthey have a surprise for this Senator and that we get cloture, and that \nthey deliver to the people what they promised. This is very unfortunate \nfor our country and for families who could have benefited from the bill \nthat it looks like Democrats are going to kill today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 18 minutes under Senator Baucus's time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I ask the Chair to remind me when I \nhave a minute and a half left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are voting at noontime today on a \ncloture motion, and those, obviously, in the Senate understand what \nthis is all about. Before the Senate at the present time is a proposal \noffered by the Senator from California and myself to increase the \nminimum wage up to $7 in just over a 2-year period. The minimum wage \nhas not been increased for the last 7 years. Now we find the minimum \nwage purchasing power is at an all-time low.\n  Now, those on the other side--we just heard from my friend Senator \nGrassley--are saying we are somehow stalling this legislation. We are \nnot. When this amendment was offered, the Senator from California and \nmyself agreed to a 20-minute time limitation so we could move ahead \nwith the rest of the debate on the TANF reauthorization. That was \nobjected to. And then the majority leader put down a cloture motion.\n  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the minimum wage because there \nis so much to say about it, about the people who are experiencing it \nand the impact of our failure to increase the minimum wage, \nparticularly the impact on children. We have not had an opportunity to \nhave a vote in the Senate for the last 7 years on this. It is time that \nwe do. We are being precluded from doing so because of the \nparliamentary maneuvers of the majority to deny the Senate of the \nUnited States a vote up or down on whether we think some of the hardest \nworking Americans ought to have an increase in the minimum wage.\n  The Republicans are so frightened about voting on this, so they do \nthe parliamentary tricks in order to try to deny the Senate an \nopportunity to vote on the minimum wage. Well, it is beyond me why they \ndon't want to take the hard vote. Why not go back to your constituents \nand say, I am for this or against it. If you are against it, explain \nwhy. But we are being denied. It is not just denying the sponsors; they \nare denying over 7 million hard-working Americans the opportunity to \nget an increase in their pay.\n  As I pointed out in the beginning, the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage now, at the end of this year, will be near an all-time low \nsince it passed in 1938. We have a chance to do something about it and \ndo something now.\n  A quick response to my colleagues on the other side regarding the \nwhole question of how increasing the minimum wage isn't really related \nto getting people off welfare into jobs. Well, it is difficult for \npeople who have listened to the debate to accept that, particularly \nwhen the Secretary of HHS himself said this in comment to the \nunderlying program, TANF:\n\n       This administration recognizes that the only way to escape \n     poverty is through work, and that is why we have made work \n     and jobs that will pay at least the minimum wage . . .\n\n  Do you hear that? Secretary Thompson said this:\n\n     . . . the centerpiece of the reauthorization proposal for the \n     TANF program.\n\n  Still our Republican friends say our amendment is not related to \nthis. Of course it is. The President's spokesman indicated that. Still \nwe are unable to get this.\n  Mr. President, I have stated who these people are who are earning the \nminimum wage. They are men and women of pride and dignity. They deal \nwith tough jobs--cleaning out buildings of our country, all over our \nNation. They work in schools as assistant teachers. They work in \nnursing homes providing help and assistance for our senior citizens.\n  Let me read one short story which is typical about a minimum wage \nworker. The name of this person is Fannie:\n\n       She weighs bunches of purple grapes or rings up fat chicken \n     legs at the supermarket where she works, Fannie Payne cannot \n     keep from daydreaming.\n       ``It's difficult to work at a grocery store all day, \n     looking at all the food I can't buy,'' Mrs. Payne said. ``So \n     I imagine filling up my cart with one of those big orders and \n     bringing home enough for all my kids.''\n       Instead, she said that she and her husband, Michael, a \n     factory worker, routinely go without dinner to make sure \n     their four children have enough to eat. They visit a private \n     hunger center monthly for three days' worth of free \n     groceries, to help stretch the $60 a week they spend on food.\n       ``We're behind on all our bills,'' Mrs. Payne said. ``We \n     don't pay electricity until they threaten a cut-off. To be \n     honest, I'm behind two months on the mortgage--that's $600 a \n     month.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 more minutes from Senator Baucus's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. She continues:\n\n       ``We owe $800 on the water bill and $500 for heat.''\n\n  These are the real workers who are going to benefit from an increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  What has happened over the last 3 years? We have seen the number of \nAmericans who are living in poverty grow from 3l million up to more \nthan 34 million. These are 3 million Americans who are living in \npoverty, including hundreds of thousands of children, in the richest \ncountry in the world, who are living in poverty and, in so many \ninstances, in hunger in the United States of America.\n  This is what the 2003 survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors that \nlooked at hunger found. These are mayors, Republicans and Democrats: 39 \npercent of the adults requesting food assistance were employed. Why? \nBecause the minimum wage cannot provide sufficient income. These are \nhard-working individuals trying to look out after their families and \nfeed them, and they cannot make enough to provide food for their \nfamilies.\n  No. 2, a leading cause of hunger was low-paying jobs. We have a \nchance to do something about that by increasing the minimum wage. This \nis what the mayors from all over the country, Republican and Democrat, \nsay, that a leading cause of hunger is low-paying jobs.\n  Emergency food assistance increased by 14 percent just this last \nyear.\n  Fifty-nine percent of those requesting food assistance were members \nof families, with children and elderly parents. This is what is going \non in this country. We can make a difference.\n  Finally, one of the major recommendations they make is raising the \nFederal minimum wage as a way\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nthe Federal Government could help alleviate hunger. Do we hear that? \nThat is the recommendation of the mayors of this country.\n  Look at what happened in a study the National Urban League did on the \nissue of minimum wage. They say:\n\n       Minimum wage workers are too often presented as teenagers \n     or wives in the middle class. Yet the clear implication of \n     this study is that the proposed increase in the minimum wage \n     from $5.15 to $6.65 an hour, or to $7 an hour in the case \n     today, would move 1.4 million American households to the \n     level of being food secure, having enough money to buy \n     nutritious, safe food for their families.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       The increase in the minimum wage lessens hunger in all \n     households, but particularly in low-income households and in \n     those households in which the householder was less educated, \n     in African, Hispanic, or single parents.\n\n  This is what is happening. There is an increased number of those who \nare living in poverty and an increase in the number of children living \nin poverty.\n  Look at the impact of hunger, the consequences of hunger and food \ninsecurity on children. This is the Heller study, June of 2002:\n\n       Elementary-school children from food-insufficient families \n     were more likely to have repeated a grade in school in both a \n     national sample of elementary-school children and a study of \n     low-income families from the Pittsburgh area.\n       Hungry and at-risk for hunger children from 4 inner-city \n     schools in Philadelphia and Baltimore were absent from school \n     more days than other children and also had higher rates of \n     tardiness. A similar finding with respect to missing school \n     was found in a multi-state survey of low income households.\n\n  These are the studies. Children are going hungry in America. This \nproposal is not going to answer all the problems, but it will help 7 \nmillion Americans. That is something worthy of this body this day. But \nwe are going to be denied by our Republicans the opportunity of even \nvoting on this amendment.\n  As I have said often, this is a women's issue because the great \nmajority of individuals who receive the minimum wage are women. This is \na children's issue because a great majority of those women have \nchildren. It is a women and children's issue. This is a family issue \naffecting women and children. This is a civil rights issue because so \nmany of these men and women are of color. And finally, this is a \nfairness issue because people in the United States of America \nunderstand fairness, and they believe if you work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, you should not have to live in poverty.\n  Let's vote up or down, at least have the courage of convictions on \nthe other side and give us a chance and give these 7 million Americans \nwho deserves an increase in the minimum wage an opportunity to have \nsome hope at the end of the day because the Senate did the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I asked unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter to myself and Senator Baucus signed \nby 41 Democrat Senators. However, at the time of printing it was \nmissing its second page. I again ask unanimous consent that the letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman,\n     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Baucus: We believe \n     reauthorizing the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n     (TANF) program is an important item on the congressional \n     agenda for this year. The Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) made dramatic \n     changes in our Nation's welfare laws that have had a profound \n     impact on disadvantaged families. We agree with the President \n     that the main goal of welfare programs should be to \n     strengthen families and support self-sufficiency. We would \n     like to work with you to build on the strengths of the new \n     system, as well as address areas where the new law falls \n     short.\n       We are encouraged by the number of families who have moved \n     successfully from welfare to work. However, 33 million \n     Americans still live in poverty. The current economic \n     downturn has led to increases in both unemployment and, more \n     recently in many States, the welfare caseload. Today, almost \n     every State in the Nation faces a fiscal crisis. Under these \n     circumstances, a concerted, bipartisan effort is necessary to \n     preserve the progress we have seen so far, as well as \n     encourage States to help more families become independent.\n       We strongly support several of the concepts the President \n     has outlined, if designed and implemented appropriately. \n     ``Universal engagement'' of welfare recipients would help \n     make sure each family's specific circumstances are considered \n     and addressed. Ending the current ``caseload reduction \n     credit,'' which gives States credit for people who are not \n     working, and replacing it with an ``employment credit,'' \n     would provide stronger incentives for States to move families \n     not only off of welfare but into jobs. Similarly, bipartisan \n     proposals to strengthen child support would encourage better \n     relations between non-custodial parents and their children, \n     and help families stay off welfare. We would like to work \n     with you to make sure all States can participate and that \n     families receive the child support they are owed. We also \n     agree that transitional Medicaid benefits should be extended \n     so parents who leave welfare will know their children will \n     have health care as their families make the transition to \n     work.\n       We are concerned, however, that the administration's \n     proposals lack several key reforms that will help more \n     families achieve self-sufficiency. We believe reauthorization \n     should include four important components to achieve this \n     goal.\n       First, to be successful, a work-oriented welfare program \n     must demonstrate that work will be fairly rewarded, and that \n     families will be better off if they play by the rules. We \n     must make sure states can provide critical work supports, \n     especially quality child care. Child care assistance is \n     essential if parents are to get a job and stay employed.\n       A significant increase in funding for child care is needed \n     not only to support the current level of child care provided \n     to low-income working families, but also to improve the \n     quality of care provided and cover the millions of eligible \n     children currently without assistance. We know there are \n     significant additional costs associated with increases in \n     work requirements. Any welfare reform bill must include \n     sufficient funding to ensure that we are not cutting child \n     care services currently provided to low-income working \n     families in order to pay for child care for families \n     receiving TANF cash assistance. In addition, funding must be \n     provided to improve the quality of child care to ensure that \n     low-income children enter kindergarten ready to learn, as \n     well as to increase access for the millions of families who \n     are eligible but currently receive no child care assistance.\n       This investment is even more important because of the \n     states' fiscal crises. At least 13 states cut their \n     investments in child care in 2002 because of budget \n     pressures, and more are likely to be forced to do so this \n     year or even next year. In this climate, it is not realistic \n     to rely on states to restore these needed funds, or fill in \n     gaps left by federal policies. Failure to strengthen the \n     federal investment in child care will have dire consequences \n     for many low-income families that are trying to succeed in \n     the workplace. We are pleased that the Senate Budget \n     Resolution rejects the President's proposal to freeze child \n     care funding, but we are still concerned that the proposed \n     funding will not sustain current levels of support, let alone \n     improve the quality of care or allow for increased work \n     requirements.\n       Second, we must recognize the role legal immigrant families \n     play in our economy. Most legal immigrants came to this \n     country to find work; they contribute economically to their \n     communities and play important roles in the labor force. \n     Because of language and other barriers, many must take lower \n     paying jobs and thus can be buffeted by economic dislocation. \n     At their annual winter meeting, the nation's governors \n     reiterated that immigration, which is controlled by the \n     federal government, creates demands at the state level for \n     education, job training, social and health services, and \n     other assistance that is necessary to help immigrants \n     integrate into our communities and become self-sufficient \n     members of society. Currently, 31 states use their own funds, \n     without federal support, to provide TANF benefits and \n     services or health assistance to legal immigrants, and other \n     states often absorb emergency health care costs for these \n     families. Giving states the options to use federal funds for \n     benefits and services to legal immigrants is an issue of \n     fundamental fairness, and it would provide needed fiscal \n     relief for states.\n       Third, states need more flexibility to make sure workers \n     have the skills to succeed in the workplace. At a minimum, we \n     support the provisions included in the bill reported by the \n     Finance Committee last year. Full-time, work-related \n     vocational training and education, post-secondary education, \n     basic adult education, work-study, and other similar \n     activities can lead to better jobs, more opportunities for \n     advancement, increased family incomes, and a more competitive \n     workforce. We should not arbitrarily limit states' ability to \n     support these activities, since they provide a true ``ticket \n     to independence.''\n       Fourth, we support state and local innovation, but will not \n     support a ``superwaiver'' that merely shifts resources from \n     one pot to another and eliminates basic protections for \n     families, while bypassing Congressional oversight. A broad, \n     vague superwaiver is no substitute for providing states with \n     the flexibility within TANF to craft welfare-to-work programs \n     that meet the particular needs of their state economies and \n     the families they serve.\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\n       Finally, we would like to express concern over \n     Administration and House proposals to significantly increase \n     work participation standards and work hours, without \n     flexibility and adequate increases in work supports. We agree \n     that TANF recipients should be engaged in work activities \n     that will help them to ultimately become self-sufficient. \n     However, we feel strongly that we should not impose rigid \n     requirements that would undermine successful state programs, \n     or reduce states' flexibility, which allows them to consider \n     and address the individual needs of participating families, \n     including disabilities and other barriers to employment.\n       We would also like to point out that states have been \n     successful in reducing their cash assistance caseloads \n     because they have taken advantage of the flexibility in TANF \n     to support low-income working families, including not only \n     those receiving cash assistance, but also those who have left \n     welfare or those who are at risk of needing welfare. These \n     innovative efforts are already in danger because of the \n     states' fiscal crises; increasing work participation \n     requirements threatens the success of these programs by \n     significantly reducing the help available to support low-\n     income working families for child care, and other key \n     services. We believe this would be a major step in the wrong \n     direction.\n       We would also like to correct the perception that states \n     can support higher work participation standards without \n     additional resources. An argument has been made that states \n     have more resources per TANF family than they had in 1996. \n     This claim is misleading for several reasons. This line of \n     reasoning assumes that non-TANF Child Care and Development \n     Block grants (CCDBG), which support many low-income working \n     families, are used only to support families receiving TANF \n     cash assistance. In fact, the statute specifically states \n     that CCDBG funds are to be used not only for families \n     receiving assistance, but also for, ``families who are \n     attempting through work activities to transition off of such \n     assistance program, and families who are at risk of becoming \n     dependent on such assistance program.'' (PRWORA, Section \n     603).\n       The Administration's figures also assume that all TANF \n     resources are used to support only families receiving \n     assistance. But states have been successful in reducing their \n     cash assistance caseloads because they have taken advantage \n     of the flexibility in TANF to support low-income working \n     families, including those who have left welfare or those who \n     are at risk of needing welfare. The General Accounting Office \n     reported in April 2002 that ``at least 46 percent more \n     families than are counted in the reported TANF caseload are \n     receiving services funded, at least in part, with TANF/MOE \n     funds.''\n       The President has said, ``It is not yet a post-poverty \n     America.'' If we are to reach this goal, we must maintain \n     strong federal and state support for welfare reform, so that \n     families can escape the ravages of poverty and become self-\n     sufficient. We look forward to working with you on a \n     bipartisan basis to achieve these important goals.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tom Daschle, Bob Graham, Jay Rockefeller, Blanche L. \n           Lincoln, John F.

Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if you could tell me when I have used 3 \nminutes, I would appreciate it. I want to leave some time for the \ndistinguished manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this issue is very important. If we \nreally want to help people move from welfare to work, we ought to \nincrease the minimum wage.\n  First, I wish to identify myself with the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and what he just said about the importance of the minimum \nwage issue, but I want to talk more to the procedural question.\n  In 1995, when we debated welfare reform the first time, the Senate \nhad 40 rollcall votes--40 rollcall votes. The next year when we dealt \nwith it a second time, because the bill had been vetoed, the Senate had \n30 rollcall votes, even under reconciliation. So we have had 70 \nrollcall votes in the consideration of this bill on two occasions in \nfewer than 10 years.\n  We have had one vote--one vote--on this bill so far. It was a good \nvote. I am very appreciative of the commitment made on a bipartisan \nbasis to childcare. But the real question is, Can you have the kind of \ndebate that has been experienced in the past, that should be \nanticipated now with the benefit of one vote?\n  I have offered the distinguished majority leader that we could work \nthrough the remaining amendments and finish this bill before we leave \nnext week. I have offered that consistently through the last several \ndays in the hope we could reach some agreement. I am very disappointed \nthat we have not been able to find some way with which to resolve just \nthe procedural differences. A vote on minimum wage, a vote on the \nunemployment compensation, a vote on relevant amendments to the welfare \nbill is not too much to ask and, indeed, that has been the practice of \nthe Senate.\n  We are willing to work. This is not a question about whether we \nsupport welfare reform. We will get an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote \non welfare reform, as we should. This is not a question of whether we \nshould have anything less than an opportunity to debate issues that are \ndirectly relevant to people's lives as they try to cope with the \nextraordinary financial pressures they feel trying to get off welfare. \nWe are hopeful we can do that.\n  We are hopeful we can work with our Republican colleagues and figure \nout ways to deal with these relevant amendments and these amendments \nabout which our Democratic caucus feel very strongly.\n  We will oppose cloture today but in no way, shape, or form is it an \nindication of our lack of willingness to work to finish the legislation \nitself. Give us a chance to do what we have done twice before on this \nbill. Give us a chance to vote on amendments that are critical to a \ngood and full debate about the direction we ought to take with regard \nto this bill, and you will have closure on it at a time in the not too \ndistant future.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with us to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what the Democratic leader has just \nsuggested is allowing us to vote on welfare reform, but what the \nDemocratic leader has insistently refused to do is to allow that bill \nto go to conference. Of course, a bill passage means nothing unless \nthere can be a final resolution on that legislation. So what we are \nbeing told is they will give us an apparent victory of passing \nlegislation with no end in sight. The idea that somehow or another we \nare going to have a final resolution--I think the words of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota were ``final resolution''--is simply not accurate. \nPassing a bill that has already been passed by the House gets basically \nput in limbo until we go to conference.\n  The Democratic leader has been very clear about not moving this bill \nto conference. So let's be perfectly clear, we are absolutely ready--in \nfact, I will offer a unanimous consent. We are absolutely ready to give \nvotes on issues of importance to the Democrats and, as I said before, \nwe are willing to pay a ransom. But we want to make sure we get our \nvictims back, and the victims in this case are the welfare reform bill \nand FSC/ETI.\n  We want to make sure they have a chance of becoming law, not put in \nthe bin of bills that have yet to go to conference because of some \nconcern about fairness in conferences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate \nproceed to back-to-back votes, first, in relation to a public minimum \nwage amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Boxer \namendment with no second-degrees in order to either amendment; provided \nfurther that the bill be limited to germane amendments, and at 9:30 on \nFriday, April 2, the substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be \nread a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill with no intervening action. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendments, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  I will explain what I have requested, and that is that we give a vote \nup or\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\ndown, which has not been allowed on a whole host of judges on this \nside, on the issue the Democrats say is the important issue of the day, \nin exchange for all the germane amendments the Democrats would like to \noffer between now and tomorrow morning. And if they would like a little \nbit more time tomorrow, we would be happy to do that, but passage and \nconference, that is what this request asks.\n  Historically in the Senate, when we passed a bill we automatically \nwent to conference. That has changed. So now we have to specifically \ninclude to do so in the unanimous consent or we do not get to \nconference.\n  I ask unanimous consent according to what I just read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I simply say that on 21 occasions now when we have \ncompleted our work on a bill, we have done what is actually the normal \nprocess. We have--\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am reserving the right to object, and I assume I have \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor. \nThere is no right to reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am happy to let the Senator from South \nDakota talk on his time since my time is limited. If he would not mind \ntaking his time, he could reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I simply reserve the right to object and \nask consent that the bill be sent to the House once it has been \ncompleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object to that modification because \nwhat the Senator from South Dakota has just said is, no, I will not let \nthe bill go to conference. That is what sending the bill back to the \nHouse means, which means, no; no conference.\n  As we all understand, without conference we do not get closure. \nWithout closure, we do not get a bill and we do not help millions of \nAmericans get out of poverty. What we are playing is politics.\n  I commend to my colleagues a Brookings Institution Policy Brief of \nSeptember 2003 ``Welfare Reform & Beyond #28.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have several articles \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Post, Apr. 14, 2003]\n\n    Welfare Reform Works, Yet Pols Seek Rollback in N.Y.C. and U.S.\n\n                           (By June O'Neill)\n\n        Politicians and experts from the left and the right \n     acknowledge that welfare reform has succeeded beyond the most \n     optimistic expectations. Yet the reforms are nonetheless \n     under political siege: Reauthorization of the major welfare-\n     reform law is now nearly a year overdue and seems mired in \n     Capitol Hill politics. And last week the City Council gutted \n     the welfare-to-work policies that made New York City one of \n     the brightest examples of reform's success.\n        One can only hope that Congress will listen to the message \n     of a large body of research that the council totally \n     disregarded--and pass a bill that retains the emphasis on \n     work that has served us so well.\n        In 1995 and '96, many in the policy community predicted \n     disaster--children crushed by poverty and neglect--if work-\n     oriented reform were approved. Instead, as documented in the \n     recent Manhattan Institute report I wrote with Anne Hill, the \n     poverty rate for single mothers, the major group affected by \n     welfare reform, has fallen by a record amount, from 40 \n     percent to 32 percent between reform's passage in 1996 and \n     2001.\n        Underlying this drop in poverty was a dramatic rise in the \n     employment of single mothers and an earnings gain large \n     enough to more than offset the decline in welfare benefits: \n     Single mothers saw their incomes rise by more than 20 percent \n     over the same period.\n        As to the children, a recent study by Northwestern \n     University's Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and others found that \n     mothers' transitions off welfare and into employment were not \n     associated with negative outcomes for their preschool or \n     young adolescent children.\n        New York City was perhaps the ultimate testing ground for \n     reform. In 1996, prior to passage of the reform law, 10 \n     percent of the city's population was receiving welfare \n     benefits, compared to only 3 percent in the rest of the state \n     and 5 percent nationwide. Moreover, that number had \n     fluctuated little in decades. But by December 2002, the city \n     welfare rolls had dropped 55 percent, even including those \n     getting state and city rather than federal aid. And the \n     number of recipients continued to fall despite the painful \n     2001-2002 recession.\n        What happened to the people who left welfare? A 1997 \n     Columbia University study predicted that 500,000 single \n     mothers would be forced into poverty within five years. That \n     prediction proved totally wrong: The poverty rate among the \n     city's single mothers fell by more than a fifth, from 52 \n     percent to 40 percent. Far from ending up helpless and in \n     deprivation, single mothers moved into the workplace in \n     record numbers.\n        Some have tried to explain away these positive \n     developments by claiming that they were caused by the 1990s \n     economic boom. That explanation fails under scrutiny. In our \n     Manhattan Institute report, we find that welfare reform can \n     account for more than 40 percent of the rise in single-mother \n     employment between 1996 and 2001; the boom was responsible \n     for less than 10 percent.\n        Of course, it is always difficult to separate out \n     statistically the net effects of different variables when \n     both are changing. However, our formal statistical analysis \n     is bolstered by historical observations which clearly show \n     that both the welfare and work participation of single \n     mothers in the pre-reform period was only weakly responsive \n     to the ups and downs of the business cycle. This explains why \n     welfare rolls have not risen much during the recent recession \n     and in many places have continued to decline.\n        In other words, single mothers didn't leave welfare for \n     work because a good economy pulled them in. They left because \n     welfare reform changed the incentives single mothers face, \n     making work a much better option for them in the short and \n     long-terms.\n        Before reform, welfare was a long-term entitlement to a \n     guaranteed income--cash, food stamps and medical benefits, \n     and often subsidized housing, too. This income was a limited \n     one, but it was given without any work requirement. So a \n     woman on welfare, particularly one with school-age children, \n     also gained something everyone values--lots of time to spend \n     on activities of her choosing.\n        Welfare reform changed all that. Strict work requirements \n     sharply curtailed discretionary time. The five-year time \n     limit meant that long-term welfare support was no longer an \n     option. Faced with a dramatic shift in incentives, some women \n     who would have gone on welfare did not do so, while many on \n     welfare chose to leave welfare much sooner than they would \n     have.\n        The commitment to join the workforce has given single \n     mothers the impetus to gain the skills and experience \n     essential to improving their lives. Indeed, my recent \n     research shows that women did better economically the longer \n     they stayed off welfare and in the workforce. Poverty rates \n     dropped 50 percent for women who did these things for four \n     years.\n        Why? Each year in the workforce brings additional money--\n     their hourly pay rose about 2 percent (after inflation) per \n     year worked, 3 percent if they stayed with one employer for \n     that time--enabling many to raise themselves out of poverty.\n        Welfare reform succeeded because it made going to work \n     more attractive than going on welfare. Reauthorization of \n     reform is being held up and threatened by the failure of many \n     in Congress to recognize this point.\n        Some would tie reauthorization to an increase in the \n     ability of single mothers to substitute education and \n     training programs for work experience. Such proposals sound \n     good--and typically were the centerpiece of the failed \n     welfare initiatives of the past--but they fly in the face of \n     what we know about why welfare reform worked, in New York \n     City and throughout the country.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                (From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 2004)\n\n                     There's More Welfare to Reform\n\n                        (By Douglas J. Basharov)\n\n       When the landmark 1996 welfare reform law came up for \n     reauthorization in 2002, easy approval was expected. After \n     all, the legislation was popular, it had originally passed \n     with significant bipartisan support and, well, it was \n     working, with the number of people on welfare down an \n     astonishing 60 percent since states started putting reforms \n     in place.\n       But instead of sailing through Congress, the \n     reauthorization effort became trapped in a political tug of \n     war between Republicans (who wanted tougher work requirements \n     added to the law) and Democrats (who wanted increased federal \n     money for child care). Instead of reauthorizing the law, \n     Congress has simply extended it several times, and now it \n     looks as if there will be yet another extension. That's a \n     shame--because the legislation needs to be updated now.\n       Despite the law's success in getting people to join the \n     work force, roughly two million families remain on welfare, \n     many headed by single mothers who are unable to get--or \n     keep--a job because of limited education and skills.\n       The Bush administration's reauthorization proposal focused \n     on these mothers. Because few states had made a concerted \n     effort to move them into programs that build specific job \n     skills, the administration called for states to adopt tougher \n     work and training requirements. Under the proposal, states \n     would have to put 70 percent of their adult recipients in \n     these designated activities for 40 hours a week.\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\n       The administration's proposal was not quite as tough as it \n     seemed. It had a number of participation exemptions. What's \n     more, as the bill moved through the legislative process, it \n     was watered down in order to win support from moderates on \n     both sides of the aisle.\n       But the administration was reluctant to broadcast the \n     legislation's softer side--doing so might undermine its pro-\n     work rhetoric. That silence played into the hands of \n     Democrats. If the Republicans wanted welfare mothers to work \n     more, they argued, there should be a parallel increase in \n     child care financing.\n       The Democrats had a point. But their demand for as much as \n     $10 billion in additional child care aid went far beyond the \n     needs of welfare families. It would have covered families \n     that had never been on welfare--and were in no danger of \n     needing it. Over time, the Democrats lowered their demands; \n     at this point, they would probably settle for about $6 \n     billion over five years, which is still more than what is \n     needed to carry out the administration's plan.\n       For the past two years, the administration has rejected \n     such large spending increases and, given the criticism \n     President Bush is receiving for the growing federal deficit, \n     it seems unlikely that he will give the Democrats what they \n     want. The Democrats' position likewise seems to be hardening. \n     They are now talking about waiting for a President John Kerry \n     to reauthorize welfare reform.\n       The stalemate is doubly painful because there are clear \n     grounds for compromise. Republican modifications have \n     resulted in work requirements that, if clarified, would enjoy \n     wide support. Democrats know that reauthorizing the \n     legislation now will ensure that states get modest but still \n     substantial increases in child care money. Another year's \n     wait would keep the states at 2002 financing levels, \n     something that has so far cost them $400 million.\n       Further delay would also forestall desperately needed \n     changes to the legislation. States have to be encouraged to \n     address the needs of the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients \n     by toughening participation requirements. Judging by the \n     experience of the states that have had the most success \n     moving these mothers into employment, we should require 50 \n     percent of a state's welfare recipients to spend 24 hours a \n     week in required activities--perhaps 32 hours a week for \n     mothers with no children under the age of 6. States should be \n     given greater flexibility in how they reach this level, so \n     long as at least 10 percent of their welfare recipients are \n     in mandatory community service or on-the-job training \n     programs. (A separate exemption of up to 15 percent would be \n     needed for the disabled.)\n       To cover additional child care and administrative costs, a \n     formula should be established that ties payments to the \n     states to increases in participation. The question of whether \n     there should be more federal aid for child care should be \n     reviewed on its own merits, not under the guise of welfare \n     reform.\n       This kind of bipartisan compromise is never easy in an \n     election season. But two million American families are still \n     trapped on welfare. Can we really afford to wait another \n     year?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                (From the Washington Post, Aug. 5, 2003)\n\n                        Work: The Key to Welfare\n\n                   (By Brian Riedl and Robert Rector)\n\n       Should Congress make work requirements for welfare \n     recipients stricter? That's what would happen under a bill \n     the House of Representatives has passed. It would require \n     more recipients to work 40 hours a week instead of the \n     current 30 and stop vocational training from counting as \n     ``work.''\n       Bad idea, the critics say. They claim that education and \n     training programs lead to successful high-paying careers, \n     while putting welfare recipients to work immediately traps \n     them in low-paying, dead-end jobs.\n       Wrong.\n       Welfare recipients assigned to immediate work see their \n     earnings increase more than twice as fast over the following \n     five years as those first placed in education-based programs, \n     according to calculations we made using data from the \n     Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a New York-based \n     nonprofit group. In fact, most government-run job training \n     programs barely raise hourly wage rates at all, a report \n     commissioned by the U.S. Labor Department reveals.\n       If the goal of welfare reform is to raise earnings while \n     reducing dependency, then quickly moving welfare recipients \n     into real jobs is the answer. Prolonged classroom training \n     tends to be the dead end.\n       Before the 1996 welfare reforms, the Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children (AFDC) safety net was just that--a net not \n     only catching but also trapping nearly all who fell into it. \n     Welfare reform replaced AFDC with a program called Temporary \n     Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). This program was \n     designed not as a net but as a trampoline, springing families \n     back up to self-sufficiency by placing adults in permanent \n     jobs.\n       The undeniable success of this approach is demonstrated by \n     the more than 5 million people (including 3 million children) \n     who have risen out of poverty since the law was enacted. \n     After remaining static for nearly a quarter-century, the \n     poverty rate of black children has dropped by a third and is \n     now at the lowest point in U.S. history. The poverty rate for \n     single mothers has plummeted in a similar manner since 1996; \n     it, too, is at the lowest point in national history.\n       But welfare reform wasn't perfect. Today less than half of \n     TANF adult recipients are employed or preparing for \n     employment in any way. Most remain idle and continue to \n     collect welfare checks.\n       President Bush and his congressional allies want to \n     strengthen welfare reform by increasing the TANF work-\n     participation rate to 70 percent; opponents seem content \n     excluding millions of families from working or even preparing \n     to work. Yet those who would enact legislation that leaves \n     hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients in idle \n     dependence are clearly harming those they wish to help.\n       And those who believe welfare recipients are better served \n     by education and training programs are ignoring the skills \n     that would help these poor adults the most. A study conducted \n     by the Washington-based Urban Institute shows that employers \n     consider a positive attitude, reliability, work ethic and \n     punctuality the most important traits they look for when \n     hiring for entry-level positions. These traits can't be \n     taught in a classroom, or as part of a training program--they \n     are acquired through firsthand work experience. Not \n     surprisingly, the same employers consider job training the \n     least important qualification.\n       Unlike those stuck in a classroom or government-run job-\n     training office, individuals placed in immediate work gain \n     real-world experience mastering job duties. As they build \n     work records, more job options and higher earnings become \n     available. In the meantime, even minimum-wage parents can use \n     the earned income tax credit, food stamps, Medicaid, the \n     Child Care Development Fund and the school lunch program to \n     raise their total income to two-thirds above the federal \n     poverty line.\n       Some critics insist that all employable adults have already \n     left welfare, leaving only individuals with insurmountable \n     personal barriers to work. Not true. Urban Institute data \n     reveal the current welfare recipients are no less work-ready \n     than those who have left welfare. In fact, a substantial \n     number of them aren't classified as having any barriers to \n     work. And most of those with such barriers as a lack of \n     transportation, a slight disability or an inability to speak \n     English can, in fact, land jobs. But their chances of doing \n     so are much better if we insist on immediate work.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous request of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the pending motion to \ninvoke cloture. We are here today because the majority chooses not to \nallow a vote on a minimum wage. It is that simple.\n  That is wrong. It is wrong because the millions of hard-working \nAmericans making the minimum wage deserve a raise. It is wrong because \nthe Senators from California and Massachusetts also deserve to get a \nvote on their amendment. It is not right that a person who has a full-\ntime job at minimum wage still has to live in poverty, but that is \nwhere we are today in America.\n  For a family of three, let's say a mom and two kids, the gap between \nthe poverty line and the minimum wage is $3,681. That is right, a \nfamily would need $3,681 more just to get up to the poverty level, and \nthat is before taking into account the cost of child care, which is a \nbig factor, or the cost of gasoline for the car--we know how much \ngasoline prices are rising--or the cost of clothes for a job. Often a \nperson has to buy separate clothes for a job.\n  If we want people to be able to move off welfare and into work--and \nthat is what we want, people off welfare into work--we have to make \nsure the work they get pays enough so they can get off welfare and lift \nthem out of poverty. That is what we have to do, and that is why \nincreasing the minimum wage is so important.\n  Most people who are on welfare will say they want to get off welfare; \nthey do not like it; they hate it. That is what they tell me. I have \ntalked to a lot of people on welfare. One of the main reasons they will \nsay it is so difficult to get off welfare is because the job that pays \nat minimum wage does not pay enough for them to get by. I have heard \nthat countless times. They are working full time but they cannot make \nends meet. We need to raise the minimum wage to help people get off \nwelfare.\n  The vote today is also about another point. The Senators from \nCalifornia and Massachusetts deserve at least to have a vote on their \namendment. They are willing to enter into a short time agreement. They \nare not delaying. They say, sure, let's have a vote on\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\ntheir amendment, with a short time agreement. They are not delaying. It \nis the other side which is preventing them from having a vote.\n  We on this side of the aisle do not wish to delay this bill. We are \nwilling to work to get a finite list of amendments. We are willing to \nenter into a time agreement on amendments. We are not asking for \nanything out of the ordinary.\n  I remind my colleagues that during the 13-day period for which the \nSenate considered the basic bill, the 1995 welfare bill, September 7 to \nSeptember 19 of 1995, the Senate conducted 43 rollcall votes on \namendments. So far this year we have conducted one, and yet there is a \ncloture motion to try to stop debate. That is not the way to legislate. \nWe are not asking for anything out of the ordinary. We merely ask that \nSenators be able to offer amendments and get votes on their amendments.\n  We have time agreements, we have lists, and so forth. That is what \nthis debate is about. I urge my colleagues to uphold the rights of \nSenators. I urge Senators to vote to increase the minimum wage. I urge \nSenators to oppose cloture.\n\n  How much time does each side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I reiterate that we are perfectly \nwilling to give up-or-down votes for a chance to pass this bill. I have \nasked unanimous consent and the other side has said no.\n  I have heard so much about everyone having a right to get up-or-down \nvotes. We have had a debate on the floor of the Senate for a year and a \nhalf about up-or-down votes on Federal judges. So maybe we can exchange \nup-or-down votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have an up-or-down vote on the Boxer-\nKennedy amendment, followed by a vote on a McConnell relevant amendment \ndealing with minimum wage, in exchange for a vote on Calendar No. 169, \nCarolyn Kuhl, of California, to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, and Calendar No. 455, Janice Rogers Brown to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So we understand up-or-down votes only apply to their \namendments and the things they want to do, not what Republicans want to \ndo.\n  We need closure and we are not getting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Senator Byrd's 17,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would inform my colleagues that with \nthis vote we will witness history. Senator Byrd will have cast his \n17,000th vote. No Senator in all of history will have done that. I will \nhave more to say about that after the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n   The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n        We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 305, H.R. 4, an act to reauthorize \n     and improve the program of block grants to States for \n     temporary assistance for needy families, improve access to \n     quality child care, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \npending committee substitute amendment to H.R. 4, an act to reauthorize \nand improve the program of block grants to States for temporary \nassistance for needy families, improve access to quality childcare, and \nfor other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n   Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski) is necessarily absent.\n   Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n   I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD ON CASTING HIS 17,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to remark on \na truly historic moment that just took place about 15 seconds ago, a \nmoment we all witnessed which is special in United States history in a \nway we will shortly lay out.\n  Senator Robert Byrd is already recognized as an American icon. In \n1917, he began life as a virtual orphan. His mom passed away when he \nwas a year old. His aunt and uncle brought him to West Virginia to \nraise him on their own.\n  Hard working, enterprising, Robert Byrd made the most of every single \nopportunity along the way and rose to become the third longest serving \nMember of Congress in U.S. history.\n  Among his many distinctions, Senator Byrd has held more leadership \npositions in this body, the U.S. Senate, than any other Senator in \nAmerican history.\n  Over the course of eight consecutive terms, Senator Byrd has cast \nmore votes than any other Senator in the\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nhistory of the Republic. Today, just a couple minutes ago, Senator Byrd \ncast his 17,000th vote in this Chamber. I applaud Senator Byrd for his \ncommitment to public service. This vote is truly a milestone in his \ncareer and the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  Without question, when history is written, Senator Byrd will hold a \nprominent place as a Senate legend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader and all the \nMembers of our body in congratulating Senator Byrd on reaching this \nhistoric milestone. I thank him for his half century of service to the \nU.S. Congress. Seventeen thousand votes is an astonishing number. It is \neven more astonishing when you consider that Senator Byrd has now cast \n652 more votes than the first runner-up, Senator Thurmond. He has \nserved 2 years less than Senator Thurmond.\n  Here is another remarkable statistic: In the last 45 years in the \nSenate, Robert Byrd has voted on 98.72 percent of the questions put \nbefore this body. He has missed only about 1 percent of all votes cast \nover 45 years--the second highest percentage of all Senators who have \ncast 10,000 votes or more.\n  From July 25, 1984, through September 17, 1997--a period of more than \n13 years--Senator Byrd did not miss one single vote. He cast 4,705 \nconsecutive votes--the second highest consecutive vote total in Senate \nhistory. Of the 11,708 persons who have ever served in the U.S. \nCongress, only two have served longer than Robert C. Byrd. But what \nmakes Senator Byrd's vote totals and voting percentages even more \nremarkable are some of the other achievements Senator Byrd has recorded \nover these last 45 years.\n  He is the first person ever to start and finish a law degree while \nserving in Congress. It took him 10 years. He graduated from American \nUniversity Law School in 1963. President Kennedy was his commencement \nspeaker.\n  In 1994, he fulfilled a lifelong ambition. He finally received his \nbachelor's degree from Marshall University summa cum laude--the first \nperson in his family ever to go to college.\n  There are two reasons Senator Byrd has reached this historic 17,000-\nvote milestone. First, Robert C. Byrd believes, in his bones, if you \nhave a job to do, you do it. He is a coal miner's son who has worked \nhard all of his life. He got his first job when he was 7, selling the \nCincinnati Post. He has been a produce boy, a gas station attendant, a \nhead butcher, and the owner of a small grocery store. He is a man who \nbelieves in earning his pay, who knows how it feels to fall asleep at \nnight exhausted but proud for having met his responsibilities for 1 \nmore day.\n  The other reason Senator Byrd has reached this milestone is because \nof his great love of West Virginia, of this Nation, and of the Senate.\n  Of course, the greatest love in Senator Byrd's life is his wife Erma. \nFor the last 3 years, Mrs. Byrd's delicate health, and Senator Byrd's \ndesire to be with her as much as possible, to support her, has made it \neven more difficult for Senator Byrd to answer every rollcall vote. Yet \nhe has continued to do so.\n  We are privileged to work with him.\n  On this historic occasion, we congratulate him. And we thank Robert \nand Erma Byrd for all they have given this Senate and our Nation.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 17,000 votes ago, I achieved a dream. I \nstood on the floor of the U.S. Senate and prepared to cast my first \nvote as a Senator from the Mountain State of West Virginia. Seventeen \nthousand votes later, I still feel much the same. It is a great \nhonor, a great privilege to serve the people in the Senate.\n\n  Ours is a glorious country. Its people are wise. They are brave. They \nare hard-working and fairminded.\n  Once it was possible for a poor young man with no important \nconnections, with no PR firm behind him, with no fundraising apparatus \nracing at full tilt, to simply go out to the people, carrying his \nfiddle and having a mind full of poetry, and on the strength of his \nenergy and his convictions, to be elected to the greatest deliberative \nbody the world has ever known.\n  That time is light-years away from today's reality. Too often now in \nAmerica it is the size of the pocketbook that elects public officials. \nI regret that change. It keeps people out of public service instead of \nwelcoming them into public service.\n  This Senate is the forum which exists to welcome and to protect the \nairing of all points of view. Both sides of the aisle need to work \ntogether to ensure that the Senate will stay true to its constitutional \npurpose. We swear an oath before God and man to support and defend this \nConstitution. Many times I have sworn that oath before God and man to \nsupport the Constitution of the United States.\n  I have had a good run in this wonderful institution. And like \nMajorian, who, when he became Emperor of the Roman Empire in 457 AD \nsaid, ``I still glory in the name of Senator.''\n  My patient and devoted wife Erma, with whom I will celebrate a 67-\nyearlong partnership 58 days from now, the Lord willing, deserves much \nof the credit for that good run. I also thank my talented staff for \ntheir tireless work and dedication.\n  No man is an island, and I have had the good fortune to have many \nsteadfast friends and supporters over the years. To the people of West \nVirginia, I owe my everlasting gratitude. They have expressed their \nfaith in me time and time again. I am proud to be their Senator, and I \nhope to continue to serve for a long while.\n  I thank my colleagues. They have been patient. They have known my \nshortcomings. I have said things from time to time that I regretted. We \nare all human. But my colleagues have been considerate of me, and I \nthank them.\n  Pericles, the brilliant Athenian statesman, gave mankind one of the \ngreatest funeral orations ever made. This address was delivered in 431 \nBC as a memorial to the first Athenian soldier who fell in the \nPeloponnesian War. In this address, Pericles said:\n\n       It is greatness of soul alone that never grows old, nor is \n     it wealth that delights in the latter stage of life as some \n     give out, so much as honor.\n\n  And so it is honor itself that never grows old. I thank my colleagues \nfor the honor they show today.\n  Finally, but most of all from Chronicles, 29th chapter, verses 11 and \n12:\n\n       Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the \n     glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in \n     the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, \n     O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.\n       Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over \n     all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand \n     it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.\n\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia honors us \nall with that last statement he made.\n  Over the years I have been here, it has been my privilege to travel \nwith the Senator from West Virginia to many events. I want to recall \none for the Senate that I am sure the Senator will remember.\n  We were in West Virginia with the British American Parliamentary \nConference. One of our guests from Britain made the mistake of saying \nit was too bad that their American cousins did not know anything about \nBritish history.\n  My colleague was the host that evening. And making a closing \nstatement for that dinner, Senator Byrd decided to show our British \ncousins his wealth of knowledge about the history of Britain and \nproceeded to name every monarch, every spouse, every person who had a \npersonal relationship with every monarch, and a complete history of the \nmonarchy of Great Britain.\n  Needless to say, when he finished, which was quite a few minutes \nlater, the British stood and applauded politely, and we have never \nheard such a comment again from our British cousins. There have been \nmany other occasions we have had together.\n\n  I wanted to say that one of the great joys of serving in the Senate \nis my being able to get to know my friend from West Virginia. We have \nhad our disagreements, but that is natural because this aisle separates \nus once in a while. But nothing has separated Robert Byrd from each \nSenator in the Senate. He has been the most agreeable Senator, on a \npersonal basis, that I have known in the Senate. I think every Senator \nwill say the same thing.\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nHe always has a smile. He always increases that smile if we remember to \nask about Erma.\n  Mr. President, I join in the applause, but I think the Senate itself \nhas been honored today to witness this historic mark in his career.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to say that last night I had the \npleasure of going to the Smithsonian Institution and meeting members of \nthe Baseball Hall of Fame. There were people there who were, to me--as \na young boy, I wanted to be a baseball player and always listened to \nthe game of the day. There were people there, including Gaylord Perry, \nDave Winfield, Joe Morgan, Sandy Koufax, Stan Musial.\n  I have to say to my friend from West Virginia, as great an experience \nas that was for me visiting with those great athletes of yesteryear, \nthat pales in comparison to the experiences I have had while serving \nwith the ``Babe Ruth'' of the U.S. Senate.\n  When I was elected to this leadership job, Senator Byrd supported me. \nI wrote him a letter--and I am confident he remembers that like he does \neverything else--and I said I believed he was the Babe Ruth of the U.S. \nSenate. When I say that, he is a member of the hall of fame, of course, \nbut the Babe Ruth in the Baseball Hall of Fame stands above all the \nrest. In the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd stands above all of us. I have \na degree in history and I know something about it. I know we have great \nSenators here, but I have had the opportunity to serve with the \ngreatest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to add my voice \nto those who praise Senator Robert C. Byrd. I think what every public \nservant deserves, and occasionally gets, is a recognition that his or \nher service is in fact profoundly appreciated. That is usually not the \ncase. The American people are not as aware of what goes on in these \nHalls, or even in their own legislative halls, as they ought to be.\n  But I take special happiness out of this day for Senator Byrd because \nhe has accomplished something that nobody else has with his 17,000th \nvote. He rose to cast his vote, as he always does. When somebody comes \nto greet him, argue with him, plead with him, and he is at his seat, he \nalways rises, be that a man or a woman. He has brought, in my judgment, \nnot only a tautness to the debates that we have in this Chamber, not \nalways agreeing with the majority or with the minority, but he knows \nhis mind and he knows his soul, and he knows his God. He does not \ndeviate from that and he cares not who appreciates that or who doesn't.\n  In other words, Senator Byrd is a man who, over the years, through \nthe crucible of tough experiences and steadfast devotion not only to \nhis God but also to the great figure who is not here today, who is so \nmuch part of his life and who brings out even in saying her name a \ngreat emotion in me, and that is his absolutely wonderful, wonderful \nwife Erma, honors us by his service.\n  I was with him earlier this morning as he was talking to \nschoolteachers from all over the United States who are trying to get \ntheir students to write better. It is called the ``writers project,'' \nwhich he has been instrumental in doing. He talked to them of public \nservice and the need for accuracy and being fair. What he was really \nsaying is that doing something in your life which is not only important \nbut which you give yourself to profoundly, completely, an utter \ndevotion to duty, is what separates the great and the near great.\n  I am very proud to serve with Senator Byrd. We have served together \nfor 20 years now and have known each other for close to 40 years. Our \nwives are good friends; we are good friends. I sit behind him in the \nseat that Senator Moynihan used to occupy. I enjoy seeing people coming \nup to him and making their case, which talks not only of his courtesy, \nbecause he is so often on the floor, but also of his power to get \nthings done, which then makes me say that there is no possible way to \ndescribe, from the point of view of the Senators in my State of West \nVirginia, what he has meant, does mean, and will mean for that State.\n  West Virginia is a State that has always had to struggle. We have \nalways had to keep pushing the rock uphill, not daring to take one hand \noff for fear that the rock may roll back over the top of us. It takes a \ntough person and a moral person and a determined person to fight the \nbattles that are needed to be won for our people in West Virginia. That \ncomes to Senator Byrd instinctively.\n  I am so proud of this day because I cannot help but feel that when \nSenator Byrd goes to bed tonight, he will have a strong and profound \nsense of satisfaction--not that he needs to feel that, but that will \nmake me feel better if he does feel that, because he serves our State \nand our Nation as few people have in the history of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I join with our colleagues and \njust tell Senator Byrd what a mentor he has been to the newer Members \nof the Senate. There are moments and experiences here that one never, \nnever will forget. I will never forget the first time, with somewhat \ntrembling knees, I rose to give my first speech. In the course of that \nspeech, I happened to mention it was my maiden speech in the Senate.\n  Of course, I was speaking to an empty Chamber, except for the \nPresiding Officer. All of a sudden, the doors swing open and in strides \nSenator Byrd. As I finished my remarks, Senator Byrd rose to his feet \nand said:\n\n       Will the Senator yield?\n\n  And then proceeded to give a history of the maiden speeches of the \nSenate. What a mark upon this junior Senator, what a pleasant memory \nthat he is such a great mentor to all of us. We thank him.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is entirely appropriate for the Senate \nto pause for a few moments to recognize not only the record of 17,000 \nvotes, but also the presence and continued service of a remarkable man \nwho happens to be the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Bob Byrd is our Lou Gehrig the iron man of the Senate. For me, Bob \nByrd personifies what our Founding Fathers were thinking about when \nthey were thinking about a United States Senate. He brings the kind of \nqualities that the Founding Fathers believed were so important for \nservice to the Nation.\n  When history records his remarkable service to the United State \nSenate, they will find there has been no one--no one--in this body who \nhas defended the Constitution of the United States more vigorously, \ntenaciously, and with a greater understanding, awareness, and belief in \nits words.\n  There has been no one in history that has better understood the \nimportance of the United States Senate and its role in our great \ndemocracy. Bob Byrd understands what our Founding Fathers intended, and \nbecause of his constant and persistent efforts, this institution is \nfiner and all of us are finer Senators.\n  Senator Byrd, we are grateful for your service and this country is \nappreciative and grateful for your defense of the Constitution and for \nyour service to this country. I am grateful to have you as a friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I add my voice as well to my seatmate, if I \nmay. I sit in this chair by choice. Senator Byrd sits in his chair by \nchoice as well, but he makes the choice before I do. I wanted to find \nout where he was going to sit so I could sit next to him. I did that \nbecause I wanted to sit next to the best, to learn everything I \npossibly could about the ability of this institution to provide the \nkind of leadership I think the country expects of us.\n  Several thoughts come to mind. This is a day of obvious significance \nin the number of votes that have been cast, 17,000, but it is far more \nimportant to talk about quality than quantity. Quantity is not an \ninsignificant achievement, but the quality of my colleague and friend's \nservice is what I think about when the name Robert C. Byrd comes to my \nmind.\n  I carry with me every single day, 7 days a week, a rather threadbare \ncopy of the United States Constitution given to me many years ago--I \ncan't even read it well now; it is so worn out--I may need a new copy--\ngiven to me by\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\nmy seatmate, Robert C. Byrd. I revere it. I tell people why I carry it \nbecause it reminds me of the incredible gift given to me by the people \nof Connecticut to serve in this Chamber, to remind me of the importance \nof an oath we all made, and that is to do everything we can to \npreserve, protect, and defend the principles upon which this Nation was \nfounded. Robert C. Byrd, in my mind, is the embodiment of that goal.\n  It has often been said that the man and the moment come together. I \ndo not think it is an exaggeration at all to say to my friend from West \nVirginia that he would have been a great Senator at any moment. Some \nwere right for the time. Robert C. Byrd, in my view, would have been \nright at any time. He would have been right at the founding of this \ncountry. He would have been in the leadership crafting this \nConstitution. He would have been right during the great conflict of \ncivil war in this Nation. He would have been right at the great moments \nof international threat we faced in the 20th century. I cannot think of \na single moment in this Nation's 220-plus year history where he would \nnot have been a valuable asset to this country. Certainly today that is \nnot any less true.\n  I join my colleagues in thanking the Senator from West Virginia for \nthe privilege of serving with him. He has now had to endure two members \nof my family as colleagues. Senator Byrd was elected to the Senate in \n1958 along with my father. He served with my father in the House. I \nhave now had the privilege of serving with Senator Byrd for 24 years, \ntwice the length of service of my father. That is an awful lot of time \nto put up with members of the Dodd family. We thank Senator Byrd for \nhis endurance through all of that time.\n  There is no one I admire more, there is no one to whom I listen more \nclosely and carefully when he speaks on any subject matter. I echo the \ncomments of my colleague from Massachusetts. If I had to pick out any \nparticular point of service for which I admire the Senator most, it is \nhis unyielding defense of the Constitution. All matters come and go. We \ncast votes on such a variety of issues, but Senator Byrd's \ndetermination to defend and protect this document which serves as our \nrudder as we sail through the most difficult of waters is something \nthat I admire beyond all else.\n  I join in this moment in saying: Thank you for your service, thank \nyou for your friendship, and I look forward to many more years of \nsitting next to you on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join with my more senior colleagues in \npaying my respects and tribute to the great Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd. It is a mark of his greatness that he has had such a powerful \neffect on not only the most senior of his colleagues who have been here \nthe longest, but also the more junior Members of the Senate, such as \nmyself.\n  When I arrived here in January 2001, just a little over 3 years ago, \nI was one of 12 freshman Senators from both sides of the aisle. We were \ngiven many words of encouragement from our colleagues, but basically \nleft to find our own way or flounder along the way. It was Senator Byrd \nwho took it upon himself to convene tutorials with the 12 of us. We \nconvened promptly at 4 o'clock in his office, and he shared with us his \nperspective on the Senate.\n  From the four volumes he has orated and published as the history of \nthe U.S. Senate, as well as the volume he orated from his own direct \nknowledge and reading about the Roman Senate, there is no one who \npossesses more wisdom and a broader understanding of the historical \nrole and the responsibility of this body and this great democracy and \nRepublic.\n  Those of us who had the benefit of those tutorials learned more from \nthose sessions about how to conduct ourselves in the Chamber where he \nhas served with such greatness than from anything else.\n  When the time came for us to preside, as we took the majority, I had \nthe opportunity, through many hours, to watch and listen to Senator \nByrd, particularly in the fall of 2002 when we were debating the \nresolution to give the President authority to make the final decision \non whether to commit this Nation to war in Iraq.\n  Senator Byrd was heroic in standing forth and taking a stand which I \nsupported because of the compelling wisdom of his words and the power \nand the eloquence to remind us that we had a constitutional \nresponsibility in this body which we were forsaking by abdicating that \nresponsibility to the President.\n  I believe Senator Byrd received over 20,000 phone calls from his \nfellow citizens around the country. Back in my State of Minnesota, I \nheard time and again from those who were so admiring of his courage and \nhis steadfastness as I was then, too. I learned more about the U.S. \nConstitution during that time than I had ever learned before in my \nlife, and I learned more about the proper role of the Senate than I \npossibly could have learned through years of experience, just by having \nthe benefit of serving with and listening to and learning from Senator \nRobert Byrd.\n  I am very proud to pay tribute to him today. He has been the most \ninfluential Member of this body in my development here, and I am \ngrateful beyond words for the privilege of serving with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I, too, rise to bring the attention of the \nSenate to a historic occasion. Those who are witnessing this debate may \nnot realize that they are seeing a moment in the history of the United \nStates of America that is not likely to be repeated.\n  Our colleague, the distinguished and senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert C. Byrd, has just cast his 17,000th vote in this body. \nI do not rise today to bring any embarrassment to my colleague. I am \nhonored to call him friend. I rise to congratulate and honor him, and \nto note the historical span of his service to our country.\n  On January 8, 1959, Senator Byrd cast his first vote in the Senate. \nFittingly, it was a vote on Senate procedure. He has since become a \nmaster of the rules of the Senate. When Senator Byrd rises and raises a \nparliamentary point, a hush falls over this Chamber, respectful of the \nfact that this man from West Virginia knows more about the procedure \nand rules of the Senate than any person.\n  On April 27, 1990, Senator Byrd cast his 12,134th vote earning him \nthe record for the greatest number of rollcall votes in Senate history.\n  On May 5, 1998, he became the first Senator in history to cast 15,000 \nvotes.\n  Let us put this in historic context. When Senator Byrd cast his first \nvote, Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were in the Chamber with \nhim and Richard Nixon was the Presiding Officer of the body. When he \ncast his first vote, Hawaii had not yet become a State and the United \nStates had not yet launched a man into space. When he cast his first \nvote, a state-of-the-art computer would have taken up half the space of \nthis Chamber and had roughly the same amount of computing power as \ntoday's Palm Pilot.\n\n  Senator Byrd has served with 11 Presidents--and I underline the word \n``with'' because Senator Byrd makes it clear that he has never served \nunder any President.\n  He brings to mind often the words of the Constitution which give \nequality to the branches of Government.\n  He has been a candidate for election. As he said, he stood before the \nbar of public opinion 11 different times, 8 times as a candidate for \nthe Senate and 3 times as a candidate for the House. And he has never \nlost.\n  Senator Byrd has served in the Senate as majority leader and held \nmore leadership positions in the Senate than any other Senator in the \nhistory of the United States. He has chaired the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, on which I am honored to serve, and currently serves as the \npanel's ranking member. He has earned his place as the unrivaled expert \non Senate rules and he has become perhaps the most popular political \nfigure in his home State of West Virginia. He was named ``West \nVirginian of the Century'' by the residents of his home State. What \ngreater honor could they give him.\n  As of this Friday, Senator Byrd will have served, if my calculation \nis correct, 18,716 days in Congress, 51 years, 3 months, and 2 days. Of \nthe 11,708 individuals who have served in Congress,\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nonly 2 have served longer: Carl Hayden of Arizona for 56 years and \nRepresentative Jamie Whitten of Mississippi for 53 years.\n  Senator Byrd will become the longest serving Member on June 11, 2006. \nHe has cast more rollcall votes than any other Senator in history. \nStrom Thurmond ranks No. 2 with 16,348 votes.\n  We are all privileged to have served in this body. Few Senators in \nthe history of this institution have had such a command of both the \nnature and nuance of Senate debate as Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, \nand few, if any, spanning the entire history of this body have had such \na reservoir of knowledge, from Roman and Greek history to the \ndeliberations of the Founding Fathers to hundreds, maybe even \nthousands, of poems which Senator Byrd has committed to memory.\n  Perhaps it is through his love of poetry that I have gained a deeper \nunderstanding of my colleague. President Kennedy once said:\n\n       When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him \n     of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's \n     concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of \n     his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses, for art \n     establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the \n     touchstone of our judgment.\n\n  That is a magnificent quote which pays tribute to a man who has \nintegrated poetry into his entire life. But if we were to end there \nwhen it comes to procedure and poetry, we would not tell the story of \nthis great man's service.\n  His is not just poetry when it comes to service in the Senate. It is \nalso powerful prose. It is not just his eloquence but his integrity. \nThose of us who serve with him know that during the most recent debate \non the invasion of Iraq, one voice in the Senate was heard above all \nothers. This man, after many years of service, has not forgotten his \nresponsibility to this Nation and the people he represents. He stood up \nand took controversial, difficult positions and did them with the kind \nof force and power which won friends for him far and wide.\n\n  I have told this story before but it bears repeating. When I went to \na Catholic parish in Chicago with my wife and we had come back from \ncommunion and were kneeling down, an elderly fellow walked up to me in \nthe midst of the Iraqi debate and leaned over and said, ``Stick with \nSenator Byrd.''\n  I came back to tell him that. His fans are far and wide, in Chicago, \nWest Virginia, and across the United States of America, because time \nand again he spoke the truth and did it in a way that touched the \nhearts of Americans far and wide.\n  He is an inspiration to all of us who have been honored to serve with \nhim. He brings to this body the kind of decorum, the kind of integrity, \nand the kind of commitment to which all of us aspire.\n  For all of his great and varied achievements, Senator Byrd shows his \ndedication and humiliation not by wielding his power like a club but by \nperforming the most basic requirement of a Senator more times than any \nother Senator in history. I wish to recognize and honor the senior \nSenator from West Virginia for the quality as well as for the quantity \nof his service. It is entirely fitting that this noted lover of history \ntoday makes history himself. My commendation and congratulations to \nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join so many of my colleagues \nand friends in paying tribute to the great Senator from West Virginia. \nAs my friend from Illinois indicated, we are praising and honoring him \ntoday not just for the number of votes he has cast but for the courage \nof his votes. It is one thing to cast 17,000 votes; it is another to \nlook at the quality and the integrity behind those votes.\n  So I join with my colleagues in saying thank you to Senator Byrd. I \nwas proud to join with Senator Byrd as he spoke out on the Iraq \nresolution and what our role in the Senate should be and is.\n  I went home, as did my colleagues, and over and over again people \nasked me did I know Senator Byrd; did I work with Senator Byrd; listen \nto what he is saying because he is speaking for all of us.\n  I also thank Senator Byrd for helping me as one of the 12 Members who \ncame in 2000. When we were in the majority, we had the opportunity to \npreside over the Senate, and I am very grateful for all I learned about \nthe Senate, about the process, about the importance of being dutiful in \nour responsibilities, and also about the important role we play in \ngoverning our country. I will forever be grateful to Senator Byrd for \nthe lessons that I have learned and continue to learn.\n  One of the most wonderful images I have of being in the Senate \nactually occurred during orientation when I was first elected and \ncoming here in December of 2000. I had the opportunity to invite my son \nto join me in the Old Senate Chamber where we heard from Senator Byrd, \nsome wonderful, eloquent words and stories from the early days in the \nSenate. It was captivating. It was inspirational. It was motivating. It \nwas a wonderful opportunity for me to share with my son, the new \nventure I was undertaking and the responsibilities I was undertaking as \na Senator from Michigan.\n  I thank the great Senator from West Virginia for his friendship, for \nhis courage, for his role in the Senate in helping us to understand our \nresponsibilities and our duties to the country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join with many colleagues who came to \nthe Senate Chamber today to express appreciation and recognition of \nSenator Robert Byrd as today he cast his 17,000th vote representing the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  I can hardly think of what more to say other than he has truly been \nan exemplary Member of this body and a pillar of this institution, \nsomeone we all respect. I only hope our votes can be cast as \nconscientiously as his have been all these many years. I join my \ncolleagues in congratulating him today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about our \ndistinguished and beloved colleague, Senator Byrd, whose friendship I \nhave treasured for many years--more than 20 years now. I seek and \nlisten to what he says, to be aware of the knowledge he possesses about \nso many things, and the memories he carries.\n  When I first arrived here, I met Senator Robert C. Byrd and extended \nmy wishes that we would have a chance to serve together--this is 20 \nyears ago; and 20 years is a long time, except when it is compared to \nmore than 40 years--and that he would continue to provide the kind of \nleadership and inspiration that he has for all of us for all these \nyears.\n  We wish him well. We want to see him continue to provide the example \nhe has shown all of us, with his dignity and intelligence and knowledge \nand awareness of the rules that govern this body of ours--as fractious \nas they have become in recent years. We always want to pay attention \nwhen Senator Byrd issues a view of the process that is developing, \nabout where we ought to be, about the courtesies we should extend to \none another.\n  I will never forget Senator Byrd, with his rage at one of the \nSenators who was addressing the President by his first name, saying: \nWhere is he? Where is Bill? Why isn't Bill here? Senator Byrd stood up, \nwith all his stature in front of him, saying: How dare you. How dare \nyou call our President Bill. In all the years I have served with \nRepublican Presidents, never, never would I dream of calling the \nPresident Ronald or George or otherwise.\n  With that little reminder, he brought us all back to a reasonable \nstate of dignity and comity that we need to be reminded about on many \noccasions.\n  Very few have the knowledge stored in our being that Senator Robert \nC. Byrd has.\n  Again, when I first arrived in the Senate, I had not been in \nGovernment before, so it was all very complicated and perplexing. But I \nwanted to spend some time with Senator Byrd, and he was courteous and \nhe did it. We sat in his office, talking about the background of our \nsociety and our country. He talked about the English Kings from the \nperiod somewhere maybe about the time of William the Conqueror, the \n11th century, and he talked\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nabout how long each succeeding monarch served, the year that person \ntook the office, and the year they left the office, what caused them to \nleave the office, who died, how they died, by assassination or \notherwise, from the 11th century on up to contemporary times. You will \nhear Senator Byrd often quote from the early days of Roman and Greek \ncivilization. It is remarkable.\n\n  I come out of the computer business. I think I can safely say that I \nhave never met a computer the equal of Robert C. Byrd, to have the \ndepth of knowledge that he has and to be able to call upon it at so \nmany times.\n  I will bet that in the 17,000 votes Robert C. Byrd cast, he knows \nmore about the votes he cast almost than any Senator who has been here \njust for 100 votes or 200 votes. He understood every one of them. He \nnever cast a vote without thought.\n  Each of us has had the experience, I am sure, of disagreeing, \nperhaps, with one another, even with a distinguished leader such as \nSenator Robert C. Byrd, and have him disagree with knowledge and with \nexperience and say: This is why I think you are wrong. You are my \nfriend, Frank, but I disagree with you on this, and I am going to vote \nthe other way.\n  It was always with respect and friendship that these exchanges took \nplace.\n  So we mark a historical moment. No one before has ever cast that many \nvotes. As a matter of fact, very few have cast a number of votes that \ncome anywhere close to the 17,000 mark. This is a record, as I think \nhas been said by others, that will stand probably forever. It took \nRobert C. Byrd some eight terms to acquire the voting record that he \nhas. When you know that person and you see the devotion and loyalty he \nbrings to his family--he and his wife will celebrate their 67th \nanniversary, I believe. That is quite a tribute in a period like we now \nsee in our country when the institution of marriage is not what it used \nto be. So we wish Mrs. Byrd, Erma Byrd, a return to better health--we \nknow she has been having some difficult times these last few years--and \nfor them to share many more good years together and for Robert C. Byrd \nto stand here as our example of what can be, as an example for children \nacross this country.\n  If they read the history of Robert C. Byrd, they will see his growth \nfrom a poverty stricken, uneducated, simple family, to go on as he did \nto reach the level of responsibility, of importance that he achieved, \nand the contributions he made to country in so many ways, reminding us \nabout our responsibility to avoid conflict wherever we can do it, but \nalways sticking up for his State and constituents who sent him here.\n  I think I hold a voting record also. I think I am the only Senator on \nthe books that ever, as a freshman, cast almost 7,000 votes. That, I \nthink, is fairly remarkable. You have to discount the first 18 years I \nwas here, but a freshman with 7,000 votes, it doesn't compare to \nSenator Byrd's record, no matter what.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to salute my senior \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. Today, the Senator \npassed a milestone that has never been passed before, and may never be \npassed again: he cast his 17,000th vote on the Senate floor. It's an \namazing achievement. No other sitting Senator has cast more than 15,000 \nvotes. Senator Thurmond, who is no longer with us, cast the next \nhighest total of 16,348 votes.\n  Mr. President, Senator Byrd has had a long and distinguished career \nin the United States Senate. He was first elected to this body in 1958. \nOnly Senator Thurmond served longer, but Senator Byrd may soon pass \nthat record, too--he's only got two more years to go. He became the \nDemocratic Leader in 1977, holding that position for six consecutive 2-\nyear terms, three terms as majority leader, and three as minority \nleader. He also served as President pro tempore--third in line in the \norder of succession to the Presidency, after the Vice President and the \nSpeaker of the House--from 1989 to 1995 and 2001 to 2003.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is also a master historian. His four-\nvolume, 3,000 page history of the U.S. Senate has been called ``the \nmost ambitious study of the U.S. Senate in all of our history.'' He is \na passionate advocate for understanding our history, not only among \nSenators, but for the entire country. In 2000, the Senator's efforts \nled to the creation of the Teaching American History Grant Program--\ncommonly referred to as the Byrd grants--to encourage better teaching \nof American history in our schools. I was fortunate to follow his lead \nwith a bill I introduced last year, the American History and Civics \nEducation Act, which Senator Byrd co-sponsored. The Senate passed it \nunanimously last year, 91 to 0. I hope the House will act on it soon. \nI'm sure one reason the Senate was prepared to support such a bill is \nthat we have all learned the value of our history from one of history's \ngreat teachers: Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  I salute my colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, and \nwish him well as he sets a new record with each succeeding vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in \ncongratulating my friend and colleague, my neighbor from West Virginia, \nfor his great accomplishment today but, more importantly, for his great \nservice in the Senate.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I did what many of my colleagues \nhave done, and that is I paid a visit to my colleague from West \nVirginia. I went into his historic office. He was kind enough to give \nme the books he has written about the Senate and was kind enough to \nautograph his books. Those books will always be a great treasure for me \nto keep.\n  But they have not just been something that has been in my bookcase; \nthey are something I can pull down to then read the history of the \nSenate. What wonderful books they are, what wonderful references, what \nwonderful stories they tell about the Senate. That is so because my \ncolleague is not only a great Senator, he is a great historian. We are \nreminded of that many times when he comes to the Senate floor. Not only \ndoes he have a great institutional memory from his many years of the \nSenate, but because of his reading not only about the United States and \nthe U.S. Senate, but because of his great love of history, he can put \nwhat we do in the United States in its historical perspective.\n  As the new Members of the Senate, we take turns presiding over the \nSenate. One of the great benefits of doing that is to sit in the \nPresiding Officer's chair, as my colleague is doing now, and we have \nthe opportunity to listen to our colleagues. I have had the \nopportunity, many times, to listen to Senator Byrd.\n  I can remember many times listening to his speeches. Sometimes it was \nhis great annual speech on Mother's Day, sometimes a speech on the U.S. \nConstitution, or a speech on whatever legislation is in front of us, or \nabout the history of the Roman Senate or, as my colleague from Illinois \nhas said, a speech about a pending resolution. It didn't matter what it \nwas, it was always something for us to think about, always something \nfor us to ponder and meditate on.\n  Senator Byrd, thank you for your service and thank you for causing us \nto think. Whether we agree with you or not on every matter, you always \nmake us think. That is the job of the Senate. As you referred a moment \nago to this great deliberative body, you make sure that we are that, \nyou make sure we continue to be that great deliberative body. I thank \nyou for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield quite briefly?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Certainly, I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take a moment to thank my colleagues who \nhave spoken. They have been so gracious. I shall never, never forget \nthe beautiful words, the lovely phrases they have uttered here today. \nThey have made this a very beautiful day. I know that my wife Erma has \nlistened from home.\n  I thank each and all of these wonderful, wonderful friends. That is \nwhat they are, they are friends. I shall never forget them. I shall not \nname them. The Record already has done that.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend from Ohio for his graciousness \nin yielding.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n  Mr. DeWine. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine pertaining to the introduction of S. 2270 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3544-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3544-S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EVERYONE ACT--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                         National Public Radio\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week I took the floor of the Senate \nto note the decision which has been made by National Public Radio \nconcerning the host of Morning Edition with Bob Edwards. It was \nannounced in the Washington Post that National Public Radio management \nhad decided after some 24 years to relieve Mr. Edwards of his \nresponsibility as host of the morning show. There was not much given by \nway of explanation, and it was clear from comments by Bob Edwards that \nit wasn't his decision.\n  It has been interesting since I took the floor and noted my \ndisappointment over that decision the response which I received from my \ncolleagues in Congress. It turns out Members of Congress on both sides \nof the aisle feel as I do--that this decision by National Public Radio \nis the wrong decision; that Bob Edwards, who has been not only a host \nof this program but the most successful morning voice in America, is \nbeing moved away from this assignment in a situation and in a \ncircumstance that is almost impossible to understand.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to me and asked, What can we do? Can \nwe go after the appropriations of NPR? I don't recommend that at all. I \nthink National Public Radio is such an important institution more than \nany single individual that we should do this in a positive and \nconstructive fashion.\n  What I encourage my colleagues to do is to remember that National \nPublic Radio is, in fact, public radio; that all of us who enjoy it so \nmuch, who rely on it so much, and who contribute to it from our own \nindividual finances, have a responsibility if we disagree with this \ndecision by the management. I have encouraged my friends and those who \nfeel as I do to get onto their Internet and e-mail, and to e-mail \nNPR.org, to do it immediately and let them know that their decision to \nremove Bob Edwards at the end of this month of April is the wrong \ndecision. I have done it myself.\n  I have received a reply from Mr. Kernis which, frankly, I find very \ntroubling. When asked why they think this man who has become such an \ninstitution in America should be removed, the response is nothing short \nof gobbledygook. They talk about bringing someone who has depth and \nexperience. But who else would you turn to rather than Bob Edwards?\n  I would like to make part of the Record at the end of my statement a \nseries of columns and editorials from across the United States from \nthose who enjoy Bob Edwards in the morning and can't imagine public \nradio without him. Some of these, starting with the Chicago Tribune, \nwere published recently as the news reached that city of the decision \nby National Public Radio.\n  As they said in this editorial in the Chicago Tribune, people do not \nunderstand why this decision was made. Here is what they concluded in \nthe Tribune editorial about Bob Edwards:\n\n       In contrast to their audience, though, NPR executives seem \n     to have forgotten about the public part of their title. In \n     commercial broadcasting, a beloved host who had presided over \n     huge ratings gains would almost never be nudged aside. Public \n     broadcasting is valuable precisely because it is relatively \n     free from such worldly concerns. But it is also, effectively, \n     a public trust, and for the public to continue to trust it, \n     this institution needs to do a better job of explaining its \n     momentous decisions. This is not the only newspaper, by far.\n\n  In the St. Louis area, Linda Ellerbee, known to many of us because of \nher news reporting and posting of programs wrote: ``Time and Age: NPR \nTossing Out Bob Edwards.'' Linda Ellerbee should know. She was moved \naway from a television network position because they thought for a \nwoman she was too old. She says:\n\n       But we're not aging the way our parents did. We're \n     reinventing the process. Besides, there are a lot of us out \n     here.\n\n  The point she made in her article about Bob Edwards is at his \nadvanced age of 56--which I still consider very young--he speaks not \nonly to people of my generation but so many older and younger. If it is \nthe marketing belief of NPR they need to have a new, fresh voice, they \nare missing the big picture.\n  For 24 years every morning when my clock radio goes on, I hear Bob \nEdwards. I know whether times are bad, dangerous, or peaceful. I can \ncount on him. I have done it this morning. I have done it so many \nmornings. I cannot imagine ``Morning Edition'' without him.\n  There is also a comment from the Washington Post, Richard Cohen. He \ntells about the same experience.\n\n       Now the news from NPR is that Edwards will soon be gone.\n\n  He talked about the fact he may just decide to start listening to \nMozart on disk, rather than turning on ``Morning Edition.'' He says:\n\n       NPR Executive Vice President Ken Stern told the Washington \n     Post that the firing of Edwards was part of a ``natural \n     evolution,'' that had ``to do with the changing needs of our \n     listeners.'' What ``natural evolution''? What does that mean? \n     And what is ``changing needs''?\n\n  Mr. Cohen goes on to say to the Washington Post:\n\n       Listen, Ken, my needs haven't changed. I still want news in \n     the morning. I still want smart features. I do not want \n     interviews with airheaded celebrities a la Matt and Katie or, \n     worse, interviews with the latest humorousless person Donald \n     Trump has just fired from ``The Apprentice.''\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       But the firing-cum-transfer of Edwards (he may become a \n     senior correspondent) is nonetheless disquieting. Maybe my \n     fear is misplaced and maybe the end of the Edwards era will \n     turn out not to be a bad thing. Still, it will be jarring to \n     wake up in the morning with a stranger.\n\n  He closes by saying:\n\n       Goodbye, Bob. Get some sleep. You've earned it.\n\n  Mr. Cohen may have given up, but I haven't. I still believe the \npeople across America should be contacting National Public Radio, \nnpr.org. Send them your e-mail that Bob Edwards, ``Morning Edition'' is \nimportant to you. As a Senator, as a citizen, he is important to me.\n  The San Diego Union-Tribune in an editorial entitled ``NPR Show Is a \nBig Hit, So It Must Need Fixing?'' by Robert Laurence:\n\n       This story makes no sense.\n       As such, it's the kind of story that can only happen in the \n     topsy-turvy Orwellian world of public broadcasting.\n       It's this: The host of a hugely successful morning radio \n     show, a show where ratings have done nothing but climb for \n     years, a man whose skill as an interviewer is unexcelled \n     in the world of broadcasting, whose very voice helps \n     millions of Americans get their day grounded, is being \n     evicted from a seat in the studio.\n\n  Mr. Laurence goes on to say:\n\n       That's Bob Edwards, since November 1979 the host of \n     National Public Radio's ``Morning Edition . . . ''\n\n  He goes on to talk about the explanations from NPR management, \nexplanations he and I both find wanting. And Scripps Howard, Bill \nMaxwell and the St. Petersburg Times, entitled ``A Morning Voice That \nWill Be Missed:''\n\n       All good things must come to an end.\n       And so it is with the ouster of Bob Edwards . . .\n       To say that Edwards is the end of an era is an \n     understatement.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Thanks in large part to ``Morning Edition,'' when I report \n     to the St. Petersburg Times editorial board each morning at \n     9:30, I know what's going on in the Nation and the rest of \n     the world.\n\n  Millions of us would say the same thing.\n  Columbus Dispatch, Tim Feran: ``Shame On NPR For Axing Edwards Before \nBig Date.''\n  The big date, of course, is the 25th anniversary on the air. I agree \nwith Mr. Feran.\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer: ``Not a Good Way To Start The Day,'' a \ntitle from Connie Schultz, a columnist. She writes:\n\n       The man I've been waking up with is leaving me.\n\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n\n  She talks about her disappointment and how hard it is to understand \nwhy NPR is making this decision.\n\n  Turning to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, Bill Radke, a columnist, \nwrites: ``Mornings Without NPR's Colonel Bob.''\n  He starts:\n\n       Bob Edwards has been canned, and there seem to be two types \n     of people in the world: The ones saying, ``You've ruined my \n     life, Bob's life, and the lives of everyone I know,'' and the \n     ones saying, ``Who is Bob Edwards?'' Those who did not listen \n     to Bob Edwards may now never know. Those who do, understand \n     full well.\n\n  The Hartford Courant, in Connecticut, by Jim Shea:\n\n       It's not often that you can use the words National Public \n     Radio and stupid in the same sentence but such an occasion \n     has arisen:\n       National Public Radio's decision to replace ``Morning \n     Edition'' host Bob Edwards is just plain stupid. What are you \n     bozos who run NPR thinking? You know, we've really got to do \n     something about the fabulous ratings we have.\n       Bob Edwards is not just the bright, witty, urbane, \n     insightful and immensely likable host of ``Morning Edition,'' \n     he is for the program's 13 million weekly listeners the voice \n     of the morning.\n       There is something soothing, something comforting, \n     something reassuring about stumbling from slumber into the \n     gentle embrace of Edwards' mellifluous baritone that makes \n     morning bearable.\n\n  He speaks for many people when he writes that.\n  Finally, on salon.com, Alexandra Marshall makes many of the same \npoints about the importance of Bob Edwards' ``Morning Edition.''\n  Those who are following this debate may be puzzled as to why a \nSenator would stand up in this Chamber to make an issue over the \nreplacement of a man who is, by all measures, just another voice in the \nmorning. But Bob Edwards is not another voice in the morning. He is the \nvoice we have counted on and the voice we rely on.\n  If he is as important to you as he is to so many of us, please, \nunderstand National Public Radio exists because of people like us who \nlisten to it and contribute to it out of our own pockets, love it, and \nwant it to continue to be the great institution which it is today. \nThose who are shareholders of National Public Radio by virtue of our \ncontributions, if we disagree with this decision, have an obligation to \ntell the management right now.\n  I encourage those who feel as I do that the replacement of Bob \nEdwards is wrong, to do two things: First, go to your Internet, e-mail \nnpr.org and let them know what you think; and second, call your local \naffiliate of the National Public Radio system and let them know this is \na sad and sorry decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n327 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                        Recent Violence in Iraq\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to \nexpress my outrage and the outrage of Americans across this country in \nseeing the mutilation and the horrible attack on the Americans who were \nserving, not in the military but serving their country nevertheless, \nand the gleeful crowd gathered around.\n  We have to remember that it was a relatively small group of people. \nBut nevertheless, the deed was so horrendous that it is hard for those \nof us who live in a democratic environment, as we do, who live with the \nrespect that we have for other human beings, to look at this and in any \nway understand what is happening.\n  So we send our condolences to those families who lost someone they \ncared about, and to lose them in some kind of atrocious assault we hope \nwill serve as a reminder to all of us of what responsibility we took on \nwhen we entered Iraq and the things we should have tried to contemplate \nbefore we got to the point that we are.\n  One cannot criticize our military. I was in Iraq a couple weeks ago. \nMost of my colleagues have been there at one time or another to see the \ncourage and the willingness to serve that we have with our wonderful \nyoung people there. I talked to them. I especially met with those \nservice people who come from New Jersey, men and women. I was very \nimpressed with the quality of their thinking, their education, their \nview of life and country.\n  I served in World War II. We were some 14 million in uniform. I \nenlisted when I was 18. I remember the associations and friendships I \nmade in the small unit in which I served in Europe during the war. When \nI saw the young people who are serving us today, I was truly impressed \nwith the quality of those who wore that uniform.\n  We now see the situation in Iraq is a very grim one. I am not sure \nthat the turnover on July 1 to a ruling council, a governing counsel, \ncan stem the tide of violence or reduce the volume of our \nresponsibility. But I wish all of our people well and make a pledge \nhere that I would like to carry back the message that I got from my \nconversations with some soldiers there.\n  I asked them to be frank with me and tell me what, if anything, they \nthought they needed. And they were reluctant at first. I asked whether \nthe food was all right, the shelter was OK. Oh, yes.\n  But one young captain finally felt comfortable enough to speak. And \nhe said: Yes, I will tell you what we could use, Senator.\n  He said: The flack jacket that is the best available out there is \nbeing worn by members of the coalition in some places, and we don't \nhave those. They are lighter, they are more efficient, and I don't \nunderstand why we don't have them.\n  Fair enough. He said: You see this rifle?\n  I think it was an M-16, but they have changed considerably from the \ntime I carried a weapon in World War II.\n  He said: I see members of the coalition with lighter, better aiming \nmechanisms than we have on these guns. They are easier to work with at \nany time. We don't have them, and I don't understand why.\n  When he talked about armored vehicles, he said they don't have enough \nof them. I was almost dumbstruck. I didn't know what to say because I \nknow we have allocated lots and lots of funds. We have placed over $160 \nbillion into the effort in Iraq, and we are about ready to place a lot \nmore with a special allocation, a supplemental allotment. I asked our \nmilitary leadership to tell us what it is that prevents us from \ndelivering the kinds of tools, protections, and instruments that our \npeople need to conduct their duty there.\n  I saw something in the paper last week that said much of the material \nwe would like to have there is not sent because we don't have the \ntransportation available. I think we ought to get after that problem. I \npledge to do whatever I can to search out the reasons and make sure we \nexpedite the process of getting our courageous service people, who \nserve us so well, the equipment and the support that is needed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis leadership on this and so many issues. He expresses the feelings I \nhave heard from soldiers returning from Iraq who are in Walter Reed \nHospital recuperating, who are still strong in spirit and still \ndedicated to our country and hoping that we will help them win this \nbattle and let them come home safely. There is a lot more we can and \nshould do. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his leadership in \nthis area.\n\n\n                          Dietary Supplements\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been an issue I have worked on \nnow for almost 2 years relative to dietary supplements in America. We \npassed a law called the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act in \n1994. In passage of that legislation, we attempted to establish a \nstandard for the legal treatment and regulation of dietary supplements. \nThey are known to many Americans. It is a multibillion-dollar industry.\n  There are many of us who take vitamins and minerals and believe they \nare good for our health. I took one this morning. I hope it helps me. I \ndon't think it will hurt me. For a lot of Americans, it is something \nthey rely on.\n  There is another category that goes beyond ordinary vitamins and \nminerals, which are products known as dietary supplements. In many \nrespects,\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\nwhat they consist of are herbal extracts, so-called natural products \nthat are put in combination and sold in stores with many claims about \nwhether they can help you from a health viewpoint.\n  Most Americans who walk into a drugstore, pharmacy, or nutritional \nsupplement store believe the products on the shelf being sold to them \nare, in fact, safe. They may believe they have been tested. They may \nbelieve the proper clinical evaluation has been done. They may believe \nthe Government is monitoring whether there is something wrong with the \ndrug that causes a bad health event. Those beliefs are right and true \nand accurate, when it comes to prescription drugs. They have to go \nthrough extensive testing before they are ever put on the market. The \nFDA and many agencies look at them carefully to make certain they are \nboth safe and effective--in other words, that they will not harm you \nand, in fact, will do what they are supposed to do and help you. That \nhappens for prescription drugs, and it is what happens to the key \ningredients in over-the-counter drugs.\n  When you walk into a dietary supplement store, a health store, that \nis not the case at all. What you see on the shelves there are products \nwhich, by and large, have never, ever been tested. Never tested. The \nlaw we passed said the makers of those products, unlike the \npharmaceutical companies that make prescription drugs and some over-\nthe-counter drugs, have no responsibility to test their products for \nsafety before they are sold to the public. In fact, the burden is \nshifted 180 degrees. The Food and Drug Administration of the Government \nhas the burden to prove that what is sold on the shelf is unsafe.\n  Think about that for a moment. Think of the hundreds, thousands, tens \nof thousands or more dietary supplements for sale in the U.S., and you \ncome to the obvious conclusion that there is no Government agency large \nenough to test every possible combination that can be included in a \ndietary supplement. So the simple fact is very few are tested.\n  This week, Consumer Reports magazine reported on the issue of dietary \nsupplements. I think a lot of this magazine. I have subscribed to it \nover the years. I think what they present is done in a very \ndispassionate and objective fashion. In this issue, they identify the \nproblem we face in America with dietary supplements. They note the fact \nthat U.S. consumers, since passage of the law I mentioned earlier, have \nliterally spent billions of dollars on dietary supplements. They say it \nis interesting that for 10 years, although the FDA had the authority to \nremove an unsafe dietary supplement from the shelf, they never did. I \nwill quote:\n\n       Yet, until very recently, the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration had not managed to remove a single dietary \n     supplement from the market for safety reasons.\n       After seven years of trying, the agency announced a ban on \n     the weight-loss aid ephedra in December of 2003. And in March \n     2004 it warned 23 companies to stop marketing the body-\n     building supplement androstenedione (andro).\n\n  That is a steroid precursor. Here we have it on the books for 10 \nyears, with thousands of products that fall under its purview, and only \ntwo have been removed. Frankly, what it comes down to is described \nlater by Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in \nthe Public Interest, a Washington, DC, consumer advocate group:\n\n       The standards for demonstrating a supplement is hazardous \n     are so high that it can take the FDA years to build a case.\n\n  Years--while the product is still being sold. How many people at the \nFDA are responsible for monitoring dietary supplements, a multibillion-\ndollar industry, with thousands of products? Their supplement division \nconsists of about 60 people with a budget of only $10 million to police \na $19.4 billion-a-year industry.\n  Consumer Reports goes on to draw this comparison:\n\n       To regulate drugs, annual sales of which are 12 times the \n     amount of supplement sales, the FDA has almost 43 times as \n     much money and almost 48 times as many people.\n\n  So it is very clear this agency is not prepared and staffed and, \nfrankly, doesn't have the authority to protect the American consumer. \nSo what happens? People unsuspectingly go into these health food \nstores, vitamin stores, and see the dietary supplements with all sorts \nof claims on them; they buy them, they use them, and the consumers of \nAmerica become the guinea pigs.\n  We are the ones who are testing these products to see if they are \ndangerous. You might say, if they are dangerous, if they hurt someone, \nclearly then the Government will take them off the shelf, right? No, I \nam sorry, that is not right because understand that the law we passed \nat the request of the industry does not require dietary supplement \nmanufacturers to report to the Government when people are literally \ndying from the products they sell.\n  I am sure many people listening to this debate say that cannot be \ntrue. It is true.\n  Let me give a specific example. Metabolife International, a leading \nephedra manufacturer, did not let the Food and Drug Administration know \nit had received 14,684 complaints of adverse events associated with \nephedra products. But Metabolife 356, which you may remember, in the \nprevious 5 years had received notice of 18 heart attacks, 26 strokes, \n43 seizures, and 5 deaths. Under the law of the United States of \nAmerica, Metabolife had no legal responsibility to tell the Government \na product it was selling was killing people.\n  People listen to that and say that cannot be true, but it is. It is a \nfact.\n  When a Harris poll surveyed 1,000 Americans about what they thought \nthe law was, they found 59 percent of them said they believe \nsupplements must be approved by a Government agency before they can be \nsold. They went on to say 68 percent said the Government requires \nwarning labels on a supplement's potential side effects or dangers, and \n55 percent said supplement manufacturers cannot make safety claims \nwithout solid scientific support.\n  Sadly, every single response by the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans was plain wrong. There is no Government regulation of the \nproducts, there is no requirement for warning labels, and these \ncompanies can make safety claims without solid scientific support. That \nis a fact.\n  It seems the Institute of Medicine has decided it is time for a \nchange, a change I believe is long overdue. Today the Institute of \nMedicine released this report. It is a framework for evaluating the \nsafety of dietary supplements. In the fall of 2000, the Food and Drug \nAdministration contracted with the Institute of Medicine to develop a \nscientific framework for safety evaluation of dietary supplements \nwithin the confines of the law. They also asked them to test their \nframework on six commonly used dietary supplements. The report took \nmore than a year longer to complete than was expected, but it is \ncomprehensive and thorough. It contains many observations we need to \nscrutinize closely.\n  First, their framework depends on the collection of data that is not \nrequired to be turned over to the FDA by supplement manufacturers, \nnamely adverse event reports.\n  The IOM report states that the first step in the process for \nreviewing safety is to look for signals of safety problems, including \nadverse events. What do I mean by an ``adverse event''? Does it mean if \nyou have an upset stomach from a vitamin you have to report it to the \nFood and Drug Administration? Does it mean if you get dizzy from taking \nany kind of supplement, from garlic to fish oil, you have to call the \nFood and Drug Administration? No.\n  What I believe the standard should be is serious adverse health \nevents. If you pass out, have a stroke, or heart attack, or die--\nserious things that can occur.\n  Lest you think this is something that does not happen, let me tell \nyou the story of a young man, 16 years old, who lived a few miles from \nmy home in Springfield, IL. Sean Riggins of Lincoln, IL, a 16-year-old \nhigh school student, played on the football team. He had a big game \ncoming up. He went over to the local gas station--gas station, mind \nyou--and saw a product on the shelf called Yellow Jackets. It was an \nephedra product. Yellow Jackets were supposed to give him energy. This \nman thought: I need energy; I am going to play football. He purchased \nthis product over the counter at a gas station in Lincoln, IL, washed \nit down with a Mountain Dew, which happens\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nto be loaded with caffeine, and started feeling sick. When he got to \nthe football game, he didn't feel good at all. The next day, his mom \nand dad took him to the hospital, and later that morning he died from a \ndietary supplement with ephedra. Under the law as it is written, if the \nparents of Sean Riggins called the company that made Yellow Jackets and \nsaid, ``Your product just killed my son,'' that company would not be \nrequired under law to even report that to the Government. That is not \nright.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine report we are looking at today recommends \nthat that change. Metabolife misled the Government. Companies that make \nproducts such as Yellow Jacket sadly are not much better.\n  Let me tell you about another company called Rexall Sundown. It \nmarketed an ephedra product called Metab-o-lite described by the \nGovernment as having adverse event reports. In other words, people were \ngetting sick who took this product. We heard about it and requested the \ncompany provide us with information about the adverse reports, about \npeople getting sick after they took this product.\n  The response I received was truly astonishing. The company said \nRexall Sundown was a new company and had never sold ephedra products. \nTherefore, it never had any adverse event reports in their possession. \nThey used the oldest trick in the book to shield themselves from \nliability for the dangerous products they sold. They had dissolved \ntheir old company, started a new one with the same name, and tried to \nescape any liability for the life-threatening products they had been \nselling. We tried to get more information from them and failed, but we \nwill continue that effort.\n  Let me also say to people who said, ``Thank goodness, ephedra is off \nthe market, so you can stop worrying,'' that is not the case. The same \nConsumer Reports magazine that is coming out has a table which I \ncommend to everyone who takes dietary supplements. It is impossible to \nread this chart, I am sure, on television. I will summarize a few \npoints of it for those who would like to understand what Consumer \nReports, an objective magazine, says about 12 supplements. They said \nyou should avoid these supplements.\n  A supplement that is ``definitely hazardous'' is aristolochic acid. \nThis is something that is sold under a variety of names. They say it is \na potent human carcinogen. It can cause cancer potentially, kidney \nfailure, sometimes requiring transplant. The Food and Drug \nAdministration warned consumers and the industry in April 2001. It has \nbeen banned in seven European countries and Egypt, Japan, and \nVenezuela. But it is still being sold in the United States. \nAristolochic acid is also known as birthwort, snakeroot, snakeweed, \nsangree root, and so forth.\n  Then they list another group of ``very likely hazardous'' products \nbanned in other countries where we have a warning from the FDA: \nComfrey, which includes blackwort, bruisewort, and so many other herbal \nnames.\n  Incidentally, let me say at this moment how difficult it is for \nconsumers to follow this because they change the names on these bottles \nin the dietary supplement store, and you have no idea what you are \nbuying. The Food and Drug Administration advised the industry take it \noff the market in July 2001, but it is still being sold. It creates \nabnormal liver function or damage, often irreversible, causing death.\n\n  Androstenedione, I mentioned this earlier. The FDA finally banned it \nin supplements.\n  Chaparral is another product which is sold under a variety of names. \nIt causes abnormal liver function or damage, often irreversible. FDA \nwarned consumers in December 1992.\n  Germander is another product banned in France and Germany.\n  Kava is an ingredient in a variety of products. FDA warned consumers \nin March 2002 to avoid it. It is banned in Canada, Germany, Singapore, \nSouth Africa, and Switzerland, but it can still be sold legally in the \nUnited States because the Food and Drug Administration does not have \nthe power and the authority to police this kind of dangerous product.\n  Under ``likely hazardous'' products there is one I would like to \nspeak to, bitter orange, citrus aurantium. You will find this in \nMetabolife Ultra. When they took ephedra out, they put bitter orange \nin, and there are a lot of other products, diet products, energy \nproducts. It can cause high blood pressure and increased risk of heart \narythmia.\n  We wrote to seven companies that make supplements that contain citrus \naurantium and asked them: What kind of tests did you engage in to \ndetermine whether citrus aurantium, which is now replacing ephedra, is \nsafe? One of the CEOs wrote back and said: We have a scientific study \nto prove our product is safe. So we looked at the study. The study did \nnot have anything to do with citrus aurantium or bitter orange. It was \nabout the safety of using orange juice--orange juice--in drug \nmetabolism studies.\n  We then contacted one of the scientists involved in this study and \nasked: Do you realize this company that is selling thousands of \nproducts worth millions of dollars is claiming your scientific study \nsays citrus aurantium is safe?\n  This scientist came back to us and said: That is an improper use of \nthat study to justify the sale of that product.\n  So there is no scientific basis for the safety that CEO asserted. \nThese manufacturers are literally putting together dangerous and \nsometimes lethal combinations of chemicals and selling them under the \nbanner of dietary supplements to unsuspecting American consumers.\n  For some consumers, it is a waste of money. For others, it is much \nmore dangerous.\n  There are other products that are mentioned here. I am probably going \nto fail to pronounce many of them properly: organ/glandular extracts, \nLobelia, Pennyroyal oil, Scullcap and Yohimbe. When one goes through \nthese, they will find many of these have been banned in other \ncountries.\n  One of the conclusions from the Institute of Medicine, after looking \nat dietary supplements, is unreasonable risk does not mean the Food and \nDrug Administration has to prove the supplement is harmful.\n  The report concludes, given the limited amount of data available, \ndefinitive statements judging safety of these products may be difficult \nto completely substantiate scientifically.\n  The committee determined that concluding a supplement presents an \nunreasonable risk does not require complete evidence a dietary \nsupplement causes a serious adverse event. In other words, the \nunreasonable risk standard that is written in the DSHEA law is a \nstandard which frankly is going to be a very difficult one for the FDA \nor others to prove.\n  So what they are suggesting at the Institute of Medicine is we look \nto a different and more reasonable standard. They also talk about \npremarket review of some of these products, which I think is something \nthat needs to be done.\n  I particularly believe stimulants should be subject to premarket \nreview so we have some testing to make sure they are safe so many of \nthese products here, such as bitter orange, citrus aurantium, which \ncause an increase in blood pressure--and, frankly, I believe what they \nare suggesting in the Institute of Medicine report kind of parallels \nlegislation which I have introduced--to try to bring some sanity to \nthis industry.\n  This has been a battle which I have been engaged in for almost 2 \nyears now. I know what happens when one takes on a giant industry in \nAmerica, a multibillion-dollar dietary supplement industry. If one \nwalks into most vitamin stores around America, they will find my name, \nnot in a praiseworthy fashion. They are passing out leaflets saying: \nWrite to Durbin and tell him to stop taking away your vitamins and \nminerals.\n  It is a scare tactic. It is a scare tactic from an industry that \nshould be running scared. There are good actors in this industry and \nthere are bad actors, but unfortunately the bad actors are being \nprotected by the good ones.\n  Right now I believe Americans should be able to buy vitamins and \nminerals which have been tested and proven, make their own choices \nabout their own health, but I also believe this industry has a \nresponsibility when it sells products that can be dangerous to \nAmericans to do two things.\n  First, if they are selling stimulants they should be tested in \nadvance so we\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\ndo not have another ephedra which is going to take the life of an \ninnocent young boy in Lincoln, IL, or a major league baseball player \nlike Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles.\n  Second, I believe all of these dietary supplement manufacturers \nshould have a legal obligation to report to the Food and Drug \nAdministration when people get seriously ill or die as a result of \ntaking their products. I think that is the least we should demand.\n  I am happy to see the Institute of Medicine creating momentum for \nCongress to finally make a decision. I am happy to see the \nadministration, after more than a year of urging, finally banning \nephedra, but more has to be done. Today as we speak, innocent children \nand consumers across America are buying products which they presume to \nbe safe and they are not.\n  We have an obligation to American consumers to set a standard of care \nso they know when they make a purchase, whether it is in a drugstore or \nin a vitamin store, they are buying a product that is more likely to \nhelp them than hurt them. Sadly, the DSHEA law which currently exists \ndoes not meet that standard.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   GOPHER WOMEN BASKETBALL AND HOCKEY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, in these challenging times, it is always \nnice to rise to the floor of the Senate to speak about some good \nthings, about the accomplishments of some of the folks from your State \nthat elicit a great sense of pride.\n  Minnesota is the home to more than 15,000 lakes. It says on our \nlicense plates ``10,000 Lakes,'' but there are more than 10,000 lakes. \nJudging from the performance of our homegrown college athletes this \nwinter, there might be something very special in the water. I \ncongratulate Coach Laura Halldorson and the University of Minnesota \nGolden Gophers Women's Ice-Hockey team, which claimed its first NCAA \nchampionship this Sunday with a convincing 6-to-2 victory over Harvard \nUniversity.\n  Finishing with a record of 30 wins, 4 losses, and 2 ties, a \nconference championship, and the top seed in the NCAA tournament, the \nGophers did what so many No. 1 seeds often fail to do, they finished \nthe job and they brought home the hardware.\n  I think Americans love an underdog, but we also enjoy marveling at \nexcellence, and the women Gopher hockey team achieved this and they \ndeserve our congratulations, they deserve our plaudits.\n  I wish to highlight the recent progress of women's hockey for a \nmoment.\n  Hockey is to Minnesota what basketball is to Indiana or football is \nto Texas. Minnesota has been the center of the hockey universe for \nalmost 100 years. Until very recently, women's college hockey was \ndominated by Eastern schools. In fact, Augsburg College was the first \nMinnesota school to field a women's hockey team in 1995. I can proudly \nsay that since the inception of a NCAA Division I National Championship \nin 2001, no school outside Minnesota has won the national title.\n\n  The first three tournaments were won by the University of Minnesota-\nDuluth, which I had the pleasure of meeting last year.\n  The hockey rinks of Minnesota--and almost every town has at least \none--have always been full of young ring rats wearing hockey jerseys \nwith the names of Minnesota legends such as Broten, Bonin, Pohl, and \nGaborik. Today, however, it is as common to see young ring rats skating \naround the ice with ponytails coming out of their helmets. I got my 14-\nyear-old daughter her first pair of Betty hockey skates this winter, \nand she uses them proudly. They have the ponytails coming out their \nhelmets. They are wearing names such as Brodt, Darwitz, Wendell, and \nPotter on their backs. Minnesota has always been the State of men's \nhockey. Now, thanks to the pioneers of women's hockey such as the women \nwho just won the national championship, Minnesota can rightly claim to \nbe the State of all ice hockey.\n  Switching from the hockey rink to the basketball gym, the story that \nhas all of Minnesota abuzz right now is the Minnesota Golden Gophers \nwomen's basketball team's appearance in the NCAA Final Four. After \nearning a seventh seed in the regional tournament, Minnesota defeated \nthe No. 3 seed, the No. 2 seed, and finally top-ranked Duke, 82 to 75, \non Tuesday night. Prior to this year, the Gophers had never made it \npast the Sweet Sixteen in three previous NCAA tournaments. Now the \nGophers will be the highest seed to play in a Final Four since No. 9 \nArkansas in 1998. I believe they are the first No. 7 seed to play in \nthe Final Four.\n  I had a chance to watch--not watch, I watched here in Washington--the \ngame against UCLA with my daughter in Minnesota who, in addition to \nwanting to be a hockey player, wants to be a basketball player. On the \nphone, play by play, as we were talking about it, I just loved the \nsense of excitement.\n  I was unable to watch the game against Duke the other night; I had a \nspeaking engagement at the time of the game. But I was anxious, when I \nchecked my cell phone as soon as that speaking engagement was over, to \nhear first a message from my daughter, with just a couple of minutes \nleft, that we were ahead and then this excited message that we won. We \nwon. It is great to see young kids, young women look at other young \nwomen and look at their sense of accomplishment, athletic \naccomplishment and say, Boy, I would like to be like that. It is great \nto have role models, and we have them at the University of Minnesota \nnow, led by second year coach Pam Borton and Most Valuable Player \nLindsay Whalen, a young woman who broke her wrist and was out for a \nwhile and I believe the first game back in the tournament scored 31 \npoints.\n  The Gopher women will face the University of Connecticut at 8:30 \nMinnesota time. I wish the team all the best of luck, and the thanks of \nmillions of Minnesotans who will be glued to the television, cheering \nyou on, including me and my daughter.\n  The University of Minnesota women's ice hockey and basketball teams \nhave made all Minnesotans proud. A source of intense pride for all \nMinnesotans is that these championship teams are overwhelmingly \ncomprised of Minnesota-grown young women. Eleven of the 14 players on \nthe Gopher basketball team, and 12 out of 20 on the hockey team, are \nfrom Minnesota. These young women represent cities from corners of \nMinnesota, such as Fosston, Marshall, Stewartville, Moorhead, Hibbing, \nand the Twin Cities.\n  Congratulations to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers women's \nice hockey and women's basketball teams for their athletic success, and \nfor, really, making all of Minnesota proud, doing such a fabulous job \nof representing Minnesota on the national stage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the last couple of hours since we had \nour vote today, I have been asked by a couple of press people who are \nlingering in the hallways about the issue of obstructionism. \nApparently, there are some who suggest there is obstruction going on in \nthe Senate.\n  It is interesting to me that there are charges of obstructionism to \nthe Senate's business. We are not voting today, really. We voted once \non a cloture vote. We did not vote yesterday. Apparently, we are not \nvoting now until next Wednesday.\n  Why is that the case? Because there was an amendment offered to \nincrease the minimum wage, and the majority party did not want to vote \non the amendment.\n  It seems to me if there is obstruction around here, it is obstructing \nthe ability to have a vote on an amendment to\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\nincrease the minimum wage. The people at the bottom of the economic \nladder in this country have not had an increase in the minimum wage for \nyears. It is perfectly appropriate for us to consider that in the \ncontext of welfare reform.\n  So an amendment is offered; but because the majority does not want it \nto be voted on, business essentially is stopped dead on the floor, and \nthere are no votes, and we are at parade rest for 4 or 5 days. If \nanybody is obstructing, I would say it is those who brought the welfare \nreform bill to the floor and then decided they did not want to vote on \nanything, and we go, day after day, with no votes. And those who create \nthat situation now accuse others of obstructing.\n  I think it is a curious thing to do, but maybe there is a language \nhere I have not yet learned and do not yet understand. But there is \ncertainly no obstruction on the part of those of us who want to have a \nvote on the amendments we offered.\n\n\n                      Outsourcing of American Jobs\n\n  Mr. President, we are going to be turning, we think, in the next week \nor two back to a piece of legislation that was on the floor of the \nSenate that was also pulled from consideration because they did not \nwant a vote on an amendment that was pending. When that bill comes back \nthat deals with the issue of tax incentives for foreign sales--when \nthat bill comes back to the floor, I intend to offer an amendment \ndealing with an issue that has been discussed recently, and that is the \nmovement of jobs from this country to overseas.\n  We talk a lot about the concern of the outsourcing of jobs. This \ncountry, as you know, has lost over 3 million jobs in recent years, the \nlast 3 years or so, 3\\1/2\\ years, and we are now down a net roughly 2.5 \nmillion jobs. We gained a few jobs back, but we are about 2.5 million \njobs less than we were 3\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  So the question is, will this economy create new jobs? We need them \ndesperately. The other question is, why are we having policies in place \nthat remain in place that actually incentivize the movement of jobs \noverseas?\n  Let me describe one of them I intend to fix with an amendment as soon \nas I have the ability to offer the amendment on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Assume, for a moment, there are two businesses. Both produce garage \ndoor openers. They are both located in the United States. They both \nmanufacture garage door openers, and they sell them in the United \nStates. One of them decides they will move to China, so they move their \nplant to China. They fire their American workers. They hire workers in \nChina. They make the same garage door opener in China and ship it back \nto our country.\n  There is one substantial difference now between those two firms, and \nthat is the taxes they will pay on the profits they earn. The company \nthat has moved to China to produce the product to ship back into this \ncountry will pay a lower U.S. income tax. In fact, they will largely \npay no U.S. income tax.\n  We have a tax incentive in our law books that says: If you move your \nplant overseas and produce there for the purpose of shipping back into \nour country, we will give you a tax cut.\n  You talk about perversity, this is it. Our country says: We will \nreward you if you shut down your American company, your American \nbusiness, move it to China, move it to another country, and ship the \nproduct back into our country.\n  Well, at a time when we are losing jobs and desperately need jobs in \nour country, the very least we should do--at least the baby step we \nought to take--is to shut down the perverse incentive in our Tax Code \nthat says: Ship your jobs overseas and we will give you a big break.\n\n  We will have an opportunity to vote on that. The Senate voted on \nthat, actually, in an amendment I offered some years ago, and my \namendment came up short. Perhaps having lost now 2.5 million net jobs \nin the last 3\\1/2\\ years, the Senate will come to a different \nconclusion. I hope that is the case because this issue of jobs is \ncritically important.\n\n\n                            Trade Agreements\n\n  Mr. President, I have spoken often on the floor of the Senate about \nthe subject of international trade. I will do so again briefly, just to \nsay we have recently negotiated two free trade agreements, negotiated \nby the trade ambassador. I do not expect either, frankly, to come to \nthe floor of the Senate this year. Why? Because I do not expect the \nadministration, which negotiated these trade agreements, will want to \nhave a debate on them: the Central American Free Trade Agreement and \nthe Australian Free Trade Agreement. Why don't they want to have a \ndebate on them? Because, like most recent trade agreements, they are \nnot mutually beneficial; that is, beneficial to us and those with whom \nwe negotiated the treaty. In most cases, they will end up costing this \ncountry lost jobs and large trade deficits.\n  I will not go into great discussion about the so-called CAFTA, \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement, or to go back and talk about \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, both of which are \nterrible agreements, or the recent bilateral agreement we did with \nChina, which is an awful agreement, or the agreement with Australia \nthat really shortchanges us in terms of what we should have required to \nhave happen with state trading enterprises. I will not do that. But \nsuffice it to say, I do not expect there to be brought to this floor a \ndebate on this trade agreement by the administration because that is \nthe last thing they want between now and this election, because it will \nbe a significant debate about jobs and whether these trade agreements \ncost us jobs or gain jobs. The record is quite clear, we are losing \njobs as a result of these many trade agreements.\n  We have the highest trade deficit in the history of this country, by \nfar: a $470 billion trade deficit. Every single day--every single day--\nalmost $1.5 billion in trade deficit; that is, goods we are importing \nin excess of goods we are exporting. Someday, someone has to pay the \ncost of that trade deficit.\n  Now let me describe my concern about this trade. I am not concerned \nabout expanding trade. I happen to believe it is largely beneficial to \nexpand trade. I think countries that engage in activities because of \nnatural resources, and other things, where they have a natural \nadvantage, that it makes sense for us to trade with them, and for those \ncountries to trade with us in circumstances that are the reverse.\n  But that is not the case with most trade agreements today. In fact, \nthe case is we have not a doctrine of comparative advantage, as Ricardo \nused to talk about nearly 200 years ago. The doctrine of comparative \nadvantage is irrelevant. It is a natural advantage that becomes a \npolitical advantage by countries that create circumstances of \nproduction that are fundamentally unfair with respect to free trade.\n  An example: A country says: We will not allow workers to organize. If \nthey try to organize, we will fire them. And, oh, by the way, we will \nnot require the payment of any kind of a minimum wage. You can hire \nworkers for 16 cents an hour, if you wish. And, by the way, there is no \nage issue with respect to child labor, so if you want to pay 16 cents \nan hour, and hire a 12-year-old kid to do it, that is fine as well. \nAnd, also, we will not require the workplace be safe. If you want to \nhire 12-year-olds, pay them 12 cents an hour, and put them in an unsafe \nworkplace, that is all right, too. By the way, when you do it, and you \nhave a 12-year-old working in an unsafe plant, working 12 hours a day, \n7 days a week, you can dump the chemicals into the air and the water \nfrom that plant, and that is just fine as well.\n\n  Now if countries decide that is the condition of production in their \ncountry, and plants move to those countries to hire those workers so \nthey can produce a product to ship back into our country, is that what \nwe should aspire to have American workers compete with? The answer is, \nno, of course not. Yet that is exactly what is happening today. You \nthink I am wrong? Check the facts. I am not saying in every factory \nthey are hiring 12-year-olds, but I am saying it is happening in many \nparts of the world. I will give you one example I have used on the \nfloor of the Senate previously to describe in more specific terms the \nway this works.\n  This is a picture of a Huffy bicycle. Most people know about Huffy \nbicycles--20 percent of the American marketplace. You can buy them at \nK-Mart, you can buy them at Wal-Mart, and you can buy them at Sears. \nHuffy bicycles used to be made in Ohio. They\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nwere made by workers who made $11 an hour. They would get up and go to \ntheir jobs. I am sure they were proud of their jobs. They worked $11-\nan-hour jobs in Ohio to make Huffy bicycles. Right between the \nhandlebars and the front fender they had a little insignia, a little \nmetal insignia of the American flag.\n  Well, Huffy bicycles are no longer made in America. They are now made \nin China. The workers who made Huffy bicycles in Ohio were fired \nbecause $11 an hour was too much to pay someone to make a bicycle. \nHuffy bicycles are now made in China by workers who work 7 days a week, \n12 to 14 hours a day, and are paid 33 cents an hour. In fact, Huffy \nbicycles no longer have the decal of the American flag between the \nhandlebar and the front fender. They have a decal of the globe, \ndescriptive, it seems to me, of what is happening to the elements of \nproduction and the manufacturing base in this country.\n  The question is this: Is it fair competition to ask workers in Ohio, \nmaking $11 an hour, to compete with workers in China who work 7 days a \nweek, and make 33 cents an hour? Does that represent fair competition? \nIs that what we aspire to do? Or is this driving to the bottom the \nwages of American workers? And is it exporting the manufacturing \nexpertise and base of the U.S. economy?\n  Globalization has happened quickly. The rules of globalization have \nnot kept pace. We know that we don't want the product of Chinese prison \nlabor to come in and hang on a store shelf in an American store and \nrepresent that as fair competition. Most all in the Chamber would \nprobably agree the product of Chinese prison labor ought not be sold in \nthis country because it is not fair competition. But then what about \nsomeone in Indonesia who works for 16 cents an hour? Is that fair \ncompetition for an American worker? Should we aspire to have an \nAmerican worker compete in a circumstance where someone works 12 hours \na day, sleeps in a bunker, 12 to a room, works 7 days a week in a plant \nthat is unsafe?\n  The question of outsourcing of American jobs and the question of what \nis fair trade are questions that this Congress ultimately will have to \nanswer because, if not, we will see a continued exodus from this \ncountry of jobs.\n  The economists, the so-called big thinkers who wear small glasses, \ntell us we are only talking about the outsourcing of low-tech, low-\nskill, low-wage jobs. That is absolutely untrue, flat out false. If \nthose economists are still giving opinions and still making money, they \nshould not be. I won't name the economists, but the economists who told \nus what would happen with the United States-Mexico trade agreement who \nwere dead, flat out wrong. They said with that agreement we will import \nfrom Mexico the product of low-skilled, low-wage labor, and we will, \ntherefore, benefit from that. It won't cost us high-skill, high-wage \nlabor in the United States.\n  That is not true. The three largest exports from Mexico are \nautomobiles, automobile parts, and electronics--the product of high-\nskilled labor. It has cost dearly American jobs.\n  There are so many elements to this that almost defy description. Part \nof it is the start of this process, when we negotiate the trade \nagreement. Let me give you one of the most idiotic provisions in an \nagreement I have ever seen. It was done a couple years ago. I have no \nidea which unnamed and unseen negotiator negotiated this, but we \nnegotiated a bilateral trade agreement with China. And we have with \nChina a very large trade deficit, now nearly $130 billion a year. So \nthis is what our side agreed to: we will put a 2.5-percent tariff on \nChinese automobiles shipped to the United States, and the Chinese will \nimpose a tariff 10 times higher on any U.S. cars that we aspire to sell \nin China.\n  How would one come to that agreement with a country with whom we have \nsuch a large trade deficit? I have no idea. It is fundamentally \nincompetent to negotiate treaties that so undermine the basic \nmanufacturing interests of our country.\n  Another example of automobiles--I don't come from a State that \nproduces automobiles--is the country of Korea. I have a chart that \nshows what is happening with Korea. We import a substantial number of \ncars from Korea. Most people know the names of those cars. They buy \nthose cars. We have ships coming across the ocean loaded with Korean \ncars. In fact, in a recent year, we had 618,000 Korean cars shipped in \nthe U.S. marketplace for sale. Do you know how many cars we sold in \nKorea? Two thousand eight hundred. So there were 618,000 cars coming \nfrom Korea to the United States and 2,800 cars from the United States \nto Korea.\n  Why is that the case? Is it because Korean consumers don't want to \nbuy American cars? No. It is because the Korean government has put up \nbarrier after barrier to try to stop such sales. That is why you have a \nratio of 217 to 1 Korean cars sold in the United States to U.S. cars \nsold in Korea. Why do we put up with it? It is because this country \nlacks the backbone and the spine and the will to demand fair trade and \nstand up for our products. If our producers can't compete, shame on us. \nThen we lose. But requiring our producers to compete when the game is \nrigged, saying our producers ought to compete, when foreign markets are \nclosed to us, is fundamentally wrong. Yet that is what is happening. \nJapan, Europe, Korea, China--you can go right down the list.\n  I have mentioned a number of times that we have a trade regime in \nthis country and people who work in that area seem to lack the stiff \nbackbone that is necessary to stand up for our own economic interests. \nThere is no evidence that we ever get tough with anybody, no matter the \ncircumstances, because most of our trade policy is mushy-headed, \nforeign policy rather than sound, sensible economic policy.\n\n  We had a dispute with Europe on about beef trade, because Europe will \nnot allow U.S. beef into its market. The WTO, for a change, ruled that \nthe United States was right, and that we could retaliate on Europe for \nblocking our exports. And what do we do? We put tariffs on Roquefort \ncheese, goose liver, and truffles. That is going to scare the devil out \nof somebody, scare them with tariffs on Roquefort cheese, goose liver, \nand truffles, won't it?\n  Our country's trade officials don't have the foggiest idea how to \ndeal with trade problems, whether it is standing up for beef interests \nin this country or standing up for manufacturers or the interests of \nworkers. Our trade officials simply have been AWOL.\n  There is much to talk about with respect to international trade and \njobs. The discussion about all of this relates to whether we have a job \nbase to allow those who aspire to go to work to find a job. We have \nseen 2.5 million fewer jobs now than 3\\1/2\\ years ago, and at least a \npart of that is because we are outsourcing and seeing jobs move from \nthis country to other countries.\n  At least two of the reasons for that are, one, we have a perverse Tax \nCode that actually rewards companies that move their jobs out of this \ncountry, and we ought to do something about that. And, second, we have \nbasically incompetent trade agreements that fail to stand up for this \ncountry's economic interests.\n  My hope is that we could have a debate on trade in the Senate this \nyear. It appears to me we are going to have a debate on virtually \nnothing. The minute someone offers an amendment, the others pack up \ntheir duffel bags and leave town. I don't understand it. Day after day \nwe have no votes. Why? Because someone dared come to the floor to say, \nafter 6 or 8 years, maybe we should have an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  What does that do? It fills up airplanes leaving Washington, DC, \nbecause nobody wants to vote. And while they are out of town, they tell \nthe press that those who offered the amendment are obstructionists, \nforgetting, of course, that the obstruction is really the refusal to \ngive a vote to those who offered a very sensible amendment to the bill.\n  Most of us came here because we want to do serious things about \nserious issues. It would be good if, in the interest of this country, \nwe could, in a spirit of some cooperation, decide here is the \nlegislation we want on the floor, offer your amendments, have \nreasonable time agreements, have votes, and move on. Whatever the will \nof the Senate is, that is what we ought to do.\n  But instead, especially recently, we have seen a regrettable \nsituation of the Senate deciding, if there is a controversial amendment \nthat is offered, the majority doesn't like it, we will just stop \nworking.\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\n  There is a lot to do. This country has an economy that regrettably at \nthis point, while producing some growth, is not producing jobs. I just \nfinished reading an article by an economist from the Reagan \nadministration, Paul Craig Roberts, who was one of the architects of \nthe economic strategy back in the 1980s. Paul Craig Roberts has it \nabout right. He said this may well be an economic recovery without new \njobs--a jobless recovery. And if that is the case, we are in trouble.\n  We need to search for ways to begin to create these jobs. If we have \na recovery and no new jobs being created, we face some pretty difficult \ntimes. The American people want to go to work. These kids coming out of \ncollege want jobs. They want opportunity and hope. They want a good \nfuture. You do that by having an economy that produces jobs. There is \nno social program we discuss in the Congress that is as important or as \nproductive as a good job that pays well.\n  That is what allows people to have a good life, provide for their \nfamily, and do the things they want to do. So the question for us is, \nwhat happened here? Why the disconnect? Why is an economy that is \ngrowing not producing jobs?\n  One answer is that we are seeing jobs moving to Sri Lanka, \nBangladesh, China, Mexico--you name it. They are leaving. As they \nleave, a part of that departure is to be rewarded with a reverse tax \ncut, a tax incentive that says we will reward you while you leave.\n  We ought to close that now. We ought to go back and look at some of \nthese trade agreements and decide whether it is in this country's \ninterests not to be protectionist but to demand that the rules of trade \nbe fair. If we are unwilling to do that, we are not going to see the \ncreation of the kind of jobs that are necessary to restore the 2\\1/2\\ \nmillions jobs that were lost and provide the additional jobs an \nincrease in population requires year by year.\n  Mr. President, there are no votes today, tomorrow, Monday, or \nTuesday. I guess the Senate comes back with perhaps a vote on \nWednesday. I hope that perhaps we can start over and decide to treat \nseriously those things that are serious. There is such a tendency here \nto treat lightly those things that are serious and treat seriously \nthose things that should be treated lightly. We never get to where we \nshould be with respect to the interests of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Get Outdoors Act\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise with my colleague from \nTennessee, to recognize the introduction of legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today by Congressmen Don Young of Alaska and George \nMiller of California. The Get Outdoors Act is similar to an effort that \nmany of us in the House and Senate were involved in during the 106th \nCongress.\n  I am particularly pleased to be joined by Senator Alexander to \nannounce our intention to introduce similar legislation in the Senate \nin the coming weeks.\n  The principles and concepts within this legislation from the 106th \nCongress were then and continue today to be one of the most significant \nconservation efforts ever considered by Congress. Our goal is to \nprovide a steady, reliable stream of revenue to fund some of the most \nurgent conservation needs in the country.\n  The Get Outdoors Act, or GO Act, as the House bill will be referred \nto, is almost identical to the legislation considered by the House and \nSenate in the 106th Congress. That legislation had overwhelming \nbipartisan support. It was a landmark, multi-year commitment to \nconservation programs benefitting all 50 States.\n  The legislation we will be introducing uses a conservation royalty \nearned from the production of oil and gas off the Outer Continental \nShelf for the protection and enhancement of our natural and cultural \nheritage, threatened coastal areas and wildlife habitat. It also \nreinvests in our local communities and provides for our children and \ngrandchildren through enhanced outdoor recreational activities.\n  By enacting this legislation, we can ensure that we are making the \nmost significant commitment of resources to conservation ever and \nensure a positive legacy of protecting and enhancing cultural, natural, \nand recreational resources for Americans today and in the future.\n  As many of our colleagues will remember, during the 106th Congress \nthe House of Representatives passed almost identical legislation by a \nvote of 315 to 102 and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources reported a similar version that had the support of both the \nChairman and Ranking Member.\n  In addition, in September of 2000, a bipartisan group of 63 Senators \nsent a letter to the majority and minority leaders indicating their \nsupport to bring the bill to the floor. The effort was supported by \nGovernors, Mayors and a coalition of over 5,000 organizations from \nthroughout the country.\n  Unfortunately, despite that tremendous and unprecedented network of \npeople who came together in support of the legislation, our efforts \nwere cut short before a Bill could be signed into law. Instead a \ncommitment was made by those who opposed the legislation to guarantee \nfunding for these programs each year through the appropriation process.\n  However, as we have painfully witnessed since then, that commitment \nhas not been honored. What has happened is exactly what those of us who \ninitiated the effort always anticipated. Each of these significant \nprograms has been shortchanged and a number of them have left out \naltogether or forced to compete with each other for scarce resources. \nSo, today, the House has taken a great step to introduce similar \nlegislation. The principle of the bill Senator Alexander and I will \nsoon introduce provides a reliable, significant and steady stream of \nrevenue for the urgent conservation and outdoor recreation needs of our \nrapidly growing cities.\n  If we were to look at a map of the country and put lights where most \nof the population is, we would see a bright ring around the country \nbecause two-thirds of our population reside within 50 miles of our \ncoasts. As a Senator from a coastal State, I understand the pressures \nthat confront many of our coastal communities.\n  Today, with the price of oil near a 13-year high we should channel \nsome of those revenues and re-invest them in our natural resources.\n  Some of the programs in the legislation we plan to introduce will \ninclude: impact assistance, coastal conservation and fishery \nenhancement for all coastal States and eligible local governments and \nto mitigate the various impacts of producing States that serve as the \n``platform'' for the crucial development of Federal offshore energy \nresources from the Outer Continental Shelf. It does not reward \ndrilling, but it does acknowledge the impacts to and the contributions \nof States that are providing the energy to run the country; flexible \nand stable funding for the State and Federal sides of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund while protecting the rights of private property \nowners and with a particular emphasis on alleviating the maintenance \nbacklog confronting our national parks; wildlife conservation, \neducation and restoration through the successful program of Pittman-\nRobertson; urban parks and recreation recovery to rehabilitate and \ndevelop recreation programs, sites and facilities enabling cities and \ntowns to focus on enhancing the quality of life for populations within \nour more densely inhabited areas by providing more green-spaces, more \nplaygrounds and ball fields for our youth and the parents and community \nleaders that support them; historic preservation programs, including \nfull funding of grants to the States, maintaining the National Register \nof Historic Places and administering the numerous historic preservation \nprograms that are crucial to remember our proud past and fully funding \nthe Payment In Lieu of Taxes program, or PILT, in order to compensate \nlocal governments, predominantly out west, for\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\nlosses to their tax bases because the Federal Government owns so much \nland in a number of those States.\n  While we confront the challenges of a war, budget deficits and a \nstruggling economy, I believe it would be wise and we would show good \nstewardship to take this opportunity to set aside a small portion of \nthe oil and gas royalties to our States and localities for initiatives \nsuch as outdoor spaces or recreation facilities where our children can \nplay. The essence of this legislation, the American Outdoors Act, is to \ntake the proceeds from a non-renewable resource for the purpose of \nreinvesting a portion of these revenues in the conservation and \nenhancement of our renewable resources.\n  We wanted to come to the floor today to share these ideas with our \ncolleagues, to encourage their input and ask them to be a part of this \nunique conservation effort.\n  I would also like to add how much I appreciate the leadership of \nSenator Alexander. I think we will make a great team and thank him for \nhis cosponsorship as we attempt to move this legislation through the \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the Presiding Officer and I are new \nMembers of the Senate, but we learn our lessons pretty quickly. One of \nthe things you learn here is if you want to have an impact in the \nSenate, you have to put a focus on something you care about and then \nkeep after it.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has done that. In her first term here she \nfocused on the great American outdoors. Working with others, she came \npretty close to passing an important piece of legislation 3 years ago.\n  There were some problems in it for Members of the Senate. It is my \ngoal, working with her this year, and we hope with many others of our \ncolleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and others of \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to solve those problems and \ncome up with legislation that represents the conservation majority, the \nhuge conservation majority that exists in the United States of America.\n  The conservation majority of this country does not have a line down \nthe middle with chairs on each side. It exists on both sides of every \naisle and has broad support. We are good legislators, and if we are as \ngood as we hope we are, we will be able to work and represent what our \nconstituents would like us to do. So it is a privilege for me to work \nwith Senator Landrieu. We both serve on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We are fortunate under Chairman Pete Domenici and \nranking member Jeff Bingaman that we, most of the time, are able to \nwork in a bipartisan way. So we are off to a good start in terms of \nfashioning a piece of legislation that will gain the support of our \ncolleagues.\n  We are deliberately today not offering legislation. We want to \ndiscuss it first with members of our committee. We want to discuss it \nnext with others, such as the Presiding Officer of the Senate, who has \na long interest in conservation matters. We want her ideas and those of \nothers. Then, perhaps in 3 weeks, after the recess, we will be able to \ncome forward with a piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana said, this morning Congressman Young of \nAlaska and George Miller of California introduced the GO Act, the Get \nOutdoors Act of 2004. I believe they used it to emphasize we might do \nsome work on this obesity problem that is really worrying us, in terms \nof health, if more of us spend a little more time walking outdoors, \nplaying outdoors, and taking advantage of our country.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana said, the bill therefore will provide, \nI believe, about $3 billion in guaranteed annual funding for outdoor \nrecreation purposes. It would be paid for, as she described, by what I \nthink of as a conservation royalty. This is the way I think of it. It \nis a royalty on the revenues from oil and gas drilling on offshore \nFederal lands. After the royalties are paid to the landowner and after \nthe royalties are paid to the State, this conservation royalty would be \npaid to a trust fund which would then spend the money for the benefit \nof conservation. Then, after that, the rest of the Federal revenues \nwould go into the regular Federal appropriations process.\n  That is the way I like to think about it and I hope that is the way a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate will want to think about it as \nwell.\n  As the Senator said, we will be discussing these concepts that she so \nwell outlined with our colleagues. And we hope they will join us as \ncosponsors. As she said, our bill will be similar to that which was \nintroduced this morning in the House of Representatives, but it will \nnot be the same.\n  In addition, it will be similar to the so-called CARA legislation \nthat Senator Landrieu and many others worked hard on 3 years ago, but \nit will not be the same. There are some lessons that we need to learn \nfrom what happened 3 years ago.\n  For example, the cost of the Senate legislation may not be as much as \nthe cost of the legislation offered in the House. That is yet to be \ndetermined.\n  In addition, as the Senator said, we intend to discuss with our \ncolleagues whether States should have the option, for example, of \nspending the Federal share of the Land and Water Conservation Fund for \nmaintenance of Federal lands rather than for acquisition.\n  I have learned over the years that there is a big difference of \nopinion between Senators from the West and Senators from the East about \nthe acquisition of Federal lands. In North Carolina and Tennessee, we \ndon't have much Federal land. So a lot of us--even many of us \nconservative Republicans--would be glad to have a little more. Out West \nthere are a lot of people who think the Federal Government not only has \nenough but it has too much, and they don't want to see legislation that \nwould acquire more.\n  We need to take that into account as we develop a piece of \nlegislation that will represent the conservation majority but do it \nwith respect for those States that are already largely owned by the \nFederal Government.\n  Our legislation, like that proposed in the House, will ensure that \nState and Federal parts of the Land and Water Conservation Fund will \nfulfill the intention that Congress originally envisioned. It will \nprovide for wildlife conservation. That will benefit hunters and \nfishermen. There are more hunters and fish people with hunting and \nfishing licenses in Tennessee than there are people who vote. I am not \nsure that is a statistic to admire, but it is a fact, and it is one to \nwhich I pay attention. Bird watchers and all Americans who enjoy \noutdoor recreation will benefit from this legislation. It will provide \nfunds to establish city parks so the children in and around our \nmetropolitan areas can have decent, clean places to play; so families \ncan have decent places to go; and so senior Americans can have decent, \nsafe places to walk.\n  Someone once said Italy has its art, England has its history, and the \nUnited States has the Great American Outdoors. Walt Whitman wrote, ``If \nyou would understand me, go to the heights or watershores.''\n  Our magnificent land, as much as our love for liberty, is at the core \nof the American character. It has inspired our pioneer spirit, our \nresourcefulness, and our generosity. Its greatness has fueled our \nindividualism and optimism and has made us believe that anything is \npossible. It has influenced our music, literature, science, and \nlanguage. It has served as the training ground of athletes and \nphilosophers, of poets and defenders of American ideals.\n  That is why there is a conservation majority--a large conservation \nmajority--in the United States of America.\n  That is why so many of us, as the Senator from Louisiana said, feel a \nresponsibility in our generation to ensure to the next generation the \ninspiration of the dignity of the outdoors, its power, its elemental \nfreedom; the opportunity to participate in the challenges of its \ndiscovery and personal involvement; and the fulfillment that is to be \nfound in the endless opportunities for physical release and spiritual \nrelease.\n  Some of the words I just used came from the preamble of President \nRonald Reagan's Commission on American Outdoors, which I chaired in \n1985 and 1986.\n  In 1985, President Reagan asked a group of us--I was then the \nGovernor of Tennessee--to look ahead for a generation and see what \nneeded to be done for Americans to have appropriate places to go and \nwhat they wanted to do outdoors.\n  Our report, issued in 1987--very nearly a generation ago--recommended\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nthat we light a prairie fire of action to protect what was important to \nus in the American outdoors and to build for the future. We focused on \nthe importance of a higher outdoors ethic, suggested an ``outdoor \ncorps'' to improve recreational facilities. We examined the role of \nvoluntarism. We pointed out that the park most people like is the park \nclosest to where they live and how important it is, therefore, to have \nurban parks as well as great national parks. We warned of how the \nliability crisis and runaway lawsuits threatened our outdoor activities \nand called for a new institution or set of institutions to train \nleadership for outdoor recreation.\n  We formed State commissions, such as Tennesseans Outdoors, which went \nto work with the same objectives in our own State that we had in our \nnational Commission.\n  We envisioned a network of greenways, scenic byways, and shorelines. \nMost of the action we suggested was not from Washington, DC, but was \ncommunity by community by community.\n  But we also acknowledged the important role the Federal Government \nhas to play in providing outdoor recreation opportunities. Of course, \nwe must have clean air and clean water, and we must protect and enhance \nrecreation opportunities on Federal lands and waters.\n  Almost all of us on the Commission called for the creation of a $1 \nbillion fund to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund--both \nthe State share and the Federal share. This is a way of balancing our \nneed for more oil and gas with our need for recreational opportunities \nin the outdoors.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I think of these annual payments from the \nrevenues derived from offshore drilling for oil and gas on Federal land \nas a royalty payment. Pay the owner a royalty, pay the State its \nroyalty, then pay a conservation royalty for the use of that resource. \nThen the rest of those revenues go into the Federal Treasury to be \nappropriated. Pay a $3 billion annual conservation royalty--that is the \nnumber that the House bill uses--before it ever gets to the Federal \nappropriations process. Then appropriate the rest.\n  I believe this legislation will have broad bipartisan support in the \nSenate.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Landrieu, Chairman Domenici, \nwith our colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and \nwith all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fashion \nlegislation that is good legislation, that represents the overwhelming \nconservation majority in the United States of America, and which can \npass the Senate and the House of Representatives this year.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I commend my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, for his leadership--as I said, for not just this year \nand the years he has been in the Senate but for his years of service in \nTennessee, and as Chairman of this important Commission that outlined \nsome of the principles we are talking about and searching for solutions \nto today; and for his eloquence in reminding us that even more than \ngood stewardship is required.\n  One particularly fresh idea that he has brought to this effort is the \nconservation royalty.\n  I think we can begin to see that the companies are not only paying a \nroyalty to the Government, but they are paying a royalty to future \ngenerations through conservation. I think it is royalty they would \ngladly pay. We are not asking them to pay more than they are today. But \na portion of what they pay today.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership, and I look forward to \ngetting, as we said, ideas from our colleagues, taking it to the Energy \nCommittee and developing broad bipartisan support. Even in these days \nof tight budgets, we can think about setting aside a portion of these \nrevenues which are not insignificant. As you know, last year we \ngenerated $6 billion off the coast primarily of Louisiana, Texas, \nMississippi, and Alabama, while still honoring the moratorium that is \nin place along the western coasts the eastern coasts and Florida. Even \nhonoring the moratorium in place, we still were able to generate \nbillions of dollars. Hopefully through this legislation we can dedicate \nthat conservation royalty, a portion, to the worthy causes.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Her comments make me think of this report. Let me hold this up. So \nstaff will not worry, I will not ask to put this in the Congressional \nRecord. There is a summary I will bring to the Senate when we introduce \nthe bill. This is the report of President Reagan's Commission on \nAmericans Outdoors, published in 1987. It is a very good resource and \nbackup for many of the ideas we envision being part of this \nlegislation.\n  I learned very quickly as Chairman of this Commission that most of \nthe decisions we have to deal with in environmental and conservation \nmatters involve balance. Senator Landrieu and I know, because of our \nservice on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as we work hard \nto try to develop a national energy policy, that we are having a \ndifficult time as a country compromising, creating balance between our \nneed to produce and our need to conserve.\n  I certainly do not want to draw into this discussion all of those \narguments. I will say very little more about it except it would be nice \nto find in this contentious Presidential year, in this time when we \nhave so much disagreement about energy production and conservation, one \narea where we could show we are skilled enough as legislators to \nproperly represent the huge conservation majority in the United States.\n  Most Americans, as President Reagan's Commission thought and almost \nall Members thought, of course, we have to drill for oil and gas; \notherwise our natural gas prices are going through the roof; our jobs \nwill be in Mexico; our lights will be out. Of course we have to do \nthat.\n  Is that an insult to the environment? Yes, it is. What do we do about \nit? Shut down the wells? No, one thing we can do is take some of that \nmoney--actually a lot of this money--and pay a conservation royalty, \ncompensate for that by creating a conservation benefit on the other \nside. This idea of the land and water conservation fund has been \nendorsed by politicians of both parties for a long time. What we are \ntrying to do today is assure a steady stream of revenue to the State \nand Federal side of the conservation fund, plus a number of other \nconservation areas, in a way that respects each of our States. We can \ndo it. There is enough of a majority; we can do that.\n  President Reagan's Commission on Americans Outdoors from 1985, 1986, \nand 1987, and the work that Senator Landrieu and the majority in both \nHouses did, form a wonderful beginning. We will see in the next few \nweeks if we are wise enough to take that to a successful conclusion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALEXANDER). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            fallujah deaths\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I watched with horror yesterday as the \nmedia displayed the images of crowded streets, in Fallujah--and burning \nbodies in the center of that horrific celebration. In the middle of \nthat city that is part of the volatile Sunni Triangle, four Americans \nwere attacked, executed, and then burned as a mob of Iraqis danced \naround the corpses.\n  I found it hard to believe I was watching a news program, given that \nthe scene playing out before my eyes looked far more like a gruesome \nmovie than tragic reality.\n  Sadly, it was a reality--and that reality continues today. Families \nhave been notified that their loved ones were among the four casualties \nand are mourning the loss of these brave souls.\n  My home state of North Carolina grieves today as well. The four men \nwho were brutally assassinated yesterday were employees from Blackwater \nSecurity Consulting, based in a city in northeastern North Carolina. \nPreliminary reports tell us that three had been Navy SEALs and one had \nbeen an Army Ranger.\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\n  The four contractors were stationed in Fallujah to provide a convoy \nof security--the very purpose of their presence was to protect the \nlives of Iraqi men and women and they in turn were subjected to such \nbarbaric and despicable acts.\n  Yesterday's attack on these innocent men only further illustrates the \nevil influence Saddam Hussein still has over so many Iraqis. We are \ntold that the 150,000 residents of Fallujah are being held captive by a \nbrutal regime that wants nothing more than to return to the past days \nof tyrannical rule and streets of violence. The perpetrators of these \nghastly acts hate freedom, loathe democracy and wish to turn back the \nclock--it is important to say now more than ever that we will not let \nthis happen.\n  Mr. President, the horrific slaughters yesterday will not weaken the \nAmerican resolve to bring order, democracy, and peace to this war torn \nnation. The criminal who orchestrated these murders are few--and the \nIraqis who stand firm against such violence are the men and women we \nare seeking to serve as the Coalitional Provisional Authority acts to \nestablish stability in the middle of chaos.\n  As peace and order are brought to all regions of Iraq, may justice \narrive alongside them. It is my sincere hope that those responsible for \nthese attacks will not escape punishment. Let our response be swift and \njust.\n  While I wish there were more I could offer to the families who grieve \nthe horrific loss of their loved ones, my condolences and my prayers \nare all I have. My heart aches for the tears of so many--and my earnest \nprayer is that we see the end of these tragedies as brave Americans \ncontinue their work in Iraq. I deeply believe in their mission and in \nthe cause of democracy, freedom, and peace.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to speak for not more than 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Prices\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have spoken in the last 3 days about \nthe current price crisis this country is experiencing with the critical \nresource energy. The American consumer is going to the pump in their \nlocal community today to refuel their car and paying record high \nprices; in fact, the highest ever recorded on average in our history. I \nwould hope they are beginning to ask the question why, why is this \nhappening and why am I having to pay another $5 or $6 per tank of gas, \nan average of maybe $15 or $20 or $30 a month more.\n  In fact, I and the chairman of the Energy Committee, Pete Domenici, \nand others, held a press conference to speak to the issue of energy and \nwhy the Senate was not yet debating a comprehensive energy bill that is \nready for us to debate once again and vote on.\n  At that time I mentioned the average consumer today will pay, as an \nindividual, $300 or $400 more a year for the price of energy, and \ncollectively, as a family, they may well pay more than that. When you \nconsider their electrical bills and space heater bills, the average \nfamily is going to pay considerably more this year. That is money that \nwon't come as a result of having a pay raise and, therefore, having the \nmoney to offset those costs. Those are dollars and cents that are going \nto come directly out of the family budget this year. It will have a \nsubstantial impact on that family's ability to do what they did a year \nago, whether it was providing food for the table, clothes for their \nchildren, or maybe the family vacation, or the recreational value they \nplace on a certain activity that would cost them a certain amount of \nenergy.\n  I mentioned some days ago that I think probably families are already, \nif they own a motor home, recalculating whether they will actually be \nable to take that home and go someplace in the country this summer \nbecause of the potential cost, additional cost that 15 or 20 cents on a \ngallon of gas will mean this year. Those are all very real issues and \nsome that clearly this Senate ought to address.\n  I have said for that average consumer who is asking the question why, \nI have an answer. The answer is that the Senate of the United States \nhas refused to bring out and pass and set on our President's desk a \ncomprehensive energy bill that addresses those and other issues that in \nthe long term will get us back into the business of producing energy \nfor our country and becoming less dependent on foreign supplies and, \ntherefore, certainly dependent upon ourselves more than others. It is \nan important issue that we have before us today.\n  We have even seen it now break into Presidential politics, as Senator \nKerry speaks of ways he can propose to bring down those prices. I have \nnoticed he has not talked about production. He has not talked about \nincreasing production. So there are going to be a lot of schemes. I use \nthe word ``scheme'' because some are scheming at this moment as to how \nthey might turn this to their political advantage, tragically enough; \nthat is, the price of energy at this moment.\n  Why don't they just stop and ask the Senate why they can't pass a \ncomprehensive national energy policy for our country? We have been 14 \nyears without any new directions or new ideas as it relates to energy \nproduction, and it is clearly time we speak to that. There is a \nproposal that has just been brought forth. It is called the Gasoline \nFree Market Competition Act of 2003. Each time we see something like \nthis as an idea, it is important that we put it in the right context. \nEach time a government agency investigates gasoline prices--and there \nhave been 29 such investigations by Federal and State agencies over the \npast several decades--the findings literally have been all the same. \nThe market controls the price of energy, not some unscrupulous \nproducer. It is the market forces that ultimately produce the price at \nthe pump.\n\n  The purpose for antitrust law is to protect the interests of the \nconsuming public, not to increase the profit of any level or type of \ndistributions, which is what happens in the legislation I have \nmentioned, which is S. 1731. That particular legislation would try to \ndictate refiners' distribution practices. I don't think our Government \nought to ever get into the micromanagement of a marketplace. Our goal--\nand it always should be our goal--is to create transparency in the \nmarkets so all of the parties involve can understand them.\n  As noted in a recent economic study on ``The Economics of Gasoline \nRetailing,'' a Dr. Andrew Kleit, professor of energy and environmental \neconomics at Penn State University, puts it this way:\n\n       There is a difference between protecting competition and \n     protecting competitors. Protecting competition means moving \n     to provide consumers with the lowest sustainable prices, not \n     protecting the profits of any level of production or any \n     individual firm.\n\n  Professor Kleit's analysis shows that eliminating the ability of \nrefiners to restrict where their brands can be distributed, as proposed \nin S. 1737, would likely reduce refiners' investment in distribution \noutlets and ultimately harm consumers.\n  From a competitive point of view, Professor Kleit says, ``these calls \n[for this type of distribution concepts in legislation] are [clearly] \nmisguided.''\n  The strategy at issue is the result of competition between various \nforms of distribution in gasoline marketing. This competition promotes \nefficiencies which benefit consumers by bringing products to market for \nless cost. My fear is S. 1737 would not protect competition, only some \nof the competitors.\n  That is clearly where we ought not be going. But what I think S. 1737 \nreally does is it tries to speak to a market today that is a product of \nGovernment interference in the past. By that I mean standards and new \nstandards that do not allow the normal marketplace to flow and that, \nultimately, confuse the process and create dislocations, whereas a more \nfree market approach certainly would allow that to happen.\n  As we have seen in recent years, the Federal Trade Commission has \ncarefully studied many of the proposals about mergers within the \nindustry. In many instances, the FTC has required\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\ncompanies to sell assets to new competitors as these mergers occur. Let \nme give some examples.\n  For example, the Exxon Mobil merger in 1999 resulted in the largest \nretail divestiture in FTC history--the sale or assignment of \napproximately 2,431 Exxon Mobil gas stations in the Northeast and mid-\nAtlantic, some 1,740; California stations, some 360; Texas stations, \n319; and in Guam, 12; and the sale of Exxon refineries in California, \nterminals, a pipeline and other assets.\n  So my point is, while we may try to micromanage and use that as an \nexcuse or an attempt to help the marketplace, what the FTC has done \nrelating to these mergers has in part done that. In other words, we \nhave given them the authority to do so.\n  Similarly, when British Petroleum merged with Amoco in 1998, they \nagreed to make certain divestitures to free up more than 1,600 gas \nstations in 30 markets in order to satisfy FTC concerns that their \nmerger would substantially lessen competition in certain wholesale \ngasoline markets.\n  Let's stop passing the buck on energy prices.\n  Let's stop attempting to tinker with the energy bill and apply \nuntested concepts and theories in the hope that we can create the \nperfect bill while our citizens are being crushed by high energy \nprices.\n  Let's pass the energy bill and implement the energy policies included \nin that bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Let's stop the partisan rancor and do what our constituents sent us \nhere to do--protect their jobs, protect their quality of life, and \nprotect their security by passing this energy bill.\n  While many Senators may come to the floor well meaning in the next \nseveral months to find some political safe haven in which to address \nthe issue of high energy prices, there really are not any. Nobody is \nscheming today. Nobody is glutting the marketplace. The reality is a \nproblem of supply and demand. While I am quite sure you will have some \nState attorneys general out there calling for investigations, the \nproblem is supply and demand. It clearly is that, and there is no other \nargument that can really fit or begin to explain why we have record \nhigh gas prices.\n  This Senate needs to pass a comprehensive energy bill, and we have \none. It is ready to come to the floor. We are being denied that \nopportunity to bring it to the floor. All I am saying is use due \ncaution as it relates to all kinds of new ways to argue the problem in \nthe marketplace. But when you don't have enough supply of product or \ncrude to go around, when you have world demands and us now depending on \na world market for our supply of crude, we have a problem. This Senate \nrefuses to address that problem.\n  I hope in the coming days as gas prices continue to spike, consumers \nwill ask the question why, and turn to the Senate and say very simply: \nDo something. Pass a national energy policy. Put it on the President's \ndesk and allow this country to get back into the business of production \nand meeting the supply to the market, instead of trying to find a \nscheme or another excuse that will only be a short, limited political \nground on which to stand.\n  I believe there is no place to hide today and no Senator can have \nthat opportunity. The vote has been on the record. Let's change the \nrecord and improve the record by the passage of a national energy \npolicy that will once again put our country in the business of energy \nproduction.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2274 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            jobs crisis and indifference to working families\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the last 3 years, America has lost \nnearly 3 million private-sector jobs, including nearly 2.9 million good \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics says there are 8.2 million Americans \nout of work today.\n  But that doesn't include the millions of ``discouraged workers'' who \nhave stopped looking for jobs. And it doesn't include millions more who \nare under-employed.\n  All together, nearly 15 million American workers today are \nunemployed, under-employed, or have given up looking for work.\n  A month ago, the President's Council of Economic Advisors released \nits annual report on the economy. It predicted that the economy would \ncreate 3.8 million new jobs this year.\n  The President's own Labor and Commerce secretaries refused to endorse \nthat prediction. Then the President himself backed away from those \nnumbers.\n  After 3 years of promising jobs that never materialized, the Bush \nadministration won't even predict anymore how many jobs their policies \nwill create.\n  Last month, the economy added only 21,000 new jobs--every one of them \nin government. 21,000 new jobs. That is one job for every 389 Americans \nwho need jobs.\n  All over America, people who have lost jobs are draining their \nsavings accounts, tapping their 401(k)s, and running up expensive \ncredit card debt to try to make ends meet.\n  The average length of unemployment is at a 20-year high.\n  When people finally find work, it often involves a substantial cut in \npay. Jobs in growing industries pay, on average, 21 percent less than \nthe jobs in industries that are shrinking.\n  We have a jobs crisis in this country. And it is not just unemployed \nworkers who are feeling the pain.\n  With wages stagnant or falling, and health care and child care costs \nrising, many parents are working longer and harder than ever--and it's \nstill not enough.\n  Consumer debt is at an all-time high. Home mortgage foreclosures, car \nrepossessions, and credit card debt are all at record levels.\n  Millions and millions of American families are just one health \ncrisis, one pink slip, or one bad break away from financial disaster.\n  You would never know any of this to look at the agenda of the Bush \nadministration and Congressional Republicans.\n  The President and Congressional Republicans tell us, ``don't worry, \nthe economy is getting stronger.''\n  Getting stronger for whom?\n  Not the millions of Americans who are unemployed and underemployed. \nNot the workers whose jobs are being shipped overseas with help--help--\nfrom this administration.\n  Not the 43 million Americans who can't afford health insurance and \nare living with the daily dread that one serious illness or accident \ncould put them in a financial hole they will never dig their way out \nof.\n  America's families need jobs. And workers who have lost their jobs \nneed help until they get back on their feet.\n  They need unemployment insurance, job training, and health care until \nthey can find their next job.\n  Yet, this week, instead of just ignoring the economic stress so many \nAmerican families are under, the Bush administration is knowingly, \ndeliberately, increasing that stress.\n  Yesterday, the Federal unemployment insurance program expired.\n  Despite repeated Democratic efforts to extend the program, the Bush \nadministration and Congressional Republicans have refused.\n  As a result, over one million workers have seen their unemployment \nbenefits expire over the past 3 months, and nearly one million more \nwill see their benefits expire in the next 3 months.\n  Last week, the President's Commerce Secretary said President Bush \nwould sign an extension of the Federal unemployment program if Congress \npassed it.\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\n  So I urge President Bush to use his powers of persuasion to convince \nthe Members of his own party to extend unemployment benefits.\n  It is wrong to punish workers who can't find jobs in a jobless \nrecovery.\n  There is something else the President should do.\n  President Bush should make it clear that he will not strip overtime \npay protections from one American worker. Not one.\n  Any day now, the Labor Department is expected to issue new \nregulations that could deny 8 million American workers their right to \novertime pay. Those regulations were expected to be released yesterday, \nbut they have now been delayed for some reason.\n  Bipartisan majorities in the House and the Senate voted last year to \noverturn the Bush regulations stripping workers of their overtime \nprotections.\n  But the White House worked behind closed doors with Republican \nleaders in Congress to push the regulations through anyway.\n  If they have their way, up to 8 million workers--including \nfirefighters, nurses, store supervisors and others--will lose their \novertime pay.\n  Overtime pay isn't for luxuries; it is essential family income that's \nneeded to pay mortgages, tuition, grocery bills, utility bills, health \ninsurance premiums, and prescription drug costs.\n  For eligible workers, overtime pay makes up, on average, 25 percent \nof their income.\n  Last week, Republican leaders in the Senate actually pulled the JOBS \nbill to avoid voting on a Democratic amendment that would have \npreserved the overtime rights of American workers.\n  The Bush administration would rather force American companies to pay \ntariffs on the goods they sell in Europe than protect the overtime pay \nof American workers.\n  That shows how deeply out of touch this administration and its allies \nin Congress are with the real needs of average working Americans.\n  There are other signs as well. Two days ago, the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to increase child-care funding in the welfare bill so \nthat mothers who are moving from welfare to work won't have to leave \ntheir children home alone or with strangers.\n  Even though States are slashing funding for child care, the Bush \nadministration insisted that no more money for child care is needed. If \ntheir view prevails, 450,000 children would be forced out of child \ncare. That is how out of touch they are with this economy.\n  This administration has also refused, repeatedly, to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  It has fought to deny the earned income tax credit for low-income \nparents--at the same time it insists on more and bigger tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest one percent.\n  The President's economic advisors even suggested re-classifying \nBurger King jobs as manufacturing jobs to try to disguise how many \nmanufacturing jobs America is losing.\n  I have some advice for them: Forget about creating better-sounding \nstatistics and figure out how to create better-paying jobs here in \nAmerica.\n  Millions of Americans are hurting and need help.\n  I urge the President and the members of his administration, and \nRepublican leaders in Congress, to listen to them and extend the \nfederal unemployment insurance payments, stop this effort to deny \nworking people overtime pay, work with us in a bipartisan way to create \nand keep good jobs here in America and make affordable health care and \nchild care available for working families.\n\n\n                          VIOLENCE IN FALLUJAH\n\n  Mr. President, today, I offer my condolences to the families of the \nnine Americans who lost their lives in Iraq yesterday.\n  Five Marines were killed in the most deadly car bombing our forces in \nIraq have yet seen in the 11 months since the fall of the Saddam \nHussein regime.\n  In addition, yesterday four private security contractors were \nattacked and brutally killed by a mob in Fallujah.\n  The barbarity of these acts is shocking, and it reminds us of the \ncourage of the men and women--both civilian and military--serving in \nIraq, working to bring freedom to the Iraqi people.\n  Every day, our soldiers and the private contractors engaged in the \nwork of serving our military and rebuilding Iraq face the fear of \nviolence.\n  Yet every day, they go about their work with skill and resolve \nbecause they understand that their efforts are building a safer Iraq, \nand a more secure Middle East.\n  The cost to our Nation has been profound.\n  Six hundred American service men and women have lost their lives \nsince the beginning of hostilities.\n  Over 3,000 soldiers have been wounded.\n  Just over the weekend, in fact, a young man from my hometown of \nAberdeen, SD, Sergeant Sean Lessin, sustained a severe head injury in \nthe course of his duties in Iraq.\n  Sgt. Lessin is a member of the 147th Field Artillery Unit and is now \nreceiving treatment at the U.S. Military Combat Support Hospital in \nBaghdad.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Sgt. Lessin and his wife Jessica \nin Aberdeen.\n  Someone once wrote that ``True heroism is remarkably sober, very \nundramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, \nbut the urge to serve others at whatever cost.''\n  The Americans who lost their lives yesterday--indeed, all those \nserving their Nation in Iraq--are true heroes.\n  At times such as these, when our Nation faces great challenges, the \nloss of such heroes is particularly painful, because they are so rare, \nand so important.\n  To the families of those killed, we offer our deepest condolences and \nour unbounded thanks for the sacrifice your loved ones have made.\n  To the men and women still serving in Iraq, you have the thanks and \nadmiration of your Nation.\n  We recognize the escalating violence you face, and we will spare no \neffort to ensure that you have every tool, every resource, every \npossible advantage we can offer to help you complete your work and \nreturn home safely to your loved ones.\n  America will not be intimidated by barbaric acts whose only goal is \nto spread fear and chaos throughout Iraq.\n  Yesterday's events will only serve to strengthen America's resolve \nand seal America's unity.\n  The brave people who lost their lives did not die in vain.\n  Americans stand together today and always to finish the work we \nstarted and bring peace and democracy to the citizens of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senator \nWyden's amendment to the PRIDE Act that provides States the option to \nextend current TANF waivers and create additional waiver authority.\n  Virginia has been a leader in many important national reform \nmovements throughout the history of our country. In February of 1995, \nduring my tenure as Governor of the Commonwealth, Virginia enacted one \nof the most principled, tough, comprehensive welfare reform measures in \nthe United States. It was a tough fight to get this measure passed by a \nDemocrat led General Assembly.\n  Many other States enacted successful reforms and our approach and \nthat of Wisconsin and Massachusetts served as a model for the entire \nNation and encouraged self-sufficiency, the dignity of work and the \npride of independence rather than dependence.\n  The ``Virginia Independence Program'' transformed an outdated welfare \nsystem that was failing taxpayers, sapping initiative from welfare \nrecipients, and breaking up families. I have had many former welfare \nrecipients thank me for ending the downward cycle of dependency and \ndespair.\n  Unlike the Federal work requirement outlined in the 1996 law, able-\nbodied recipients in Virginia were required work within 90 days, the \nState had a 2-year limit on benefits, with transition assistance in the \nthird year and promoted individual responsibility by allowing no \nincrease in State benefits for recipients who have more children while \nreceiving welfare.\n  Vital reforms were made for children. Virginia ended the marriage \npenalty, increased enforcement of child support by suspending \nprofessional and driver's licenses for ``deadbeat'' parents, required \nmothers to identify the father to receive benefits, or receive no \nbenefits--this led to 99 percent identification and more child support.\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\n  Finally, the law required that minor-age mothers having children \nwhile on welfare must live with a parent or guardian and stay in \nschool, more commonly referred to as ``Learnfare''.\n  These reforms resulted in a 60 percent decrease in welfare rolls, and \nsaved more than $357 million in taxpayer funds in Virginia which were \nused for other priorities in education and law enforcement. Ultimately, \nI measure our success not by how many people are receiving welfare \nchecks, but rather by how many people are leading independent, self-\nreliant lives.\n  Virginia's trailblazing welfare reform has been extremely successful \nin setting the stage for Federal welfare overhaul, significant declines \nin welfare roles nationwide, and increasing the number of former \nwelfare recipients getting back to work. Virginia's waiver from Federal \nlaw has enabled much of the success in requiring able-bodied men and \nwomen to work for their benefits.\n  With the passage of the Federal welfare reform in the fall of 1996, \nCongress intended to give the States flexibility with the law. \nFlexibility through these waivers has allowed States the ability to \ndevelop innovative programs that best serve their citizens. Fifteen \nother States opted for waivers. Indeed, Virginia has far exceeded the \ngoal of the Federal welfare legislation offering Virginians the best \ntools to provide for themselves and their families.\n  As of June 2003, Virginia's welfare waiver expired. It is imperative \nthat the PRIDE Act, a continuation of welfare reform started in 1996, \ninclude waivers for States that have taken the initiative to make \ncomprehensive welfare reforms. We need to ensure that States can \ncontinue to encourage independence through work, promote families and \nmarriage and guarantee child-support enforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that States can \nmaintain these positive results and successful welfare reforms.\n\n\n                       unemployment compensation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the extension \nof the temporary extended unemployment compensation program, which \nexpires today. I support this effort because, in my view, we still face \nan extremely serious problem of unemployment in the United States, \nspecifically as it relates to the number of workers who have exhausted \ntheir unemployment insurance benefits and are still unable to find \nwork.\n  The Democrats have tried to extend this program through unanimous \nconsent at least a dozen times this winter and the effort has been \nrejected by Republican leadership every time. We tried in February of \nthis year. We tried in January of this year. And we tried a number of \ntimes in November 2003. Each time the other side of the aisle said the \nprogram was no longer needed. Even worse, they said that extension of \nthe program would only give incentives to workers to stay home instead \nof look for work. This is a very different view of American workers \nthan I have.\n  According to the latest data from the Department of Labor, between \nDecember and February there will be at least 781,000 workers that will \nhave exhausted their regular State benefits and will go without \nadditional Federal unemployment assistance. Based on extrapolations \nfrom that analysis, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities argues \nthat with each week that goes by, another 80,000 workers will be added \nto this list. In no other comparable data on record has there been this \nmany ``exhaustees.''\n  In my State of New Mexico, it is estimated that 4,300 workers have \nexhausted their benefits from December 2003 through March 2004. Through \nSeptember 2004, it is estimated that 7,200 workers will have exhausted \ntheir benefits. In a State where the most recent unemployment rate is \n5.7 percent and jobs are very difficult to come by, this is hardly an \nencouraging figure.\n  The Bush administration has argued that extension of the TEUC program \nis not necessary because the unemployment rate is low and the economy \nis growing. They suggested again and again that we are on the verge of \nan economic recovery and jobs are being created. I respectfully \ndisagree.\n  In 2001, the Bush administration claimed that their tax cuts would \ncreate at least 800,000 jobs by 2002. That did not happen. In 2002, the \nBush administration claimed that 3 million jobs would be created in \n2003. That did not happen. In February, the Bush administration claimed \nin their economic report that 2.6 million jobs will be created in 2004, \nbut everyone in the administration quickly backed away from that \nnumber. No one truly believes that this will happen.\n  Given the lack of coherent or comprehensive policy proposals by the \nadministration, I say it is time we in Congress act to address job \ncreation and help the victims of their failed policies. Extending the \ntemporary emergency unemployment compensation program is, in my view, \nthe least we can do for Americans that have been attempting to find \nwork but cannot do so. As a practical matter, this means workers can \ncontinue to get unemployment insurance benefits while they continue to \nsearch for work.\n  So I want to add my voice to the others today and say that we must \npass this legislation before it expires. American workers deserve to be \ndealt with in a fair and equitable manner, especially in this time of \nneed. They need a lifeline, and it is up to us to provide it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3557-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 4, 2000, an 18-year-old Brooklyn man was charged with \nallegedly slashing three men and threatening the life of another \nbecause he believed the men to be gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3557-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3557-S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DECRYING THE ETHNIC VIOLENCE IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn in the strongest \npossible terms the violence 2 weeks ago in Kosovo, which claimed the \nlives of 20 persons, injured more than 600 others, displaced more than \n4,000 individuals, destroyed more than 500 homes, and destroyed or \ndamaged more than 30 churches and monasteries.\n  In a reversal of the brutal murders and ethnic cleansing carried out \nin 1998 and 1999 against Kosovar Albanians by the forces of former \nSerbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, the perpetrators of this violence \nwere the former victims--the ethnic Albanians. Their principal targets \nwere Kosovo Serbs, although Ashkali and other minorities in the \nprovince also suffered.\n  There is no way to gloss over or disguise these events: They are a \ndisaster of the first magnitude. Five years ago last week, I submitted \nthe resolution that was adopted by this body, authorizing military \naction against the Milosevic government in order to rescue the \npersecuted Kosovar Albanians. Over the subsequent eleven weeks the \nUnited States and its allies successfully waged an air war, which \nresulted in the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. A United \nNations Security Council Resolution created a protectorate administered \nby the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo--known popularly \nby its acronym UNMIK--under the military protection of NATO's Kosovo \nForce or KFOR.\n  Since the summer of 1999 the international community, working through \nthese civilian and military structures, has attempted to pacify and \nstabilize the situation, rebuild the shattered infrastructure, and help \nguide the embittered and traumatized population toward eventual \ndemocratic self-rule. Resolution of Kosovo's final status was\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\nunderstandably deferred until significant progress was achieved.\n  From thousands of miles away it is difficult to appreciate the scope \nof the effort that the international community has devoted to Kosovo. I \nmight offer a very personal example. My older son, Beau, served for \nnearly a year in UNMIK as a lawyer, helping the Kosovars to build a \nlegal system that would impartially dispense justice to all inhabitants \nof the province. Tens of thousands of other Americans, together with \ncitizens of dozens of other countries, have similarly worked in \ncivilian and military capacities for the last five years.\n  Although there has, in fact, been considerable progress in several \nareas, the recent violence graphically demonstrates that, on the whole, \nthe effort is in danger of failing. The economy is in sad shape with \nmore than half the population unemployed. Kosovar Albanians complain \nthat the lack of action on final status has choked off any significant \ndirect foreign investment, which is the sine qua non for economic \ndevelopment. But it would be irresponsible to move to final status \nbefore stability and democracy have been achieved--as clearly they have \nnot yet been.\n  So where do we go from here? Kosovo is a complex problem, for which \nthere are no simple answers. In fact, every policy in the short run \ncarries significant downside potential. Nonetheless, we must \nimmediately take several steps.\n  First of all, through KFOR and UNMIK, we must make it unmistakably \nclear to all the citizens of Kosovo that the violence must cease \ncompletely.\n  Second, all citizens of Kosovo must cooperate with KFOR, UNMIK, and \nthe Kosovo police in identifying for prosecution the perpetrators of \nviolence and the destruction of property.\n  Third, all displaced persons and refugees must be returned to their \nformer towns and villages, guaranteed their personal safety, and \ngranted assistance to rebuild their homes as speedily as possible. In \nthis regard, I am encouraged by the commitment made by the Kosovo \nAssembly to establish a fund for the reconstruction of homes, churches, \nand other property destroyed during the March attacks.\n  Fourth, the United Nations should undertake a review of the structure \nand organization of UNMIK.\n  Fifth, the authorities in Pristina and Belgrade should reinvigorate \nand intensify their dialogue.\n  A resolution submitted by my good friend from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, and of which I am an original co-sponsor, makes many of \nthese points.\n  I would add a few more important policy recommendations.\n  The so-called ``benchmarks'' established by UNMIK must be reviewed. I \nhave supported the policy of ``standards before status'' whereby Kosovo \nmust fulfill rigorous goals before the province's final status is \nconsidered. I still believe that, in general, this is the correct \ncourse. The precipitous calls by some people for abandonment of the \nbenchmarks and rapid independence for Kosovo would, I believe, be a \ncure worse than the disease. The international community simply cannot \nreward murder and violence. ``Riots before status'' is not the answer.\n  Nonetheless, I believe that the UNMIK benchmarks have been too \nelaborately constructed. Few countries could completely fulfill their \nrequirements. In the wake of the violence, the benchmarks should be \nstreamlined and prioritized, with emphasis given to personal security, \nminority rights, and some kind of decentralization of government, \nalthough not the apartheid-like ``cantonization'' being demanded by \npoliticians in Serbia.\n  If by the middle of 2005 the benchmarks on personal security and \nminority rights can be completely fulfilled, and significant progress \nmade on the other benchmarks, then discussion of final status for \nKosovo can begin.\n  We should do our best to strengthen the moderates in Kosovo and \nSerbia, but there are, unfortunately, very few such ``good guys'' on \nthe political scene in Pristina and Belgrade. Short-term political \nexpediency seems to trump principle, despite the occasional lofty \nsounding speeches. Most Kosovar Albanian leaders hesitated before \npublicly condemning the ethnic violence, Prime Minister Rexhepi being a \nvery positive and conspicuous exception. General Ceku's call for \nrestraint on the part of members of the Kosovo Protection Corps was \nalso helpful. In the future, all Kosovar leaders must get the message \nthat rewards will flow to those who genuinely try to build a peaceful, \ndemocratic, multi-ethnic society.\n\n  It would be easier to be sympathetic to the cries from Belgrade to \ndefend and give special rights to the Kosovo Serbs if Serbian \npoliticians had not been so demagogically nationalistic in the weeks \nand months prior to the violence. The new Serbian Government led by \nPrime Minister Kostunica seems hell-bent on insulting the very \ninternational community that it needs for support in the Kosovo \nquestion, and in other matters.\n  Above all, the Kostunica administration has repeatedly thumbed its \nnose at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. \nIn a speech in late February, Kostunica himself candidly explained: \n``This country is not a simple deliverer of human goods to The Hague \ntribunal.'' No political campaign can justify this kind of know-nothing \njingoism.\n  Then just last Tuesday the Serbian Parliament outdid even Kostunica's \nblustering when it voted by a wide margin to pay all Serbian war crimes \nindictees at ICTY ``compensation for lost salaries, plus help for \nspouses, siblings, parents, and children for flight and hotel costs, \ntelephone and mail bills, visa fees, and legal charges.'' The measure \nwas supported by deputies from the parties of ultra-nationalist \nVojislav Seselj and of Milosevic. Both these gentlemen, of course, are \ncurrently residing in prison in The Hague. The party of Prime Minister \nKostunica joined in voting for this measure, which, were it not so \ngrotesque, might almost be labeled comic opera.\n  As long as up to 16 indictees, including three former Serbian \ngenerals, are openly living in Serbia, and the ``butcher of Bosnia,'' \nformer General Ratko Mladic, is also probably there, the Serbian \nGovernment cannot expect much international support. The U.S. \nGovernment has just announced that it is suspending all economic \nassistance not used for democratizing purposes because of Belgrade's \nunsatisfactory level of compliance with ICTY, and until it cooperates \nfully, Serbia will not be allowed to join NATO's Partnership for Peace.\n  We can take some solace in the opposition to the Serbian Parliament's \nresolution by a few smaller parties, including that of Defense Minister \nBoris Tadic, a genuine democrat and man of principle. During the Kosovo \nviolence, Tadic, who has carried out a vigorous reform of the Serbian \nmilitary and security services, proved that he has instituted civilian \ncontrol by keeping the lid on hotheads calling for intervention, \nreportedly in cooperation with U.S. Admiral Gregory Johnson, NATO's \nAFSOUTH Commander. There is a chance that later this year Mr. Tadic may \nrun for President of Serbia against a candidate of Seselj's party.\n  In order to get Kosovo back onto the right path, the U.S. Government \nmust alter its policy. And make no mistake about it: Kosovo matters. It \nmatters to the people of Kosovo. It matters to the people of Serbia. It \nmatters to the stability of the entire area of the former Yugoslavia. \nIt matters to the Balkans, since Serbia is the key to regional \nstability, and because the fate of Kosovo directly impacts ethnic \nAlbanians in neighboring Albania, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, in southern Serbia, and in Montenegro. In that context, \nKosovo matters to the security of all of Europe and, hence, to the \nsecurity of the United States of America.\n  One thing is crystal clear: the Bush administration can no longer \nafford to relegate Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, and Macedonia to the \nback burner of its international concerns. The administration has been \nliving in an ideologically driven dreamworld in which victory in the \nBalkans was prematurely declared in order to get on with perceived \nhigher priorities like national missile defense.\n  Lest anyone think I am criticizing the focus on the war on terrorism \nin Central Asia and the Middle East, I am not. As early as the fall \n2000 election campaign--nearly one year before the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001--Presidential candidate George W. Bush announced \nthat he would unilaterally withdraw U.S. ground forces\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nfrom the NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. His \nfuture National Security Advisor Dr. Rice echoed this misguided notion \nin a newspaper interview. The following spring, Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld, flying in the face of all objective evidence, declared that \nthe problem of Bosnia had been settled three or four years earlier. \nEven in this body resolutions for withdrawal of U.S. forces were \nperiodically submitted, but, I am happy to say, rejected.\n  Now we are waging war, attempting to quell resistance movements in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We all know that our armed forces are stretched \nperilously thin, and obviously some troop adjustments have had to be \nmade. U.S. forces in Bosnia have been reduced to little more than one \nthousand, or about 5 percent of their initial strength. Later this year \nNATO will turn over command of SFOR to the European Union, although \nsome American troops will remain at our base in Tuzla, at the request \nof the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Let me repeat that for my colleagues: the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, with the representatives of all three major groups--the \nBosnian Muslims, Serbs, and Croats--concurring, requested that American \ntroops stay on in Bosnia after the EU takes command of the peacekeeping \nforce. The fact is that the United States has stature unequaled in that \npart of the world perhaps even higher in Kosovo than in Bosnia.\n  As in SFOR, we have drastically reduced our troop strength in KFOR. \nGiven the events of the past few weeks, we dare not reduce it further. \nKFOR troops played a key role in quelling the Kosovo violence. I am \ntold that of the various national contingents, American KFOR troops \nespecially distinguished themselves.\n  Further proof of the Bush administration's downgrading the importance \nof the region was its abolishing the position of Special Coordinator \nfor the Balkans. This position should be reinstated and filled by a \nsenior career diplomat with extensive experience in Balkan affairs.\n  This new Special Coordinator should immediately engage the political \nleadership in Pristina and Belgrade in serious dialogue. I do not want \nto pre-judge what the final international legal status of Kosovo will \nbe, although I cannot imagine that Kosovo will ever revert to direct \ncontrol from Belgrade. Whatever the end result, direct negotiations \nbetween Pristina and Belgrade must be an integral part of the process. \nNo other path would stand the test of time.\n  The United States was Serbia's ally in two world wars in the first \nhalf of the twentieth century. The United States is revered by Kosovar \nAlbanians as their savior from the recent tyranny of Slobodan \nMilosevic.

Mr. President, we have all heard the expression that \n``knowledge is power.'' At no time is this more true than when we are \nat war. Our military uses satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, remote \nsensing devices, and long-range patrols to learn where the enemy is, \nwhat he is doing, and how we can kill him.\n  But there is another type of knowledge which is just as essential if \nwe are to be successful in combat. The side which knows and understands \nthe weather the best has a large advantage.\n  Now, I know some may reply that we do not need to be concerned about \nthe weather. We have smart bombs, stealth fighters and guided missiles. \nWe have sensing devices which let us see in the darkness. But despite \nthis high technology, we still have to give Mother Nature her due. \nRain, clouds and low visibility can still ground aircraft or hamper \noperations. High temperatures affect men and equipment. Dust storms can \nrapidly render sophisticated machines and electronics unusable.\n  Our troops faced many weather extremes as we prepared for the start \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom a year ago. Extreme heat, thunderstorms, and \ndust storms all threatened operations. To learn more about Iraq's \nweather and to gather the data necessary to predict, if possible, \nweather patterns in that country, a group of brave meteorologists \ndropped behind enemy lines. They fed their information to the Air \nForce's 28th Operational Weather Squadron, known as ``The Hub.''\n  As detailed in a special being carried by the Weather Channel, the \nUnited States Air Force dropped its Special Operations Forces \nWeathermen, known as the ``Grey Berets,'' behind enemy lines weeks \nbefore the beginning of armed conflict. The Grey Berets took \nexceptional risks to gather the data necessary for our Army, Navy and \nAir Force to conduct operations. For example, 5 days before the land \ninvasion started, Grey Beret Sgt Charles Rushing waded ashore to gather \ninformation on fog, surf, and currents to enable a helicopter assault \nteam to successfully seize key Iraqi refineries on the Al-Faw peninsula \nbefore Iraqi troops blew them up.\n  After the war began, the Hub reported on the biggest dust storm to \nhit the region in 30 years. The storm, covering over 300 miles, \nshredded tents and clogged engines and lungs. To the north, the storm \ncreated other problems, by dumping snow and sleet on Bashur Airport, \nthe target of the most ambitious combat paratroop assault since World \nWar II. The 173d Airborne brigade was flying toward a mountainous drop \nzone while Cpt John Roberts, chief Grey Beret weather forecaster, had \nto make a call on whether the weather would lift long enough for 1,000 \nparatroopers to safely make their jump.\n  The actions and decisions of these two men are just two examples \nwhere our Grey Berets helped ensure the success of our troops. There \nare many, many more.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Grey Berets for their heroism and \nprofessionalism and their contributions to our armed services. I also \nthank the Weather Channel for bringing their achievements to wider \npublic notice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3559-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3559-S3560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             S. 275, THE PROFESSIONAL BOXING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed by \nunanimous consent to pass S. 275, the Professional Boxing Amendments \nAct of 2004 (Act). I would like to thank the bill's cosponsors, \nSenators Stevens, Dorgan, and Reid for their commitment to professional \nboxing and the warriors who sustain the sport.\n  This amendment is designed to strengthen existing Federal boxing laws \nby making uniform certain health and safety standards, establishing a \ncentralized medical registry to be used by local commissions to protect \nboxers, reducing arbitrary practices of sanctioning organizations, and \nproviding uniformity in ranking criteria and contractual guidelines. It \nalso would establish a Federal entity, the United States Boxing \nCommission--USBC--to promulgate minimum uniform standards for \nprofessional boxing and enforce Federal boxing laws.\n  Over the past 7 years, the Commerce Committee has taken action to \naddress the problems that plague the sport of professional boxing. The \ncommittee has already developed two Federal boxing laws that have been \nenacted, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, and the Muhammad \nAli Boxing Reform Act of 2000. These laws established minimum uniform \nstandards to improve the health and safety of boxers, and to better \nprotect them from the often coercive, exploitative, and unethical \nbusiness practices of promoters, managers, and sanctioning \norganizations. While these laws have had a positive impact on \nprofessional boxing, the sport remains beset by a variety of problems, \nsome beyond the scope of local regulation.\n  Promoters continue to steal fighters from each other, sanctioning \norganizations make unmerited ratings changes without offering adequate \nexplanations, promoters refuse to pay fighters who have put their lives \non the line, local boxing commissions fail to ensure the protection of \nboxers' health and safety, boxers are contractually and financially \nexploited, and the list continues. Most recently, we have learned of a \nfederal law enforcement\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\ninvestigation that reportedly may yield a dozen or more indictments for \ncharges of fight fixing.\n  All too often my office receives a call from a parent whose child was \nkilled in a match asking why proper medical or safety precautions were \nnot taken by the local commission with jurisdiction, or from a boxer \nwho has worked tirelessly to escape poverty, only to find themselves \nsubject to the exploitation of the unscrupulous few who control the \nsport.\n  Professional boxing is the only major sport in the United States that \ndoes not have a strong, centralized association or league to establish \nand enforce uniform rules and practices. There is no widely established \nunion of boxers, no collective body of promoters or managers, and no \nconsistent level of regulation among state and tribal commissions. Due \nto the lack of uniform business practices or ethical standards, the \nsport of boxing has suffered from the physical and financial \nexploitation of its athletes.\n  The General Accounting Office confirmed in a July 2003 report on \nprofessional boxing regulation that, because professional boxing is \nregulated predominantly on a state-by-state basis, there is a varying \ndegree of oversight depending on the resources and priorities of each \nstate or tribal commission. The report also indicates that the lack of \nconsistency in compliance with Federal boxing law among state and \ntribal commissions ``does not provide adequate assurance that \nprofessional boxers are receiving the minimum protections established \nin Federal law.''\n\n  The consequences of this vacuum of effective public or private \noversight has led to decades of scandals, controversies, unethical \npractices, and far too many unnecessary deaths in professional boxing. \nYet another tragic, but precise example, of poor local regulation \noccurred just last year in Utah where a 35-year-old boxer collapsed and \ndied in a boxing ring. The young man should never have been allowed to \nparticipate in the bout given that he had suffered 25 consecutive \nlosses over a three-year period leading up to the fight, including a \nloss only one month earlier to the same opponent against whom he was \nfighting when he died. While tragic in its own right, this is merely \none in a seemingly endless series of incidents that continue to occur \nas a direct result of inadequate state regulation.\n  This measure would improve existing boxing law, and also establish \nthe USBC. The primary functions of the commission would be to protect \nthe health, safety, and general interests of boxers. More specifically, \nthe USBC would, among other things: administer Federal boxing laws and \ncoordinate with other federal agencies to ensure that these laws are \nenforced; oversee all professional boxing matches in the United States; \nand work with the boxing industry and local commissions to improve the \nstatus and standards of the sport. The USBC also would maintain a \ncentralized database of medical and statistical information pertaining \nto boxers in the United States that would be used confidentially by \nlocal commissions in making licensing decisions.\n  There has been quite a bit of confusion among local boxing \ncommissions regarding the effect that this bill would have on them. Let \nme be clear. The purpose of the USBC would not be intended to micro-\nmanage boxing by interfering with the daily operations of local boxing \ncommissions. Instead, the USBC would work in consultation with local \ncommissions, and only exercise its authority should reasonable grounds \nexist for intervention.\n  The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing compromise \nthe safety of boxers and undermine the credibility of the sport in the \npublic's view. This bill is urgently needed to provide a realistic \napproach to curbing such problems.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to support with my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, the Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2003.\n  This is an issue that we have now been examining for some time, and I \nam pleased that the Senate is moving this legislation forward.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee had the opportunity over the past years \nto spend time with figures such as Roy Jones Junior, Muhammad Ali, Bert \nSugar, Lou Dibella, and Bernard Hopkins, and we heard some things that \ncaused great concern.\n  I grew up as a boxing fan who wants to see the sport succeed, but I \nhave worried about how the sport is doing, and I believe this \nlegislation will take an important step.\n  Professional boxing is the only major sport in the United States that \ndoes not have a strong, centralized association or league to establish \nand enforce uniform rules and practices for its participants. There is \nno union, no organization that polices promoters or managers, and \nunfortunately no consistent level of state regulation among the state \nathletic commissions.\n  Part of the problem is the alphabet soup of 29 sanctioning bodies--\nall with different titles and rankings--and another part is a lack of \nfaith that anyone, not the state commissions, managers or promoters are \non the up and up.\n  I believe that a system based on state commissions alone just takes \nus to the lowest common denominator. We are in desperate need of some \nbasic national standards and uniform enforcement.\n  There continue to be stories about how some people are exploiting the \npatchwork of federal and state boxing regulations to the detriment of \nboxers and their fans.\n  This manipulation is often tolerated, or tacitly permitted by the \nstate boxing commissions, and too often current laws are rarely \nenforced by the state attorneys general, or the U.S. Attorney's office \nwho are too busy or just not interested.\n  This bill will create a United States Boxing Commission to oversee \nthe sport. The federal Commission would have the responsibility to \nlicense promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations. The \nCommission would be able to keep things in line by revoking or \nsuspending licenses as situations warrant.\n  It is imperative that we establish this federal mechanism in order to \nprotect not only the boxers, but also the overall integrity of the \nsport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3560-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3560-S3561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    QUESTIONS ABOUT IRAQ AID REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to discuss an issue concerning U.S. \nefforts to rebuild Iraq. Before I begin, however, I want to again \nrecognize the bravery and sacrifices that are being made every day by \nAmericans and Iraqis, and especially those who have been killed or \nwounded. There have been, almost daily, horrific, cowardly acts of \nterrorism, increasingly aimed at citizens. The appalling attacks this \nweek, where the bodies of Americans were dragged through the streets, \ndisgust and deeply sadden us all. My deepest condolences go out to the \nfamilies and friends of those who have died.\n  Yesterday, the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, CPA-IG, issued his first report on the reconstruction \nefforts in Iraq. I want to remind people that it was Senator Feingold, \nand later in the process, Senator Stevens, not the Bush administration, \nwho worked hard to establish the CPA-IG office during the debate on the \nIraq supplemental. I had the privilege of working with Senator Feingold \nto help draft some of the provisions of his amendment, and he, along \nwith Senators Stevens, are to be commended for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  Page 33 of the CPA-IG's report contains a table, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. LEAHY. The information it contains concerns me, as it should \nevery Senator. It shows that, as of February 29, 2004, nearly 4 months \nafter President Bush signed the Iraq supplemental into law, only $900 \nmillion of the $18.4 billion appropriated for reconstruction programs \nhas been obligated, less than 5 percent.\n  At a time when security is the most critical issue in Iraq, sadly \ndemonstrated by this week's tragic attacks in which nine Americans were \nkilled, the administration has obligated only $292 million of the $3.24 \nbillion for ``security and law enforcement,'' less than 10 percent of \nthe total appropriated. This is money that is supposed to go for \ntraining a new Iraqi army and police force to reduce the risks to \nAmerican soldiers and civilians working in\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\nIraq. On top of this, only $25 million for ``justice, public safety, \nand civil society'' has been obligated. This is less than 3 percent of \nthe $1 billion appropriated.\n  Not one dime of the $1.85 billion appropriated in the supplemental \nhas been obligated for ``health care,'' ``private sector development,'' \n``roads, bridges and construction,'' and ``transportation and \ntelecommunications.''\n  It would be one thing if the administration had warned us they were \ngoing to have trouble spending the $18 billion, but they said the \nopposite. They told us these funds were urgent. It was ``an \nemergency.'' The money had to be appropriated immediately, and not one \ndime less than the amount requested. There was no time for Congress to \ncarefully consider this legislation. It had to be rammed through as \nfast as possible.\n\n  The administration resisted accountability for how it would spend \nthese billions and billions of dollars, and that fact was, and is, a \nmajor concern that many in the Senate have had about that supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  In a letter to Congress on September 17, 2003, the President stated: \n``This request reflects urgent and essential requirements. I ask the \nCongress to appropriate the funds as requested, and promptly return the \nbill to me for signature.''\n  Ambassador Bremer testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on September 24, 2003: ``No one part of this $87 billion \nsupplemental is dispensable, and no part is more important than the \nothers . . . This is a carefully considered, integrated request. This \nrequest is urgent. The urgency of military operations is self-evident. \nThe funds for nonmilitary action in Iraq are equally urgent. Unless \nthis supplemental passes quickly, Iraqis face an indefinite period with \nblackouts eight hours a day. The link to the safety of our troops is \nindirect but no less real.''\n  I would point out to Ambassador Bremer, who I respect a great deal, \nthat less than 8 percent of the funds for ``electricity'' have been \nobligated. That is $428 million out of $5.6 billion.\n  I could go on, but by now the point is clear: If every dime of the \n$18 billion was so necessary, as a lump sum, to pay for the \nreconstruction of Iraq this year, why then has so little been obligated \nnearly 4 months after the President signed the bill?\n  I did not vote for the $18 billion and at the time I discussed my \nreasons in detail. But one of the reasons was that it was obvious that \nthe White House was asking for far more than they could effectively use \nthis year because they did not want to revisit this issue in an \nelection year. They did not want to have to defend this controversial \nprogram again in the court of public opinion. They did not want the \naccountability that should accompany the spending of such large sums.\n  This is one Senator who does not believe we should spend billions of \ndollars of the taxpayers' money without proper accountability. We all \nknew we would have to spend billions to help rebuild Iraq. But the \nissue was how many billions, over what period of time, and how to pay \nfor it in a time of rising deficits. Back when we were asked to vote on \nthe supplemental, I urged, as did others, that because the situation in \nIraq was, and is, so unpredictable, that we appropriate only as much as \ncould be effectively used. I said that we should then revisit the issue \nthis year, see how the funds were being used, make any necessary \nadjustments to the reconstruction program, count what other nations \nwere contributing, and then decide how much additional U.S. funding \nthis year would be needed to fill gaps in resources.\n\n  But the White House would have none of that. The President insisted \non getting every dime up front, paid for by increasing the deficit \nrather than reducing the President's tax cut for the wealthiest \nAmericans, even though, as the CPA-IG and OMB reports clearly show, \nthey cannot possibly spend it all this year. They probably will not be \nable to spend half of it. All that talk about how this had to be done \nin the blink of an eye and without adequate checks and balances was \nbaloney.\n  Congress received some of the first indications that the \nadministration was going to have trouble handling all of this money \nwhen the Office of Management and Budget published a plan, on January \n5, 2004, that projected CPA spending at a modest $1.4 billion by the \nend of the first quarter. The CPA-IG report confirms that the \nadministration is having difficulty handling all of this money, as many \nof us predicted.\n  We all want this money spent wisely, and no one wants any \nadministration to spend money for the sake of spending money. Also, \nthis is not to take anything away from the brave men and women who are \nworking so hard, under extremely difficult conditions, to rebuild Iraq.\n  But the issue exposed by this report is not the administration's \nspending rate in Iraq. The issue it exposes is the administration's \ncredibility. It seems self-evident that a large portion of the money \nwas not as urgently needed as administration officials insisted at the \ntime, or the CPA, as press reports have suggested, is tied up in \nbureaucratic knots and is not able to move fast enough to rebuild Iraq. \nI submit that the answer is both of the above, but I will let the \nnumbers speak for themselves.\n  Perhaps we will see a large ramping up of spending in the second \nquarter, as the administration suggests it will do according to OMB's \nspending plan. Perhaps the administration can provide a good \nexplanation for why these projects have proceeded so slowly. But \nregardless, it is clear that Congress could, and I believe should, have \nappropriated only a portion of the money last year. There is plenty of \nopportunity to act on another supplemental this year, instead of \nfrittering away the Senate's time on hot-button political issues \ndesigned to score points in an election year.\n  I believe the Congress can encourage the administration to do better \nin Iraq, shaping a more effective strategy in the process. This \nVermonter believes that more debate, more transparency, and even a dose \nof frugality, especially when it comes to spending $18 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money would be a good thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  The CPA has allocated $7.9 billion of the $18.4 billion. \nAdditionally, the CPA has established a $4 billion reserve.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1890, the Stock \nOption Accounting Reform Act. I am pleased to cosponsor this important \nlegislation, and I applaud the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, and the distinguished Democratic whip for their \nleadership.\n  I urge all my colleagues to pay close attention to this legislation, \nand to join those of us who believe that the mandatory expensing of \nstock options would harm American companies, and more importantly, harm \nAmerican workers who benefit from the issuance of stock options from \ntheir employers.\n  The Financial Accounting Standards Board--FASB--may soon take action \nthat would require public companies to record employee stock options as \nan expense. This will unequivocally impede economic growth and stifle \nthe economic recovery of our high-tech sector as well as other \nindustries.\n  As a result of FASB's proposal, companies will take a massive \nearnings charge based on stock option ``costs''. Just as we hope to \nturn the corner, the tech industry will be disproportionately hit with \nphantom costs that will undermine general investor confidence in the \ntech recovery.\n  Expensing will destroy our partnership culture of distributing stock \noptions to our entire workforce. We know from empirical research that \nbroad-based employee ownership delivers higher returns to shareholders, \ngreater productivity, and increased returns on equity.\n  In addition, small companies and start-ups, which depend on employee \nstock options to attract the smartest and brightest, will be dealt a \ndetrimental blow. The costs associated with the implementation of this \nnew rule will inhibit small business growth. In a time when the United \nStates is struggling to keep more jobs in America, this proposal \nundermines U.S. competitiveness.\n  Talented and skilled U.S. workers will be forced to look to our \ncompetitors, countries such as Taiwan and Singapore, for high paying \ntechnology based employment.\n  It is imperative that the United States retains its status as a \nglobal technology leader. Innovation and hard work are two basic \nfundamentals that founded our country. Broad based employee stock \noptions provide incentives for workers to work harder, promote savings \nand serve as an incentive for creating new ideas, which ultimately \npromotes economic growth.\n  I commend my colleagues for introducing this important piece of \nlegislation, and it is my hope that you will join me in voting in favor \nof S. 1980.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, our worse fears about FASB's seemingly \npredetermined crusade against stock options have unfortunately proven \ntrue. As expected, FASB has released a proposed expensing rule for \nstock options that is a lose-lose for individual investors and the \nAmerican economy.\n  Trial lawyers are gearing up for the biggest windfall of the 21st \nCentury. They will be the only winners in this misguided action. FASB's \nproposed rule would allow companies to either use Black Scholes or a \nBinomial method to expense options. Both are flawed models and will \nyield very different and certainly inaccurate results.\n  There is no question that market capital will be destroyed when these \nflawed numbers hit financial statements. Because companies have to \nchoose the method they use to expense, and the inputs that feed into \nthat flawed model, they will most certainly be barraged by class action \nlawsuits from greedy trial lawyers who will exploit the difficult \ndecisions that FASB is going to force companies to make.\n  Ironically, despite FASB's stated goal of improving information for \ninvestors, individual investors will now have absolutely no ability to \nmake meaningful comparisons between companies. Different companies \nusing different flawed valuation models will confuse and mislead the \nvery people FASB purports to help.\n  Our technology sector is on the cusp of recovery. We cannot afford to \nlet bad accounting destroy jobs and cripple our global competitiveness. \nThere are bigger picture issues here that FASB is neither tasked with \nexamining, nor equipped to look at. That is the responsibility of the \nCongress and Administration.\n  This move represents a tremendous threat to our global \ncompetitiveness. Communist China has, as a part of their 5 year plan, \nthe use of stock options. They are setting out to duplicate the success \nof our very own Silicon Valley and stock options are at the very heart \nof the Chinese government plan.\n  This is not about executive compensation. That is a separate and \ndistinct issue. WorldCom and Enron had nothing to do with stock \noptions. In fact, the Enzi-Baker bill says go ahead and expense for the \ntop 5 executives. This is about small businesses and rank and file \nworkers and preserving their ability to use this powerful tool for \ninnovation and growth. This is about preserving broad-based employee \nstock ownership plans.\n  Make no mistake about it. If FASB's rule goes into effect, rank and \nfile workers are the ones that will suffer. We need to support policies \nthat create jobs and wealth for Americans, not destroy them.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, yesterday the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board, FASB, released an exposure draft of a rule that will \nrequire companies to treat employee stock options as an accounting \nexpense. I find this proposal fundamentally flawed for a number of \nreasons and urge my colleagues to support legislation to prevent this \nfrom becoming a reality.\n  During my time as Governor of Virginia, I witnessed unparalleled \ngrowth in the technology sector of my State's economy. Many new and \nexciting businesses brought their products, services, and, most \nimportantly, jobs to Virginia.\n  Many of these technology companies that located to Virginia were \nsmall ``start-ups'' with little more than a good idea and the \nwillingness to take a risk for the hope of reward later. These \ntechnology companies contributed greatly to the tremendous economic \nexpansion witnessed during the 1990s.\n  However, technology companies were able to attract and retain top \ntalent and key directors without having to raise large amounts of \ncapital by granting employee stock options. In the end, shareholders \nand employees won. Employee stock options granted by many technology \ncompanies were awarded broadly to employees not only to give them an \nownership interest in the company, but also to better align the \ninterests of employees and shareholders.\n  I think employee ownership and incentives are great. It is desirable \nto have motivated employees caring abut the success of their company. \nBroad-based employee stock options give employees--from the newly \ngraduated worker to the experienced CEO--ownership in the company. \nIndeed, a well-respected technology CEO has said that employees with \nstock options are like homeowners, whereas those without stock options \nare like renters--there is a difference in the attitude, commitment and \nlevel of entrepreneurial spirit. The proposed FASB action will destroy \nour partnership culture of distributing stock options to the entire \nworkforce of a company. Broad-based employee ownership delivers higher \nreturns to shareholders, greater productivity, increased return on \nequity, and higher returns on assets.\n  Unfortunately, the unelected officials of the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board want to bring this era to an end. In their effort to \ntreat employee stock options as an accounting expense, they are \ndisregarding three fundamental issues. First, employee options are not \nfreely tradable. How do you value something that has no market? How do \nyou put a price on something if it is not for sale? The answer is that \nyou cannot. There is no accurate way to value these options without an \nopen market.\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n  Second, employee stock options are subject to lengthy vesting \nperiods--typically between 4 or 5 years. If the employee changes jobs \nbefore the options vest, they are forfeited.\n  Finally, employee stock options will be exercised only if the stock \nprice rises above the strike price. How does one predict future stock \nprices with any degree of certainty? There are entire industries \ndedicated to such a practice, yet I am unaware of anyone who is able to \npredict with absolute certainty what a stock price will be over a given \nlength of time.\n  This news is sure to be greeted with joy by our competitors in the \nPacific Rim. Entrepreneurs in Taiwan, Singapore and China will not just \ncontinue to focus on software development or gene sequencing there. \nThey will create global competitors there which will be listed on those \nstock markets. They will be free to offer stock options without the \nburden of expensing and our most talented people will flock there, just \nas they flocked to the Silicon Valley and Virginia when our technology \nindustries were built.\n  I find it distressing that a communist country, the People's Republic \nof China, has companies attracting entrepreneurial people and customers \nwith stock options. Meanwhile, here in America an unelected, \nprejudicial board wishes to stop such employee ownership, motivation \nand success to Americans. This proposal will harm the ability of \ninnovative American companies to successfully compete.\n  Despite the issues I have discussed, FASB is determined to make \nfundamentally flawed assumptions about future stock price and \nemployment trends. What is more, according to a Bear Stearns report, \nthere will be a 44-percent decline in NASDAQ 100 companies' profits if \nthey would have been required to expense employee stock options in \n2003.\n  I hope my colleagues are aware of the issues and risks posed by \nmoving forward with this flawed proposal. At this time, we need to \nembrace efforts to keep people working and our economy growing. If FASB \nis allowed to proceed, the economic effects will be disastrous.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3563-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3563-S3564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE JOHN R. LEWIS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 5 years ago Salisbury University, which \nis located in the town of Salisbury on Maryland's Eastern Shore, \nestablished PACE, the Institute for Public Affairs and Civic \nEngagement. PACE has a dual mission: to serve the communities of the \nEastern Shore, using campus resources, faculty-student research teams \nand off-campus opportunities like internships and a voter registration \ndrive to promote responsible citizenship and good government; and to \npromote the active engagement of students in civic affairs. For \nSalisbury Professors Harry Basehart, of the political science \ndepartment, and Francis Kane, of the philosophy department, who \ntogether founded PACE and serve as its co-directors, this is a personal \nmission as well.\n  Among PACE's many programs is an annual lecture series that brings to \nthe campus distinguished guests to speak on issues of public life, \nespecially issues that most concern Salisbury's students. The speaker \nthis year, on March 29, was Congressman John R. Lewis, who represents \nGeorgia's 5th Congressional District and is serving his ninth term.\n  It is fair to say that in all his life from his childhood in rural \nTroy, AL, through his years as a student leader in the civil rights \nmovement, to his dedicated service in the Congress Congressman Lewis \nhas never known a day of lassitude, apathy or indifference. He spoke to \nSalisbury's students from the perspective of his own student years, and \nI have rarely seen an audience listen with such focused intensity.\n  As it happens, I was born and raised in Salisbury. I was deeply \nhonored to have the opportunity to introduce Congressman Lewis to the \nSalisbury community, and I ask unanimous consent to print my \nintroductory remarks in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Introduction for Congressman John R. Lewis, PACE Lecture, Salisbury \n                               University\n\n                     (By Senator Paul S. Sarbanes)\n\n       It is pleasure to return to the campus of Salisbury \n     University. As many of you know, coming to Salisbury is as \n     always coming home. My parents had come to this country as \n     immigrants from Greece and they settled in Salisbury. I grew \n     up here and went to Wicomico County's public schools. \n     Lifelong convictions and aspirations first took shape in \n     Salisbury.\n       Today it is a special pleasure to be here, because I have \n     the signal honor and privilege of introducing my \n     congressional friend and colleague, John R. Lewis, as the \n     third speaker in the annual lecture series sponsored by PACE, \n     this University's Institute for Public Affairs and Civic \n     Engagement.\n       The purpose of the lecture series is to bring distinguished \n     public figures to the campus to speak on issues of public \n     life. That certainly describes Congressman Lewis, who is \n     serving his ninth term in the House of Representatives as the \n     representative of Georgia's 5th congressional district, which \n     includes the city of Atlanta. Congressman Lewis sits on the \n     Ways and Means and Budget Committees, both with critically \n     important jurisdictions. He is universally respected as a \n     legislator. Most recently he guided to enactment legislation \n     to establish a new National Museum of African American \n     History and Culture. The Museum will take its rightful place \n     among our nation's great Smithsonian Institutions on the \n     Mall.\n       But as many of you surely know--as I hope all of you know--\n     Congressman Lewis's distinguished record in the House of \n     Representatives is but one part of what makes him so special \n     as this year's PACE lecturer.\n       When PACE was established 5 years ago, its founders \n     Professors Harry Baseheart and Fran Kane said their objective \n     was ``to save the next generation from the enervating winds \n     of political apathy and cynicism and to play a part in a \n     revival of civil engagement among our students.'' Through its \n     many programs, including this lectureship, that is precisely \n     what PACE does.\n       I think it is fair to say that there has not been a single \n     day in John Lewis's remarkable life which has been marked by \n     cynicism, apathy or disengagement. For the full story, I \n     commend to you his absolutely gripping memoir, Walking with \n     the Wind. But I want to say a few words about it.\n       In his memoir, Congressman Lewis tells us that his \n     engagement began as he watched the bus boycott in Montgomery, \n     AL, 50 miles from his home in rural Troy. Martin Luther King \n     put words into action, he says, ``in a way that set the \n     course of my life from that point on. . . . With all that I \n     have experienced in the past half century, I can still say \n     without question that the Montgomery bus boycott changed my \n     life more than any other event before or since.''\n       John Lewis was then 15 years old. He was setting out on a \n     long and dangerous road with twists and turns, on a journey \n     demanding inexhaustible supplies of moral and also physical \n     courage.\n       Today we call that road the Civil Rights Movement. It is \n     central to understanding the history of our country in the \n     past 50 years.\n       Seen from another perspective, the Movement is the story of \n     John Lewis's life, as he has lived it day by day.\n       In 1957, John Lewis managed to get to college in Nashville \n     on a full scholarship. There he became a leader in the \n     student sit-in movement, which challenged the laws that \n     allowed African Americans to spend their money shopping in \n     Nashville's stores but forbade them to sit at the lunch \n     counters. David Halberstam has observed that the students had \n     much in the way of ideals and convictions, but they had no \n     protection--``no police force, no judges, no cops, no \n     money.''\n       John Lewis went to jail for sitting down--the first of some \n     40 times he was to go to jail. Three months later, the lunch \n     counters ``served food to black customers for the first time \n     in the city's history.''\n       John Lewis went on the Freedom Rides, which tested the \n     Supreme Court ruling that all vestiges of segregation in \n     interstate travel had to end. As he observes in his memoir, \n     ``Issuing the decision was one thing, of course. Carrying it \n     out, as I would soon learn firsthand, was another.''\n       He rode the first bus, which traveled from Washington, DC, \n     to Mississippi. He can recount for you better than I how many \n     times he was beaten and jailed in the course of that ride. \n     The violence that the Freedom Riders encountered was for most \n     Americans unimaginable.\n       In the summer of 1961, when the ride ended, John Lewis was \n     21 years old.\n       There is not enough time today to do justice to that ride, \n     or John Lewis's years as chairman of SNCC, the Student Non-\n     Violent Coordinating Committee, or his speech on the Mall in \n     Washington in 1963. But in this election year I want to \n     comment on the events that took place in Selma, AL, on March \n     7, 1965. They have gone down in our history as ``Bloody \n     Sunday.''\n       On that day several hundred Americans set out to march from \n     Selma to Montgomery, Alabama's capital. Their purpose was to \n     press for the right to vote, a right denied to African \n     Americans. The unarmed marchers were brutally attacked by a \n     ``human wave'' of ``troopers and possemen.'' John Lewis was \n     among many beaten unconscious.\n       Bloody Sunday shocked the Nation. Five months later the \n     historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law--a \n     direct consequence of the horrific attack at Selma. In the \n     words of Taylor Branch, ``The powerful new law broke decades \n     of impediment and heartache.''\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\n       On Bloody Sunday, every marcher's life was on the line--for \n     the right to vote.\n       I ask you to reflect on the events at Selma and their \n     meaning for our Nation, and on November 2--Election Day \n     2004--to exercise your priceless citizen's right vote.\n       From the beginning our Nation has lived by certain abiding \n     principles. These were set out more than 60 years ago by the \n     distinguished Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, in his \n     landmark study of race and America democracy, An American \n     Dilemma. He called this ``The American Creed.'' Here are his \n     words: ``It is the current in the structure of this great and \n     disparate nation . . . encompassing our `ideals of the \n     essential dignity of the individual human being, of the \n     fundamental equality of all men (and women), and of certain \n     inalienable rights to freedom, justice, and a fair \n     opportunity.' These ideals are ``written into the Declaration \n     of Independence, the Preamble of the Constitution, the Bill \n     of Rights and into the constitutions of the several states.''\n       For much of its history our Nation failed to live up to the \n     principles it espoused. It has been John Lewis's lifelong \n     mission to end the terrible contradiction that once assured \n     these rights to some of our people while cruely denying them \n     to others. He has led and inspired generations of Americans \n     to make our Nation a better place for all our people. He has \n     an incredible story to tell. It is a privilege to have \n     Congressman Lewis on the Salisbury campus today, and I am \n     honored to introduce him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3564-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CAPT JOHN LAWRENCE FROM, JR.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently I heard about CAPT John Lawrence \nFrom, Jr. in McLean, VA, a retired Navy nuclear submarine captain, who \nlived next door to Jim Rosser and his wife, Nicki Watts. They told me \nthat he had died of pneumonia at Arlington Hospital at the age of 82. \nRetired Air Force Colonel Watts sent me material about him, and I would \nlike to include it in the Record. Sometimes obituaries are so cold and \ngive so little about somebody's life that I wanted the Senate to pause \nand think of Captain From.\n  Captain From not only served in the Pacific during World War II, but \nalso commanded the first Polaris missile nuclear submarine. The Pacific \nTheater tours were dangerous, extraordinarily uncomfortable, and \nextremely necessary to our efforts to win World War II.\n  People get mentioned on this floor for many things, but I agree with \nColonel Watts that Captain From should receive recognition here.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some material I \nhave about him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       John Lawrence From, Jr. (Larry), 82, a retired Navy nuclear \n     submarine captain, died March 19, 2004, of pneumonia at \n     Arlington Hospital. He had lived in McLean, VA, since 1972.\n       Captain From, a native of Norfolk, VA, was a 1943 graduate \n     (class of 1944) of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD.\n       He served in the Pacific Theater during WWII, making six \n     submarine war patrols. After the war, he commanded a diesel-\n     electric submarine, and in the 1960s commanded the first \n     Polaris missile nuclear submarine, the USS George Washington \n     III (SSBN 598), and later the Ulysses S. Grant. (Larry was \n     pictured on the cover of LIFE magazine's March 22, 1963 issue \n     as the first Polaris captain.) He retired in late 1972 at the \n     conclusion of his last assignment as Commanding Officer, \n     Naval Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor.\n       Captain From was a graduate of the Naval War College in \n     Newport, RI, and the National War College in Washington, DC. \n     He received a master's degree in international affairs from \n     George Washington University.\n       His service awards included the Legion of Merit with Gold \n     Star (second award), the Joint Service Commendation Medal, \n     and the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ``V''. \n     Submarines, while he served in them, were awarded the \n     Presidential Unit Citation and Navy Unit Commendation.\n       In the late 1960s, he was instrumental in establishing, \n     developing, and maintaining a Boy Scout Troop in the \n     Chesterbrook Woods community of McLean.\n       After retiring from the Navy, Larry worked for nearly 12 \n     years at Science Applications International Corporation as \n     Vice President of research and development, and provided the \n     Navy with state-of-the-art underwater tracking systems based \n     on advanced signal processing techniques.\n       Larry was a parishioner of St. John's Catholic Church in \n     McLean, and his faith was like the submarines he served: \n     silent but deep. He was committed to serving the Lord and his \n     lovely wife, Mary Jane, whom he loved so devoutly and cared \n     for for so many years. Through it all, he remained a tower of \n     strength, always to be commended and remembered.\n       Survivors include his wife of 58 years, Mary Jane; three \n     children, Deborah J. Fletcher of Mill Valley, CA, Tina L. \n     Egge of Fredericksburg, VA, and Michael E. From of Seattle, \n     WA; and three grandsons, Kyle Egge, and Christopher and \n     Patrick From. He is also survived by his brother, William \n     From, and sister, Mary Elizabeth Troxell.\n       Larry was interred at Arlington Cemetery on March 30th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3564-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL DEBORAH A. GUSTKE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great American \nand a true military hero who has honorably served our country for 32 \nyears in the Army and Army Nurse Corps: Colonel Deborah A. Gustke. \nColonel Gustke has a true passion for nursing and served in a variety \nof clinical nursing and leadership positions at various Army medical \nfacilities including Fort Benning, GA, Tripler Army Medical Center, \nHawaii, and Fort Hood, TX. Her tremendous leadership skills led to her \nselection as a nurse recruiter and subsequent selection for long-term \ncivilian schooling to obtain an advanced degree as an oncology clinical \nnurse specialist. Colonel Gustke served with distinction in a series of \nsenior leadership positions as chief nurse at Fort Knox, KY, Fort \nRucker, AL, and at Fort Bliss, TX, and as the Army Nurse Corps \npersonnel proponent staff officer. In every circumstance, Colonel \nGustke was recognized for her clinical excellence and stellar \nleadership.\n  In 2000, Colonel Gustke was appointed the Assistant Chief of the Army \nNurse Corps. As assistant chief, Colonel Gustke developed and \nimplemented policies and procedures that affected nearly 35,000 nursing \npersonnel throughout the Army. Collaborating with senior Army and \nDepartment of Defense organizations, she worked to successfully obtain \ndirect hire authority, thereby dramatically reducing the hiring time \nfor civilian nurses. She spearheaded several recruitment and retention \ninitiatives, including the $18 million Health Professional Loan \nRepayment Program, the critical skills retention bonus, and increased \ncapacity for the Army Enlisted Commissioning Program. Her efforts \ndecreased the impact of the national nursing shortage on the Army. In \naddition, she implemented the recognition of the advanced practice \nnurse role for the Army Medical Department. As chair of the Federal \nNursing Service Council, she sponsored the development of a Federal \nnursing research model that focused on improving soldier readiness and \npatient-care outcomes.\n  Colonel Gustke's accomplishments are eloquent testimony to her \ntalent, dedication, loyalty, and determination in ensuring that the \nbest possible nursing care is always available to our soldiers, their \nfamily members and our deserving retirees. Colonel Gustke has \nestablished a legacy of superior performance to be emulated by all, \nwhich reflects greatly on herself, the United States Army, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my \ndeepest appreciation on behalf of a grateful Nation for her dedicated \nservice. Congratulations to Colonel Gustke. I wish her Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3564-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3564-S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment today to \nspeak about the American Legacy Foundation. This foundation celebrated \nits 5th anniversary this past month, and I wanted to express my \ncontinued support for the foundation in the future.\n  This foundation, formed under the master settlement agreement reached \nwith big tobacco, has worked tirelessly over the last 5 years on its \nmission to build a world where young people reject tobacco and anyone \ncan quit.\n  We know that tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable death \nin this country. Forty-seven million Americans smoke, and 400,000 \npeople a year die because of it. Smokers have a one in three chance of \ndying from smoking-related conditions.\n  Even more alarming, every day, 3,000 children under age 18 start \nsmoking, of which 1,000 will ultimately die of smoking related \ndiseases. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using tobacco at \nor before age 18; the average youth smoker begins at age 13 and becomes \na daily smoker by age 14\\1/2\\.\n  The American Legacy Foundation, through its highly effective public\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nawareness campaign truth' alone, has helped reduce youth \nsmoking rates to a 28-year historic low. I have heard from young people \nin my home state of Iowa who say that seeing the truth' \ntelevision and magazine advertisements have affected their decisions \nabout tobacco. The foundation also has a number of successful cessation \nprograms in operation across the country.\n  The American Legacy Foundation clearly still has work to do. \nEducating American young people about the harmful effects of smoking is \nnot merely a 5-year long task. Yet this year, the foundation received \nits last payment from the master settlement agreement. Without \nincreased resources, the important work of the American Legacy \nFoundation cannot continue.\n  I ask that my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the \nachievements of the American Legacy Foundation and in pledging our \nsupport for the important work they do educating our nation about the \ndangers of tobacco use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3565-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DANA CORPORATION'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Dana \nCorporation, a fine Ohio company celebrating a very important \nmilestone--100 years of quality service as one of the world's chief \nautomotive suppliers. The Dana Corporation, headquartered in Toledo, \nOH, develops automotive parts and systems that have truly \nrevolutionized the automotive industry.\n  I would like to take just a few moments to tell my colleagues in the \nSenate about this Ohio company and how much of an impact it has made in \nmy home State. Back in early 1904, a young engineering student named \nClarence Spicer received a patent for developing the first feasible \nuniversal joint to power an automobile. With this one invention, \nClarence Spicer forever changed the way automobiles operated by \nchanging the drive mechanism from chain to joint operated. It was from \nthese early insights and humble circumstances that the Dana Corporation \nwas born.\n  The company gained standing and financial prosperity under the \nleadership of businessman, attorney, politician, and financier, Charles \nDana. Under his leadership, the company began to grow in technology, \nproduction, and geographic reach. Today, the Dana Corporation employs \nat least 28,000 Americans. In Ohio, alone, the company employs 3,151 \npeople in 22 different facilities. They are world renowned for their \nresearch and production of drive shafts and axles; engine cradles, \nfull-body frames, brake and chassis products, including suspensions and \nsteering products; heat exchangers, valves, and coolers; and bearings \nand sealing products. Their dedication and insight have helped move \nsome of history's greatest vehicles--from the Model T and World War II-\nera Jeep to London taxicabs, 18-wheel rigs, giant earth-moving \nmachines, and every car on the NASCAR racing circuit.\n  I commend the Dana Corporation for its century of success and wish \nthe company and all of its employees continued success in producing and \nmanufacturing high-quality automotive supplies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3565-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF REVEREND JIMMY WATERS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, for most of his 83 years, the \nReverend Jimmy Waters made a significant impact on the lives of many \nGeorgians. The former pastor of Macon's Mabel White Memorial Baptist \nChurch and Tattnall Square Baptist Church has spent, as he said, a \ngreat deal of time battling fires. For more than 55 years, he was \nchaplain of the Macon-Bibb County Fire Department assisting the men who \nfought physical fires. For nearly 60 years, he was also an ordained \nminister, fighting, as he said, the hell fire that threatens men's \nsouls.\n  In addition to presiding over the growth of Mabel White from 800 \nmembers to over 3,900, he served as chaplain to the Macon Police \nDepartment, the Bibb County Sheriff's Office, the Georgia State Patrol, \nand the Georgia bureau of Investigation. He was also named lifetime \nchaplain of the Georgia Peace Officers Association, which awarded the \nfirst Jimmy Waters Scholarship in his honor to a University of Georgia \ncriminal justice student.\n  Reverend Waters was a graduate of Mercer University, where he entered \nthe ministry while he was still a freshman and earned both his \nbachelor's and doctorate degrees. As a loving father and husband, he \nraised three daughters with his wife, the former Annette Burton of \nCrawfordville. His family often sang with him as he conducted religious \nservices in churches located as far away as Israel and Italy.\n  Reverend Waters was not the type of Christian who kept his lamp under \na bushel. He and his siblings sang gospel music on Atlanta's WSB radio \nstation in the 1930s. In addition to his duties as pastor, he initiated \ntelevised services from Mabel White, and later began broadcasts of \n``The Victory Hour.'' After he retired from Mabel White in 1977, he \ndevoted his efforts to Jimmy Waters Ministries, which spread the Gospel \nthrough radio, television, and evangelism. As religious director for \nWMAZ radio and television in Macon, he recorded over 25,000 broadcasts \nat home and abroad until he stopped in 2003. He also served as co-host \nfor many fundraising telethons for Macon's WMAZ-TV in support of the \nMuscular Dystrophy Association, the Children's Miracle Network and \nCerebral Palsy.\n  Dr. Waters was often recognized for his work, serving as President of \nthe Georgia Baptist Convention from 1974-1976 and as Chairman of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention's Radio and Television Commission from \n1977-1978. In all of the many positions he accepted, he brought energy \nand integrity to the job.\n  That inner fire that he brought to his work is the reason why so many \nof us will miss Reverend Jimmy Waters. He was a great American and my \ngood friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3565-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3565-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3565-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE--March 31, 2004\n\n  At 12.16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to improve environmental enforcement and security; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Mikulski to introduce today the Environmental \nEnforcement and Security Act (EESA) of 2004. This bill will increase \nsubstantially enforcement of our Nation's environmental laws, increase \nenvironmentally related homeland security, and further protect our \nNation's water supply from terrorist attack.\n  Our families and environment deserve communities free from \nintentional violators of environmental laws and terrorists who would \nattack our drinking water supplies.\n  With this dramatic new commitment to environmental enforcement and \ndrinking water security, we will tell those who would intentionally \nharm us that we are coming after them.\n  The environment and health of our communities need vigorous \nprosecution of intentional violations of our Nation's environmental \nlaws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal \nEnforcement program investigates the most significant and egregious \nviolators of environmental laws that pose a significant threat to human \nhealth and the environment. However, the number of EPA Criminal \nEnforcement Special Agents has remained constant for the last several \nyears.\n  In addition, in our post-9/11 world, EPA Special Agents are needed \nfor homeland security duties to detect, investigate and respond to \nterrorist threats involving chemical or biological hazards.\n  EPA Special Agents support the Department of Homeland Security, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice. EPA \nSpecial Agents are members of FBI Counter-Terrorism Response Teams and \nEvidence Response Teams.\n  However, with this new post-9/11 need to respond to the threat of \nterrorism, some are concerned that environmental violations may not be \nreceiving the attention they deserve. A recent report by the EPA \nInspector General, an internal review by the EPA Enforcement and \nCompliance Assurance program, and various media accounts tell how EPA \nneeds more resources to meet both its environmental and homeland \nsecurity duties.\n  Our bill responds to these calls with a dramatic new commitment to \nEPA's enforcement program. My bill will put 50 new EPA Criminal \nEnforcement Special Agents on the environmental beat. EESA will also \nprovide for 80 Special Agents to support homeland security duties.\n  With our bill, we will no longer need to make a choice between \nprotecting our homeland and protecting our environment.\n  With out bill, those who would intentionally hurt our families and \ncommunities through environmental harm will know that we are sending \nthe manpower and resources needed to come after them.\n  We are also sending local communities new funding to protect our \ndrinking water supplies. Every family and every business needs clean \nand safe drinking water. Every mother needs to know that when she turns \non the tap in her kitchen sink, clean and safe water will come out.\n  That is why our bill devotes $100 million for additional drinking \nwater security protections. EESA will send grant funds directly to \nwater systems to protect against terrorist attack with fencing, \nintruder detection, access control and water monitoring. The need is \ngreat, but the federal government will attempt to do its share.\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n  Our bill will also enhance EPA's ability to protect the environment \nand human health in several other ways. EESA will double the number of \nenforcement trainers and triple EPA's enforcement training budget. EESA \nfunds will train Federal, State and local inspectors, law enforcement \nagents and prosecutors with the training they need to pursue \nenvironmental violations.\n  Our bill will also improve the environment by doubling compliance \nassistance funds to fill gaps in enforcement coverage, reach regulated \nfacilities not visited by inspectors, and help the regulated community, \nespecially small businesses, to understand EPA's complex and extensive \nregulatory requirements.\n  Our bill will also make EPA's enforcement actions more efficient and \ntargeted by fully funding a strategic enforcement targeting program. \nEESA will enhance EPA's ability to target its enforcement actions to \nwhere the environment needs them most. Strategic targeting will also \nimprove EPA's ability to identify and respond to increased \nnoncompliance with environmental laws.\n  Our Nation's environmental laws exist to protect our families, our \ncommunities and our natural resources. Those who would intentionally \nviolate our environmental laws deserve the full force of the government \nto stop them.\n  Our families and communities also deserve our most vigorous efforts \nto protect them from the specter of terror. Chemical and biological \nthreats represent one of the most sinister means for men to terrorize \neach other.\n  We will send our homeland security agencies the environmental \nexpertise and personnel they need to confront these threats.\n  We will also send our local communities new help for additional \ndrinking water security protections.\n  Our environment deserves no less, our families deserve no less. I \nurge my colleagues to support passage and funding of the Environmental \nEnforcement and Security Act of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 2270. A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wish to talk this afternoon about a bill \nthat my colleagues, Senator Kohl, Senator Grassley, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Specter, Senator Schumer, Senator Leahy, Senator Coleman, and I \nare introducing, which is called the No Oil Producing and Exporting \nCartels Act of 2004. We are introducing this bill to address the \nlongstanding problem of foreign governments acting in the commercial \narena to fix, allocate, and establish production and price levels of \npetroleum products.\n  Every consumer in America knows that gasoline prices have reached \nrecord highs over the last couple of weeks. The national average has \nreached a new record high for self-serve unleaded gas. That is \napproximately $1.80 per gallon. But over the last week in my home State \nof Ohio gas prices have been even higher. In Marietta, gas was $1.84; \nin Cleveland, $1.86; in Columbus, it topped out at $1.88 in some \nstations. Many analysts predict that prices could get as high as $2 per \ngallon, or higher, by the summer.\n  This is of particular interest to me because Ohio and the Midwestern \nStates always seem to be hit especially hard by gas prices spikes. \nThese spikes are acutely painful to persons who commute long distances \nand to those who live on fixed incomes such as the elderly.\n  What is the cause? Certainly there are many causes, but as we might \nexpect, there are a number of factors at play. But there is surprising \nagreement among industry experts about the primary cause of high gas \nprices and that is the increase in imported crude oil prices.\n  We also know the biggest factor in setting crude oil prices is OPEC. \nThe unacceptably high price of imported crude oil is a direct result of \ncollusive agreements among OPEC nations to maintain the price of oil.\n  Despite the fact that gasoline prices are going through the roof, \nOPEC members met yesterday in Austria and decided to cut the output of \noil even further. We have been through this process more than enough to \nknow what that means for the American consumer. When demand is high and \nsupplies are cut, that obviously means higher prices. That is exactly \nwhat OPEC did to us yesterday. It ripped off American consumers by \nraising gas prices even more.\n  this is an outrage. In fact, OPEC is probably the most notorious \nexample of an illegal cartel in the world today, even at a time when it \nis widely understood that such conduct is counterproductive and ill-\nsuited for our global economy. Supreme Court Justice Scalia in a recent \ncase described collusion among competitors as ``the supreme evil of \nantitrust.'' Nation after nation has adopted antitrust enforcement \nprinciples that recognize the illegality of price fixing and output \nrestrictions among competitors. In 1998, the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, then composed of twenty-nine member \nnations, issued a formal recommendation denouncing price fixing. OPEC's \ncontinued actions, in ongoing defiance of American and international \nantitrust principles, should not be tolerated.\n\n  Until now, however, OPEC has effectively received special treatment \nunder U.S. antitrust laws--despite the fact that oil is a commodity \nthat touches the lives of nearly every American consumer. It is time \nthat we take steps to assure that oil is subject to the principles of \nthe free market. The bill that we are introducing today would do just \nthat and help in the fight to lower gas prices.\n  Senator Kohl and I have introduced this bill twice before--in 2000 \nand 2001. It is an idea whose time has come. The purpose of our NOPEC \nbill is simple--it would treat OPEC like any other cartel. If OPEC were \na group of private companies colluding on prices, the executives could \nbe prosecuted and sent to jail, and the firms would pay millions of \ndollars in fines or maybe even billions in fines. Unfortunately, \nhowever, for years enforcement has been constrained by two related \ncourt opinions.\n  In 1979, a Federal District Court found that OPEC's price-setting \ndecisions were ``governmental'' acts and accordingly that they were \ngiven sovereignty status and protected by the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act. Subsequently, in 1981, a Federal Court of Appeals \ndeclined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so-\ncalled ``act of state'' doctrine.\n  NOPEC would effectively reverse these decisions by making it clear \nthat OPEC's activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that \nthe Federal courts should not decline to hear such a case based on the \n``act of state'' doctrine. As a result, under NOPEC, the Department of \nJustice and the Federal Trade Commission could bring a legal antitrust \nenforcement action against foreign states engaging in the restraint of \ntrade regarding oil and other petroleum products. Simply put, NOPEC \nassures that our U.S. antitrust agencies have jurisdiction and \nauthority to bring such cases.\n  We don't intend to give up the fight for lower gasoline prices. \nToday, I want the members of OPEC to hear a message loud and clear--we \nwon't quit fighting for American consumers. When OPEC wants to do \nbusiness with America, it must abide by our antitrust laws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Oil Producing and \n     Exporting Cartels Act of 2004 '' or ``NOPEC''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SHERMAN ACT.\n\n       The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended by adding \n     after section 7 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7A.

Mr. President, in recent weeks, consumers all across the \nNation have watched gas prices rise, seemingly without any end in \nsight. On March 24, U.S. gasoline prices reached a record high average \nof $ 1.74 a gallon. And, if consumers weren't paying enough already, \njust yesterday the OPEC nations decided to cut production by a million \nbarrels a day, an action sure to drive prices even higher. Such \nblatantly anti-competitive action by the oil cartel violates the most \nbasic principles of fair competition and free markets and should not be \ntolerated. It is for this reason that I rise today, with my colleagues \nSenators DeWine, Specter, Leahy, Feingold, Schumer, Coleman and \nGrassley, to reintroduce the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels \nAct'' ( ``NOPEC\"). This legislation is identical to our NOPEC bill \nintroduced in the last two Congresses, a bill which passed the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously in 2000.\n  Real people suffer real consequences every day in our nation because \nof OPEC's actions. Rising gas prices are a silent tax that takes hard-\nearned money away from Americans every time they visit the gas pump. \nHigher oil prices drive up the cost of transportation, harming \nthousands of companies throughout the economy from trucking to \naviation. And those costs are passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices for manufactured goods. Higher oil prices mean higher \nheating oil and electricity costs. Anyone who has gone through a \nMidwest winter or a deep South summer can tell you about the tremendous \npersonal costs associated with higher home heating or cooling bills.\n  We have all heard many explanations offered for rising energy prices. \nSome say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some blame \ndisruptions in supply. Others point to the EPA requirement mandating \nuse of a new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas in the \nMidwest or other ``boutique'' fuels around the country. Some even claim \nthat refiners and distributors have illegally fixed prices. On this \nissue, Senator DeWine and I have asked the Federal Trade Commission to \ninvestigate these allegations. As a result of our inquiries, the FTC \nhas put a task force in place to find out if those allegations were \ntrue. While we continue to urge the FTC to be vigilant, the FTC has to \ndate found no evidence of illegal domestic price fixing as a cause of \nhigher gas prices.\n  But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable: the price \nfixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations. For years, this conspiracy has \nunfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed \nof the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \ngovernment has yet tried to take any action. NOPEC will, for the first \ntime, establish clearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil \nproducers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict supply or set \nprices, they are violating U.S. law. It will authorize the Attorney \nGeneral or FTC to file suit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our \nbill will also make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind \nthe doctrines of ``Sovereign Immunity'' or ``Act of State'' to escape \nthe reach of American justice.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. And we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  Some critics of this legislation have argued that suing OPEC will not \nwork or that threatening suit will hurt more than help. I disagree. Our \nNOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our authorities to \ntake legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing conspiracy of \nthe oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real deterrent effect on \nnations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices to the detriment of \nconsumers. This legislation will be the first real weapon the U.S. \ngovernment has ever had to deter OPEC from its seemingly endless cycle \nof price increases.\n  There is nothing remarkable about applying U.S. antitrust law \noverseas. Our government has not hesitated to do so when faced with \nclear evidence of anti-competitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers. A few years ago, for example, the Justice Department secured \nrecord fines totaling $725 million against German and Swiss companies \nengaged in a price fixing conspiracy to raise and fix the price of \nvitamins sold in the United States and elsewhere. Their behavior harmed \nconsumers by raising the prices consumers paid for vitamins every day \nand plainly needed to be addressed. As this and other cases show, the \nmere fact that the conspirators are foreign nations is no basis to \nshield them from violating these most basic standards of fair economic \nbehavior.\n  Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the \ninternational oil cartel would be in gross violation of antitrust law \nif engaged in by private companies. If OPEC were a group of \ninternational private companies rather than foreign governments, their \nactions would be nothing more than an illegal price fixing scheme. But \nOPEC members have used the shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape \naccountability for their price-fixing. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct, though, already recognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of \nnations is not protected by sovereign immunity. And it is hard to \nimagine an activity that is more obviously commercial than selling oil \nfor profit, as the OPEC nations do. Our legislation will correct one \nerroneous twenty-year-old lower federal court decision and establish \nthat sovereign immunity doctrine will not divest a U.S. court from \njurisdiction to hear a lawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel \nare violating antitrust law.\n  In the last few weeks, I have grown more certain than ever that this \nlegislation is necessary. Between OPEC's decision yesterday to cut oil \nproduction and the FTC's conclusion for the last several years that \nthere is no illegal conduct by domestic companies responsible for \nrising gas prices, I am convinced that we need to take action, and take \naction now, before the damage spreads too far.\n  For these reasons, I urge that my colleagues support this bill so \nthat our nation will finally have an effective means to combat this \nselfish conspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2271. A bill to establish national standards for discharges from \ncruise vessels into the waters of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Cruise \nShip Act of 2004. I am proud to be joined by Senators Lautenberg, \nCorzine, Feinstein, Kennedy and Boxer in offering this legislation. I \nalso am honored to be working with Congressman Farr, who is leading \ncompanion legislation\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nin the House and is a co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus.\n  America's oceans span nearly 4.5 million square miles, an area 23 \npercent larger than the nation's land area. They are a resource for \ntravel, commerce, recreation and the global ecosystem. They comprise 70 \npercent of our planet.\n  We cannot continue to take this vast resource for granted. The Pew \nCommission found in June 2003 that our oceans are in crisis. The report \ncites five priorities: implementing a sustainable national ocean \npolicy; coordinating the governance of ocean resources; reorienting our \nfisheries policy to emphasize sustainability; protecting ocean habitat \nand managing coastal development; and controlling the sources of \npollution threatening our marine ecosystems. Today I want to \nconcentrate on the fifth priority: controlling pollution.\n  With growing amounts of pollution caused by human activity, we are \nsignificantly degrading the marine environment. According to the EPA, \npollution has rendered 44 percent of tested estuaries and 12 percent of \nocean shoreline miles unfit for swimming, fishing or supporting aquatic \nlife. The Coast Guard estimates that marine debris is responsible for \nthe deaths of more than 1 million birds and 100,000 marine mammals each \nyear. About 90 percent of Florida's coral reefs are believed to be dead \nor dying.\n  We have taken some actions to protect our oceans, but we still have a \nlong way to go. We need to improve enforcement of our existing \nenvironmental protection laws, but we also need to update them to \naccommodate for the changing times.\n  Specifically, we need to address pollution from passenger cruise \nships. The cruise line industry has grown significantly over the past \n34 years. In 1970, cruise ships carried 500,000 passengers in the \nUnited States. In 2002, the cruise line industry carried 6.5 million \npassengers in about 150 ships in the United States, and that number has \ncontinued to grow.\n  In addition to a tremendous increase in the number of passengers, \ncruise ships themselves have grown. Today the average cruise vessel \naccommodates 3,100 passengers and crew. Carnival recently built the \nlargest passenger ship in the world, the Queen Mary 2: it's 1,132 feet \nlong, which is more than twice as long as the Washington Monument is \ntall; it is 236 feet high, about the height of a 23-story building; and \nit weights about 151,400 long tons, the rough equivalent of 390 fully \nloaded 747 jets.\n  According to the EPA, a typical 3,000 passenger cruise ship each week \ngenerates 210,000 gallons of sewage; 1 million gallons of gray water, \nincluding runoff from baths, laundry machines and dishwashers; and \n37,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Ships of the size of cruise vessels \ntoday, which generate the amount of waste of today, did not exist when \nthe Clean Water Act and other environmental laws were written in the \n1970s. Therefore, our laws regarding cruise ships are grossly \ninadequate.\n  My colleagues may be shocked to learn that it is legal to dump raw \nsewage 3 miles from shore; and it is legal to dump sewage within 3 \nmiles so long as it is run through a machine, which complies with a \nstandard that is over 20 years old and which is never rigorously tested \nonce installed. Also it is legal to dump gray water--which can contain \nharmful toxins and nutrients--anywhere in the ocean. Only Alaskan \nwaters are protected by strong federal legislation enacted in 2000 that \nregulates sewage and graywater.\n  The legislation I am introducing today,the Clean Cruise Ship Act of \n2004, would draw from key provisions of the federal law in place in \nAlaska and the Clean Water Act. This bill would: first, create a no \ndischarge zone that would prevent dumping of sewage, graywater and oily \nbilge water within 12 miles of shore--to protect our coasts and \nestuaries; second, apply the current Alaskan standards to sewage and \ngraywater discharges outside of 12 miles from shore; third, allow the \nCoast Guard and EPA to jointly issue discharge requirements based on \nthe best available technology, with the goal of zero pollutants by \n2015; and finally, strengthen enforcement.\n  Studies show that the Alaskan standards, which our bills applies to \nthe rest of the country, can be achieved. Indeed, ships that have been \nupgraded to treat sewage and graywater with modern technology are \neasily meeting or exceeding standards for such constituents as fecal \ncoliform and chlorine.\n  Not only is this bill technologically feasible: it is affordable. The \ncost to upgrade each ship will be more than $3 million. To put this \ninto context, Carnival Cruise Lines just spent $800 million to build \nthe new Queen Mary 2, and earned $6.7 billion in revenues last year.,\n  The Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2004 is a reasonable approach to an \nurgent problem. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2272. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nexpand the pediatric vaccine distribution program to include coverage \nfor children administered a vaccine at a public health clinic or Indian \nclinic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in conjunction with Senator Smith, I am \nintroducing the ``Children's Vaccine Access Act of 2004.'' This \nlegislation makes three changes to the Vaccines for Children program \nwith the intent of expanding access and the delivery of vaccines to our \nNation's children. This legislation is supported by the Administration \nand included in the Administration's budget as recommended by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.\n  First, the legislation expands access to the Vaccines for Children, \nor VFC, program for children whose private health insurance does not \ncover immunizations by allowing children to receive their VFC vaccines \nat State and local public health clinics. Currently, underinsured \nchildren must go to specially designated Federal Qualified Health \nCenters or rural health centers to receive VFC vaccines. Consequently, \nour bill expands the number of access points at which children can get \nthe vaccines they need.\n  According to the CDC, there are approximately 3,000 Federally \nQualified Health Centers enrolled in VFC, compared with approximately \n7,000 health department clinics. As the CDC notes, ``Increasing access \npoints for VFC eligible underinsured children will allow those who may \nhave been previously denied immunizations at public health clinics to \nbe vaccinated with the full series of routinely administered \nvaccines.''\n  Second, the bill seeks to restore the tetanus and diphtheria vaccines \nto the VFC program by lifting the 1993 price caps that were in use \nprior to enactment of the VFC program. The price caps are so low that, \nfor example, the tetanus booster vaccine was unfortunately dropped from \nVFC coverage when no vaccine manufacturer would bid on the contract at \nthe 1993-imposed price cap levels.\n  CDC estimates that over 200,000 additional children would be served \nthrough VFC with these two changes.\n  And finally, the bill includes new authorizing language to allow the \nCDC to sell the VFC purchased stockpile vaccines to its grantees or \nback to manufacturers for use in the private sector in the event that \nthe stockpiled vaccines are needed by non VFC-eligible children.\n  Immunizations are critical to both children's health and the public \nhealth care system. The VFC program began on October 1, 1994, to \nimprove vaccine availability to children nationwide by providing \nvaccines free-of-charge to Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, underinsured, \nAmerican Indian, or Alaska Native children through both public and \nprivate providers. The VFC program automatically covers vaccines \nrecommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or \nACIP, and approved by the CDC.\n  VFC has had an enormous impact on improving the immunization rates \namong our Nation's children. According to the Children's Defense Fund, \n``Between 1993 and 1999, there was nearly a 20 percent increase in the \nnumber of fully immunized two year-olds.''\n  However, the goal of achieving a 90 percent immunization coverage \nrate, with the complete series of recommended vaccines, has still not \nbeen achieved. According to the National Immunization Survey (NIS), the \nnationwide vaccination coverage levels\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\namong children 19-35 months of age for the 4:3:1:3:3 series of \nchildhood immunizations was 74.8 percent in 2002. Unfortunately, the \nimmunization rate in New Mexico was just 64.6 percent in 2002 and \nsecond worst in the Nation to only Colorado. To address that problem, \nin December 2001, I requested the CDC to work with the State of New \nMexico on improving its immunization rate and a number of positive \ndevelopments have taken place, including the creation of an \nImmunization Task Force at the state level and the passage of \nlegislation to create an immunization registry by the New Mexico \nLegislature this past month.\n  It is my belief that the strides the Nation and New Mexico continue \nto make to further improve the childhood immunization rate is assisted \nby this legislation. I would like to thank the CDC for their fine work \non the VFC program and their assistance with this legislation and in \nits assistance directly to the State of New Mexico. I would also like \nto thank Senator Smith for his dedication and support for this \ninitiative to improve the health of our Nation's children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide increased rail transportation security; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator Hollings and other \nmembers of the Senate Commerce Committee in introducing the Rail \nSecurity Act of 2004.\n  The recent attacks on Madrid's commuter rail system demonstrated all \ntoo vividly that our own transit system, Amtrak, and the freight \nrailroads could be vulnerable to terrorist attack. Only modest \nresources have been dedicated to rail security since the September 11, \n2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and efforts to address \nrail security remain fragmented. The Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) has not completed a vulnerability assessment for the rail system, \nnor is there an integrated security plan that reflects the unique \ncharacteristics of passenger and freight rail operations.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would authorize resources to \nensure rail transportation security receives a high priority in our \nefforts to secure our country from terrorism. The legislation directs \nDHS to complete a vulnerability assessment for the rail system and make \nrecommendations for addressing security weaknesses within 180 days of \nenactment. It also authorizes funding to address long-standing fire and \nlife safety needs for several tunnels along the Northeast Corridor, and \nauthorizes appropriations to meet immediate security needs for \nintercity and freight rail transportation. Further, as recommended by \nthe General Accounting Office, the proposal requires DHS to sign a \nmemorandum of agreement with the Department of Transportation to make \nclear each department's roles and responsibilities with respect to rail \nsecurity.\n  The freight railroads, individual commuter authorities, and Amtrak \nhave, on their own initiative, completed risk assessments and taken \nsteps to safeguard passengers, facilities, and cargo. These efforts, \naccomplished at a very small cost to the federal government, have \nhelped make our rail system safer. The legislation introduced today \nwill augment these efforts and bring these individual initiatives \ntogether in a coordinated rail security program.\n  More than 2 years ago, in the aftermath of the September 11th \nattacks, the Commerce Committee reported rail security legislation but \nunfortunately that proposal was not adopted by the full Senate. The \nCommerce Committee will meet in the coming weeks to consider this \nlegislation and it is my hope that the proposal will be acted upon \nquickly by the full Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand and improve retired pay, burial, education, \nand other mobilization benefits for members of the National Guard and \nReserves who are called or ordered to active duty, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to introduce and send to the desk \nthe 21st Century Citizen Soldier Benefits Act which I introduce on \nbehalf of myself.\n  I thought I would take a moment this afternoon to outline the \nframework and the context of this bill because it has to do with our \nArmed Forces. It has to do with a very important component of our Armed \nForces, which is our Guard and Reserve units, part of our total force, \na very important part of that total force as I hope to outline.\n  This is an attempt to put before the Senate and the Congress a \ncomprehensive bill--one that I find and I know people in Louisiana \nacross party lines and in very energetic and enthusiastic ways support \nbecause the need is so great--to support our men and women in uniform, \nparticularly our Guard and Reserve components.\n  If the war on terror is teaching us anything--and we are learning \nsome tough lessons each and every day as we move forward through this \nwar--we all know we cannot defend this Nation adequately without the \nstrength provided by our National Guard and Reserves.\n  Since 9/11 when this country was attacked, the first time in this \nlarge measure since the attack on Pearl Harbor many years ago, over \n355,000 guardsmen and reservists have been mobilized.\n  To give a grasp of that number, our Navy today, arguably the most \npowerful in the world, has 375,000 sailors. So in 2\\1/2\\ years, we have \ncalled up almost enough guardsmen and reservists to man every ship in \nthe United States Navy. That is a lot of manpower and a lot of \nwomanpower, and they deserve our very best effort. They are not just \nbackfilling for Active Forces. They are serving on the front lines, as \nwe have seen today how brutal those front lines can be. They are being \nwounded and killed just like our Active Forces. In fact, 97 of the 600 \ndeaths in Iraq have been Guard and Reserve deaths.\n  Today 176,000 citizen soldiers wear the uniform full time, and that \nnumber, as I will show, is growing exponentially. By May 1, 40 percent \nof the\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\ntroops in Iraq will be members of the National Guard and Reserve. These \nare men and women who have full-time jobs, who are coaches, small \nbusiness owners, policemen, firemen, State workers, and waiters and \nwaitresses in our restaurants. They hold many jobs, but they are then \ncalled up. They take off their daily dress clothes and put on the \nuniform and go to the front lines to protect us.\n  In Louisiana, and I know this is true in Texas, thousands of men and \nwomen have been called up.\n  We have 3,051 reservists on active duty right now. Over 6,000 \nLouisiana reservists have been activated since \n9/11. For many, their activation periods have unfortunately lasted, \nbecause of the demand on our troops, sometimes in excess of 18 months \nto 24 months. The 528th Engineering Battalion from Monroe, LA, recently \ndeployed to Afghanistan, 500 Louisianans on their way serving already. \nMarine Reserve Company B of Bossier City, 150 Marines have just been \nput on alert for mobilization. Company B has already been mobilized \nbefore.\n  Last month, the Department of Defense put another 18,000 National \nGuardsmen on alert status, including 3,800 members from Louisiana's \n256th Separate Infantry Brigade. I will be visiting their leaders on \nMonday, in Lafayette, LA, and be visiting with their families to talk \nabout the separation that is going to occur and how we are doing as a \nnation, as a State, and as a community, to help them through this \ndifficult time as they help, protect, and give us their very best in \nthis war effort.\n  The National Guard and Reserve, as I said, make up now 45 percent of \nour forces. We simply cannot fight without them. Yet as I am going to \nexplain, the benefits, their pensions, their compensation, their GI \nbenefits, their retirement benefits, and even their burial benefits do \nnot match with their level of service and do not match with the \ncontribution they are, in fact, making.\n  I understand why because when the framework for the Guard and \nReserves was initially put together, they were thought of as sort of a \nbackup, as a filler.\n  They do other things as well other than, of course, fighting wars. \nThey help our States mobilize at times of national and natural \ndisasters. So I am clear, as are many of us, about why initially, as \nthe Guard and Reserve was created and the framework developed, those \nrules and regulations were put into place back in the 1940s, in the \n1960s, and in the 1970s.\n  In 2004, the times are different. The demands are great and they are \nmeeting this challenge. As a Congress we need to meet them more than \nhalfway.\n  Nearly 35,000 have been mobilized more than once. Imagine returning \nfrom Afghanistan, reuniting with your family, getting your business \nrestarted, getting back into the desk you left before you went to \nserve, only to be told to get ready because you are leaving in another \nfew months, get ready to ship out again.\n  We have a retention and recruiting crisis looming on the horizon. I \nwould like to show the number of troops, reservists, who have been \ncalled up from 1953 through 1989, through the Berlin crisis of 1961, \nthrough the Cuban missile crisis, and the Vietnam war, we called up a \ntotal of 199,877, about 200,000, through all of this, three times in 40 \nyears. Since 1990, in the last 14 years, we have called up 634,984--the \nPersian Gulf war, the intervention in Haiti, Bosnian peacekeeping, \nOperation Southern Watch, the Kosovo conflict, now our ongoing war on \nterrorism, which has many fronts, primarily in Afghanistan and in Iraq. \nThat is unprecedented in terms of our recent history.\n  The question to us should be: Are we doing what we should as we are \nincreasing our military budget substantially? I, for one, have \nsupported each and every increase and almost argued in many instances \nfor more money going to our military. What portion of that increase is \ngoing to the Guard and Reserve to make sure their pensions are intact, \nthat when they retire their compensation is fair, that their families \nare cared for at least at a decent and adequate level while they serve \nus so magnificently and so beautifully? So we can see we are calling \nmore and more on our Guard and Reserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excellent \narticle that appeared in the Washington Post in January of this year by \nMr. Vernon Loeb, a very excellent staff writer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 2004]\n\n               Army Reserve Chief Fears Retention Crisis\n\n                            (By Vernon Loeb)\n\n       The head of the Army Reserve said yesterday that the \n     205,000-soldier force must guard against a potential crisis \n     in its ability to retain troops, saying serious problems are \n     being ``masked'' temporarily because reservists are barred \n     from leaving the military while their units are mobilized in \n     Iraq.\n       Lt. Gen. James R. Helmly said his staff is working on an \n     overhaul of the reserve aimed in part at treating soldiers \n     better and being more honest with them about how long they're \n     likely to be deployed. Helmly said the reserve force \n     bureaucracy bungled the mobilization of soldiers for the war \n     in Iraq, and gave them a ``pipe dream'' instead of honest \n     information about how long they might have to remain there.\n       ``This is the first extended-duration war our Nation has \n     fought with an all-volunteer force,'' said Helmly. ``We must \n     be sensitive to that. And we must apply proactive, preventive \n     measures to prevent a recruiting-retention crisis.''\n       Helmly said his staff is engaged in an overhaul of the \n     reserve aimed at turning the Army's part-time soldiers into a \n     top-flight fighting force that can handle the strains of the \n     global war on terrorism. In a Pentagon briefing for defense \n     reporters, Helmly outlined an array of planned changes and \n     bluntly described the force he took over in May 2002 as being \n     dominated by bureaucrats who often ignored soldiers' needs.\n       In a recent memo, Helmly said, he told his subordinates \n     that he was ``really tired of going to see our reserve \n     soldiers [and finding] they're short such simple things as \n     goggles. It's about damn time you listen to your lawyers less \n     and your conscience more. That will probably get me in \n     trouble. But I told them, I want this stuff fixed.''\n       Reservists in Iraq have long complained about having to \n     spend a year there with inadequate equipment, including a \n     lack of body armor.\n       Most reservists went to Iraq last year on year-long \n     mobilizations, with a belief that they would be required to \n     spend only 6 months in the country. But they were abruptly \n     informed in September that they would have to spend 12 months \n     in Iraq, pushing the total length of many reservists' \n     mobilizations to 16 months or longer.\n       Analysts inside and outside the military say these long \n     overseas mobilizations could have the effect of driving \n     reservists out of the military in droves once they begin \n     returning from Iraq over the next several months. After that, \n     the service will lift the ``stop-loss'' provisions that \n     prohibit soldiers from quitting the reserve when their \n     hitches are up.\n       Helmly said he has not been surprised by such criticism. \n     ``The [Iraq] mobilization was so fraught with friction that \n     it really put a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths,'' he \n     said. ``We had about 10,000 who had less than 5 days' notice \n     that they were going to be mobilized. Then we had about 8,000 \n     who were mobilized, got trained up, and never deployed.''\n       ``No sooner do the statues of Saddam Hussein start tumbling \n     down, then the guidance was, start planning to demobilize \n     everybody,'' Helmly said, only to find in July that a growing \n     insurgency required remobilizing 4,000 to 5,000 of the 8,000 \n     that were initially mobilized but never deployed.\n       ``One lesson I have certainly learned . . . it is \n     imperative that we communicate with our soldiers and their \n     families in advance, and that we not set false \n     expectations,'' Helmly said.\n       To that end, Helmly said, a ``major order culture change'' \n     is taking place in the reserve so that reservists know, upon \n     joining, that they will be called up to active duty for \n     between 9 and 12 months every 4 to 5 years.\n       As part of that change, he said, the current total of 2,091 \n     reserve units will be reduced significantly so that every \n     unit--typically a support company of about 150 soldiers--is \n     manned, equipped and ready to go to war, if necessary.\n       Currently, 226,000 soldiers would be necessary to man all \n     those units. But the Army Reserve is only authorized by \n     Congress to have 205,000 soldiers, Helmly said, and at any \n     given time, only between 160,000 and 175,000 of them are \n     available for mobilization.\n       ``We will in fact inactivate units beginning next year \n     specifically to harvest the strength so we can man fully our \n     remaining units,'' Helmly said, adding that maintenance and \n     ``water support'' units will be reduced in favor of more \n     military police, civil affairs and heavy truck transport \n     detachments.\n       ``I'm often asked by families, how do you know you'll be \n     able to recruit for this force?'' Helmly said. ``There are no \n     knowns; we're treading new virgin territory here. But most of \n     our people will respond well to the initiatives we're putting \n     forward. They don't wish to be part of a second-class team.''\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. According to this reporter:\n\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\n\n       The head of the Army Reserve said yesterday that the \n     205,000-soldier force must guard against a potential crisis \n     in its ability to retain troops, saying serious problems are \n     being ``masked'' temporarily because reservists are barred \n     from leaving the military while their units are mobilized in \n     Iraq.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Lieutenant General Helmly told his subordinates that he was \n     ``really tired of going to see our reserve soldiers [and \n     finding] they're short such simple things as goggles. It's \n     about damn time you listen to your lawyers less and your \n     conscience more. They will probably get me in trouble. But I \n     told them, I want this stuff fixed.''\n\n  Not only are these men and women being called up in unprecedented \nnumbers, not only are they being prevented from leaving, which is \nmasking a potential readiness crisis, but they are also not being \nprovided with some of the basic tools, equipment, and body armor that \nthey need to protect themselves; therefore, contributing to a state of \nunease.\n  Not that these guardsmen and reservists are not patriotic, not that \nthey would not walk across hot coals, and in many instances they do \nevery day to protect us, but we should at least be able to take these \nmodest steps to make sure we are strengthening them and honoring their \nservice to us.\n  The operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo are ongoing, with no \nend in sight. We do not know if emergent threats around the world will \nbecome real and embroil us in yet other military operations, partially \nbecause our Active Forces are stretched so thin we need to call up our \nGuard and Reserve, and yet because of this we could face a retention \ncrisis.\n  As I said, the deployments are lengthy, the benefits and legal \nprotections are not sufficient in many instances, and the equipment is \nlacking. So let us hope we can take steps through this legislation and \nothers to fix this situation.\n  I hope the bill I offer today and sponsor today--and I look forward \nto many cosponsors joining on this bill--will improve the Guard and \nReserve benefits, and legal protections. As I said, we are calling it \nthe 21st Century Citizen Soldier Benefit Act.\n  We have had two major changes or improvements to the Guard and \nReserve framework, one in 1940 and one in 1994. It is time, 10 years \nlater, this year, 2004, with the unprecedented nature of their service, \nto step up this framework of support for our Guard and Reserve. It is \ntime for Congress, in my opinion, to take a comprehensive look at the \nbenefits and protections afforded to the members of the Guard and \nReserve.\n  We have not done so since 1994. It is time that we do this. My bill \ndoes it in several ways.\n  First, we call for equal benefits for equal service in the area of \nburial benefits, for activated Guard and Reserve should be the same as \nActive Duty. Guardsmen and Reservists cannot be buried in national \ncemeteries unless they are killed in action. Think about that. A man or \na woman serves not just for 6 months, but maybe 2 years, comes home, is \ncalled back to go again, dodges the bullets, gets past the landmines, \nperhaps is seriously injured but escapes unscathed and comes home after \nserving valiantly, and then is denied burial benefits because they were \nnot ``killed in action.'' I think because of what they have done, it is \ntime for us to give them the right opportunities for burial in our \nnational cemeteries if they are serving the time that our Active Duty \nserve, with all the dignity that they would deserve in such a \nsituation.\n  The bill does not authorize every member of the Guard and Reserve to \nthese burial rights, but it is inconceivable why someone who fought \noverseas for our Nation cannot be buried with his or her comrades \nsimply because one soldier was in the Reserve and one soldier was \nactive--fighting side by side, same foxhole, same patrol, same landmine \nbut yet not the same burial ground.\n  No. 2, we hope in this bill that guardsmen and reservists activated \nfor 2 years should have active duty GI bill benefits--the GI bill, \nwhich is probably one of the best pieces of legislation this Congress \nhas ever passed, it is referred to hundreds of time in speeches on and \noff the floor, and is one of the bills Americans generally know about, \nquote, and can say what it does. It has enabled millions of American \ntroops to enroll in college when they returned from World War II. The \nGI bill created a bedrock of middle-class Americans. It was one of the \ncornerstones that helped us build the middle class, and it ushered in \n50 years of unprecedented economic growth. Why? Because when people get \ngood training and good education, their earning potential goes up and \nthe contribution they can make to their community rises in a \nsignificant way.\n  Today, members of the Active-Duty Forces receive more in GI benefits \nthan the Guard and Reserve personnel, and if the Guard and Reserve \npersonnel weren't contributing in equal ways to our active duty, I \nwould not be here arguing for them, but they are contributing in equal \nways, putting their lives in danger. Our bill will allow them to \nparticipate more equally in the GI benefits.\n  The third part of this bill would seek to create parity between \nReserve components and Active Duty in terms of their retirement age. \nRight now, Active Duty can leave the military once they serve 20 years. \nWe think that is a great benefit. It is one of the attractions to the \nmilitary service. Many of our military men and women serve honorably \nfor 20 years and then retire to go off and have yet a second and third \ncareer, as lifespans continue to increase. We are proud of that. We \nbelieve and know they contribute in many ways even past their service.\n  But Guard and Reserve today cannot collect retirement until 60 years \nof age. This bill would reduce it to 55 years and end what is an unjust \nsituation and help them. Hopefully it will address part of this \nretention issue by making these benefits more generous.\n  The fourth and I think one of the most important issues this bill \nseeks to address is ending the pay gap faced by guardsmen and \nreservists. Mr. President, I don't know if in Texas you have had a lot \nof people complain to you about this, but I sure have had people in \nLouisiana come up and say to me, Senator, I can't possibly understand \nhow we would ask someone to put on their uniform, go to Iraq, and take \na 40-percent, 30-percent, or 20-percent cut in pay, to put their life \non the line while we enjoy all the benefits staying home here in a safe \nplace here on the homefront. It is not that we have not had challenges \nright here on the homefront, but not to the same degree and intensity \nas we are finding on the front lines of the battlefield.\n  Yet the fact is, because there is no tax credit in our law right now \nand because it is not mandatory for employers--or the Federal \nGovernment, I might add, which is something Senator Durbin and I have \nworked very hard on together--to maintain their salaries at the level \nbefore they leave, some of these guardsmen and reservists are actually \ntaking a 30-percent or 40-percent cut in pay to serve us and to keep us \nsafe. That means while they are making the sacrifice on the \nbattlefield, which many of these men and women are willing to make, we \nare asking their spouses and their children to give up the car, sell \nthe house, give up their college fund, and it is simply not fair in a \ncountry that has the resources we have. In this Congress we want to \ngive tax credits to everybody in the world for everything under the \nsun. I don't know how we can't find the few hundreds of millions of \ndollars that it would take to give this tax credit to allow people to \nserve in the Guard and Reserve and just maintain their salary level \nwhile they serve so it doesn't put their families in jeopardy.\n  I am going to go visit our troops in Lafayette on Monday. I know the \ncommunity comes together. I know the women, many of them, join together \nfor bake sales and help out and pay each other's car payments. \nSometimes the community pulls together to pay the mortgage on the \nhouse. I think that is wonderful and it is the good old American \nspirit. But I don't know if it is necessary, not when we are giving out \ntax credits to companies that are taking jobs overseas, not when we are \ngiving out tax credits to people who make millions and are not putting \non the uniform. The least we can do is help our businesses to write off \nwhat they would have as a voluntary compensation package to maintain \nthis salary level for the men and women serving overseas to minimize \nthe sacrifice made by their families here at home. It would also \nrequire the Federal Government to step up to the plate\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\nand, as one of the largest employers in the Nation, to make sure those \nsalaries are compensated.\n  Let me share stories, one or two, from these families. There was an \nApril 22, 2003 article from USA Today that I will ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Apr. 22, 2003]\n\n                     Reservists Under Economic Fire\n\n       Washington.--Drastic pay cuts. Bankruptcy. Foreclosed \n     homes. They aren't exactly the kind of challenges that \n     members of America's military reserves signed up for when \n     they volunteered to serve their country.\n       But for many, the biggest threat to the home front isn't \n     Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It's the bill collector.\n       Four in 10 members of the National Guard or reserves lose \n     money when they leave their civilian jobs for active duty, \n     according to a Pentagon survey taken in 2000. Of 1.2 million \n     members, 223,000 are on active duty around the world.\n       Concern is growing in Congress, and several lawmakers in \n     both parties have introduced legislation to ease the \n     families' burden.\n       Janet Wright says she ``sat down and cried'' when she \n     realized how little money she and her children, Adelia, 5, \n     and Carolyn, 2, would have to live on when her husband was \n     sent to the Middle East. In his civilian job with an \n     environmental cleanup company, Russell Wright makes $60,000 a \n     year--twice what he'll be paid as a sergeant in the Marine \n     Forces Reserve. Back in Hammond, La., his wife, who doesn't \n     have a paying job, is pouring the kids more water and less \n     milk. She is trying to accelerate Carolyn's potty training \n     schedule to save on diapers.\n       She doesn't know how long she'll have to pinch pennies. \n     Like his fellow reservists, Russell Wright has been called up \n     for one year. He could be sent home sooner, or the military \n     could exercise its option to extend his tour of duty for a \n     second year. Even so, Janet Wright considers her family \n     lucky: She can still pay the mortgage, and the children's \n     pediatrician accepts Tricare, the military health plan.\n       Ray Korizon, a 23-year veteran with the Air Force Reserve \n     and an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration, says \n     his income will also be cut in half if his unit ships out. \n     Korizon, who lives in Schaumburg, Ill., knows the financial \n     costs of doing his patriotic duty from bitter experience. \n     Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he owned a Chicago \n     construction company with 26 employees. He was sent overseas \n     for six months and lost the business.\n       Still, he never considered leaving the reserve. Korizon \n     says he enjoys the work and the camaraderie. But he worries \n     about whether his two kids can continue to see the same \n     doctor when he shifts to military health coverage. ``It's \n     hard to go out and do the job you want to do when you're \n     worried about things back home,'' he says.\n       Once regarded as ``weekend warriors,'' they have become an \n     integral part of U.S. battle plans. Call-ups have been longer \n     and more frequent.\n       ``The last time you'd see this type of mobilization \n     activity was during World War II,'' says Maj. Charles Kohler \n     of the Maryland National Guard. Of the Maryland Guard's 8,000 \n     members, 3,500 are on active duty. Kohler knows several who \n     are in serious financial trouble. One had to file for \n     bankruptcy after a yearlong deployment, during which his \n     take-home pay fell by two-thirds.\n       Stories like that are the result of a shift in military \n     policy. Since the end of the Cold War, the ranks of the full-\n     time military have been reduced by one-third. The Pentagon \n     has increasingly relied on the nation's part-time soldiers. \n     More than 525,000 members of the Guards and reserves have \n     been mobilized in the 12 years since the Persian Gulf War. \n     For the previous 36 years, the figure was 199,877.\n       The end of fighting in Iraq isn't likely to lessen the \n     pressure on the Guard and reserves. They'll stay on with the \n     regular military in a peacekeeping role. Nobody knows how \n     long, but in Bosnia, Guard members and reservists are on duty \n     seven years after the mission began.\n       Korizon, who maintains avionics systems on C-130 cargo \n     planes, has been told his Milwaukee-based reserve unit may be \n     called up for humanitarian missions.\n       Some of the specialists who are in the greatest demand--\n     physicians and experts in biological and chemical agents--\n     command six-figure salaries in civilian life. The average pay \n     for a midlevel officer is $50,000 to $55,000.\n       ``They were prepared to be called up. They were prepared to \n     serve their country,'' Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., says. \n     ``They were not prepared to be part of a regular force and be \n     away from home 200 to 300 days a year.''\n       Concerns are growing on Capitol Hill. As the nation's \n     reliance on the Guard and reserves has increased, ``funding \n     for training and benefits simply have not kept up,'' says \n     Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a member of the \n     Armed Services Committee.\n       The General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing arm, is \n     studying pay and benefits for Guard members and reservists. A \n     report is due in September. Meanwhile, members of Congress \n     are pushing several bills to ease the burden:\n       Closing the pay gap. Some employers make up the difference \n     in salary for reservists on active duty. But many, including \n     the federal government, do not. A bill sponsored by \n     Democratic Sens. Mikulski, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mary \n     Landrieu of Louisiana would require the federal government to \n     make up lost pay. Landrieu is doing that for one legislative \n     aide who has been called up for active duty.\n       She has also introduced a bill to give private employers a \n     50% tax credit if they subsidize reservists' salaries.\n       Closing the health gap. Once on active duty, reservists, \n     Guard members and their families are covered by Tricare.\n       But for the 75% of reserve and Guard families living more \n     than 50 miles from military treatment facilities, finding \n     physicians who participate in Tricare can be difficult.\n       A measure sponsored by Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican from \n     Ohio, would give reservists and Guard members the option of \n     making Tricare their regular insurer or having the federal \n     government pay premiums for their civilian health insurance \n     while they are on active duty. Several senior Democrats, \n     including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota \n     and Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, support the idea.\n       Keeping creditors at bay. The Soldiers and Sailors Relief \n     Act caps interest rates on mortgages, car payments and other \n     debts owed by military personnel at 6% while they are on \n     active duty. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina \n     Republican who is the Senate's only reservist, says the act \n     doesn't apply to debts that are held in the name of a spouse \n     who is not a member of the military. He plans to introduce \n     legislation to cover spouses.\n       Despite a groundswell of support for troops, none of the \n     bills is assured of passage. There's concern among some \n     administration officials about the cost of some of the \n     proposals. In addition, some at the Pentagon think morale \n     would be hurt if some reservists end up with higher incomes \n     than their counterparts in the regular ranks.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It starts:\n\n       Drastic pay cuts. Bankruptcy. Foreclosed homes. They aren't \n     exactly the kind of challenges that members of America's \n     military reserves signed up for when they volunteered to \n     serve their country. But for many, the biggest threat to the \n     home front isn't Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden. It's the \n     bill collector.\n\n  And that is a shame. I think the two enemies mentioned before the \nbill collector are people we need to actually be focusing our attention \non, bringing them to justice in one case and finding them in the other. \nI don't think our troops need to be worried about bill collectors back \nhome, but that is the position we have them in because we have not \nacted, will not act, refuse to act in the face of giving everybody else \ntax credits, but we can't seem to find room in the budget for these \n634,000 of our bravest.\n  I want to say for the record, in Louisiana, Janet Wright's husband \nRussell is in the Marine Reserves. He made $60,000 a year. Russell was \nactivated. He will only make $30,000. Mrs. Wright says she started \nputting water in her children's cereal and hopes her daughter can be \nquickly potty trained to save on diapers. Mrs. Wright has to count \nevery penny.\n  This family is from Hammond, LA. I just don't think this is right. I \nthink we can do something about it, and this bill attempts to do that. \nA 50-percent tax credit to those employers to continue to pay their \nsalaries to fill this pay gap is part of this bill.\n  One other point of the bill, and then a short conclusion. We put a \ncap on interest rates. Many of us have loans out for a variety of \ndifferent purposes--automobiles, perhaps some business loans that have \nbeen made for our businesses, obviously mortgages. We put in an \ninterest rate cap so when you are deployed, you don't have to pay more \nthan a 6-percent rate. When rates were 20 percent and 25 percent, that \nmade a lot of sense and it was a great benefit. But as rates are \nrelatively low today, this bill would make a modest change to either \nhave it at 6 percent or prime plus 1. Again, it is not a huge amount of \nmoney, but it could potentially save a family a few hundred dollars a \nyear. It is the least we can do as part of trying to help them make \nends meet while their primary breadwinner in most cases is the one \ndeployed.\n  As Congress works to best give our military the tools they need to \nsucceed in the 21st century, we must reinforce and increase the \nbenefits and protections for our Reserves. We have asked so much of \nthem, and they have met every challenge with excellence. As we saw \nunfolding on our television screens yesterday and today, we couldn't \nask them to do more. The least we can do is to look at the package of \nbenefits,\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nupgrade it where we can, make sacrifices in other areas of our budget, \nand fund them first. They are the ones who are protecting us at this \ntime. When we can provide greater legal protections to ease the stress \non the homefront, we must, when and where we can. Failure to act will \njust exacerbate retention challenges. It will undermine our efforts to \nsucceed in our war on terror.\n  I introduce this bill today. I hope we can have a speedy hearing.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill so we can have \na great bipartisan effort. There are many other things we can so the \nGuard and Reserve really know we appreciate them, because we just do \nnot take pictures with them but we actually put them in our budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Daschle, \n        and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2275. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n101 et seq.) to provide for homeland security assistance for high-risk \nnonprofit organizations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Specter, Murray, Clinton, Landrieu, Dayton, Schumer, Daschle \nand Lieberman, to introduce the High-Risk Non-Profit Security and \nSafety Enhancement Act of 2004. This bill provides homeland security \nassistance for high-risk non-profits to protect them against foreign \nterrorist attacks. This legislation is critical to help protect the \n``soft targets'' of terrorism all over the United States.\n  We are all aware of recent terrorist attacks in the United States, \nSpain, Germany, Iraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco and Turkey. These attacks \nby Al Qaeda on an international Red Cross building, synagogues, train \nstations, hotels, airports, restaurants, night clubs, and cultural \ncenters, show its willingness to attack ``soft targets'' of all types \nin order to conduct its campaign of terror.\n  I want to make sure that our communities are protected and the \nbuildings where citizens live, learn and work are as secure as possible \nto safeguard American lives from a potential terrorist attack. Local \ncommunities are on the front lines in our war against terrorism. This \nCongress must do its share to make sure that they do not have to bear \nthe full cost of this war. This bill helps us do that by providing \nfunds for security enhancements in buildings that Americans visit \neveryday and by providing local law enforcement with added support for \nthe costs they incur in helping to guard these local buildings and \ncommunity centers.\n  Specifically, this legislation will provide up to $100 million in \nassistance to 501(c)(3) organizations demonstrating a high risk of \nterrorist attack based upon very specific standards. Organizations \nwishing to receive security enhancements under this Act must \ndemonstrate that they have experienced specific threats by \ninternational terrorist organizations, there were prior attacks against \nsimilarly situated organizations, there is vulnerability of the \nspecific site, the symbolic value of the site as a highly recognized \nAmerican Institution, or that they have a specific role in responding \nto terrorist attacks.\n  This bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to contract for \nsecurity enhancements to help these high-risk non-profit organizations. \nThese funds can only be used for security enhancements, such as \nconcrete barriers, and ``hardening'' of windows and doors, as well as \ntechnical assistance to assess needs, develop plans, and train \npersonnel. Funding under this Act can never be used for enhancements \nthat would only be reasonably necessary to protect from neighborhood \ncrime.\n  This bill also helps our vital first responders, those who are on the \nfrontline everyday helping to protect these ``soft targets.'' These men \nand women have the responsibility for protecting institutions against \nthe possibility of terrorist attack, while they are also responding to \nthe public safety needs of the entire community. By authorizing $50 \nmillion in grant funds for local police departments, this bill provides \nreal relief to local law enforcement who bear the growing costs \nassociated with providing heightened security to high-risk non-profits.\n\n  As a Nation our priority in fighting the war on terror is to be able \nto better detect, prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. This bill \ngets us one step closer to meeting those goals by helping vulnerable \ntargets better detect and prevent terrorist attacks and by making sure \nthat if terror strikes one of these facilities, security and safety \nmeasures are in place to protect the lives of those inside and around \nthese buildings.\n  Nothing the Senate does is more important than providing America \nsecurity and Americans safety. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation because it does exactly that. It makes sure that there is \nadded security for these ``soft targets'' that Americans visit everyday \nand it adds funding to support the local police, fire and rescue \nworkers who are the first responders when there is a threat to one of \nthese organizations. In the battle to protect our Nation from terrorist \nattacks, we must be sure to provide assistance to these high-risk non-\nprofit organizations that provide vital health, social, cultural, and \neducational services to the American people.\n  I know others share my concerns about protecting these ``soft \ntargets'' in our war against terrorism and that is why the United \nJewish Communities, the American Red Cross, United Way, the American \nHospital Association, the American Association of Museums, the National \nAssociation of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), American \nJewish Congress, the Theatre Communications Group, and the YMCA of the \nUSA are all united in supporting this legislation.\n  This bill not only supports homeland security, it supports hometown \nsecurity, making our communities stronger and safer, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a letter from organizations supporting \nthis effort and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Coalition for the High-Risk Non-Profit Security \n           Enhancement Act of 2004, March 29, 2004.\n       Dear Member of Congress: Before the recess--We are \n     requesting that you sign-on as a co-sponsor of the High-Risk \n     Non-Profit Security Enhancement Act of 2004, legislation to \n     provide for homeland security assistance for high-risk non-\n     profits to protect them against foreign terrorist attacks. \n     The legislative language is attached to this e-mail.\n       As leaders of our nation's non-profit sector, we firmly \n     believe there is a compelling public interest in protecting \n     high-risk non-profit institutions from terrorist attacks that \n     would disrupt the vital health, social, educational and \n     spiritual services they provide to the American people, and \n     threaten the lives and well-being of American citizens who \n     operate, utilize, and live or work in proximity to such \n     institutions.\n       The risk to such institutions since 9/11 is clear. Al \n     Qaeda's willingness to attack targets of all types has been \n     made readily apparent with attacks in the United States, \n     Spain, Germany, Iraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey, \n     including an international Red Cross building, synagogues, \n     train stations, hotels, airports, restaurants, night clubs, \n     and cultural centers.\n       This legislation would authorize the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security to make available in FY 2005 up to $100 million in \n     assistance to 501(c)(3) organizations demonstrating a high \n     risk of terrorist attack based upon: specific threats of \n     international terrorist organizations, prior attacks against \n     similarly situated organizations; the vulnerability of the \n     specific site; the symbolic value of the site as a highly \n     recognized American institution; or the role of the \n     institution in responding to terrorist attacks. Federal loan \n     guarantees would also be available to make loans accessible \n     on favorable terms. Funds would be allocated by a new office \n     in the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to working \n     with high-risk non-profits nationwide.\n       The authorized amount of grants--$100 million--is a \n     fraction of the assessed needs of high-risk non-profits, \n     which is well in excess of $1 billion. However, in view of \n     current budgetary constraints, supporters of this legislation \n     have proposed a modest level of Federal assistance.\n       Applicant organizations would submit requests to state \n     homeland security authorities that would identify and \n     prioritize high-risk institutions. Qualifying requests would \n     be forwarded to the Secretary of Homeland Security who would \n     allocate resources based on risk--maximizing the number of \n     institutions receiving security enhancements and technical \n     assistance. Payments would be made directly to contractors.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n       Security enhancements would include items directly related \n     to the international terrorist threat, such as concrete \n     barriers, and ``hardening'' of windows and doors, as well as \n     technical assistance to assess needs, develop plans, and \n     train personnel. Funds could not be used for security \n     equipment that would reasonably be necessary for protection \n     from neighborhood crime.\n       The bill also authorizes $50 million for local police \n     departments to provide additional security in areas where \n     there is a high concentration of high-risk non-profits.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of Museums.\n       American Association of Homes and Services for the aging.\n       American Hospital Association.\n       American Jewish Congress.\n       American Red Cross.\n       American Society of Association Executives.\n       American Symphony Orchestra League.\n       Association of Art Museum Directors.\n       Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan \n     Chicago.\n       National Assembly of Health and Human Services \n     Organizations.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       Theatre Communications Group.\n       UJA Federation of New York.\n       Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations.\n       United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.\n       United Way of America.\n       YMCA of the USA.\n\n                                S. 2275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``High Risk Nonprofit Security \n     Enhancement Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that there is a public interest in \n     protecting high-risk nonprofit organizations from \n     international terrorist attacks that would disrupt the vital \n     services such organizations provide to the people of the \n     United States and threaten the lives and well-being of United \n     States citizens who operate, utilize, and live or work in \n     proximity to such organizations.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n        The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) establish within the Department of Homeland Security a \n     program to protect United States citizens at or near high-\n     risk nonprofit organizations from international terrorist \n     attacks through loan guarantees and Federal contracts for \n     security enhancements and technical assistance;\n       (2) establish a program within the Department of Homeland \n     Security to provide grants to local governments to assist \n     with incremental costs associated with law enforcement in \n     areas in which there are a high concentration of high-risk \n     nonprofit organizations vulnerable to international terrorist \n     attacks; and\n       (3) establish an Office of Community Relations and Civic \n     Affairs within the Department of Homeland Security to focus \n     on security needs of high-risk nonprofit organizations with \n     respect to international terrorist threats.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS AND ISSUE FEDERAL \n                   LOAN GUARANTEES.\n\n       The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``TITLE XVIII--PROTECTION OF CITIZENS AT HIGH-RISK NONPROFIT \n                             ORGANIZATIONS\n\n     ``SEC. 1801.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nHigh-Risk Non-Profit Security Enhancement Act of 2004 together with my \ncolleague Senator Mikulski. Since 9/11, al-Qaida has attacked a series \nof so-called ``soft targets'' around the globe including hotels, \nsynagogues, social centers and facilities of the Red\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nCross. This grim reality is forcing such soft targets here in the \nUnited States to confront the need for very expensive security \nenhancements to their facilities. This legislation will help non-profit \norganizations--those soft targets least able to afford these security \nenhancements--to do the work that they need to do such as the building \nof concrete barriers and the ``hardening'' of windows and doors.\n  On February 11, 2003, CIA Director George Tenet provided the \nfollowing testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:\n\n       Until al-Qaida finds an opportunity for the big attack, it \n     will try to maintain its operational tempo by striking \n     ``softer'' targets. And what I mean by ``softer,'' Mr. \n     Chairman, are simply targets al-Qaida planners may view as \n     less well protected. . . . Al-Qaida has also sharpened its \n     focus on our Allies in Europe and on operations against \n     Israeli and Jewish targets.\n\n  Also on February 11, 2003, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller testified \nas follows before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:\n\n       Multiple small-scale attacks against soft targets--such as \n     banks, shopping malls, supermarkets, apartment buildings, \n     schools and universities, houses of worship and places of \n     recreation and entertainment--would be easier to execute and \n     would minimize the need to communicate with the central \n     leadership, lowering the risks of detection.\n\n  The record has sadly confirmed the words of Directors Tenet and \nMueller. Al-Qaida has been responsible for a series of attacks against \nsoft targets including numerous synagogues, A Red Cross building, train \nstations, hotels airports, restaurants and night clubs. These targets \nhave been in countries throughout the world including Spain, Germany, \nIraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco and Turkey.\n  In the face of this very real terrorist threat, these soft targets \nhave an obligation to take the necessary steps to better protect \nthemselves and all who visit their facilities. These additional \nsecurity measures place an especially heavy burden upon non-profit \ncorporations with limited resources. Effective security measures do not \ncome cheap.\n  This legislation would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto make available in FY 2005 up to $100 million in assistance to non \nprofits which demonstrate a high risk of terrorist attack. In choosing \nwhich projects to fund, the secretary will give preference to those non \nprofit organizations he determines to be at the greatest risk of \ninternational terrorist attack based upon the following criteria:\n  (1) Specific threats of international terrorist organizations; (2) \nPrior attacks against similarly situated organizations; (3) The \nvulnerability of the specific site; (4) The symbolic value of the site \nas a highly recognized American institution; or (5) The role of the \ninstitution in responding to terrorist attacks.\n  Applicant organizations would submit request to state homeland \nsecurity authorities that would identify and prioritize high-risk \ninstitutions. Qualifying requests would be forwarded to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security who would allocate resources based on his \nassessment of the risk. Payments would be made from the Department of \nHomeland security directly to the contractors who will do the work.\n  For those programs that do not get their security projects funded, \nFederal loan guarantees would also be available so that they can take \nout loans on favorable terms. The bill also authorizes $50 million for \nlocal police departments to provide additional security in areas where \nthere is a high concentration of high-risk non-profits.\n  Mr. President, the threat of terrorism is placing an enormous burden \non non-profit organizations that face a higher risk of terror attack \ndue to their affiliation of function. This bill is an important step \ntowards helping these non-profits meet these new and expensive security \nneeds. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in addressing this \noverlooked front in the war on terror.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2276. A bill to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to make \ngrants to Amtrak, other rail carriers, and providers of mass \ntransportation for improvements to the security of our Nation's rail \nand mass transportation system; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, two and a half years ago, the United \nStates was caught unprepared when it came to aviation security. The \nresults were devastating.\n  Since then, we have greatly improved our aviation security, and we \nhave begun to improve our port security. We have a long way to go in \nboth of these areas.\n  But, we have a longer way to go to secure our rail system--both \npassenger, freight, and local transit.\n  In October 2001, the Commerce Committee passed a rail security bill \nto authorize $1.77 billion over two years for Amtrak. We knew that the \nUnited States must not be caught off-guard when it comes to our \npassenger and freight rail systems.\n  Unfortunately, the bill never became law.\n  And, now, we have received another warning. In March, terrorists blew \nup commuter trains in Madrid killing nearly 200 people and injuring \n1,400. We must heed this warning and address the vulnerability of \nAmerica's rail systems. We must act now.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will authorize funding for \nmore police, canine dogs, and surveillance equipment on Amtrak and \nlocal transit systems. The bill will authorize $500 million per year \nfor five years. One-third of the funding will be spent on Amtrak based \non passenger ridership and the remainder of the funding will be spent \non securing rail and transit.\n  This is important for the entire nation, but it is especially \nimportant for California. California has the second highest Amtrak \nridership in the country. Almost 9 million passenger trips began or \nended in California during fiscal year 2003. Amtrak operates an average \nof 68 intercity and 300 commuter trains per day in California.\n  The freight rail system is also important for goods movement. \nCalifornia's ports receive over 40 percent of all of the goods that are \nshipped into the United States. Many of the imports are shipped by rail \nthrough California and to the rest of the nation. If there were a \nterrorist attack, the impact on our economy would be devastating.\n  Finally, local communities throughout California have mass transit \nsystems. For example, Muni, in San Francisco, is the 7th largest \ntransit system in the nation. There is light rail in Los Angeles, \nSacramento, and San Diego. Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority \nhas buses that go directly to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, \nwhich has weapons research.\n  It is vitally important to ensure that our nation's entire \ntransportation system is secure. It is time we stopped ignoring our \nrail systems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2277. A bill to amend the Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), \nto allow binding arbitration clauses to be included in all contracts \naffecting the land within the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian \nReservation; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide a technical correction that would once again allow binding \narbitration clauses to be included in all contracts affecting the land \nwithin the Salt River Pima-Mariposa Indian Community (SRPMIC). A \ncompanion bill is being introduced today by Congressman Hayworth.\n  The SRPMIC located in Scottsdale, AZ, one of the most diversified \neconomic development portfolios in Indian country. Blessed with a prime \nlocation in metropolitan Phoenix, the Tribe has nearly a dozen business \nenterprises including a sand and gravel operation, a cement company, \ntwo golf courses, and a shopping center. The tribe wants to continue \ndiversifying their economy in the hopes of becoming economically self-\nsufficient. This legislation is intended to help them achieve this \ngoal.\n  This bill would make technical corrections to title 2l5, U.S. Code, \nSection 416a(c) relating to ``binding arbitration of disputes.'' \nRecently, in an effort to consolidate and streamline various rules, \nregulations, and laws, some sections of Title 25, U.S. Code, Section 81 \nwere repealed that affected the Bureau of Indian Affairs. An unintended \nconsequence of this consolidation was that the definition for leases, \nwhich included sublease, substitute lease, and master lease, was \naltered. Simply put, this legislation would reinstate the\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nprior definition for leases on the reservation to include subleases, \nsubstitute leases, and master leases. Without this clarification, the \ntribe fears that potential tenants may be leery to invest on tribal \nland.\n  This legislation may seem minor, but it would go a long way toward \nhelping the SRPMIC achieve the economic self-sufficiency it is working \ntoward. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nwork for its speedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2279. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, with respect \nto maritime transportation security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, less than 1 year ago, we wrapped up work \non the port security bill that was signed into law as the Maritime \nSecurity Act of 2002, MTSA. That act mandated and outlined changes that \nare needed to shore up security in our ports, and established for the \nfirst time a system to coordinate, plan and implement port security at \nU.S. seaports. While this was landmark legislation, much still needs to \nbe done with respect to the implementation of the requirements mandated \nby this law.\n  I am very dissatisfied with the current Administration's disinterest \nin paying for port security, and would point out that we are \napproaching a crisis, as Federal mandates are being rolled out for \nsecurity without Federal support. I have tried over and over to focus \nthe attention of the Administration on this crucial need and pushed to \nno avail in the Senate to get the resources necessary to address this \nproblem. But to date, I have gotten little support. In addition to \nappropriating much needed funds for port security, it has become \napparent that keeping up with security needs at our ports is an ever \nevolving task, and that we may have to refocus our efforts and push \nharder to ensure that we coordinate our policies and maximize the \nlimited resources that we have in this area.\n  Today, in order to keep up with these needs, I am introducing the \n``Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2004'', along with Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Breaux. I am pleased to have worked on this with \nSenator McCain, the Chairman of our Committee, as I often remark, while \nhe has no coastline, he has worked with those of us who do have ports \nto work on these crucial port security issues. I am also pleased to \nintroduce this legislation with Senator Breaux, for he has truly been \none of the leading advocates of the importance of maritime shipping and \nthe merchant marine in the U.S. Senate. He has done invaluable work for \nus on the Commerce Committee, and is a true expert in the field. He \nwill be sorely missed for his expertise on all maritime issues, \nalthough I am sure, that in the future, he will still be the Captain of \nsome small boat, yacht, or maybe even a ship.\n  Even though the Coast Guard, Customs and other agencies charged with \nthe implementation of these measures have aggressively taken initial \nsteps necessary to set up our future structure for seaport security \nthere is still much to do, and effective action needs to occur to help \ncoordinate and crystallize security policies and objectives. The \nMaritime Transportation Security Act of 2004 would attempt to mandate a \ncoordinated Federal approach to several areas of concern in port \nsecurity. It would also attempt to set performance standards for \ncertain areas in port security and add a few enhancements to last \nyear's legislation. Most importantly the bill would require a user fee \nto be established to help pay for the port security mandates.\n  Specifically, this bill would impose in rem liability to secure \npayment of penalties and fines under the Act and to help ensure \ncompliance with the security requirements imposed by the MTSA. The bill \nwould also include provisions to increase security in waterside cargo \nareas, and ensure that cargo contents of imported marine cargo \ncontainers would be required to be cleared within 5 days of entering a \nU.S. port, or alternatively removed after 5 days without being cleared, \nto a regulated warehouse where it would be opened and reviewed to \nverify its contents. This would in no way change any claim to \npossession of the goods. Importantly, the bill would require DHS to \nevaluate the policies and practices of sealing empty containers. \nAccording to the Federal Maritime Commission, over 4 million containers \nwere imported into the United States empty. At a recent hearing, a \nrepresentative from the ILWU longshoremen's union pointed out that \ntreatment of empties and the sealing practices of these containers \nvaried from locale to locale. This bill would require an analysis of \ncurrent practices at U.S. ports in order to determine what steps need \nto occur in order to make sure that the transport of empty containers \ndoes not present a threat of terrorism, and whether a Federal policy is \njustified in this area.\n\n  The bill would require the Administration to produce a coordinated \nplan for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating maritime intelligence \ninformation collected by Federal agencies on ships, cargo, crew members \nand passengers. This intelligence is used to determine which ships, \ncargo, or crew warrant further inspection. This section of the bill \nrequires further development of a maritime intelligence system to \ncollect and analyze information concerning the crew, passengers and \ncargoes carried on vessels operating in waters under the jurisdiction \nof the United States. This mandate essentially restates existing law \nsince it appears that the agencies have actually grown further apart \nsince the passage of the Maritime Transportation Security Act. The \nprovision in this bill would require a plan on how the Administration \nwill coordinate collection and analysis of maritime information, and \nhow agency personnel might be co-located to maximize resources and \ncoordinate analysis. This plan must also indicate when long range \nvessel tracking will be integrated into this intelligence information. \nAdditionally, the plan would require the government to analyze private \nsector resources to evaluate how they could be used to help monitor and \ndifferentiate legitimate moves of trade from those actions and players \nthat are more suppositious. The Federal Government does not have a lot \nof experience monitoring commercial maritime activity, and I believe \nthey will have to employ private sector expertise to assist in this \nendeavor.\n  The report shall also consider the abilities of the Department of \nNavy to collect and analyze commercial maritime information. The U.S. \nNavy probably has the most resources dedicated to the evaluation of \ncommercial shipping activities, but are precluded from sharing this \ninformation. In light of our need for better information on commercial \nshipping, this policy has to be reevaluated. A maritime intelligence \nsystem needs to be set up to work together so that Federal agencies, \nState, local and the private sector can coordinate their law \nenforcement activities. Maritime intelligence on commercial ocean \nshipping is currently gathered by the Coast Guard, Customs, INS, and \nother agencies such as the Federal Maritime Commission under separate \nsystems. Only the Coast Guard and the Navy currently work together. We \nlag far behind in this area, and each agency is operating independent \nof others. We are not getting the full picture of what is happening out \nthere. It is crucial that we have the best information available so \nthat we can target our relatively limited resources with maximum \nefficiency. Further, the information has to be disseminated in a \nfashion to maximize its utility, while still protecting that \ninformation which needs to be kept confidential. Collection and \nanalysis of commercial maritime information is a key element of our \nport security that needs more focus and has to be addressed if we are \nto adequately protect our Nation.\n  Importantly, the bill will require the Administration to come up with \ncargo security plans to evaluate targeting systems to determine whether \nthey are effective in deterring and protecting against potential acts \nof terrorism from cargo. In the event that targeting is inadequate \nprotection, DHS would be required to increase the amount of cargo being \nnon-intrusively inspected or x-rayed by two over the next year. The \nbill would also require the consolidation of intermodal cargo security \nprograms that have the same security goals while establishing criteria \nand\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nperformance goals for these security programs, which are currently \noperating completely independent of each other, and require certain \nother cargo security program enhancements. Voluntary cargo security \nprograms are not the answer to the important problem of securing our \nNation from terrorist attacks. Firm standards and goals must be in \nplace to ensure that items that we know we don't want in marine \ncontainers are not actually in marine containers. The legislation will \nalso require a report on the amount of actual inspections that are \nbeing done at foreign seaports.\n  While the Container Security Initiative was rolled out with great \nfanfare to work with foreign ports to inspect cargo before they get to \nU.S. ports, the question remains whether we are actually getting much \nbang for the buck. The fundamental question that needs to be addressed \nis whether foreign nations have been willing to use their security \nscreening equipment for our benefit, and to what degree have they been \nwilling to screen cargo for the benefit of our Nation. The legislation \nwill require a report to determine whether this program needs \nadjustment, or is a cost-effective measure to ensure safe cargo \nmovements into the U.S., and to update us on the progress in the \ninstallation of a system of radiation detection at U.S. ports.\n  Additionally, this legislation will redirect our efforts to help \nensure that we can verify that security is in place to prevent an act \nof terrorism, and not place us in a position of having to rely on \ndocumentation and the attestations or documentation of third parties in \norder to determine whether we need to take actions to protect the \npublic. The Administration has not even started to implement the \ncertification program required to certify ``secure systems of \ntransportation,'' 46 U.S.C. 70116, and they must get going on this \nvital initiative. Otherwise, it would only take one good liar to breach \nour system of defense. Although I understand we cannot inspect every \npiece of cargo, we have a credible system in place to actively increase \ncargo inspections, and implement a system that would ultimately allow \nus to reopen U.S. ports to commerce, in the event of an attack.\n  Additionally, the bill also would require a report from the Coast \nGuard on the benefits of utilizing joint operational centers at United \nStates seaports to implement area security plans. This report should \nincorporate lessons learned from the three centers that have already \nbeen established, such as ``Operation SeaHawk'' in Charleston, SC, and \nconsider which security programs could be effectively fused into these \njoint operational centers. The Commandant of the Coast Guard would be \nrequired by this bill to report on the effectiveness of these centers \nfor port security and determine if it would be beneficial and cost \neffective to establish centers in additional areas that pose a \nsignificant security risk, and to utilize them to implement area \nsecurity plans.\n  The bill will also make sure that port security grants are reviewed \nand approved, as was mandated under the terms of the MTSA, and all \ngrants are subject to the review of the Coast Guard Captain of the \nPort, the regional Maritime Administration representative, and other \nTransportation Security Administration security officials as well as \nother DHS security experts, before the grants are approved. This grant \nprogram is not open-ended, it is intended to help the private sector \nand State and municipal governments achieve compliance with Federally \napproved facility plans and area maritime security plans, and the \nchanges to the statute will ensure that the grant program operates the \nway we intended it to operate.\n\n  The bill also requires the Maritime Administration and the State \nDepartment to evaluate existing foreign assistance programs to \ndetermine whether the existing aid programs can be utilized to help \nforeign nations achieve compliance with the international standard set \nfor port security. The MTSA requires the Coast Guard to set up a \nmechanism to review the practices of foreign ports to ensure that they \nhave implemented adequate security measures, and ultimately, they can \ntake steps that would result in the closure of commerce from ports in \nnon-compliance with international security standards. It is in the best \ninterests of everyone potentially impacted by such a policy \nimplication, if we review our foreign aid programs to determine whether \naid can be used to implement the necessary security measures.\n  The bill also requires the Maritime Administration to work with the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, and other DHS port \nsecurity agencies such as TSA, Coast Guard and Customs to determine how \nto supplement their training programs to include a greater \nfamiliarization with commercial maritime practices. Port security law \nenforcement is much different in the aftermath of September 11, and \nofficials involved in regulation and policing shipping will now have to \napproach it from a different perspective, and to be able to identify \nanomalies and irregularities, in order to best focus our limited police \nresources over an immense volume of trade. It is my understanding that \nthe Maritime Administration has been utilizing resources at the U.S. \nMerchant Marine Academy and working with FLETC to formalize port \nsecurity training. I think that this change will help our Federal \nagencies bolster their existing training programs, and achieve a \ngreater understanding of potential security issues that could arise, \nand will be a healthy addition to work already done by the Maritime \nAdministration and FLETC.\n  The bill rewrites the DHS mandate to conduct research and \ndevelopment, and would require the Science Directorate within DHS to be \nmore accountable to Congress for those actions they are taking to \ndevelop the types of technology necessary to address security at our \nseaports. Importantly, the bill also requires the Coast Guard to \nevaluate the security risks and policies very carefully of nuclear \nfacilities on or adjacent to navigable waterways to ensure that we have \nsecurity policies in place to prevent acts of terrorism from occurring \nfrom on or under navigable waterways. Most nuclear facilities are on or \nadjacent to navigable waterways, and I want the Coast Guard to exercise \nthe highest degree of security in their treatment of these facilities \nand the threat posed as a result of maritime commerce or the proximity \nto navigable waterways.\n  Most importantly, this bill attempts to address the fundamental issue \nthat will face the nation as we implement the MTSA--will sufficient \nfunding be in place to assure that our ports and agencies will robustly \npursue security, or we will have to rely on sham security programs, or \nefforts severely restricted by funding that result in de minimus or \ndesultory security efforts. When the Senate and House conferenced on \nthe port security bill in the fall of 2002, the Senate conferees \ninsisted on establishing direct funding for port security programs \nthrough a user fee, identical to the airline security fee, which would \nhelp defray the significant costs for the new port security mandates. \nThe Administration declined to dedicate any resources for port \nsecurity, and they declined to support the Senate's user fee. Unable to \nreach agreement with the House conferees and the Administration, I \nagreed to authorize just the necessary funds, but the President was \nrequired by law to report to Congress within 6 months on a funding \nproposal to assist States and their ports in complying with security \nmandates for Federal security plans. That report has never been \nprepared and is 9 months overdue.\n\n  When the President's budget for FY 2004 came out, after the U.S. \nCoast Guard had estimated that it would take $7.4 billion of funding in \norder to comply with the port security requirements, there was no \nfunding for port authority compliance in that year's budget resolution. \nI offered an amendment to the FY 2004 Budget Resolution which was \nunanimously accepted to add $1 billion to help defray the first year \ncosts of port security--ultimately it was dropped from Conference. Two \nweeks later, the President was presented with a direct opportunity to \nfund port security programs: Congressional consideration of his \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the war in Iraq \nand bolster homeland security. Again, the Administration funding \nrequest included no funding for port authorities to help them comply \nwith the Federal mandate, so I offered an amendment to add $1 billion \nto the supplemental specifically to help ports meet the new security \nmandates. Despite unanimous approval in\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nthe Senate 3 weeks earlier, the amendment was opposed by the \nAdministration and defeated on the Senate floor on a straight party \nline vote.\n  Last year, I made another effort to address the port security funding \ninadequacies during consideration of the FY 2004 Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill. Again, the Administration proposed no funding for \nport security grants in their 2004 request, so I offered an amendment \nto the bill to direct $300 million specifically to port security grants \nwithout increasing the overall cost of the bill. The Administration \nopposed the funding increase, and the amendment was defeated largely \nalong party lines with only three Republicans supporting the amendment.\n  Until this year's budget the President has not requested one dime \nspecifically for port security. He has opposed efforts to mandate the \nfunds be raised from the users of the system, and this year's budget \nrequest is for only $46 million. Despite opposition from the White \nHouse, Congress has directed appropriations that have resulted in \ngrants of $450 million to ports to help ensure compliance with the \nFederal security mandates, and so I know that this issue is an area of \nmajor concern. Ultimately, the funding issues must be addressed, and \nthis bill proposes a user fee to pay for the costs of compliance of \nport security. I had considered the possibility of authorizing the \nAdministration to either generate funds for port security via a user \nfee, or alternatively mandate that funds be directly transferred from \nfunds collected by Customs duties, but because of jurisdictional issues \ndetermined not to do so. The maritime industry supports this approach, \nand I am not opposed to this approach, but want only to ensure, that \none way or another, we have the necessary funding in place to set up \nthe system of port security that this nation deserves. Simply put, \nthere is just too much at stake to hope that security emerges.\n  This bill seeks to continue the work to correct the security and \nterrorism prevention needs at our maritime borders. There is much to be \ndone and there is a continued need for government and industry \ncooperation. This bill works on some of that need, yet the major need \nis funding for port security, which I hope that we will be able to \naddress in the Senate very soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution providing for a protocol for the nonpartisan confirmation of \njudicial nominees. We have come to a crisis situation in the Senate on \nthe confirmation of Federal judges. This has been a highly \ncontroversial subject since the beginning of the Republic. There have \nbeen controversies from time to time, pitched debates in the Senate \nChamber, nominees confirmed and some nominees rejected.\n  The current controversies focused significantly in the last 2 years \nof President Reagan's Presidency when the Democrats won control of the \nSenate in the 1986 elections. For the last 2 years of President \nReagan's tenure, the Presidential appointments were slowed down. The \nsame thing happened during the 4 years of President George Herbert \nWalker Bush. When President Clinton was elected, and we had a Democrat \nin the White House, when we Republicans gained control of the Senate in \nthe 1994 elections, President Clinton's nominations were slowed down. \nPretty much a tit-for-tat situation.\n  Now that we have had both the Presidency and the Senate under \nRepublican stewardship, the controversy has reached a new level where \nfor the first time in the history of the Republic, court of appeals \nnominees have been filibustered. The responsibility of the President \nhas been to use his constitutional authority for interim appointments. \nThose two interim appointments have been roundly criticized by the \nDemocrats.\n  And the position has been stated on the other side of the aisle that \nthere will be no more confirmations of Federal judges until there is a \ncommitment, an indication, or some statement, or some understanding \nthat the interim appointments will no longer be made.\n  My State of Pennsylvania is very severely impacted by this \ncontroversy. We have a nomination pending before the Senate of a \ndistinguished Federal judge, Judge Van Antwerpen, who is ready for \nconfirmation. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is badly \nunderstaffed. We have some five nominees for the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania awaiting confirmation. \nThere again, the courts are in need of the services of these \nprospective Federal judges.\n  The resolution, which I am submitting today, is a protocol which \nwould call for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee 30 days after a \nPresident submits a nomination; 30 days later, a vote by the committee; \n30 days after that, floor action in the Senate; 30 days after that, a \ndecision on the outcome.\n  It is true there would not be the opportunity for filibuster, but the \nRepublic has survived for more than 200 years before the filibuster was \nused. There was one illustration where there was a filibuster for a \nSupreme Court nominee, but that is really irrelevant to the kinds of \ncontroversies we have now, or the situation we are in at the present \ntime.\n  Beyond my State of Pennsylvania, there are other States, other \ncircuits, having judicial crises, and we ought to take the Federal \njudicial nominating confirmation process out of the politicization \ncourse, and we ought to try to work this through.\n  It may be that, in August, when there is some uncertainty as to who \nwill occupy the White House and which party will control the Senate, \nthat some accommodation can be reached. But right now litigants are \nbeing denied the prompt disposition of their cases. It is a well-known \nmaxim that justice delayed is justice denied. It is my hope that we \ncould find an accommodation somewhere here to do the people's business.\n  It is well known that partisanship is at a very high level in the \nCongress today--in the House of Representatives, where there is a \nnarrow margin for the Republicans; and the partisanship here in the \nSenate, where there is a 51-49 majority for the Republicans.\n  But we ought to establish a protocol. We ought to establish a \nprocedure. The protocol I am proposing is not in concrete. I am \nprepared to discuss it to find ways of working it out.\n  I had thought of putting in a provision that if it was a party line \nvote in the Judiciary Committee, even though there was not a majority \nin favor of sending a nominee to the floor, but a party line vote, that \nit come to the floor. I have decided to omit that.\n  I had thought about putting a provision in that if the Supreme Court \nnominee did not have a majority, the nominee would come to the floor in \nany event. And I have omitted that.\n  Twice in the past 14 years, nominees have come to the floor of the \nSenate for the Supreme Court of the United States without having a \nmajority vote in the Judiciary Committee. But both times--one a 5-to-8 \nvote, the nominee came to the floor; another time, on a 7-7 tie, there \nwas a 13-1 vote to send the nominee to the floor. And I have decided, \nin the interest of avoiding a controversy, to omit that.\n  But I ask my colleagues to review this resolution for a protocol and \nto see if we cannot find some way to confirm Federal judges without \nfiguring out whose ox is being gored.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 328--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n  CONTINUED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY FIDEL CASTRO AND THE \n                           GOVERNMENT OF CUBA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Allen) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 328\n\n       Whereas, one year ago, in March 2003, Fidel Castro and the \n     Government of Cuba led a nationwide campaign to arrest and \n     jail dozens of prominent democracy activists and

around the world was \n     focused on the war in Iraq;\n       Whereas the failure to condemn the Government of Cuba's \n     continued political repression of democracy activists will \n     further undermine the opportunity for freedom on the island; \n     and\n       Whereas the international community missed an opportunity \n     to speak against such brutal repression in a meaningful \n     manner during the 59th Session of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva, Switzerland, from \n     March 17, 2003, through April 23, 2003: Now, therefore, be it\n

all political prisoners in Cuba;\n       (B) Senate Resolution 97, 108th Congress, unanimously \n     agreed to April 7, 2003, condemning the crackdown on \n     democracy activists in Cuba; and\n       (C) Senate Resolution 62, 108th Congress, unanimously \n     agreed to June 27, 2003, calling upon the Organization of \n     American States Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, \n     the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the \n     European Union, and human rights activists throughout the \n     world to take certain actions in regard to the human rights \n     situation in Cuba;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Cuba to immediately release \n     individuals imprisoned for political purposes;\n       (3) praises the bravery of those Cubans who, because they \n     practiced free speech and signed the Varela Project petition, \n     have been targeted in this most recent government crackdown;\n       (4) calls on foreign governments to--\n       (A) increase the pressure on the Government of Cuba to \n     improve its record on human rights in Cuba; and\n       (B) invite civil society leaders and democracy activists in \n     Cuba to official events;\n       (5) calls upon the 60th Session of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights in Geneva from March 15, 2004, to \n     April 23, 2004, to--\n       (A) condemn Cuba for its human rights abuses; and\n       (B) demand that inspectors from the International \n     Commission of the Red Cross be allowed to visit and inspect \n     the conditions of prisons to assess for the international \n     community the extent of human rights abuses and the current \n     situation in Cuba; and\n       (6) urges the President to direct United States \n     Representatives at the 60th Session of the Commission on \n     Human Rights to make the strong condemnation of the human \n     rights situation in Cuba a top priority.\n\n

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4062, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4062) to provide for an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958 through June 4, 2004, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support passage of H.R. 4062, a \nbill that provides needed improvements to the Small Business \nAdministration's largest business loan program, the ``Section 7(a)'' \nprogram, at no additional cost to the Government.\n  The SBA's 7(a) loan program has proven that a small amount of \ngovernment backing can greatly enhance private-sector financing for \nsmall businesses, and that the economic benefits reverberate throughout \nthe economy at large. Small businesses create almost 75 percent of the \nnet new jobs in the economy. The 7(a) program harnesses this power and \nhas helped small businesses to create or retain nearly 2 million more \njobs in the last five years.\n  The program is so popular among small businesses that demand for \nprogram funds in the first few months of fiscal year 2004 suggests that \nrequests for the entire year would far out-pace its available budget. \nAs a result, in January 2004, the SBA shut the program down, and then \nre-opened it with a loan cap of $750,000--only 37.5 percent of the $2 \nmillion maximum previously available. Faced with these restrictions, \nsmall businesses have urged Congress and the administration to improve \nfunding opportunities for the rest of 2004.\n  Together with my fellow Senators, colleagues in the House, and a \nlarge coalition of small businesses and lenders, we have worked for \nseveral months to construct a way to improve the program by allowing \nlenders to help alleviate the funding shortfall. This plan would \nbenefit small businesses and lenders by allowing loans larger than \n$750,000, and by allowing ``piggyback'' loans, or by allowing financing \npackages with several portions. And again, we could do this without \nincreasing Government expenditures.\n  The bill would achieve these goals in three ways. First, lenders \nwould return to the SBA a 0.25 percent, or one-quarter of one percent, \nfee on new loans under $150,000. Lenders are currently permitted to \nretain this amount from a borrower fee, of 1 percent, that lenders \nalready collect and pass on to the SBA. For loans larger than $150,000, \nlenders already must pass the entire borrower fee on to the SBA; this \nchange would make the treatment the same for all loan sizes. This \nproposal was first made by the SBA, as part of a larger plan the SBA \nsubmitted to Congress this year.\n  Second, a lender fee on new loans would be increased from 0.25 \npercent, one-quarter of one percent, to 0.36 percent. This fee cannot \nbe passed on to small businesses.\n  Third, lenders would be permitted to provide small businesses with \n``piggyback'' financing packages that include a 7(a) loan portion and a \nnon-7(a), strictly commercial portion, if the lenders paid the normal \nfees on the 7(a) loan portion and a 0.70 percent fee on the non-7(a) \nportion. Prior to January 2004, the SBA permitted this type of \nfinancing, but without receiving any fee income for the non-7(a) \nportion, and without an upper limit on the total financing. H.R. 4062 \nprohibits the non-7(a) portion of the financing from being larger than \nthe 7(a) loan.\n  The bill also extends to June 4, 2004, the authorization for several \nSBA programs that would otherwise expire on April 2, 2004, including \nthe Preferred Surety Bond Program, the Small Disadvantaged Business \nProgram, and the SBA's co-sponsorship authority. Finally, the bill \nextends to September 30, 2004, the authorization for the SBA's \nCertified Development Company program, also known as the 504 Loan \nProgram.\n  H.R. 4062 is very similar to legislation which I introduced in the \nSenate on March 10, S. 2193, the ``Small Business Loan Revitalization \nAct of 2004,'' which I was joined in sponsoring by 18 fellow Senators. \nThat legislation was the result of months of hard work and negotiations \nwith fellow Senators, colleagues in the House, small businesses, \nlenders, and the administration. I regret that S. 2193's provisions, \nsuch as its lower fees for lenders, and the increased debenture sizes \nfor the 504 Loan Program which I recently added by amendment, are not \nbeing enacted today, but I am pleased that, according to the Small \nBusiness Administration's projections, H.R. 4062 at least achieves the \ngoal of allowing the 7(a) program to operate without restriction \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/01/senate-section/article/S3595-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3595-S3596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, APRIL 2, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

There \nis an important medical liability bill being introduced by Senator \nGregg and others, Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of \n2004. That bill deserves to be debated and voted on. We will try to \nschedule that bill for next week. I will continue to hold out hope that \nwe will be able to finish the JOBS bill, which is the FSC/ETI bill.\n  Senators have come to the floor over the course of the last several \nweeks discussing the importance of this bill. Yet we have been unable \nto vote on the legislation as the WTO sanctions continue each day. In \nfact, today, since this is 1 month after the sanctions began, the \nsanctions were increased by $40 million. We must move expeditiously on \nthat bill. It is a priority for the Senate. We will have an opportunity \nnext week to speak on this bill.\n  The pension reform conference report is another piece of legislation \nthat should be moved expeditiously. The House may act on that \nconference report later this evening or on Friday. I will be talking to \nmy colleagues about scheduling that conference report for Senate \naction.\n  Finally, the conferees on the budget resolution continue to meet and \nit is important to address the budget conference report as soon as that \ndoes become available. Having said that, we have a lot of work to do \nand not a lot of time to do it. We will be working each day next week \nwith an effort to schedule the above-mentioned items throughout.\n  In addition, next week we have accommodated Members' schedules for \nthe observance of Passover.

Mr. President, I am troubled by some of the comments made \nearlier as we debated whether to continue with this bill before us. In \nparticular, one of the leaders on the other side of the aisle is quoted \nin today's paper as saying--this a direct quote--``Why put our Members \nthrough the whole litany of Democratic political votes for no \ndiscernible gain?''\n  I am amazed at the implication these amendments we in the Democratic \ncaucus are trying in vain to have voted upon by the Senate are \npolitical votes. I am even more astonished it could be said they are \nfor no discernible gain.\n  For whose gain are we talking? Not, perhaps, for Republican Members \nof the Senate. But that is not the purpose of our amendments. These are \namendments to benefit the American people.\n  We are talking about extending unemployment benefits for the over 1.1 \nmillion Americans who have exhausted those benefits since December of \nlast year. The Children's Defense Fund, originators of the No Child \nLeft Behind concept, are committed to seeing it carried out and have \nestimated 622,000 American children live in families whose parents have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits. They estimate each of those \nfamilies loses an average of $1,100 a month in income when their \nunemployment benefits run out. It drives over a third of them below the \npoverty level. Over two-thirds of those families lose their health care \ncoverage.\n  No discernible gain from a vote on extending unemployment benefits? \nPerhaps not to the Republican caucus. But it would surely make a huge \ndifference to 1.1 million American adults and their 622,000 children.\n  No discernible gain to a vote on protecting overtime pay for some 8 \nmillion Americans who stand to lose those benefits through the \nunilateral action of the Secretary of Labor? These are not idle \npolitical gestures. These are real decisions affecting the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  It may be inconvenient for some Members to vote on them, but that is \nour responsibility in this body.\n\n\n                           Education Funding\n\n  As another illustration of how these votes and these decisions really \ndo affect people's lives, about a month ago we were holding rollcall \nvotes regarding the budget resolution for the next fiscal year, and \njust about that same time the Secretary of Education was in my State of \nMinnesota, where he met with educators and with State officials, and \nwith, evidently, some of the Members of the Minnesota congressional \ndelegation on the other side of the aisle--I was not invited to either \nof those meetings, which seemed a shame since they were being billed as \nnonpolitical meetings, but, nevertheless, they did occur--and at that \nmeeting--again, I was not invited, so I was not there--according to the \nreports of those who attended, the Secretary assured these Minnesota \neducators that No Child Left Behind is adequately funded.\n  Well, there had been rumors that there were going to be cutbacks \naffecting Minnesota in the title I program, which is the major source \nof funds under the so-called No Child Left Behind. So the Minnesota \neducators were temporarily relieved by that, until just a few weeks \nlater--scarcely a month later, in fact--when the actual title I \nallocations for the next fiscal year, 2005, became known.\n  Lo and behold, Minnesota will experience a reduction of over $2.5 \nmillion. Only two States in the Nation are going to experience cuts in \ntitle I funding from the year 2004 to the next year, 2005: \nMassachusetts and Minnesota.\n  Now, I am not running for President or anything else, for that \nmatter, this year, so I am shocked that Minnesota would be paired with \nMassachusetts as being the only two States to be cut back in title I \ndollars at the same time we are experiencing an increase in the \nchildren who are eligible for title I funding. As that reduction gets \nspread across our school districts, some of the consequences are very \nsevere. Quite a number of districts will be taken off of title I \nfunding whatsoever. They will not be able to serve any of the children \nin those school districts who are eligible, individually, for title I.\n  One of the school districts, Anoka-Hennepin, is going to experience a \n40-percent reduction in funding for title I programs at the same time \nthe number of children eligible for title I is going up.\n  Now, how can we say that there is no child going to be left behind \nunder this program, and that it is adequately funded, when a school \ndistrict such as that is going to experience a 40-percent reduction in \nfunding? How is it that two States in the Nation--Massachusetts and \nMinnesota--are going to see a reduction in funding while the overall \nprogram nationwide is going to receive a $1 billion increase?\n  Why are we being punished? Why are we being penalized? Why are we \nbeing singled out for those reductions? Why does the Secretary of \nEducation come to our State one month earlier and assure our educators \nthat there is plenty of money, that these reductions are not going to \ntake place, when either he did not know--in which case he was \nunbelievably ill-informed--or he knew and did not speak honestly to our \neducators? And either one of those I find enormously reprehensible.\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n  Mr. President, $2,727,000 is a huge loss in money for the \ndisadvantaged children of the State of Minnesota, meaning that less \nthan half--less than half--of all the children in my State who are \neligible for title I funding are actually going to get services \nprovided to them. And that is no child left behind? That is a fraud. \nThat is adequate funding for No Child Left Behind? That is a lie. That \nis a lie.\n\n  In this room I have heard it said several times: There is plenty of \nmoney for title I. There is plenty of money for No Child Left Behind. \nNot for Minnesota. We were underfunded before, and it is being cut back \nnow. We are one of two States being cut. I ask the Secretary of \nEducation: I want to know why. Come back to Minnesota, Mr. Secretary, \nnow that you have the facts, evidently. Come back to Minnesota and meet \nwith those educators and tell them why, why our money is being cut \nback.\n  The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nhas stood on this floor--and I have had this debate with him; he is not \nhere presently, but I look forward to that opportunity again in the \nfuture--saying there is additional money available to the States under \nNo Child Left Behind. In fact, there is so much additional money that \nsome States don't know what to do with it all.\n  Well, I can see why that distinguished Senator made that statement, \nbecause in his home State, over the last 5 years, they have experienced \na 44-percent increase in funding under title I. In this next year, they \nare going to receive an increase of almost the same $2.5 million which \nMinnesota is going to lose. They will receive an 8.1-percent increase \nin title I funding, whereas we will experience a reduction of over \n$2,727,000.\n  So I guess for some States this is a good deal because they are \ngetting more money. I am glad they are, if they have that additional \nneed. But the State of Minnesota has the additional need, also. More \nchildren are coming in from all over the world; children who need \nEnglish second-language skills; children who are without any education \nfrom countries that have been war ravaged for years; children coming \nfrom other States with educational achievement levels grades behind the \nstudents in Minnesota.\n  We cannot offer the services they are entitled to under Federal law \nthat existed before No Child Left Behind? We cannot offer the services \nthat were promised to them and to us as a condition for voting in favor \nof No Child Left Behind? I voted against that, I will confess, as did \nmy colleague at the time in the Senate. Maybe that is why Minnesota is \nbeing singled out and punished. I do not know. I do not understand why, \nexcept that I know the two Senators from Massachusetts--one is the \nranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nand he certainly made a commitment to this program at the time because \nhe was assured there was going to be full funding; the other Senator, \nof course, is now the Democratic candidate for President of the United \nStates. I find it really not coincidental that is one of the two States \nthat is singled out to be cut back in funds.\n  But I do not understand why Minnesota--why Minnesota--is suffering \naccordingly. It is wrong. It is wrong to be cutting back funds when you \nare saying to the American people that no child is going to be left \nbehind and then you turn around and make that a lie. It is wrong. It is \nunfair to the State of Minnesota.\n  Mr. Secretary of Education, you owe it to our State to come back and \nexplain to our educators why it is that they are going to have to do \nmore with less next year. Why is it that we are one of two States being \ncut back?\n  I am deeply offended. On behalf of the people of Minnesota, I am \nenraged that we are being treated in this unfair way--and on behalf, \nmost of all, of the children in the State of Minnesota who are not \ngoing to be receiving the special services to which they are entitled. \nWe are going to force cutbacks in educational services affecting all of \nour schoolchildren. They are being left behind, Mr. Secretary. Mr. \nPresident, they are being left behind. What are you going to do about \nit?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, earlier in the day, a number of my \ncolleagues took the floor to pay tribute and respect to my dear friend \nand colleague, Senator Byrd. I was unable to be here because I was \ninvolved in a markup of legislation. I want to take a few moments now, \nas we bring the day's business to a close, to pay tribute to my very \ngood friend on the occasion of his 17,000th vote in the Senate, an all-\ntime record.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has given this Nation \nand his beloved State of West Virginia the very best in public service. \nThe civility, the intelligence, the commitment, and dedication that \nSenator Byrd brings to this body commands the respect and admiration of \nevery Member of the Senate. That has been expressed from time to time \nby many of us in this Chamber.\n  The vote today is but one of many milestones for Senator Byrd, but it \ndoes offer all of us the opportunity to reflect upon his very special \nplace in the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd often refers to the Senate as a ``pillar of the \nConstitution.'' I think it is fair to refer to Senator Byrd as a \n``pillar of the Senate.'' The Senator's dedication to this body and its \nhistory--he has written, after all, the definitive history of the U.S. \nSenate--its customs and its procedures are unequaled by any other \nMember I have known. And his dedication to the Senate ranks with his \ndedication to the country, to the State of West Virginia, and to the \nConstitution.\n  As this body's indisputable expert on parliamentary procedure, it is \nonly fitting that Senator Byrd's first vote, the first of the 17,000 \nvotes that we celebrate today, was cast on January 8, 1959, and was \nprocedural in nature. That vote began, of course, a legacy of \nextraordinary leadership and service in this body.\n  The able Senator from West Virginia has not only employed his mastery \nof how the Senate functions effectively in floor debates, but he has \nused it to pass on and protect and perfect the spirit of this body \nwhich he has called ``the cornerstone of our constitutional system.''\n  Given this incredible record of service and experience, Senator Byrd \nnow, I think fairly, stands as both the intellect and the conscience of \nthis Chamber. He constantly reminds us of the fundamentals of our \ndemocracy and the role the Framers of our Constitution envisioned for \nthe legislative branch.\n  No Member of the U.S. Congress has a deeper understanding of the \nConstitution and of the Legislature's vital function as a guardian of \nour fundamental national document.\n  It is because of this institutional knowledge, his devotion to the \nSenate's distinguishing characteristics, and his devotion to the \ncivility that has customarily underpinned the interaction of the \nMembers of this body that in times of severe national crisis, and on \noccasion constitutional crisis when the Senate is faced with the most \ndifficult of choices, Members from both sides of the aisle have sought \nthe leadership of Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  I consider it a singular honor to serve with him in the Senate.
