Many are anxious \nand fearful as the lives of our Nation's forces and their allies are in \nharm's way, opposing an evil and oppressive regime. We pray for swift \nvictory and a safe return. We know that the one certainty of war is \nsacrifice. And yet there is the haunting thought that if nothing is \nworth fighting and dying for, then evil goes unchallenged, cruelty \nunthwarted, and oppression unchecked. What then is worth living for?\n  We pray for courage and inner strength for those young men and women, \nwho, on their country's behalf, offer a forceful, yet vulnerable \npresence to compel a malevolent dictator's overthrow.\n  Lord, we live in a day when the foundations of truth and goodness \nhave been despised and denigrated and lives are built on hedonism, \ncynicism, and relativism. Yet these are sand, and after life's quaking \nstorms only the things which cannot be shaken remain.\n  O God, let good be brought out of evil as people realize that freedom \nis a luxury, denied for most of history to most of humanity. Thus, may \nour gratitude for our own freedom be shown by never taking it for \ngranted or using it wantonly, forgetting its cost in sacrifice, past \nand present.\n  May these Senators, as guardians of this precious freedom, be its \nsharers with others, as blessed by Thee. And may they use their \nposition of power for a lasting purpose that benefits this fair land \nand far beyond. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4315-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ted Stevens led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4315-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong and \nunconditional support for our troops in Iraq. As the war continues to \nprogress, I have every confidence in their capabilities, their courage, \nand their commitment. The passage by unanimous vote last week of a \nresolution in support of our troops sent a message to all the world \nthat Congress is united behind our men and women in the gulf.\n  I have also come to express my sincere condolences to the families of \nthose brave individuals who have already made the ultimate sacrifice in \nservice to our Nation. Last Friday, I learned that my State of Maine \nhad suffered two losses early in the fighting, two marines with ties to \nthe State of Maine: CPT Jay Aubin and CPL Brian Kennedy were among \nthose killed when their helicopter crashed in the Kuwaiti desert. \nCaptain Aubin grew up in Skowhegan, ME, and his parents, Thomas Aubin \nand Nancy Chamberlain, live in our State still. Corporal Kennedy's \nmother lives in Port Clyde, ME. No words can express fully my sorrow \nover their loss and my\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nthanks for the service of their sons. Their brave sacrifice will never \nbe forgotten.\n  On many occasions in recent months, this institution has debated the \nthreat posed by Saddam Hussein and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \nIndividual Senators have had honest disagreements about the right \ncourse to take in confronting Saddam Hussein. Now that our troops are \nengaged in battle against the forces of Saddam Hussein, we must speak \nwith one voice.\n  The outcome of this conflict is not in doubt. Our military is the \nbest equipped with the best trained force in the world's history. As \nthe representative from Maine on the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nit has been my privilege and honor to work side by side with our \nmilitary leaders to ensure this is the case.\n  If there is any message we could continue to send to the Members of \nthe Iraqi military, it would be to express the ultimate futility of \ntheir continued resistance. The President has made clear, we come not \nas conquerors but as liberators.\n  War is a harsh, painful, brutal reality even when the goals are \nnoble, even when the goals are security and freedom. As we have already \nseen, there is very little certainty in combat. In the fog of war, \nthere are innumerable factors that might affect the course of battle. \nWe often receive conflicting reports, confusing media accounts, and \ndistorted descriptions of the battlefield. But one thing should never \nbe in doubt, one thing is unmistakable: Our troops will prevail, and \nthey will receive whatever support they need to bring this conflict to \na successful end as rapidly as possible.\n  I express my gratitude to the families of the young men and women \ncurrently in harm's way who have been left behind. They truly carry a \nheavy burden, and they deserve the respect, the thanks, and the \nadmiration of every American. As we have seen so painfully over the \nweekend, victory will not come without cost. While our military leaders \nwill continue to do everything they can to minimize the danger that our \ntroops will face, there is still much risk and much danger.\n\n  To the wives, the husbands, the parents, and the children of troops, \nthank you for your bravery, your strength, and your patriotism. Thank \nyou for your love of country.\n  When I first came to the Senate over 6 years ago, I would not have \nimagined this moment. We lived in a different world then. But today, as \nour troops engage in battle, let us all show our unwavering support for \nour troops, thank them for their service, and express our heartfelt \nhope for their safe return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4316-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4316-S4317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR STATE AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, just as we stand behind our troops in \nIraq, so must we also unite here at home behind our first responders as \nthey protect our communities from the threat of a terrorist attack.\n  As the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have made \nhelping first responders one of my top priorities. Now that we have \nconfirmed Secretary Tom Ridge and helped to get the new Department of \nHomeland Security up and running, it is time to turn to strengthening \nthe new Department's partnership with State and local governments and \nthe first responders who protect our homeland.\n  On March 1, our home security structure began to come into place as \nSecretary Ridge incorporated nearly two dozen agencies into the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. While this new framework will provide \nmuch needed focus to tackling the threat of a terrorist attack, we must \nalso provide the resources to our communities and their police, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical personnel who stand ready to \nrespond to a crisis.\n  Just as they stand by to protect our citizens, our first responders \ndeserve a government that stands by them.\n  In a recent conversation with Secretary Ridge, we discussed the fact \nthat if disaster does strike, if there is another terrorist attack, it \nis our first responders, not some official from Washington, who would \nbe on the front lines. I plan on holding a series of hearings and \nintroducing legislation streamlining and strengthening Federal support \nfor State and local homeland security efforts.\n  We must continue to combat terrorism at every stage. The war on \nterrorism has already yielded some very significant victories. The fall \nof the Taliban has denied al-Qaida its most important sanctuary. The \ncapture of several high-ranking al-Qaida operatives has also pushed us \nforward in our quest to end terrorist attacks. Working with foreign \ngovernments, we have disrupted much of the al-Qaida network.\n  But we know that terrorist cells continue to operate around the \nworld, and the threat in the United States remains high. The threat \nremains very real as terrorists still plot to attack our Nation.\n  Just as we must continue to attack the threats at their sources, we \nmust also strengthen our ability to detect, prevent, deter, and respond \nto a terrorist attack.\n  Recently, I met with some 40 officials from communities around the \nState of Maine. I have also spoken with police officers, firefighters, \nand emergency medical staff personnel. They have all expressed concerns \nabout navigating the maze of Federal homeland security funding.\n  I met recently with Maine's Adjutant General, GEN Joe Tinkham, who \ntalked to me about the tangled web of some 40 Federal Agencies and \nDepartments that have a role in combating terrorism and in funding \nlocal homeland security efforts. He told me that, while underfunded, in \nsome ways the previous system worked better for the State of Maine \nbecause there was much more flexibility. Now he finds that certain \nmoney is set aside that can only be used for equipment purchases, when \nwhat is needed is joint training to learn to use that equipment \neffectively in some communities.\n\n  The new Department of Homeland Security will address many of these \nconcerns by helping to streamline and coordinate programs formerly \nadministered by a number of different agencies. But we must follow up \non these efforts to help the new Department enhance its efforts to fund \nfirst responders.\n  I have received a lot of advice on this issue from Maine's \nfirefighters, police officers, and State and local officials. They have \nsuggested a new partnership with the Department of Homeland Security \nthat gives them the flexibility they need to meet whatever is the need \nfor homeland security at the local level.\n  Last year, we put a downpayment on the needs of our communities. The \nincreased funding of programs, such as the FIRE Act, and those within \nthe Office of Domestic Preparedness, are important steps forward in \nproviding the necessary resources.\n  But we must build on this success and provide a stronger framework. \nFirst responders' needs are as diverse as the States and the \ncommunities they protect. Our grant programs and other assistance must \nbe flexible enough to reflect this diversity. But, unfortunately, that \nis not the case under the current approach.\n  Maine's first responders and local governments have told me their \nneeds range from communications equipment to personnel to more \neffective training. Mainers, and others beyond the beltway, do not just \nhave needs; they also have tremendously creative and effective ideas \nthat can be channeled into the new coordinated community-based homeland \nsecurity strategy.\n  Over the coming weeks, I will be holding hearings in the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs to begin to build a consensus for legislation \nhelping homeland security transition many of its important grant \nprograms into their new directorates. I plan to call on States, \ncommunities, and, most importantly, our first responders who stand on \nthe front lines to learn how we can better meet their needs.\n  Listening to the ideas and needs of our communities and first \nresponders will be the most effective way of developing legislation to \nmake sure our homeland security dollars go as far as possible. We want \nlegislation that will help provide the right resources to the right \npeople.\n  Our President and Secretary Ridge have shown tremendous leadership in \nfocusing the new Department's efforts, not only in developing a \nnational strategy but in focusing its efforts outside Washington.\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\n  Congress must shift its homeland security focus from Washington to \nour borders, our shorelines, and our communities. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with communities across Maine and around the country \nso that we can build a better and stronger homeland security \npartnership in the months and years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4317-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4317-S4320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A FAILING BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was pointed out in the initial remarks \nof my friend and colleague from the State of Maine, we will have \nintensive consideration of the budget starting early tomorrow morning, \nand then concluding late Wednesday afternoon. And we are going to do so \nwith very strict time constraints.\n  I want to be able to express my views on this legislation in terms of \nwhere I think we are in the consideration of the budget, and my \nconcerns for where I think we will end up on Wednesday evening at the \ntime of our vote. This is an enormously important matter that is before \nthe Congress.\n  All of our thoughts and prayers and focus are outside this Chamber \nnow, and with the brave men and women in our Armed Forces overseas. I \nthink all of us are following this closely and have shared in the \npositive outcomes that many of those in the Armed Forces have \nexperienced. And we have also felt the shattering sense of loss that \nhas been experienced by many of the families, when we have seen the \ndifficulties and the tragedies which have developed over this period of \ntime.\n  Nonetheless, our work must go on. It is important, as we think about \nthe extraordinarily brave men and women abroad, that we think about \nwhat this budget should really be all about. It seems to me the best \nway we can show appreciation for those service men and women and their \nsacrifice and their valor is to live up to the ideals they are fighting \nfor so bravely. The budget, to a very important extent, reflect our \npriorities as a nation and that is what I want to address this \nafternoon.\n  As we all sat in this Senate chamber last week, casting votes on \nbudget amendments hour after hour, it was striking how detached the \nproceedings were from the real concerns of the American people. While \nthey were concentrating intently on every detail of the unfolding war \nin Iraq, the Senate was considering a budget that our Republican \ncolleagues had proposed without any funding whatsoever for the enormous \ncost of the war and the potentially even more enormous cost of its \naftermath.\n  Tomorrow, the President will send to Congress a request for \nadditional funds to cover the initial costs of war in Iraq. There is no \ndoubt that all of us in Congress will want to provide that support to \nour troops as quickly as possible.\n  As we watched events unfold on our television screens in recent days, \nit became clearer than ever that more needs will arise because of the \nwar--both in the short term and the long term. We deserve a budget that \ndoes not squander the treasury in time of war. We need a budget that \nprovides for our troops and meets our priorities at home.\n  In this time of national unity, we owe it to our troops and to all \nAmericans to make this the best America we can be. That is patriotism \nat its best--to support our men and women abroad, and to fight at home \nfor the values they represent--for a strong and secure America, for a \nstrong economy, for equality and opportunity for all, for better jobs \nand better schools and better health care.\n  Mr. President, $1.6 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy will \nnot win this war. It will not help laid off workers and their families. \nIt will not strengthen our schools or provide prescription drugs for \nour seniors. It is as though this budget had been drafted in a sound-\nproofed room, so that the sounds of war and the voices of the American \npeople could not be heard. On the opposite side of the Capitol, the \nHouse of Representatives has already passed an even more extreme \nRepublican budget, slashing hundreds of billions of dollars from urgent \ndomestic priorities, including some for which even the Bush \nadministration had requested support. Any objective observer of Capitol \nHill can quickly see how out of touch this Congress has become.\n  A time of war should be a time of national unity--of Americans \npulling together and sharing the burdens fairly. The people's elected \nrepresentatives should reinforce this national spirit with leadership \nthat says we are all in this together, that we are here to help one \nanother. As we confront the grave threats of terrorism and war, it is \nparticularly important to build a broad national consensus at home \nbased on our shared values. Many of us have become deeply concerned in \nrecent years that our policies are moving farther and farther away from \nthese shared national values. Increasingly, major decision about how \nAmerica should be governed are being made by a narrow partisan majority \nin Congress with utter disdain for the basic needs of the overwhelming \nmajority of our people.\n  This Republican budget says it all. The last thing that America needs \nin this time of war is policies that divide us--which concentrate so \nmuch of the Nation's resources in the hands of the wealthiest few, \nwhile ignoring the needs of tens of millions of hard-working \nfamilies. Especially at this moment when we are sending young American \nmen and women into harm's way to defend our highest ideals, we in \nCongress have a responsibility to support policies which keep faith \nwith those ideals.\n\n  It is bad enough that the Republican budget fails to meet that \nchallenge. It is even worse that the narrow Republican majorities in \nthe Senate and House are bent on rushing the budget through Congress \nquickly, while public attention is preoccupied with the war. If it ever \npasses, this budget will be part of the collateral damage caused by the \nwar, haunting us for years to come.\n  It is astonishing that our Senate Republican colleagues who protested \nso loudly about the failure of Senate Democrats to produce a budget \nlast year are themselves proposing such an atrocious budget this year. \nPassing no budget would be better than passing this irresponsible \nbudget. The worst thing would be to lock in these bad policy choices \nfor years to come.\n  We recognize that it will take no small amount of political courage \nfour enough of our Republican colleagues to join us in voting down this \nbudget. Hopefully, it will happen.\n  The time is past for debate about whether we should go to war with \nIraq. Now that our troops are engaged in battle, we all join together \nin praying for their safety and for a quick and successful end to the \nconflict.\n  We need a budget which honestly addresses the cost of the war and the \nfuture rebuilding of Iraq. At a time when our troops in the field are \nbeing asked to make great sacrifices, the least that this Congress owes \nthem is to be honest about the burden we are undertaking in Iraq.\n  Even if the war ends quickly and successfully, the rebuilding of Iraq \nwill be a lengthy and costly process that will make this budget \nobsolete on the day it is passed. The Feingold Amendment was a first \nstep to address the cost of the war for the next few months, but \nRepublican leaders boasted that they would remove the amendment from \nthe final bill. The Nation's budget must not be turned into a vehicle \nfor such gross political deception--for concealing costs rather than \nsetting sound priorities. This is a time of high national purpose for \nAmerica. It should be no less on the floor of the Senate.\n  We need a budget which will also strengthen America at home. When our \ntroops return, we want them to come home to a strong economy and secure \njobs. We want them to come home to better schools for their children, \nnot schools facing drastic budget cuts, fewer teachers and overcrowded \nclassrooms. We want them to be able to afford health care and health \ninsurance for their families.\n  This budget fails all of these tests. It rejects the measures needed \nto restore the economy and to deal with layoffs and rising \nunemployment. Instead, it embraces rigid right-wing policies that have \nnot worked and will not work and do not distribute the burden fairly. \nIn 2001, President Bush pushed $1.3 trillion in tax cuts through \nCongress that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. Now, \nthe Administration is seeking an additional $1.6 trillion in tax cuts \nthat are even more heavily slanted toward the rich. That is not the\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nsolution to the problems facing America's families. It is a strategy \nthat will only add to their problems.\n  The impact of these new tax breaks is clear from the Administration's \nown budget. When the White House says ``no'' to obviously needed \nspending on urgent domestic priorities such as education and health \ncare, it says the war on terrorism requires us all to tighten our \nbelts. But the belts will be tightened mainly on low and middle income \nindividuals and families. The wealthiest Americans are not asked to \ntighten their belts at all. Just the opposite--they would receive major \nnew tax breaks.\n\n  As a result of the Republican tax plan enacted 2 years ago, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers will each save an average of $50,000 \na year. Now the administration wants to give each of them even more--an \nadditional $25,000 a year.\n  Under the administration's so-called ``economic growth'' package, \nhouseholds with annual incomes over $1 million will receive an average \ntax cut of nearly $90,000 each year. In contrast, households in the \nmiddle of the income spectrum will receive an average of less than $300 \na year in tax benefits.\n  It cannot be wartime for other Americans, but still peacetime for the \nrich. One of America's most basic values is that the country's burden \nmust be fairly shared.\n  We know that the problems facing working families have grown steadily \nworse since this administration took office in January 2001. Certainly, \nthe White House policies are not the sole cause of the economic \ndownturn we have witnessed in the last 2 years. The stock market began \nits decline before the President took office, and so did the recession. \nThe economic shock caused by the September 11 attacks was beyond the \nadministration's control. Fear of the war has been hanging heavily over \nthe economy.\n  But the response of the administration to these economic challenges \nhas been ineffective. The administration's one-track-minded commitment \nto massive new tax breaks for the wealthy as the cure for every \neconomic ailment has made a bad situation even worse. The \nadministration has ignored remedies that would provide a significant \nshort term stimulus, while undermining our long-term economic strength. \nAs a result, the economy continues to stagnate, and the number of \nfamilies facing serious hardship continues to grown.\n  Huge numbers of working men and women have lost their jobs. As \nlayoffs mount, millions of others live in fear of being the next to be \nlet go. Two and a half million fewer private sector jobs exist in \nAmerica today than existed just 2 years ago. Men and women across the \ncountry looking for a job are finding it increasingly difficult to \nobtain one. The number of long-term unemployed workers has almost \ntripled since the administration took office. This is the first \nadministration in 50 years to preside over a net loss of private sector \njobs.\n  In the face of these serious problems, it is cruel and unconscionable \nthat Republicans leap to support extravagant tax breaks for the \nwealthy, yet refuse to support a reasonable extension and expansion of \nunemployment benefits. They continue to oppose obviously needed and \nobviously urgent assistance for millions of workers facing long-term \nunemployment and hundreds of thousands of part-time and low-wage \nworkers who receive no benefits under current law.\n  Affordable health insurance should be another high priority. Yet it \nis becoming less and less affordable for large numbers of families. \nOver two million more Americans are without health insurance today \ncompared to 2 years ago. One in ten small businesses which offered \ntheir employees health insurance in 2000 no longer do so now. The \naverage cost of health insurance is soaring at double digit rates--up \nby 11 percent in 2001 and another 12.7 percent in 2002--nearly four \ntimes the rate of inflation. The health care vise on working families \nis becoming tighter and tighter every year.\n  Our public schools are facing budget cuts rights and left. The \nadministration's words are that no child should be left behind, but the \ndeeds in this budget leave over six million students behind, without \nthe help they need to get a good education.\n  The cost of college is rising beyond the reach of more and more \nfamilies. The gap between college tuition and the tuition assistance \nprovided by the Federal Government has grown by $1,900 in the first 2 \nyears of the Bush Administration. As a result, the number of able \nstudents denied the chance to go to college is growing each year.\n  For millions of families, their retirement savings have seriously \neroded in the last 2 years. Savings in 401(k) plans and other similar \nplans has plunged by $473 billion in the last 2 years. Individual \nretirement accounts dropped by $229 billion in 2001. The 2002 data are \nnot available yet, but given the poor performance of the stock market, \nanother steep decline is certain. Many middle-aged workers who thought \ntheir retirements were safe are suddenly being forced to stay in the \nworkforce longer and reduce their standard of living in retirement.\n  These are the realities American families face today.\n  In this situation, the most irresponsible action Congress can take \nwould be to accept the proposal of the administration to enact massive \nnew permanent tax cuts.\n  We cannot afford the loss of an additional $1.6 trillion from the \nTreasury. Temporary tax cuts to stimulate the economy are affordable, \nbut the administration's large permanent new tax breaks are not. If \nthat plan is adopted, the Federal Government will not have the \nresources to meet urgent domestic needs in education, in health care, \nand in homeland security. It will be virtually impossible to keep the \nNation's commitment to Social Security and Medicare.\n  The administration is misusing the recession to justify major new \npermanent tax breaks for the wealthy. Exempting dividends from taxes \nwill take $400 billion out of the Treasury over the next 10 years. Half \nof that enormous amount--$200 billion--will go directly into the \npockets of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers, who are not exactly the \nones struggling to makes ends meet in this faltering economy. Eighty \npercent of taxpayers will receive little or nothing from the dividend \nproposal. To use the need for an immediate economic stimulus as an \nexcuse to enact costly new permanent tax breaks for the wealthy is \ncynical trickle-down economics at its worst. The American people \ndeserve better from the White House.\n  The administration obviously does not want to discuss why its tax \nbreaks are targeted so heavily to the wealthiest. Its typical response \nis to shout ``class warfare.'' That's nonsense. It's not our \ndescription of the White House plan that constitutes class warfare. A \ntax plan which gives the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans more in tax \nbreaks than the total given to the other 90 percent is the real class \nwarfare.\n  Clearly, the Nation cannot afford all of these tax breaks. Cuts of \nthis magnitude will condemn us to escalating deficits that will weaken \nthe economy and make it impossible to meet our long-term commitments to \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Instead of reducing tax rates on the top income brackets in future \nyears and repealing the estate tax, we should freeze those rates at \ntheir current levels and retain the tax on estates over $ 4 million. We \nshould not enact any new permanent tax breaks for the wealthy, when we \nare so clearly failing to address so many of our most urgent national \nneeds.\n  For the cost of reducing the tax rate on the top income brackets, we \ncould provide the additional funds needed to keep the promise made in \nthe ``No Child Left Behind'' education reform act and keep it for a \ndecade.\n  For the cost of permanently repealing the estate tax on the super-\nwealthy, we could help to ensure that Social Security has the resources \nneeded to keep the promise of a secure retirement for future \ngenerations.\n  For the cost of President Bush's newly proposed $726 billion package \nof additional tax breaks tilted to the wealthiest taxpayers, we could \nfully fund a generous program of prescription drug assistance for \nsenior citizens under Medicare, and extend health insurance to millions \nof uninsured families.\n  We know which of these choices will make our country stronger and \nhelp us meet the challenges of the future. A\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\ncraven decision to give more and more tax breaks to the richest among \nus is a decision to ignore America's greatest needs.\n  Now more than ever is the time for Congress to bring the Nation's \npolicies into line with the Nation's values. The courage of our forces \nfighting in Iraq and the courage of our fellow citizens who responded \nto the terrorist attacks on 9/11 should inspire us all. In the time of \ngreat national purpose for America, Congress must respond.\n  Consider what we can accomplish if our policies are brought into line \nwith our national values. The American people want us to measure \nsuccess by people helped and problems solved. They want policies that \nare worthy of a great and generous people in this new century.\n  Providing every child with a good education from the early years \nthrough college that will enable them to reach their full potential \nwould be consistent with our most basic values. Yet, today, far too \nmany children are denied that opportunity. The children of working \nfamilies, who need help the most, often receive the least when it comes \nto education. The administration's budget leaves six million--six \nmillion--children behind. It would actually reduce funds for after-\nschool activities for more than half a million students. How can \nPresident Bush abandon his unequivocal promise of full funding for the \nschool reforms required by the No Child Left Behind Act? That \nlegislation was signed into law with great fanfare by the President a \nyear ago. But when the klieg lights go out and the bunting comes down \nand the cameras leave, the money isn't there. The Republican budget \nbefore us provides $8.9 billion less than we promised America's \nchildren a year ago. This budget has the wrong priorities and it should \nnot be enacted.\n  In the past, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have worked \ntogether to reject the administration's anti-education budgets. By a \nsubstantial bipartisan majority, we have increased the funds for \neducation. We should do the same this year. Congress must--even if the \nadministration won't--live up to our promise to leave no child behind.\n  At the same time, we have to provide more college students with \nfinancial aid to meet rising tuition costs. The gap between the cost of \ncollege tuition and the level of tuition assistance has grown by $1,900 \nsince President Bush took office. We took a step toward narrowing the \ngap last Friday by agreeing to increase Pell Grants. We must make \ncertain that the increase remains in the final budget.\n  Just as Social Security is a promise to senior citizens, we should \nmake ``Education Security'' a promise to every young American. If you \nwork hard, if you finish high school, if you are admitted to college, \nwe should guarantee that you can afford the cost of the four years it \ntakes to earn a degree.\n  We will fight to make the dream of a college education a reality for \nall. We will fight this month, this year, and we will not stop, because \nthe fight is for America's future.\n  We must do the same for health care. Every American family is facing \nsome aspect of the worsening health care crisis we face today. Health \ncare costs are skyrocketing. Families with insurance are facing more \nand more increases in their insurance premiums, for fewer and fewer \nbenefits. The number of Americans without any insurance at all is \nunacceptably high and rapidly rising. No family with insurance today \ncan be sure that it will be there for them tomorrow if serious illness \nstrikes. For senior citizens, the 40-year old promise of good health \ncare under Medicare is now being broken every day, because Medicare \ndoes not cover prescription drugs.\n\n  In the face of this crisis, the administration proposed only a meager \namount to help the uninsured, and Senate Republicans cut even that \nsmall amount nearly in half.\n  In the face of this crisis, the Republican budget pays lip service to \nthe needs of senior citizens for prescription drug coverage but fails \nto provide adequate resources to do the job. Even worse, they propose \nto dismantle Medicare and force senior citizens into HMOs and other \nprivate insurance plans in order to obtain even the paltry drug benefit \nthey are offering.\n  No senior citizens should be forced to give up the doctor they trust \nto get the prescription drugs they need. No budget accepted by this \nCongress should put tax breaks for the rich ahead of health care for \nsenior citizens and their families.\n  The Republican plan for Medicaid is equally unacceptable. It would \nvictimize 46 million of the neediest and most dependent of our fellow \nAmericans. The administration is proposing the same type of destructive \nblock grants for Medicaid that the Gingrich Congress failed to enact \nalmost a decade ago. The Republican block grant plan would leave \nmillions of innocent victims in its wake--sick and needy children and \ntheir parents, the disabled, and the low-income elderly.\n  The GOP plan for block grants to States would abolish the Federal \nChild Health Insurance Program, which now gives over 5 million children \nthe chance for a healthy start in life. Millions of senior citizens \nwould no longer be able to count on Federal nursing home standards to \nprotect them if they are unable to continue to live in their own homes. \nSpouses of senior citizens who need nursing care would no longer be \nguaranteed even a minimum amount of income and savings on which to \nlive.\n  States need fiscal relief now, so that they can respond to the human \nand financial devastation that the current recession is causing to \nState budgets, and especially to State Medicaid plans. The demands on \nMedicaid are greater than ever for States, as more families lose their \njobs and turn to Medicaid for health care. But instead of offering real \nhelp, the GOP budget offers the fool's gold of State Medicaid \n``flexibility.'' Instead of the funds that States need to protect the \nMedicaid safety net, the Republican budget offers only a license to \nStates to shred it.\n  Finally, small in cost but large in symbolism is the failure of this \nbudget to address the immediate needs of the unemployed. That failure \nvividly illustrates how far this budget strays from our values.\n  How can a budget deny unemployment benefits to the long-term \nunemployed at the same time it offers $1.3 trillion in additional tax \ncuts disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers?\n  More then four million Americans will be unemployed with no federal \nbenefits after June 1 under current law. These men and women have \nworked hard for years, paid into the unemployment fund, and now find \nthemselves without a job through no fault of their own. They are \nvictims of the stagnant economy, and the economic news is not getting \nany better. Another 308,000 workers lost their jobs last month. New \njobs are scarce. On average, there are three unemployed workers lined \nup for each job opening. The administration's own budget estimate \nacknowledges that unemployment will stay at its current high level for \nthe rest of the year.\n  Where is our concern for these four million workers? Where is our \nsense of fairness? How can anyone argue that we have $1.3 trillion for \nnew tax breaks but do not have $16 billion to help the unemployed and \ntheir families?\n  It is disturbing that our Republican colleagues are considering such \nan irresponsible budget at this very moment when our forces are risking \ntheir very lives for us in Iraq. Our colleagues would be foolish to \nexpect the shock and awe of the war to distract the American people for \nlong from noticing what is transpiring now in the arcane pages of this \nbudget. They can see that the choices this budget makes will make their \nlives more difficult. It would be wise to reject this budget, and try \nagain to get it right.\n  If we take inspiration from the willingness of our troops to make \ngreat personal sacrifices for America, it can mark the beginning of a \nnew era of common purpose--a return to unselfish policies which truly \nreflect America's values.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4317-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4317-S4320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A FAILING BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was pointed out in the initial remarks \nof my friend and colleague from the State of Maine, we will have \nintensive consideration of the budget starting early tomorrow morning, \nand then concluding late Wednesday afternoon. And we are going to do so \nwith very strict time constraints.\n  I want to be able to express my views on this legislation in terms of \nwhere I think we are in the consideration of the budget, and my \nconcerns for where I think we will end up on Wednesday evening at the \ntime of our vote. This is an enormously important matter that is before \nthe Congress.\n  All of our thoughts and prayers and focus are outside this Chamber \nnow, and with the brave men and women in our Armed Forces overseas. I \nthink all of us are following this closely and have shared in the \npositive outcomes that many of those in the Armed Forces have \nexperienced. And we have also felt the shattering sense of loss that \nhas been experienced by many of the families, when we have seen the \ndifficulties and the tragedies which have developed over this period of \ntime.\n  Nonetheless, our work must go on. It is important, as we think about \nthe extraordinarily brave men and women abroad, that we think about \nwhat this budget should really be all about. It seems to me the best \nway we can show appreciation for those service men and women and their \nsacrifice and their valor is to live up to the ideals they are fighting \nfor so bravely. The budget, to a very important extent, reflect our \npriorities as a nation and that is what I want to address this \nafternoon.\n  As we all sat in this Senate chamber last week, casting votes on \nbudget amendments hour after hour, it was striking how detached the \nproceedings were from the real concerns of the American people. While \nthey were concentrating intently on every detail of the unfolding war \nin Iraq, the Senate was considering a budget that our Republican \ncolleagues had proposed without any funding whatsoever for the enormous \ncost of the war and the potentially even more enormous cost of its \naftermath.\n  Tomorrow, the President will send to Congress a request for \nadditional funds to cover the initial costs of war in Iraq. There is no \ndoubt that all of us in Congress will want to provide that support to \nour troops as quickly as possible.\n  As we watched events unfold on our television screens in recent days, \nit became clearer than ever that more needs will arise because of the \nwar--both in the short term and the long term. We deserve a budget that \ndoes not squander the treasury in time of war. We need a budget that \nprovides for our troops and meets our priorities at home.\n  In this time of national unity, we owe it to our troops and to all \nAmericans to make this the best America we can be. That is patriotism \nat its best--to support our men and women abroad, and to fight at home \nfor the values they represent--for a strong and secure America, for a \nstrong economy, for equality and opportunity for all, for better jobs \nand better schools and better health care.\n  Mr. President, $1.6 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy will \nnot win this war. It will not help laid off workers and their families. \nIt will not strengthen our schools or provide prescription drugs for \nour seniors. It is as though this budget had been drafted in a sound-\nproofed room, so that the sounds of war and the voices of the American \npeople could not be heard. On the opposite side of the Capitol, the \nHouse of Representatives has already passed an even more extreme \nRepublican budget, slashing hundreds of billions of dollars from urgent \ndomestic priorities, including some for which even the Bush \nadministration had requested support. Any objective observer of Capitol \nHill can quickly see how out of touch this Congress has become.\n  A time of war should be a time of national unity--of Americans \npulling together and sharing the burdens fairly. The people's elected \nrepresentatives should reinforce this national spirit with leadership \nthat says we are all in this together, that we are here to help one \nanother. As we confront the grave threats of terrorism and war, it is \nparticularly important to build a broad national consensus at home \nbased on our shared values. Many of us have become deeply concerned in \nrecent years that our policies are moving farther and farther away from \nthese shared national values. Increasingly, major decision about how \nAmerica should be governed are being made by a narrow partisan majority \nin Congress with utter disdain for the basic needs of the overwhelming \nmajority of our people.\n  This Republican budget says it all. The last thing that America needs \nin this time of war is policies that divide us--which concentrate so \nmuch of the Nation's resources in the hands of the wealthiest few, \nwhile ignoring the needs of tens of millions of hard-working \nfamilies. Especially at this moment when we are sending young American \nmen and women into harm's way to defend our highest ideals, we in \nCongress have a responsibility to support policies which keep faith \nwith those ideals.\n\n  It is bad enough that the Republican budget fails to meet that \nchallenge. It is even worse that the narrow Republican majorities in \nthe Senate and House are bent on rushing the budget through Congress \nquickly, while public attention is preoccupied with the war. If it ever \npasses, this budget will be part of the collateral damage caused by the \nwar, haunting us for years to come.\n  It is astonishing that our Senate Republican colleagues who protested \nso loudly about the failure of Senate Democrats to produce a budget \nlast year are themselves proposing such an atrocious budget this year. \nPassing no budget would be better than passing this irresponsible \nbudget. The worst thing would be to lock in these bad policy choices \nfor years to come.\n  We recognize that it will take no small amount of political courage \nfour enough of our Republican colleagues to join us in voting down this \nbudget. Hopefully, it will happen.\n  The time is past for debate about whether we should go to war with \nIraq. Now that our troops are engaged in battle, we all join together \nin praying for their safety and for a quick and successful end to the \nconflict.\n  We need a budget which honestly addresses the cost of the war and the \nfuture rebuilding of Iraq. At a time when our troops in the field are \nbeing asked to make great sacrifices, the least that this Congress owes \nthem is to be honest about the burden we are undertaking in Iraq.\n  Even if the war ends quickly and successfully, the rebuilding of Iraq \nwill be a lengthy and costly process that will make this budget \nobsolete on the day it is passed. The Feingold Amendment was a first \nstep to address the cost of the war for the next few months, but \nRepublican leaders boasted that they would remove the amendment from \nthe final bill. The Nation's budget must not be turned into a vehicle \nfor such gross political deception--for concealing costs rather than \nsetting sound priorities. This is a time of high national purpose for \nAmerica. It should be no less on the floor of the Senate.\n  We need a budget which will also strengthen America at home. When our \ntroops return, we want them to come home to a strong economy and secure \njobs. We want them to come home to better schools for their children, \nnot schools facing drastic budget cuts, fewer teachers and overcrowded \nclassrooms. We want them to be able to afford health care and health \ninsurance for their families.\n  This budget fails all of these tests. It rejects the measures needed \nto restore the economy and to deal with layoffs and rising \nunemployment. Instead, it embraces rigid right-wing policies that have \nnot worked and will not work and do not distribute the burden fairly. \nIn 2001, President Bush pushed $1.3 trillion in tax cuts through \nCongress that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. Now, \nthe Administration is seeking an additional $1.6 trillion in tax cuts \nthat are even more heavily slanted toward the rich. That is not the\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nsolution to the problems facing America's families. It is a strategy \nthat will only add to their problems.\n  The impact of these new tax breaks is clear from the Administration's \nown budget. When the White House says ``no'' to obviously needed \nspending on urgent domestic priorities such as education and health \ncare, it says the war on terrorism requires us all to tighten our \nbelts. But the belts will be tightened mainly on low and middle income \nindividuals and families. The wealthiest Americans are not asked to \ntighten their belts at all. Just the opposite--they would receive major \nnew tax breaks.\n\n  As a result of the Republican tax plan enacted 2 years ago, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers will each save an average of $50,000 \na year. Now the administration wants to give each of them even more--an \nadditional $25,000 a year.\n  Under the administration's so-called ``economic growth'' package, \nhouseholds with annual incomes over $1 million will receive an average \ntax cut of nearly $90,000 each year. In contrast, households in the \nmiddle of the income spectrum will receive an average of less than $300 \na year in tax benefits.\n  It cannot be wartime for other Americans, but still peacetime for the \nrich. One of America's most basic values is that the country's burden \nmust be fairly shared.\n  We know that the problems facing working families have grown steadily \nworse since this administration took office in January 2001. Certainly, \nthe White House policies are not the sole cause of the economic \ndownturn we have witnessed in the last 2 years. The stock market began \nits decline before the President took office, and so did the recession. \nThe economic shock caused by the September 11 attacks was beyond the \nadministration's control. Fear of the war has been hanging heavily over \nthe economy.\n  But the response of the administration to these economic challenges \nhas been ineffective. The administration's one-track-minded commitment \nto massive new tax breaks for the wealthy as the cure for every \neconomic ailment has made a bad situation even worse. The \nadministration has ignored remedies that would provide a significant \nshort term stimulus, while undermining our long-term economic strength. \nAs a result, the economy continues to stagnate, and the number of \nfamilies facing serious hardship continues to grown.\n  Huge numbers of working men and women have lost their jobs. As \nlayoffs mount, millions of others live in fear of being the next to be \nlet go. Two and a half million fewer private sector jobs exist in \nAmerica today than existed just 2 years ago. Men and women across the \ncountry looking for a job are finding it increasingly difficult to \nobtain one. The number of long-term unemployed workers has almost \ntripled since the administration took office. This is the first \nadministration in 50 years to preside over a net loss of private sector \njobs.\n  In the face of these serious problems, it is cruel and unconscionable \nthat Republicans leap to support extravagant tax breaks for the \nwealthy, yet refuse to support a reasonable extension and expansion of \nunemployment benefits. They continue to oppose obviously needed and \nobviously urgent assistance for millions of workers facing long-term \nunemployment and hundreds of thousands of part-time and low-wage \nworkers who receive no benefits under current law.\n  Affordable health insurance should be another high priority. Yet it \nis becoming less and less affordable for large numbers of families. \nOver two million more Americans are without health insurance today \ncompared to 2 years ago. One in ten small businesses which offered \ntheir employees health insurance in 2000 no longer do so now. The \naverage cost of health insurance is soaring at double digit rates--up \nby 11 percent in 2001 and another 12.7 percent in 2002--nearly four \ntimes the rate of inflation. The health care vise on working families \nis becoming tighter and tighter every year.\n  Our public schools are facing budget cuts rights and left. The \nadministration's words are that no child should be left behind, but the \ndeeds in this budget leave over six million students behind, without \nthe help they need to get a good education.\n  The cost of college is rising beyond the reach of more and more \nfamilies. The gap between college tuition and the tuition assistance \nprovided by the Federal Government has grown by $1,900 in the first 2 \nyears of the Bush Administration. As a result, the number of able \nstudents denied the chance to go to college is growing each year.\n  For millions of families, their retirement savings have seriously \neroded in the last 2 years. Savings in 401(k) plans and other similar \nplans has plunged by $473 billion in the last 2 years. Individual \nretirement accounts dropped by $229 billion in 2001. The 2002 data are \nnot available yet, but given the poor performance of the stock market, \nanother steep decline is certain. Many middle-aged workers who thought \ntheir retirements were safe are suddenly being forced to stay in the \nworkforce longer and reduce their standard of living in retirement.\n  These are the realities American families face today.\n  In this situation, the most irresponsible action Congress can take \nwould be to accept the proposal of the administration to enact massive \nnew permanent tax cuts.\n  We cannot afford the loss of an additional $1.6 trillion from the \nTreasury. Temporary tax cuts to stimulate the economy are affordable, \nbut the administration's large permanent new tax breaks are not. If \nthat plan is adopted, the Federal Government will not have the \nresources to meet urgent domestic needs in education, in health care, \nand in homeland security. It will be virtually impossible to keep the \nNation's commitment to Social Security and Medicare.\n  The administration is misusing the recession to justify major new \npermanent tax breaks for the wealthy. Exempting dividends from taxes \nwill take $400 billion out of the Treasury over the next 10 years. Half \nof that enormous amount--$200 billion--will go directly into the \npockets of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers, who are not exactly the \nones struggling to makes ends meet in this faltering economy.

No budget accepted by this \nCongress should put tax breaks for the rich ahead of health care for \nsenior citizens and their families.\n  The Republican plan for Medicaid is equally unacceptable. It would \nvictimize 46 million of the neediest and most dependent of our fellow \nAmericans. The administration is proposing the same type of destructive \nblock grants for Medicaid that the Gingrich Congress failed to enact \nalmost a decade ago. The Republican block grant plan would leave \nmillions of innocent victims in its wake--sick and needy children and \ntheir parents, the disabled, and the low-income elderly.\n  The GOP plan for block grants to States would abolish the Federal \nChild Health Insurance Program, which now gives over 5 million children \nthe chance for a healthy start in life. Millions of senior citizens \nwould no longer be able to count on Federal nursing home standards to \nprotect them if they are unable to continue to live in their own homes. \nSpouses of senior citizens who need nursing care would no longer be \nguaranteed even a minimum amount of income and savings on which to \nlive.\n  States need fiscal relief now, so that they can respond to the human \nand financial devastation that the current recession is causing to \nState budgets, and especially to State Medicaid plans. The demands on \nMedicaid are greater than ever for States, as more families lose their \njobs and turn to Medicaid for health care. But instead of offering real \nhelp, the GOP budget offers the fool's gold of State Medicaid \n``flexibility.'' Instead of the funds that States need to protect the \nMedicaid safety net, the Republican budget offers only a license to \nStates to shred it.\n  Finally, small in cost but large in symbolism is the failure of this \nbudget to address the immediate needs of the unemployed. That failure \nvividly illustrates how far this budget strays from our values.\n  How can a budget deny unemployment benefits to the long-term \nunemployed at the same time it offers $1.3 trillion in additional tax \ncuts disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers?\n  More then four million Americans will be unemployed with no federal \nbenefits after June 1 under current law. These men and women have \nworked hard for years, paid into the unemployment fund, and now find \nthemselves without a job through no fault of their own. They are \nvictims of the stagnant economy, and the economic news is not getting \nany better. Another 308,000 workers lost their jobs last month. New \njobs are scarce. On average, there are three unemployed workers lined \nup for each job opening. The administration's own budget estimate \nacknowledges that unemployment will stay at its current high level for \nthe rest of the year.\n  Where is our concern for these four million workers? Where is our \nsense of fairness? How can anyone argue that we have $1.3 trillion for \nnew tax breaks but do not have $16 billion to help the unemployed and \ntheir families?\n  It is disturbing that our Republican colleagues are considering such \nan irresponsible budget at this very moment when our forces are risking \ntheir very lives for us in Iraq. Our colleagues would be foolish to \nexpect the shock and awe of the war to distract the American people for \nlong from noticing what is transpiring now in the arcane pages of this \nbudget. They can see that the choices this budget makes will make their \nlives more difficult. It would be wise to reject this budget, and try \nagain to get it right.\n  If we take inspiration from the willingness of our troops to make \ngreat personal sacrifices for America, it can mark the beginning of a \nnew era of common purpose--a return to unselfish policies which truly \nreflect America's values.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4320-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4320-S4323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are on the verge of completing action \non the budget resolution for this year. The occupant of the chair knows \nwell that tomorrow we will turn our attention to the final amendments. \nThere will be 40 amendments in order on our side, some number on the \nother side, and we will complete action by 4 o'clock on Wednesday.\n  These are momentous decisions that have very important long-term \nimplications. So I thought I would take a moment today to review where \nwe are, where we are headed, and to propose an alternative I will be \nasking my colleagues to vote on tomorrow, so that we have a chance to \ndescribe in some detail what the elements of the Democratic alternative \nare to the budget being proposed from the other side.\n  Let me start by reviewing where we are and reminding colleagues that \njust 2 years ago we were told we had some $5.6 trillion in surpluses \nover the next decade. Now we know that if the President's tax and \nspending policies are adopted, instead of surpluses we will have $2.1 \ntrillion of deficits over the next 10 years. That is especially \nimportant, given the fact that the baby boom generation is poised to \nretire in this 10-year period. In fact, the baby boomers start to \nretire in 2008. This is an extraordinary reversal that has occurred, \n$5.6 trillion in surpluses 2 years ago, $2.1 trillion in deficits now. \nThat is a $7.7 trillion reversal.\n  Let's look at where the money went. This next chart shows where the \nmoney went. Obviously, some of it is because of the economic downturn, \nsome of it is because of additional spending as a result of the attack \non this country. The biggest reason for the disappearance of the \nsurplus is the tax cuts that have been already passed and those that \nthe President proposes. If you take those tax cuts and the associated \ninterest costs, you see it is the biggest single reason for the \ndisappearance of the surplus.\n\n  The second biggest reason is labeled here ``other legislation.'' That \nis primarily spending--spending as a result of the increases for \nnational defense and homeland security. That is where virtually all of \nthe additional spending has gone.\n  The third biggest reason is technical changes, primarily lower \nrevenues--revenues being lower than anticipated, not as a result of the \ntax cut but because the economic models incorrectly predicted what \nrevenue would be for various levels of economic activity.\n  The smallest reason for the disappearance of the surplus is the \neconomic downturn, although it has clearly played a role, at 9 percent.\n  I think what is most sobering about where we are and where we are \nheaded is this chart from the President's own budget. This is from page \n43 of his analytical perspectives. It takes the long view. It looks \nfrom 2002, going out to 2050, if the President's policies are adopted, \nhis tax cuts, his spending. What it shows is we never escape from \ndeficit--never. And these are the good times; these deficits are the \nsmallest as a percentage of our gross domestic product, even though \nthey are record deficits in dollar terms. These are the largest \ndeficits we have ever had in dollar terms.\n  This year, the deficit, not counting Social Security, will be over \n$500 billion on a $2.2 trillion budget. That is a very large deficit by \nany measure. But look at what happens if we adopt the President's plan. \nThose deficits get larger and larger and larger as we go forward \nbecause the cost of them explodes at the very time the cost of the \nFederal Government explodes and at the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration.\n  Some are saying deficits don't really matter. Somehow, even people \nwho, for their whole careers, believed deficits matter and that we \nought to combat deficits are now saying, well, deficits don't really \nmatter, that these are relatively small deficits in the percentage of \nGDP terms, and that we need not really worry about that.\n  Mr. President, I will say this. First of all, these are not small \ndeficits: $500 billion deficit on a $2.2 trillion overall base is a \ndeficit of over 25 percent. As a percentage of GDP, A $500 billion \ndeficit on a GDP of $10.5 trillion is a deficit approaching 5 percent \nof GDP. That is in the range of the very large deficits we saw in the \neighties.\n  Again, what I hope will be remembered is that these are deficits that \nare right on the verge of the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nThat is when the cost to the Federal Government explodes. That is why \nthese deficits are especially dangerous for the long-term economic \nsecurity of the country.\n  For those who say deficits do not really matter, let's turn to Alan \nGreenspan who is the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He believes \ndeficits matter. He said:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n  This chart is especially important because it shows why this matters \nso much. This shows the moment in time we are in and why the previous \nchart from the President's analysis shows this could be the sweet spot. \nIt is because the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security are right \nnow producing hundreds of billions of dollars of surpluses. This year \nthe Social Security trust fund alone will produce over a $160 billion \nsurplus. That is the green bar on this chart. That is the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The blue bar, the smaller bar, is the Medicare \ntrust fund. It is also producing surpluses, although substantially \nsmaller than Social Security. One can see they are much larger in total \nthan the tax cuts that are in place.\n  Look what happens in the next year. Then the size of the tax cuts \nalmost equal the trust fund surpluses. That is true the rest of this \ndecade. Then look what happens. As the trust funds start to go cash \nnegative in the next decade, the cost of the tax cuts explode. Let's \nreality test. We are already in record deficits now, the biggest \ndeficits in dollar terms we have ever had. We are already in record \ndeficit land. The biggest deficit on a unified basis--that means when \nwe put everything into the pot, all spending, all expenditures, all \nrevenue--the biggest deficit we ever had before was under the previous \nPresident Bush, $290 billion--$290 billion.\n  This year the deficit on a unified basis is going to be over $400 \nbillion. Remember, that does not count the $160 billion that is being \ntaken from Social Security trust fund surpluses. Put those together and \nwe are over $560 billion.\n  What is ominous about this is that as we go forward, when the trust \nfunds turn cash negative, the cost of the President's tax cuts \nabsolutely explodes, driving us right off the cliff, deeper and deeper \ndeficits, deeper and deeper debt. That is going to present a future \nCongress and a future administration with extremely difficult choices.\n  Here is what the CBO Director, the Congressional Budget Office, put \nin place by our friends on the other side of the aisle. It was their \nchoice for the Director of CBO. CBO is nonpartisan, but they had the \nopportunity to pick him because they were in the majority. This is what \nhe said:\n\n       Put more starkly, Mr. Chairman, the extremes of what will \n     be required to address our retirement are these: We'll have \n     to increase borrowing by very large, likely unsustainable \n     amounts; raise taxes to 30 percent of GDP, obviously \n     unprecedented in our history; or eliminate most of the rest \n     of Government as we know it. That is the dilemma that faces \n     us in the long run, Mr. Chairman, and these next 10 years \n     will only be the beginning.\n\n  That is what he is referring to there--only the beginning. This is \ngoing to get much more serious as the baby boom generation retires and \nas the cost of the President's tax cuts explode.\n  Some are saying: But this is a growth package, and we are going to \ngrow out of this problem by more and more tax cuts. The so-called \ngrowth part of the President's tax proposal costs $994 billion. The \n$726 billion that is advertised in the newspapers forgets about the \nassociated interest costs. If you reduce your revenue or increase your \nspending, that adds to your interest cost. When you take the whole cost \ntogether, it is $994 billion in this 10-year period, but the first year \nstimulus is only $40 billion. The President only has 4 percent of his \npackage in the year in which we know we need lift to the economy. We \nknow we need stimulus. He is only providing 4 percent of his package in \nthat year. It does not make\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nmuch sense really if we are trying to get the economy moving again and \nyet not add in the long term to the deficits and debt that will make \nour future choices more difficult and more dangerous.\n  This is an analysis of what the President's plan does to economic \ngrowth. It was done by Macroeconomic Advisers. This firm is under \ncontract to the White House to do their macroeconomic analysis. They \nare also under contract to our Congressional Budget Office. Here is \nwhat they say. They say that the President's plan crowds out investment \nand slows the economy after 2004. It is not a growth package at all. It \nis a package that will hurt growth, will retire growth, will reduce \njobs, will reduce opportunity. Why? Because they have concluded the \nPresident's plan and the tax cuts in it are offset not by spending cuts \nbut by borrowing the money. You cannot borrow your way to prosperity.\n  What happens because of the President's plan? We go deeper into \ndeficit--remember, we are already in record deficit now. You cut \nrevenue and you raise spending, which is the President's plan; you go \ndeeper into deficit. You go deeper into deficit and you reduce the pool \nof societal savings. That reduces the pool of funds that is necessary \nfor investment. Less investment, less growth, that is their conclusion. \nBut it is not just their conclusion.\n  We also have an analysis by Economy.com, Mark Zandi, the noted \neconomist there, on the economic impact of the President's plan, \ncomparing it to the plan the Democrats have offered.\n  What they concluded is the plan offered by the Democrats is about \ntwice as strong, is about twice as stimulative as the President's plan. \nIn 2003, the President's plan would increase growth by four-tenths of 1 \npercent; the Democrats' plan by seven-tenths of 1 percent, almost twice \nas much. In 2004, the President's plan would increase growth by half of \n1 percent; the Democrats' plan by nine-tenths of 1 percent. But I think \nthe most interesting conclusion is the conclusion for the entire 10-\nyear period. He has concluded that the President's plan actually hurts \neconomic growth for the 10-year period. From 2003 to 2013, he finds \nthat the President's plan is negative.\n  Why? Well, he says because of this crowding-out effect. Because the \nPresident's plan creates more deficits. That means more borrowing; that \nmeans the Federal Government is in competition with the private sector \nto borrow money; that drives up interest rates. When interest rates go \nup, economic growth goes down. That is the fundamental problem with the \nPresident's plan.\n  Again, it is not just Chairman Greenspan. It is not just \nmacroeconomic advisers. It is not just economy.com. Two hundred fifty \nof the most prominent CEOs in America, who head the Committee for \nEconomic Development, came out 2 weeks ago with a detailed report that \nfound the following: No. 1, current budget projections seriously \nunderstate the problem. In other words, the problem of deficits and \ngrowing debt is much bigger than has been acknowledged. No. 2, while \nslower economic growth has caused much of the immediate deterioration \nof the deficit, the deficits in later years reflect our tax and \nspending choices. No. 3, deficits do matter. No. 4, the aging of our \npopulation compounds the problem.\n  This is really a confirmation of everything I have been saying to my \ncolleagues. Deficits do matter. Of course they matter, just like they \nmatter to a family. A family cannot go out and spend more money than \nthey have in income without it catching up to them at some point.\n  By the way, it does not happen right away. Just like to a family, one \ncan run up those charge cards, spend more money than they have got \ncoming in for awhile, but at some point it catches up to them. So, too, \nwith nations, even great nations such as ours. We can spend more than \nwe take in for awhile, but at some point the chickens come home to \nroost. We cannot have deficits that are growing as a percentage of our \ngross domestic product. That is what every economist will say. We \ncannot have deficits that grow consistently above the size of the \ngrowth of our economy, and that is the problem with the President's \nplan.\n  The deficits grow faster than the economy is growing--not just a \nlittle bit faster, a lot faster. That is what puts us in a very \ndifficult circumstance.\n  Again, that is not just the opinion of the sources I have cited. From \nthe Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, VA, editorial:\n\n       Our challenge is to allow Americans to keep more of their \n     money, the President said in his speech Tuesday. That was a \n     sound argument when the Nation was building up a surplus year \n     after year. But our financial outlook has changed for the \n     worse. There is no money left over to give us back.\n\n  Remember 2 years ago when the President had his plan for a big tax \ncut and he said, we are only giving back one out of every four surplus \ndollars. Remember, the surpluses are gone. There are no surpluses. Now \nall we see is deficits and red ink. There is no money to give back.\n  They continue:\n\n       So the government will borrow billions to make good the \n     President's IOU.\n       Americans should be skeptical about the promise of \n     something for nothing. It is your tax cuts but it is also \n     your Social Security, health care, schools and roads. They \n     all suffer when the government has to borrow to meet its \n     daily expenses.\n\n  It is not just the newspaper in Norfolk, VA. The Deseret News, Salt \nLake City, UT, says:\n\n       Now is not the time to cut taxes. War is unpredictable. . . \n     . A long protracted campaign that triggers counterattacks by \n     terrorists and Iraqi sympathizers could be hugely \n     expensive.\n\n  Boy, were they prescient because today we learned the President is \ngoing to come up this week and ask for another $75 billion for this \nyear alone to wage the war in Iraq, not a dime of which is in the \nbudget. None of that is in the budget.\n\n       Coupled with giant tax cuts, it could send the budget \n     deficit back into levels not seen in a decade or more, which \n     would stifle growth and hamper investment.\n\n  Exactly the points I have been trying to make to our colleagues \nduring this budget debate.\n\n       Congress ought to put the President's tax plan on the shelf \n     for awhile until it knows better how the men and women in \n     uniform are going to be spending their year.\n\n  Let's look at the budget that has been proposed on the other side, \nbecause here is what we see: This year alone, the deficit will be \nsomewhat less than the President has proposed, but still nearly $500 \nbillion, and it never goes away. This is all red ink. This is all \nborrowed money. Not a single year is the deficit below $300 billion \nunder the President's plan or under the plan that the Republicans are \noffering us in the Senate Chamber. It is truly stunning. Those are the \nbiggest deficits we have ever seen.\n  It is not just deficits, but it is also the debt of the country. Two \nyears ago, the President promised that under his plan he would \nvirtually eliminate the debt by 2008. Well, we see that is no longer \noperative. If we enact the Senate GOP budget plan, the total debt of $6 \ntrillion in 2002 will be $12 trillion in 2013, almost doubling in that \nperiod. Many of us think that would be a serious mistake.\n  This is what we see. This line across the chart at zero is baseline. \nThat is if we do not change the revenue policy of the Federal \nGovernment, we do not change the spending policy of the Federal \nGovernment. That is the so-called baseline. If we adopt President \nBush's budget, we can see $2.8 trillion of added debt during this \nperiod. The Senate GOP plan would add $2.2 trillion of debt. What is \ncritical is that we are on the verge of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. This is a time we ought to be paying down debt or prepaying \nliability. Instead, they are talking about dramatically expanding debt, \neither under the President's plan or the Senate GOP plan.\n  I am going to offer an alternative on behalf of Senate Democrats. \nThese are the key elements of this plan: Instead of a $1.6 trillion tax \ncut, we will offer a tax cut much more modest, one that is at the front \nend to give stimulus to the economy, that would cost $61 billion. In \nterms of covering the costs of the Iraq war, there is no provision in \nthe President's budget, no provision in the Senate Budget Committee's \nbudget. We would provide the $80 billion the President calls for.\n  On homeland security, the President and the Senate budget are in the \n$22 billion to $26 billion range for the 10 years. We would provide $80 \nbillion for homeland security, because we think it is necessary.\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\n  On a prescription drug benefit, both of them would provide $400 \nbillion during this 10-year period. We would provide $594 billion for a \nfuller prescription drug benefit. Make no mistake, this is no Cadillac \nplan. To give the American people the plan that we as Members of \nCongress have over that period would cost not $594 billion but $1.8 \ntrillion. To give the plan to the American people that our military has \nwould cost $2.2 trillion over that same period. So it is important to \nunderstand that while we are putting more money into prescription drugs \nthan the President's plan or the Senate Republican plan, it is a long \nway from being generous. As I have indicated, $594 billion is about \none-third of the cost of giving the plan that all Federal employees \nhave to the American people.\n  On education, there is no additional money for IDEA. That is the \npromise we made to States and local communities when we passed the \nDisabilities Act legislation for our schools. We said we would fund 40 \npercent of the costs. We only do half as much. To keep the promise to \nphase it in over 10 years costs $73 billion. We provide for it. Neither \nthe President nor the Senate GOP plan does.\n  On transportation infrastructure, the President actually cuts $18 \nbillion below the baseline, below level funding. The Senate GOP plan \nalso cuts, but now it has been amended by a floor amendment, so they \nbump it up $27 billion. We would provide $71 billion over 10 years \nabove the baseline. Why? Because, No. 1, it is stimulative. You start \nbuilding roads and bridges. Those are good-paying jobs.\n\n  More than that, it increases the efficiency of our economy. If anyone \ndoubts that, go to the Wilson Bridge tonight at 5:30 and see what is \nhappening. Look at the people going nowhere. That has an economic cost \nto our society. Go out on Route 66 tonight and see what is happening \nthere. Absolute gridlock. It is not just in the Washington metroplex, \nbut all across America.\n  In my State of North Dakota, which is not heavily populated, we have \na substantial part of our road and bridge network that needs repair. \nMany of the bridges in this country, something like 40 percent, are \nsubstandard. That will cost money to fix. If a bridge goes out, that \ncreates lockjaw in the whole economic system of that area. That is \nsomething we ought to tend to.\n  There is no additional money in the President's budget or the Senate \nRepublican budget for our Nation's veterans. We provide $13 billion \nover the baseline to say to our veterans: We honor what you do to \ndefend this country, and we believe the promise that has been made to \nyou on your health care and on your treatment ought to be kept. \nVirtually everyone knows the baseline budget for veterans is \ninsufficient. We try to address that with those additions.\n  The difference in deficits? The President adds $2.1 trillion to \ndeficits; $1.6 trillion under the Senate GOP plan as amended; ours is \n$863 billion. The difference between our plan and the President's plan \nis over $1.2 trillion. We have $1.2 trillion less in deficits than the \nPresident's plan. Our plan has $750 billion less in deficits than the \nplan proposed by the Republican majority.\n  The President's plan never balances the budget. The Senate Republican \nplan balances in 2012, perhaps 2013. We balance in 2011. That is a \nwiser course for America and what we should do.\n  I very much hope that our colleagues give close consideration to this \nalternative budget when we vote. I will put more descriptions and \ndetail of our alternative into the Congressional Record so it is \navailable to our colleagues, so when we vote tomorrow on this \nalternative, Members will have a chance to make their own judgment and \nto compare very directly what we have proposed, what the President has \nproposed, and what the Senate majority has proposed. I hope very much \nthat our colleagues will take a close look at what we are suggesting: \n$1.2 trillion less in deficits than the President's plan; over $750 \nbillion less in deficits than the majority has proposed.\n  Yet we have also tried to address the war cost, which is not included \nin either the President's budget or the budget from the majority in the \nSenate. We have tried to address keeping the Federal Government's \npromise to local subdivisions on education funding.\n  We have also tried to address the transportation gridlock in the \ncountry by providing more funds, and the health care needs of America, \nby some additional funding on prescription drugs. And, of course, the \nother difference, the additional funding for our Nation's veterans, \nsomething we believe is especially called for in this time when they \nare sacrificing so much, half a world away in the battle with Iraq. \nAgain, a budget is about choices. That is what we are doing. We are \nmaking choices on behalf of the American people.\n  What is the future going to look like? I believe the budgets proposed \nby the President and the Republican majority are dangerous for this \ncountry. I believe that deeply. They are pushing us deeper and deeper \ninto deficit and debt right on the eve of the retirement of the baby \nboom generation. The cost of the President's tax cuts explode at the \nvery time the cost to the Government explodes because of the retirement \nof the baby boom generation.\n\n  Remember, we are already in record deficits, and the retirement of \nthe baby boomers is not 20 years away, it is not 10 years away; the \nleading edge of the baby boom generation starts to retire in 5 years.\n  I believe we will be condemned in history for failing to face up to \nour responsibilities and our obligations if we do not recognize what is \nright over the horizon. That is not a part of the projection. That is a \nmatter of simple fact. The baby boomers have been born. They are alive \ntoday and they are going to be eligible for Social Security and \nMedicare. We know exactly what is going to happen.\n  The cost to the Federal Government of having twice as many people \neligible for Social Security and Medicare in the years ahead can only \ndo one thing: It will drive up dramatically the cost of Social Security \nand Medicare. And at the very time those costs expand and explode, the \ncost of the President's tax cut will expand and explode and put this \ncountry in deep deficit, in deep debt, and fundamentally threaten the \neconomic security of this country.\n  I fear some of our colleagues actually intend to shred the programs \nof Social Security and Medicare. I don't know what other plan they can \nhave in mind. These details, these projections of the spending and \nrevenue of the Federal Government are very clear.\n  Some have said, well, if the economy grows more strongly, won't that \nhelp? Yes, it will help. But understand that all of these numbers \nassume strong economic growth. They assume the kind of economic growth \nwe have had in the past.\n  Let me also say some will look at the plan that I have provided and \nsay, gee, Senator, you have some more spending than the Republican \nplan. Yes, I do. I pay for this war. I increase funding for homeland \nsecurity. I increase funding for our veterans. I increase funding for \neducation and prescription drugs--just in those areas. The rest of the \nbudget and domestic affairs we hold to a 4-percent increase. That means \nother parts of the budget are actually having to be cut in order to \nprovide for the priorities for education and prescription drugs. Other \nparts of the budget are having to be cut.\n  Let me show a final chart with the long-term spending of the Federal \nGovernment from 1981 through 2013. The peak of Federal spending as a \npercentage of gross domestic product occurred in the 1980s when we were \nat 23.5 percent of gross domestic product going to the Federal \nGovernment. That has come down markedly, to less than 20 percent. Now \nwe have had a jump back up because of the increased defense spending \nand increased homeland security spending.\n  Look at the difference between my budget and the Senate GOP plan. \nThere is very little difference. We wind up at 19.3 percent of gross \ndomestic product under the plan I am proposing, down from 23.5 percent \nin the early 1980s; the Republican plan goes to 18.8 percent, a one-\nhalf of 1 percent difference. That one-half of 1 percent is important \nbecause it is a matter of priorities. It is a matter of choices.\n  The budget I am proposing puts in the $80 billion to fund this war in \nIraq. Our friends on the other side do not have any money to fund the \nwar.\n  No. 2, we provide additional funding for our Nation's veterans, $13 \nbillion,\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nnot a lot of money over 10 years, but it is meaningful to them. It \nmeans we can keep promises we have made to them.\n\n  In the other major areas of difference, I have provided some \nadditional funding for prescription drugs--again, a plan that is very \nmodest compared to what Members of Congress and Federal employees have. \nI have also suggested additional funding for transportation because we \nneed it. We need to improve the efficiency of our transportation system \nin this country.\n  Those are the choices that are going to be before our colleagues. The \nplan I have offered today is a plan that will produce, as I have \nindicated, $1.2 trillion less in deficits than the President's plan; \nover $750 billion less in deficits than the Senate GOP plan. That is \nimportant. That is critically important. I hope my colleagues will take \na close look at this plan. I welcome their support. I urge them to give \nfull consideration to it.\n  Finally, the other major difference is on education. The plan I have \noffered would move us toward keeping the promise we made to States and \nlocal jurisdictions all across America when we passed the IDEA act. We \npromised we would provide 40 percent of the funding. We are doing half \nof it. That is not good enough. When the Federal Government makes a \npromise, it ought to be kept.\n  Tomorrow, under the rules of the Senate, we will not have time to \ndiscuss these options. We will not have much time for debate at all. \nThere will be a minute a side before the vote is called. But all of us \nwill be held accountable for the choices we make tomorrow. They are \nchoices not just for tomorrow and not just for this year, they are \nchoices for the next decade.\n  There has rarely been a more important decade in terms of the choices \nbeing made. What we are about to see is something that has never \nhappened in this country before, a circumstance where we have this baby \nboom generation that almost overnight is going to double the number of \npeople eligible for our retirement programs in this country. Nobody \nwill be able to say 10 years from now, when the crunch really hits, \ngee, we had no idea this was going to happen. Our colleagues are on \nnotice. They know.\n  We have presented now, over and over, in great detail, where we are \nheaded. The choice is ours to make. I hope we make it wisely.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, through treaties and Federal statute, the \nFederal Government has promised to provide health care to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. Sadly, we haven't come close to honoring \nthat commitment. Tomorrow, I intend to offer an amendment to the budget \nresolution to rectify this situation.\n  The IHS is the only source of health care for many Indians, and is \nrequired to provide that help and that support, yet funding has never \nbeen adequate.\n  The chronic underfunding has grown even worse in recent years, as \nappropriations have failed to keep up with the steep rise in private \nhealth care spending.\n  While per capita health care spending for the general U.S. population \nis about $4,400, the Indian Health Service spends only about $1,800 per \nperson on individual health care services. The Government also spends \nconsiderably less on health care for Indians that it spends for \nMedicare beneficiaries, Medicaid recipients, and veterans.\n  This level of funding is woefully inadequate to meet the health care \nneeds of Native Americans--who have a lower life expectancy than other \nAmericans, and disproportionately suffer from a number of serious \nmedical problems. Indians have higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, \nsudden infant death syndrome, and tuberculosis. There is also a great \nneed for substance abuse and mental health services.\n  More funds are needed at the IHS to provide necessary health care \nservices to Indians.\n  The current shortage of funds has startling and disturbing results. \nNative Americans are often denied care that most of us would take for \ngranted and, in many cases, consider essential. They can be required to \nendure long waits before seeing a doctor and may be unable to obtain a \nreferral to see a specialist. As incredible as this may seem, many \nIndians and Alaska Natives seeking health care are subject to a literal \n``life or limb'' test; that is unless their life is threatened or they \nrisk losing a limb, their care is postponed. Others receive no care at \nall.\n  This rationing of care means that all too often Indians are forced to \nwait until their medical conditions become more serious--and more \ndifficult and costly to treat--before they may have access to health \ncare. This is a situation none of us would find acceptable. Yet today \nthis is the reality in Indian country.\n  Last year, Gregg Bourland and Harold Frazier, then the chairman and \nvice chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, sent a letter to the \nIHS. This is how they describe the situation in Eagle Butte, SD:\n\n       In January and February 2002, the Eagle Butte Service Unit \n     on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation has been swamped with \n     children with Influenza A, RSV [Respiratory Syntactical \n     Virus], and one fatal case of meningitis. There are only \n     three doctors on duty, one Physician Assistant, and one Nurse \n     Practitioner. The only pediatrician is the Clinical Director \n     who will not see any patients, even though there is a serious \n     need for the services of a pediatrician.\n       Several of these children have presented with breathing \n     problems, high fever, and severe vomiting. The average \n     waiting time at the clinic has been four and six hours. The \n     average time at the emergency room is similar. Most babies \n     have been sent home without any testing to determine what \n     they have and with nothing but cough syrup and Tylenol. In at \n     least three cases, the baby was sent home after these long \n     waits two or more times with cough syrup, only to be life-\n     flighted soon thereafter because the child could not breathe.\n       The children were all diagnosed by the non-IHS hospital \n     with RSV [Respiratory Syntactical Virus]. No babies have died \n     yet, but the Tribe sees no justification for waiting until \n     this happens when these viruses are completely diagnosable \n     and treatable.\n\n  It is absolutely unacceptable to put the lives of these children at \nrisk. And we can do something to help. On more than one occasion, I \nhave heard horror stories of pregnant mothers delivering children in \ncircumstances that no expectant mother or child should have to endure.\n  For example, right now the service unit at Eagle Butte in South \nDakota does not have an obstetrician. The Eagle Butte service unit is \nfunded at 44 percent of the need calculated by the Indian Health \nService. The facility has a birthing room and 22 beds, but there are \nonly two to three doctors to staff the clinic, hospital and emergency \nroom. Naturally, as a result, many children and expectant mothers do \nnot receive the care they need and deserve. Due to budget constraints, \nthe IHS policy is to allow only one ultrasound per pregnancy. The \nvisiting obstetrician is available only every couple of weeks.\n  The story of Brayden Robert Thompson points out how dangerous this \nsituation is. On March 3, 2002, Brayden's mother was in labor with a \nfull-term, perfectly healthy baby. Brayden's umbilical cord was wrapped \naround his neck, but, without ultrasound, that went undetected. The \navailable medical staff didn't know what to do about his lowered \nheartbeat, abnormal urinalysis or the fact that his mother was not \nfeeling well. Despite the symptoms, IHS refused to provide an \nultrasound or to send her to Pierre to see an obstetrician. Bryden was \nstillborn.\n  This tragic death was completely preventable, but tough choices are \nbeing made every day at IHS facilities throughout the country because \nthere simply isn't enough money to provide the care that every American \ndeserves.\n  The Pine Ridge Indian reservation in my State of South Dakota built a \nbeautiful new hospital and health care center. In many ways, they are \nequipped to provide state-of-the-art, coordinated care. But they cannot \nretain healthcare professionals because of low payment schedules and \ninadequate training opportunities for local people.\n  Their shiny new labor and delivery rooms, surgery rooms and even \ndental\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\nchairs stand empty, and individuals on the reservation are forced to \ntravel long distances to receive these vital services. This also is the \ncase on the neighboring Rosebud Indian reservation.\n  But this is not solely an Indian issue. It affects surrounding rural \ncommunity hospitals, ambulance services, and other health care \nproviders who work with IHS. For example, the Lake Andes-Wagner \nambulance district in northeastern South Dakota is facing financial \ndisaster, in part because they have not been reimbursed properly by the \nIndian Health Service.\n  This ambulance service offers emergency transport for citizens of \nCharles Mix County and Yankton Sioux tribal members, since the Wagner \nIHS hospital cannot afford to operate its own service. If this \nambulance service shuts down, what will these residents--Indian and \nnon-Indian--do when they face an emergency?\n  Bennett County Hospital in the southwestern part of South Dakota is \nlocated between the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian reservations, and \nsuffers similar IHS reimbursement problems, as do other non-IHS \nproviders in South Dakota and throughout rural America.\n  From 1998 to 2001, the most recent year for which IHS has data, IHS \ncontract denials have increased 75 percent.\n  In his budget request for the next fiscal year, the President \nrequested only $1.99 billion for clinical services for Indians. This \nrepresents only a small increase over what the President requested for \nfiscal year 2003, and virtually no increase over what was finally \nincluded in the omnibus appropriations bill. We can and must do better.\n  The amendment I am proposing would increase funding for clinical \nservices by $2.9 billion over the President's request for fiscal year \n2004. It is the minimal amount that is necessary to provide basic \nhealth care to the current IHS user population. The full cost over the \nnext 10 years would be $38.7 billion. The amendment also devotes an \nequal amount to deficit reduction, all offset by a corresponding \ndecrease in the top tax rate reduction.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Inouye, Bingaman, Dorgan, \nMurray, Wyden, Johnson, Leahy, Cantwell, Reid, Kennedy, and Lieberman. \nIt is also supported by a wide range of health organizations, native \nand non-native.\n  This budget resolution is a test of this Nation's priorities. Some \nwill say that it doesn't matter, that it is purely symbolic. But the \nwhole point of the budget resolution is to establish an enforceable \nfiscal framework and make room in our budget for needs that we believe \nare worthy or our national attention.\n  I know there are some in this body who honestly believe that it is \nmore important to accelerate huge tax cuts for our Nation's wealthiest \ncitizens than to provide Native Americans the health care they have \nbeen promised but denied. Some defend that position by saying that \nsomeday, somehow, these Native Americans will benefit from the tax cuts \nextended to others, that the benefit will ``trickle down'' to them as \nwell. It is their right to take that position, but they could not be \nmore wrong.\n  A woman going into labor cannot wait for economic benefits to trickle \ndown to her.\n  A child in respiratory distress cannot wait either. How is it \npossible that we can afford to delve deeper into debt to fund \nadditional tax cuts for those doing relatively well in this country, \nbut we cannot afford to dedicate a small fraction of that amount to \nfund the most basic health care services for some of the poorest people \nin America, today?\n  We must not tolerate this situation.\n  The problem is real; the solution is simple. Give the Indian Health \nService the funds it needs to provide Native Americans the health \nbenefits they were promised.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 13, \n2001 in Clarkston, GA. Four men cornered and assaulted a 22-year-old \nSudanese man who was walking home late at night. The group of attackers \nstepped out in front of him and accused him of being involved in the \nterrorist attacks in New York. The men threatened, ``You killed our \npeople in New York. We want to kill you tonight.'' They shoved him \nagainst a wall and tried to stab him, slicing a hole in his shirt. \nFinally, when another Sudanese man rushed over to his friend's rescue, \nthe four attackers fled.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4324-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAULETTE CAREY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules \nregarding the disclosure of technological measures that restrict \nconsumer flexibility to use and manipulate digital information and \nentertainment content; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Digital Consumer \nRight To Know Act. The thrust of this bill is quite simple. Digital \nmedia companies are racing to develop technologies to combat piracy. \nSome of these anti-piracy measures could have the effect of restricting \nlawful, legitimate consumer uses as well as unlawful copying. My bill \nsays that if digital content is released in a form that prevents or \nlimits reasonable consumers uses, consumers have a right to be told in \nadvance.\n  The shift from analog to digital technologies carries many potential \nbenefits for all concerned--for technology companies, for producers of \nmusic, video, and other content, and above all, for consumers. Digital \ntechnologies, together with the rise of the Internet, promise to expand \nexponentially the possibilities for circulating, marketing, \nmanipulating, and using creative works. There is so much more you can \ndo, and so many fertile fields for innovation.\n  The shift to digital, however, also carries twin risks. The first, \nand the one on which Congress has focused most of its attention to \ndate, is the risk of piracy. Digital technologies can greatly \nfacilitate unlawful copying and distribution. This is a real problem, \nbecause people and companies that create copyrighted works must be \nfairly compensated. America's information-based economy depends on it.\n  The second, closely related risk is that, in combating piracy, the \nbaby will get thrown out with the bathwater. In the name of anti-piracy\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\nprotections, legitimate consumer uses could be stifled. Encryption or \nother ``digital rights management'', DRM, schemes could be employed \nthat restrict consumers' ability to take full advantage of the \npotential of the new digital technologies. In the end, it's not \ninconceivable that digital media could be more restricted and less \nflexible than other copyrighted items--an ironic result for a \ntechnology that was supposed to represent a great step forward for \nconsumers.\n  The bill I am introducing today focuses on this second risk. \nSignificantly, it would not in any way dictate to content companies \nwhat types of copy protection or DRM schemes may or may not be used. \nInstead, it would ensure that consumers are fully informed of any \nimpact on their ability to use and manipulate the content they buy.\n  Advance notice of technology-based use limitations is a matter of \nbasic fairness. Consumers have developed a number of legitimate \nexpectations concerning how they may use and manipulate content, and \nare likely to develop new expectations as technology develops. For \nexample, consumers increasingly expect to be able to shift legally \npurchased content between different devices--to access it on their \ncomputers, or in their cars, or using portable devices like MP3 \nplayers. They should be told in advance if these expectations won't be \nmet, so that they can factor this information into their purchasing \ndecisions. Consumers should know what they are getting or not getting.\n  In addition, I believe that imposing this kind of notice requirement \nwill help promote the development of solutions that strike an \nappropriate and acceptable balance between protecting against piracy \nand preserving utility and flexibility for consumers. Overly \nrestrictive approaches would require disclosures that content providers \ncould find embarrassing, and consumers could be alienated by measures \nthat don't seem to respect the importance of user flexibility. In \nshort, full disclosure would strengthen the market-based incentive to \navoid technologies that are too restrictive of consumer flexibility.\n  My bill would also make a clear statement that Congress expects that \nthere will be competition in the retail distribution of copyrighted \ndigital content. This shouldn't be controversial: today, compact discs, \nbooks, and movie videos are distributed via many competing retail \nstores. They also often face competition with stores selling used \ncontent, and with rentals and libraries. But what if new DRM \ntechnologies permit copyright holders to limit or prevent the ability \nof unaffiliated entities to sell or distribute content on a secondhand \nbasis? Could the copyright holder sharply reduce competition at the \ndistribution level, and thus increase its market power? My legislation \naddresses this risk by expressing the sense of the Congress that it is \nimportant to retain competition among distribution channels for digital \ninformation and entertainment content.\n  As the debate over digital copyright issues continues, I intend to \nlisten to all sides. This country needs balanced approaches that \nrespect the interests of copyright holders and consumers alike. But the \nbill I introduce today is a significant step that Congress could take \nnow that would protect consumers of digital content and promote market-\nbased solutions, all without rewriting any copyright laws. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Consumer Right to \n     Know Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Consumers have developed a number of legitimate \n     expectations concerning how they may use and manipulate \n     legally acquired information or entertainment content for \n     reasonable, personal, and noncommercial purposes. In \n     addition, as digital technology creates new ways to use and \n     manipulate content, consumers are likely to develop new \n     expectations that reflect the new technological \n     possibilities.\n       (2) Digital technologies also can facilitate unlawful \n     reproduction and distribution of information or entertainment \n     content subject to copyright protection. To combat this \n     problem, technology and content companies are developing and \n     deploying technologies to prevent or deter such unlawful \n     behavior.\n       (3) Such technologies could help promote a competitive \n     digital marketplace in which consumers have a broad range of \n     choices and media businesses can pursue a variety of business \n     models. However, there are also significant risks.\n       (4) There is a risk that technologies developed to prevent \n     unlawful reproduction and distribution of digital information \n     and entertainment content could have the side effect of \n     restricting consumers' flexibility to use and manipulate such \n     content for reasonable, personal, and noncommercial purposes.\n       (5) There is a risk that such technologies could unfairly \n     surprise consumers by frustrating their expectations \n     concerning how they may use and manipulate digital content \n     they have legally acquired.\n       (6) There is a risk that such technologies could result in \n     greater market power for the holders of exclusive rights and \n     reduce competition, by limiting the ability of unaffiliated \n     entities to engage in the lawful secondhand sale or \n     distribution of such content.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that consumers of digital information and \n     entertainment content are informed in advance of \n     technological features that may restrict the uses and \n     manipulation of such content, so that--\n       (A) consumers may factor this information into their \n     purchasing decisions; and\n       (B) there will be a strong, market-based incentive for the \n     development of technologies that address the problem of \n     unlawful reproduction and distribution of content in ways \n     that still preserve the maximum possible flexibility for \n     consumers to use and manipulate such content for lawful and \n     reasonable purposes; and\n       (2) to express the sense of Congress concerning the \n     importance of retaining competition among distribution \n     channels for digital information and entertainment content.\n\n     SEC. 3. FAIR DISCLOSURE OF TECHNOLOGICAL USE RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) FTC Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall \n     issue rules to implement the disclosure requirements \n     described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Disclosure Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--If a producer or distributor of \n     copyrighted digital content sells such content or access to \n     such content subject to technological features that limit the \n     practical ability of the purchaser to play, copy, transmit, \n     or transfer such content on, to, or between devices or \n     classes of devices that consumers commonly use with respect \n     to that type of content, the producer or distributor shall \n     disclose the nature of such limitations to the purchaser in a \n     clear and conspicuous manner prior to such sale.\n       (2) Manner of disclosure.--The Federal Trade Commission \n     shall prescribe the manner of disclosure required under this \n     subsection, which may include labels on packaging or such \n     other means as the Commission determines appropriate to \n     achieve the purposes of this section. The Commission may \n     prescribe different manners of disclosure for different types \n     of content and different distribution channels.\n       (c) Disclosure of Certain Limitations on Reasonable \n     Consumer Activities.--The following are examples of \n     limitations which shall trigger the disclosure requirements \n     of subsection (b):\n       (1) Limitations on the recording for later viewing or \n     listening (popularly referred to as ``time shifting'') of \n     audio or video programming delivered--\n       (A) via free over-the-air broadcasting; or\n       (B) as part of a multichannel video or audio system in \n     which the consumer obtains the programming as part of a \n     subscription package, with no per view charges and no ability \n     to select the specific time at which individual programs will \n     be delivered.\n       (2) Limitations on the reasonable and noncommercial use of \n     legally acquired audio or video content--\n       (A) in different physical locations of the consumer's \n     choice (popularly referred to as ``space shifting''); or\n       (B) on the electronic platform or device of the consumer's \n     choice, including platforms or devices requiring that the \n     content be translated into a comparable format before such \n     use.\n       (3) Limitations on making backup copies of legally acquired \n     content distributed in a form or medium that is subject to \n     accidental erasure, damage, or destruction in the ordinary \n     course of use, including through computer failure or computer \n     viruses, to be used only in the event that the original \n     copies are lost or damaged.\n       (4) Limitations on using limited excerpts of legally \n     acquired content for purposes such as criticism, comment, \n     news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.\n       (5) Limitations on engaging in the secondhand transfer or \n     sale of legally acquired content to another consumer, \n     provided that the transferor does not retain the content or \n     any copy thereof and that the transferee obtains only such \n     rights to the use and enjoyment of\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n\n     the content as the transferor possessed at the time of \n     transfer.\n       (d) Exception to Disclosure Requirement.--The Federal Trade \n     Commission shall not require disclosure under subsection (b) \n     with respect to any limitation that applies only to uses--\n       (1) that are sufficiently unusual or uncommon that the \n     burdens of prior disclosure would outweigh the utility to \n     consumers; or\n       (2) that have no significant application for lawful \n     purposes.\n       (e) Annual FTC Review.--On an annual basis, the Federal \n     Trade Commission shall review the effectiveness of its rules \n     implementing this section to determine whether revisions are \n     warranted to serve the purposes of this section. In \n     conducting this review, the Commission shall consider whether \n     changes in technology or in consumer practices have led to \n     new, legitimate consumer expectations concerning specific \n     uses of digital information or entertainment content that \n     would result in consumers suffering unfair surprise if a \n     technology were to limit those uses without prior notice.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) No Limiting Effect on Fair Use.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall be interpreted to suggest that a consumer activity not \n     referred to in section 3(c) or in the Federal Trade \n     Commission's rules implementing this Act may not constitute a \n     fair use within the meaning of section 107 of title 17, \n     United States Code.\n       (b) Unlawful Reproduction or Distribution.--Nothing in this \n     Act shall be interpreted to permit the otherwise unlawful \n     reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content or to \n     shield a person engaging in such activity from any type of \n     legal action or judgment.\n\n     SEC. 5. COMPETITION IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) competition among distribution outlets and methods \n     generally benefits consumers; and\n       (2) just as copyright holders have sold content embodied in \n     tangible products such as audio cassettes, videotapes, and \n     compact discs to multiple competing retail distributors, \n     copyright holders selling digital content in electronic form \n     for distribution over the Internet should offer to license \n     such content to multiple unaffiliated distributors, to enable \n     competition among different distribution models and \n     technologies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 694. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to monitor and \ninvestigate gasoline prices under certain circumstances; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, gasoline prices on average in California \nare $2.15 per gallon.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, the \ncost of crude oil rose 16.4 percent from January 6 to March 3. During \nthe same time period, the average retail price of gasoline rose 27.2 \npercent.\n  After seeing the statistics, I do not buy the argument that higher \ngasoline prices are due solely to higher crude oil prices. I am \nconcerned that oil companies have been pocketing more profits as \nconsumers pay record high gas prices.\n  I have been advised of news reports that refiners are taking more \nplants than usual offline for ``routine maintenance.'' This is \nreminiscent of the electricity crisis when generators took their plants \noff-line for ``routine maintenance'' at a rate higher than normal. We \nnow know that these generators were holding back electricity to \nartificially increase the price of electricity.\n  In response to soaring gas prices across the country and especially \nin California and in response to potential manipulation, I am \nintroducing legislation to shed light on the situation and hopefully \ncurtail future market manipulation.\n  My legislation requires the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, to \nautomatically investigate the gasoline market for manipulation anytime \naverage gasoline prices increase in any state by 20 percent in a period \nof 3 months or less and remain at that level for seven days or more.\n  Market manipulation would include, but is not limited to, collusion \nor the creation of artificial shortages such as unnecessarily taking \nrefineries off-line. In determining the trigger, the gasoline price \nused would be the Energy Information Agency's pricing of regular grade \ngasoline. A report on the FTC's investigation would be due to Congress \n14 days after the price trigger.\n  Under the bill, the FTC would be required within two weeks of issuing \nthe report to hold a public meeting to discuss the findings.\n  If the findings indicate that there is market manipulation, then the \nFTC would work with the state's Attorney General to determine the \npenalties.\n  If the findings indicate that there is no market manipulation, then \nthe U.S. Department of Energy must officially decide, within two weeks, \nif the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be used in order to ease \nprices and stabilize supply.\n  We need to deter market manipulation. Otherwise we risk serious price \ngouging with no accountability to consumers. My legislation offers a \nreasonable standard for an investigation and a reasonable time frame in \nwhich to complete that investigation. I believe the threat of these \ninvestigations and the public light that would be shed on the system \nwill be positive for the consumer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Roberts):\n  S. 695. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom supplies and to \nexpand such deduction to include qualified professional development \nexpenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise to introduce \nthe Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2003. I am joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Warner, and Senator Roberts, in introducing \nthis legislation to help our teachers who selflessly reach deep into \ntheir own pockets to purchase supplies for their classrooms or to \nengage in professional development.\n  Senators Warner, Landrieu, Roberts and I have long led the effort to \nrecognize the invaluable services that teachers provide each and every \nday to our children and to our communities. This tax relief is \nsignificant in that it recognizes the extra mile that our dedicated \nteachers go in order to improve the classroom experience for their \nstudents.\n  This legislation builds upon the tax relief that we authored, which \nwas previously enacted in the economic recovery package in the last \nCongress. Our bill would double the amount that a teacher can deduct--\nfrom $250 to $500--and includes professional development expenses in \nthe deduction. Our bill would also make this modest tax relief \npermanent, whereas the provision in the economic stimulus package is \nscheduled to sunset next year.\n  While our legislation provides financial assistance to educators, its \nultimate beneficiaries will be our students. Other than involved \nparents, a well-qualified teacher is the single most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \ndemonstrated, time and again, the strong correlation between qualified \nteachers and successful students. Moreover, educators themselves \nunderstand just how important professional development is to \nmaintaining and expanding their level of competence.\n  When I meet with teachers from Maine, they repeatedly tell me of \ntheir desire and need for more professional development. But they also \ntell me that, unfortunately, school budgets are so tight that \nfrequently the school districts cannot provide the assistance a teacher \nneeds in order to take that additional course or pursue that advanced \ndegree. As President Bush aptly put it, ``Teachers sometimes lead with \ntheir hearts and pay with their wallets.''\n  A recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics \nhighlights the benefits of professional development. The survey found \nthat most teachers who had participated in more than eight hours of \nprofessional development during the previous year felt ``very well \nprepared'' in the area in which the instruction occurred. Obviously, \nteachers who are taking additional course work and pursuing advanced \ndegrees become even more valuable in the classroom.\n  Increasing the deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies is \nalso a critical component of my legislation. So often teachers in \nMaine, and throughout the country, spend their own money to improve the \nclassroom experiences of their students. While many of us are familiar \nwith the National Education Association's estimate that teachers spend, \non average, $400 a year on classroom supplies, a new survey \ndemonstrates that they are spending even more than that. According to a \nrecent report from Quality\n\n[[Page S4329]]\n\nEducation Data, the average teacher spends more than $520 a year out of \npocket on school supplies.\n\n  I have spoken to dozens of teachers in Maine who have told me of the \nbooks, rewards, supplies, and other materials they routinely purchase \nfor their students.\n  Idella Harter is one such teacher. She told me of spending more than \n$1,000 in a single year, reaching deep into her pocket to buy \nmaterials, supplies, and other treats for her students. At the end of \nthe year, she started to add up all of the receipts that she had saved, \nand she was startled to discover they exceeded $1,000. Idella told me \nat that point she decided she'd better stop adding them up.\n  Debra Walker is another dedicated teacher in Maine who teaches \nkindergarten and first grade in town of Milo. She has taught for more \nthan 25 years. Year after year, she spends hundreds of dollars on \nbooks, bulletin boards, computer software, crayons, construction paper, \ntissue paper, stamps and inkpads. She even donated her own family \ncomputer for use by her class. She described it well by saying, ``These \nare the extras that are needed to make learning fun for children and to \ncreate a stimulating learning environment.''\n  Another example is Tyler Nutter, a middle school math and reading \nteacher from North Berwick, ME. After teaching for just two years, \nTyler has incurred substantial ``startup'' fees as he builds his own \ncollection of needed teaching supplies. In his first years on the job, \nhe has spent well over $500 out-of-pocket each year, purchasing books \nand other materials that are essential to his teaching program.\n  Tyler tells me that he is still paying off the loans that he incurred \nat the University of Maine-Farmington. He has car payments to make. He \nis saving for a house. And he someday hopes to get an advanced degree. \nNevertheless, despite the relatively low pay he is receiving as a new \nteacher, he says, ``You feel committed to getting your students what \nthey need, even if it is coming out of your own pocket.''\n  That is the kind of dedication that I see time and again in the \nteachers in Maine. I have visited nearly 100 schools in Maine, and \neverywhere I go, I find teachers who are spending their own money to \nimprove their professional qualifications and to improve the \neducational experiences of their students by supplementing classroom \nsupplies.\n  The relief we passed overwhelmingly in the last Congress was a step \nin the right direction. As Tyler told me, ``It's a nice recognition of \nthe contributions that many teachers have made.'' We are committed to \nbuilding on this good work. We invite all of our colleagues to join us \nin recognizing our teachers for a job well done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Breaux, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Chaffe, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 696. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for marginal domestic oil and natural gas well production \nand an election to expense geological and geophysical expenditures and \ndelay rental payments; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. Hutchinson. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation to \nprovide tax incentives for marginal wells. As we look to long-term \nsolutions to meet our needs for gasoline, electricity and home heating \noil, marginal well tax incentives are critical to increasing supply and \nretaining our energy independence.\n  Senators representing all regions of the country, including the \nNortheast and Midwest, have a common interest: to make the United \nStates less susceptible to the volatility of world oil markets by \nreducing America's dependence on foreign oil. I understand that when \nthe price of home heating oil spikes in the Northeast, it hurts those \nSenators's constituents. They understand when the price of oil falls \nbelow $10 a barrel--as it did several years ago and we lose 18,000 jobs \nas we did in Texas--that hurts my constituents. We understand that \nthese are merely two sides of the same coin: a growing U.S. dependence \non foreign oil.\n  In fact, at the heart of the marginal well tax credits is the goal of \nreducing our imports of foreign oil to less than 50 percent by the year \n2012. It is incredible to me that America is sliding toward 60 percent \ndependence on foreign oil. As the sole remaining superpower in the \nworld, and as the country with an economy that is the envy of the \nindustrialized world, this threat to our economic as well as our \nnational security is simply and totally unacceptable.\n  The core problem with our growing dependence on foreign oil is an \nunderutilized domestic reserve base of both crude oil and natural gas. \nIn 1992, we imported 46 percent of our oil needs from overseas. It is \nequally important to realize that in 1974, when America was brought to \nher knees by the OPEC oil embargo, we imported only 36 percent of our \noil. Today we stand at over 56 percent imports. If the major oil \nproducing countries of the world were ever to collectively sabotage \nU.S. interests as we have seen in the past with Iraq, they could wreak \nhavoc with the American economy.\n  We simply must take steps today to increase the amount of oil and \nnatural gas we produce right here at home. While shutting-off foreign \noil completely may not be realistic, it is realistic to utilize our \nreserves much more than we do today. Marginal wells--those wells that \nproduce less than 15 barrels of oil and less than 90 thousand cubic \nfeet of natural gas per day--have the capacity to produce 20 percent of \nAmerica's oil. This is roughly the same amount of the oil the U.S. \nimports from Saudi Arabia.\n  Much of this oil and gas could be produce in areas where it is being \nproduced today, and has for decades, that is not environmentally \nsensitive. That is why I have advocated for tax incentives that would \nmake it economically feasible for production to continue and actually \nincrease in areas largely where production takes place today.\n\n  There are close to 400,000 such wells across the United States. Many \nof these wells are so small that, once they close, they never reopen. \nIf we had had the marginal well tax provision in place several years \nago before the oil price plummet, we would not have lost over 400,000 \nbarrels per day of production due to small wells shutting down.\n  The overwhelming majority of producing wells in Texas are marginal \nwells. A survey by the Independent Producers Association of America, \nIPAA, found that marginal wells account for 75 percent of all crude \nproduction for small independent operators; up to 50 percent for mid-\nsized independents; and up to 20 percent for large companies. A \nsensible energy independence policy is to offer tax relief to producers \nof these small wells that would help them stay in business when prices \nfall below a break-even point. When U.S. producers can stay in business \nduring periods of low prices, supply will be higher and help keep \nprices from shooting up too high.\n  The marginal well provision in the energy bill provides a maximum $3 \nper barrel tax credit for the first 3 barrels of daily production from \na marginal oil well, and a similar credit for marginal gas wells. The \nmarginal well credit would be phased in-and-out in equal increments as \nprices for oil and natural gas fall and rise. For oil, in would phase \nin between $18 and $15 per barrel. In addition to the marginal well \nprovisions, the bill includes tax incentives for delay rental payments \nand geological and geothermal expensing. These provisions will help \nproducers locate and develop potential oil and gas properties.\n  We do not have to be at the whim of foreign countries or market \nforces beyond our control. Therefore, we've got to increase our \ndomestic supply and I believe these energy tax incentives will do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/24/senate-section/article/S4329-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4329-S4330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 28--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF THE \n    BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, 1774-2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
