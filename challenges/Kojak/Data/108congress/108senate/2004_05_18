Mr. President, today, we will be in a period of morning \nbusiness for 1 hour. The first half of that time will be under the \ncontrol of the majority leader, with the second half under the control \nof the minority side. Following that period, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of H.R. 3104, the Afghanistan/Iraq campaign medals bill. \nUnder the agreement, there will be 20 minutes for debate prior to a \nvote on passage of the bill. Senators can, therefore, expect the first \nvote of the day to occur sometime around 11 or 11:15 this morning.\n  Following that vote, we will resume the Defense authorization bill. \nWe began that bill yesterday and made some progress by disposing of the \nHutchison amendment regarding cadets and midshipmen. We will continue \non that bill throughout the day with rollcall votes expected. I have \nmentioned our desire to finish the Defense bill this week, and I hope \nMembers will cooperate with the managers of the bill so we may have an \norderly consideration of amendments. Senators who intend to offer \namendments should be contacting the chairman and ranking member at this \ntime so they may begin scheduling amendments for this week.\n  Also, we have a cloture vote scheduled for 2:15 p.m. today on the \nnomination of Marcia Cooke to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida. There is still hope we can work out an \nunderstanding as to when we will vote on some of the 32 pending \njudicial nominations and, therefore, there is a chance the cloture vote \nmay be vitiated. We will alert all Members if there is a change with \nthat vote.\n  Also this week we will continue to look for a way to consider and \ncomplete the bioshield bill. I hope we can pass that important measure \nbefore we conclude our business this week. The highway bill is another \none we need to get to conference, and we will find a way to do that if \nat all humanly possible this week. I am reminded daily of the \nimportance of this bill and the necessity of going to conference. I was \ntalking to our colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, who again \nunderscores the importance of moving this bill forward as soon as \npossible.\n  It is going to be a very busy week. As we approach the recess, \nSenators can expect late nights, if necessary, to complete the \nlegislative and executive items I have mentioned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5559-6", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5559-S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time, I want to briefly comment \non the fact that yesterday was the 50th anniversary of the monumental \nBrown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision.\n  I had the wonderful opportunity of joining my colleagues from Kansas, \nSenators Roberts and Brownback, in Topeka, KS yesterday around noon. As \nwe stood in front of that two-story Monroe Elementary School, which was \none of the four segregated schools in Topeka in 1954 which Black \nchildren were forced into, you couldn't help but appreciate how far \nindeed we have come, but also reflect on how far we must continue to \ngo.\n  It was 50 years ago and 1 day, May 17, 1954, that the Supreme Court \nstruck down the separate but equal doctrine that had been established \naround 60 years before by Plessy v. Ferguson. The Brown v. Board \ndecision is considered by many to be one of the most, if not the most, \nimportant Supreme Court decisions of the last 100 years. It energized \nthe civil rights movement and the victories that would follow, \nincluding the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It catalyzed a tectonic shift \nin our Nation's social consciousness.\n  The Brown v. Board story begins a little over 50 years ago in the \ncity of Topeka, KS where we were yesterday. It was a third grader named \nLinda Brown who was barred from attending the neighborhood school \nbecause she was black. At that time she was 7 years old. She had to \nwalk six blocks through a rail yard to meet her bus, and then\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nshe would be transported an additional 2 miles across town to the all-\nBlack elementary school. That trip every day took about an hour. It was \nher dad, Rev. Oliver Leon Brown, for whom the Supreme Court case is \nnamed, who decided his child deserved to go to a school closer to home. \nHe joined 13 other families in filing suit to end segregation in \nAmerica's public schools.\n\n  Linda Brown recalls that, using her words:\n\n       When the parents involved tried to enroll us in all white \n     schools and we were denied, my mother explained that it was \n     because of the color of our skin. As a child I did not \n     comprehend what difference that could possibly make.\n\n  Indeed, as a child Linda knew the truth so many adults refused to \nrecognize, that the color of a person's skin should not make any \ndifference at all.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, many States were slow to \nintegrate classrooms. When I look back to my State of Tennessee, \ninitial compliance was mixed. While Nashville public schools, for \nexample, began their first day of integration in 1957, the surrounding \ncounty didn't begin until 1960. And even 10 years after that in 1970, \n40 metro schools in Nashville were still segregated. But since that \npoint in time, Tennessee, as the rest of the Nation, has made great \nprogress. I think of the Chattanooga School for Arts and Sciences, \nwhich is hailed in the State as a model for diversity and academic \nsuccess. Indeed, 99 percent of its students, who come from all racial \nbackgrounds across the country, go on to college. In 2003, the \nelementary and middle schools scored above the national average in the \nTennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program tests.\n  That all leads me to the ultimate hope of the Brown v. Board \ndecision: That not only will Black and White students learn together, \nbut that they will succeed together. In this we have a long way to go. \nAs we look ahead and as we celebrate that wonderful decision of 50 \nyears ago, as we were celebrating yesterday in Topeka, we have a long \nway to go.\n  Most recently, the President's No Child Left Behind Act is one \npowerful tool we have in closing the educational gap that exists \nbetween White and Black students. It sets rigorous standards for \nlearning and teacher qualifications. It does hold schools accountable \nfor their academic success. No longer will students be passed from \ngrade to grade without mastering those basic learning skills. No longer \nwill schools be able to mask their results in broad averages. They will \nhave to account for every group of students under that schoolhouse \nroof.\n  Fifty years on, American has undergone a dramatic transformation. No \nlonger is segregation an accepted, let alone celebrated, way of life. \nWe recoil at the pictures of the Little Rock nine being jeered and \nthreatened by angry White protesters. We hail the courage of those who \nled us forward. We tell their story that we will always aspire to \nAmerica's true purpose, that true purpose which is so powerfully \nexpressed in our founding, that all men are created equal, and that \nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that \namong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5560-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to take some \ntime in morning business to talk about one of the things that impacts \nus all, that we all see as we come to work each day or whatever we do \nin our day, and that is the cost of energy, particularly gasoline. It \nhas an impact on all of us, certainly, something that affects not only \nyou and me in our cars trying to get to work, but also the cost of \nother services and merchandise we buy, because there is an additional \ncost to development of all those things when gas is as high as it is \nright now.\n  It is a difficult thing to deal with because it is an item that over \ntime we have expanded in our use, and we have begun to use a good deal \nmore than we have in the past. We have increased our consumption, but \nwe have not done the same thing with the kind of support facilities \nnecessary to meet those increased demands. Again, one of the issues is \nnot only gas or electricity, but it is the whole issue of energy in a \nbroad sense, certainly, and energy policy that has to do with the long-\nterm availability of energy to meet the demands we have.\n  Again, I point to the fact we have not been able to move an energy \npolicy in the Senate in order to deal with the future. We will hear a \nlot of complaints, probably today, about something that ought to be \ndone. The real important thing is, we ought to do something about the \npolicy so over time we can make some of the changes that need to be \nmade to change the whole situation with energy over time. Obviously, \nthere are a number of activities that need to be done.\n\n  A lot of factors affect fuel price and supply. One of them, \nobviously, is the cost of oil. Crude oil is at historic highs right \nnow. In the past, we were accustomed to seeing crude oil at about $22 a \nbarrel. We talk about it when we make plans. It is now nearly $41. It \nhas increased a great deal over the last several months. It is very \nimportant to understand that the cost of oil represents almost 50 \npercent of the cost of gas at the pump. There are other costs, of \ncourse, but this is the major cost.\n  Interestingly enough, the cost of crude oil, plus the taxes, \nrepresents a little over 70 percent of the cost of gasoline. So when we \ntalk about these costs, of course, that has to be one of the factors.\n  Also, there are less refined gasoline imports, as gas, not as oil, \nbecause of sulfur regulations. Over the years, we have had a reduction \nin the number of refineries. It seems strange, doesn't it; as demand \nhas gone up substantially, the number of refineries has gone down. It \nis true that capacity has not changed that much because the refineries \nhave gotten larger, but they have not increased the capacity over time. \nIn the late eighties, we were using about 85 percent of capacity of \nrefineries. Now it is about 94 percent of capacity being used, and the \ndemand, of course, has gone up over that time. There has been a \ncontinual closure of refineries over the last 23 years, and so the \nsystem is now very tight.\n  In addition to capacity, we have had a lot of different regulations \nand different kinds of additions to gasoline in different parts of the \ncountry so that refining has been made much more expensive and much \nmore difficult to market in that they have to have this kind of \nreduction here and another one for this State and so on. It has been \nvery difficult. The reality is that there are a number of components to \nthe price of gasoline. We have to review those in context.\n  We will be hearing probably soon that the Government ought to be \ntaking oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is there to be \na reserve and has been put together over a period of time. The fact is \nthat the daily input into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is about \n170,000 barrels a day, and the consumption in this country is almost 9 \nmillion barrels a day. It is a relatively small amount. There may be \nsome merit in diverting the daily input into this reserve, but I \ncertainly think it would not make a lot of sense to extract from it. It \nwill be interesting to see what happens with respect to this issue.\n  The fact is that the current price, when adjusted for GDP or growth \nin the economy and inflation, is not at a record high. In the 1980s, as \na matter of fact, given the same economics, the price of gas was higher \nthan it is today.\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\nHowever, since it has gone up from $1.50 to $2, that is a sudden \nimpact. The 1981 price, if it is measured against today's economy, \nwould be over $3. We have to be realistic about where we are.\n  The most significant factor, of course, that affects gasoline prices \nis the cost of crude oil. As I mentioned, it represents almost 50 \npercent of the cost of a finished gallon of gasoline. Crude oil prices \nhave increased about 60 percent since April a year ago. That is a great \nincrease.\n  The other point is that we have become more dependent on imported \ncrude oil as opposed to domestic production. We have, interestingly \nenough, less control over that production.\n  The high demand in Asia and the U.S., plus OPEC activities, has \nrestrained production over the years. It is the most important factor \naffecting prices.\n  Another key factor is increased gasoline demand, and that continues \nto go up. We can see that each day on the street in the number of cars \nand SUVs that are using more gasoline per mile than they did in the \npast. It is interesting; as we are moving in one direction in use and \nconsumption, we are moving in another direction in providing the \nsupply.\n  We have had a crazy arrangement. We have had very little growth in \nthe U.S. in refining capacity. Currently, there are 149 refineries with \na capacity of 16.8 million barrels a day. In 1980, there were 321 \nrefineries with a capacity of 18.6 million barrels per day. That has \nbeen a conflict in our situation. Of course, there are a number of \nreasons for that situation. There have been no new refineries built \nsince 1976, and unlikely due, of course, to political considerations, \nincluding siting costs, environmental requirements, industrial \nprofitability, and, most importantly, the ``not in my backyard'' \nattitude which we seem to see in energy. We have over here demand and \nconsumption, we want this service, but over here we say: Oh, yes, but \nwe do not want refineries in our midst, we do not want transmission \nlines, we do not want the things that are elements of energy, but at \nthe same time we want more of the product. These are some of the \nproblems. They are not easy to resolve, but they are resolvable.\n  We need to take a look at a policy for the future and begin to \nprovide incentives to do what needs to be done, to take another look at \nsome of the environmental controls we have put in place. That is not to \nsay we do not want to protect the environment, but there are ways to do \nit that are less intrusive on production. There is no doubt that \nenvironmental regulations have played a part in increasing the cost of \nfuel. No one believes we ought to sacrifice the environment. That is \nnot the issue. The question is how can we do it in a more \nenvironmentally secure way without putting limitations on production.\n  The environmental and energy policies are interlinked. We must \nremember, when we are considering new regulations and policies, what \nimpact it is going to have on the result. We do not seem to consider \nthose two issues at the same time. We put on regulations saying we are \ngoing to help the environment, not thinking about what impact it has. \nNow we are at the point where the impact is affecting us, and we say: \nMy gosh, what have we done? What happened here? Why do we have these \nincreased costs?\n  It is pretty clear we need to do some things that are different from \nwhat we have done in the past.\n  It is fair to say that many of the folks from the Northeast and \nCalifornia complain about the high prices; however, their delegations \nover time have supported unilateral disarmament of our energy security \nby refusing to accept the balance that has to be created. They have \nopposed offshore drilling, coal-fired plants, nuclear-fired plants, the \ndevelopment of ANWR, leasing and development of minerals on public \nlands, and hydro relicensing--just a few of the things that have to do \nwith domestic production and transportation of energy.\n  I guess we have to ask, Where do they think energy fuel comes from? \nIt does not come out of the sky. We have to produce it. It is kind of \nlike that attitude that one thinks milk and eggs just come from \nSafeway. There are some animals behind it.\n  We have to consider the consequences when the Federal Government \nmandates a certain environmental equation such as a 2-percent oxygenate \nthat is put into gas. We have to be sensitive and realize the \nconsequences so that the decisions we make with regard to those issues \nhave to be balanced with what we need.\n  I hear all of this complaining about it but then we do not seem to \nrecognize the link between Federal regulations and the higher price of \ngas: the phase-out of MTBE, the tier II gasoline sulfur standards, \ndiesel standards, regional haze. All of these Clean Air Act \nrequirements are going to raise the price of gasoline.\n  There are some things we can do. We have to do something about \nconservation. We have to find ways that we can use energy more \nefficiently, and that is possible. It is starting to happen even in \nautomobiles.\n  I come from a State where SUVs are necessary. Sometimes we need a \nfour-wheel drive to get to my house. Where I stay in northern Virginia, \npickups and SUVs are all over the place. I do not think they need four-\nwheel drives very often, but that is fine. We can still make those more \nefficient. We can take a look at it.\n  We have to do some things over time to fuel cars with other things--\nhydrogen, for example. In our energy policy we have the opportunity to \ntake a look at more research and more opportunities to provide \nalternatives. Gas and oil are not going to be there forever at the same \ndegree they are now. They will be for a good long time if we treat them \nproperly, but there comes a time when we have to look at other kinds of \nthings, and that is what this policy is about. That is why we need to \nbe looking at more than just next week or next year. We have to take a \nlook at what we are going to be doing. We have to modernize our energy \nstructure to make it more efficient than it is now. We have to talk \nabout renewables, whether it be electricity, wind energy, or Sun \nenergy.\n  These are things we need to be doing. We know how to do them in small \namounts now, but we have to find out how to do them in volume. We have \nto find out how to do them in a reasonable and bearable cost, but we \ncan do that if we focus on doing it.\n  At the same time, we can protect the environment. My home State is \none of the States where we have a great deal of energy production. We \nare the No. 1 producer of coal, for example. Well, in order to do that, \nwe have to change things somewhat. We have to do some more research to \nfind out how we can have clean burning coal, because it is the largest \nfossil fuel available to us.\n  We also are a producer of oil and gas. We have natural gas, of \ncourse, which has many uses as energy but we ought to be using coal or \nnuclear for the electric generation because natural gas is much more \nfluid. It can be used in other ways and for many other things, where \ncoal cannot.\n  The point I am trying to make is that these are things that are out \nthere in the future but they will not come about until we decide we are \ngoing to emphasize a policy with regard to energy and the impact it \nwill have on us over the years.\n\n  The bill that we have is available to do these things. Unfortunately, \nwe have had some problems of obstruction in getting it done. We need to \nwork on that and acknowledge where we are and where our consumption is. \nRight now, it is reaching beyond where we are in terms of having a \nproduct to provide.\n  So it seems to me it is pretty clear that is the direction we need to \nmove and it is the direction we can, indeed, move. We have a greater \nopportunity to do that now.\n  I will now take a second to look at some of the highlights of the \nenergy policy bill that we do have. As far as oil and gas, we \npermanently authorized the Strategic Reserve. We have incentives for \nproducing from marginal wells. As my colleagues can imagine, when wells \nproduce a great deal of product each day everyone is interested in \nthat. When they become marginal, there needs to be some incentives to \ncontinue to do that.\n  We have some royalty relief for deep water wells and for our greatest \nopportunity for these products offshore. We need to take into account \nthe environmental status that we want there. We\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\nhave to do something about a gas pipeline from Alaska where some of our \ngreatest reserves of energy are.\n  I already mentioned clean coal and certainly there are opportunities \nfor us to ensure that the largest resource, fossil fuel, is available \nwithout being harsh on the environment. Indian energy, we have not \nallowed the tribes to be doing something on the reservations, which \nmany of them would like to do. A lot of people resist nuclear energy. \nThe fact is, we want clean generated electricity. Nuclear is probably \nthe best opportunity that we have to do that.\n  The section is also there on renewables so, again, we can make some \nprogress in terms of being able to utilize some renewable energy \nsources that will take some of the pressure off of the kind of \nproduction that we have now.\n  We have a great challenge. I think it is a challenge to this body to \nmove forward on an energy policy and stop finding reasons to not have \none and object to having one. It is the same people who complain about \nnot having affordable energy, and that is kind of where we are. We can \nindeed change that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about \nseveral issues relative to what is happening in Iraq today. First, the \nterrible offenses that occurred at the Abu Ghraib prison that came \nforth a couple of weeks ago have obscured some of the positive things \nthat have been happening relative to the war on the ground in Iraq. We \nmade some great strides over the last couple of weeks and, once again, \nwe have every reason to be extremely proud of our brave men and women \nwho are carrying out this war against terrorism, because we are winning \nthis war.\n  We are seeing more of the bad guys taken out in Iraq today, and a lot \nof that has been obscured by what happened at Abu Ghraib and the \nrevelations that have been forthcoming relative to those incidents over \nthe past couple of weeks.\n  With respect to Abu Ghraib and to the individuals who were involved \nin the atrocities that took place there, our Army is doing exactly what \nit is supposed to do relative to issues such as this. We are doing a \ncomplete and thorough investigation of the facts. Those who committed \noffenses for which they need to be held accountable are going to be \nheld accountable, irrespective of their level of management.\n  I say that because these atrocities may have been carried out by \nprivates or sergeants or any other enlisted or officer personnel up the \nline. If they were, then they are going to be held accountable. If any \nof these atrocities were carried out by civilians, they are going to be \nheld accountable likewise.\n  Major General Taguba produced a very professional and comprehensive \nreport on what did take place at Abu Ghraib. He found what happened \nthere was a total lack of discipline and a failure of leadership. Our \nmilitary forces want to be held accountable because those who are doing \nthe great job over there--and this is 99.99 percent of our military \npersonnel--want us to get to the bottom of this, just as everybody in \nAmerica and every other individual around the world wants us to do. And \nwe are going to do that.\n  Second, there was an announcement yesterday that the coalition forces \ndiscovered sarin gas in an artillery round, and that is a very \nsignificant fact. I don't think we can overstate the significance of \nthis, but by the same token we need to be careful as to how far we go. \nThere was a lot of criticism leveled at this administration for \nconducting this war on the basis that weapons of mass destruction were \nin Iraq and in the possession of Saddam Hussein and that was the sole \nreason we went to war with Iraq. That simply was not the case. We \ndebated that and will continue to debate that down the road. But the \nfact is those of us who kept saying we know the weapons of mass \ndestruction are there because Saddam Hussein admitted he had them--and \nhe never told us what he did with them so we know they are there--that \ntheory has now been validated.\n  But is this the be-all and end-all relative to the issue of weapons \nof mass destruction? I don't think so. I don't think we need to get \noverexcited. I think we need to continue to allow the Iraq Survey Team \nto do their investigation and at the end of the day we will find out \nwhat did happen, how many weapons of mass destruction exist today, and \nwhere those weapons are. We will proceed with the destruction of those \nweapons that once belonged to Saddam Hussein. It is important that we \nfind and destroy these weapons of mass destruction so they can't be \nused by terrorists, as they attempted to do last weekend.\n  Third, I want to mention the killing yesterday of the President of \nthe Iraqi Governing Council, Mr. Izzedine Salim. Mr. Salim was a \nrespected member of the IGC. His leadership will be missed. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his family.\n  However, his successor, Mr. Ajil al-Yawar, will lead the IGC over the \nnext 6 weeks until political sovereignty is turned over to the new \nIraqi government on June 30. The terrorists and anarchists fighting to \nkeep Iraq from becoming a free and democratic state are not going to \nwin. We are not going to let the killing of a fine individual such as \nMr. Salim keep the people of Iraq from forming a new, free and \nindependent government and obtaining their democracy.\n  The perspective on these events is very important. We will turn over \nsovereignty to Iraq on 30 June. We have discovered weapons of mass \ndestruction and we need to continue our search for others. We need to \nlet our investigation on Abu Ghraib be completed before making \npronouncements on who was responsible.\n  Last, I would like to relate that about 4 weeks ago, I had the \npleasure of visiting 14 of our military institutions in Europe within a \n4-day period. During that period of time, Senator Sessions, Senator \nEnzi, and myself had the occasion to visit with individual members of \nour Armed Forces such as those who belong to the 173rd Airborne \nBrigade, who are stationed at Caserme Ederly in Vicenza, Italy, who \nspent a year in Kirkuk, Iraq. They were the original occupying troops \nin Kirkuk. We had the occasion to visit with spouses of our soldiers \nwho, today, are deployed to Iraq. We also had the opportunity to visit \nat Landstuhl Hospital at Ramstein, Germany, individuals who have been \ninjured in Iraq. I have to say, every time I am around those men and \nwomen, my heart beats a little faster because they are not only the \nfinest young men and women America has to offer, but they are doing a \nfantastic job of representing America, whether it is doing their duty \nof being fighting men and women or whether it is doing what they \nprobably do best, and that is being the greatest ambassadors America \nhas right now in that part of the world.\n\n  The men and women in the 173rd Airborne Brigade, for example, said \nwhen they marched into Kirkuk, the Iraqi people viewed them as simply \nan occupying military force, which was not going to be supportive of \nthe goals that the citizens of Kirkuk wanted to see carried out; that \nis, to have their children educated, to have hospitals, to have water \nand sewer and power restored.\n  As the weeks and months went on, however, the members of the 173rd \nAirborne Brigade did exactly what the local people didn't believe \npossible: They rebuilt the hospitals, they rebuilt and opened the \nschools, they fixed the power grid so electricity could be restored to \nthe citizens of that community, as well as increasing the availability \nof water and sewer, so at the point in time when the 173rd needed to be \nreturned home, there were tears shed on both sides. The bonding between \nour fighting men and women, these soldiers and goodwill ambassadors, \nand the people of Kirkuk was exactly as we envisioned it should be; \nthat is, our men and women had done a great job of liberating those \npeople and at the same time had made good friends and had been great \nambassadors for the United States in that part of the world.\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\n  At Landstuhl, I will have to say the attitude of soldiers who had \nreceived, in some cases, very serious injuries was unbelievable. One \nyoung man who was from the home State of the Presiding Officer, as he \nand I discussed, who had his right leg shot off below the knee, made a \ncomment to me as I walked in the room--and he had a big smile on his \nface. He said:\n\n       Senator, I'm leaving here and I am going to Walter Reed \n     Hospital and I am going to get a new leg and as soon as I get \n     me that new leg I want you to know I am going back to be with \n     my buddies in Iraq.\n\n  What greater attitude, commitment, and dedication can you have from \nany individual? That young man is simply a shining light out there \ntoday and should far overshadow the stories we see coming out of Abu \nGhraib.\n  Also, the spouses of the soldiers who are deployed to Iraq today, the \nspouses we visited with, about 35 or 40 of them, had, again, an \nunbelievable attitude. Our military families are truly that. They are \nfamilies. They stand side by side with their spouses and support their \ndeployment to any part of the world. But particularly now with respect \nto this very difficult and complex deployment in Iraq, these spouses \nhad the opportunity to engage with us and to come forward to complain \nabout a number of things, but they never did. They were all positive \nand said they knew their husbands were doing the right thing, they were \ntruly supportive of them, and once again our military families were a \nshining light of which we can all be very proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak on \nDemocratic time in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5563-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5563-S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me agree with the Senator from \nGeorgia. The men and women in uniform representing the United States of \nAmerica are our best. I have had a chance to meet with them, both the \nguard units in my State and their families, and to go to Walter Reed \nHospital to meet those who have been seriously injured in combat. I \nhave attended the funerals of those who have died from my State. My \nheart goes out to every single one of them and their families. They \nhave given this country all we can ask and they have given Iraq \nmillions of acts of kindness and bravery and good will, which we as \ncitizens back home could never, ever repay.\n  But, having said all that, we cannot look beyond the fact that the \npolicy and the decisions made by this administration that brought us \ninto this war have raised the most serious and profound questions with \nthe American people and with the Members of Congress. We understand \nnow, sadly, that, frankly, we were given the wrong reasons. We were \nwrong in the reasons the administration gave us for going to war. There \nwere no weapons of mass destruction massed on our borders, poised to \nthreaten our troops and poised to threaten others. There were no \nchemical and biological weapons, no nuclear weapons.\n\n  The administration was wrong when they talked about plutonium being \nshifted from Africa to Iraq. There was no evidence of that whatever.\n  There was no evidence whatever, despite the administration's \nstatement, of the presence of al-Qaida in Iraq or any connection \nbetween Saddam Hussein and September 11.\n  This administration was wrong on the number of troops we needed. When \nGeneral Shinseki boldly said we would need more forces to accomplish \nour goal, he faced derision from this administration. He has been \nproven right and, sadly, at a time when we were supposed to be bringing \nAmerican troops home, we are bringing more troops into Iraq. We are \nescalating the number of forces that are necessary for us to protect \neven those who were on the ground.\n  We were wrong about our coalition. It was too thin and too weak at \nthe start and still is today.\n  This is an American war, borne largely if not exclusively by American \ntaxpayers, and almost exclusively by American troops. Despite the \ncontributions by Great Britain and Poland and others, these are \nAmerican forces whose lives are on the line.\n  We were wrong about the reaction of Iraqis who were supposed to greet \nus with parades and flowers as we liberated their country. Sadly, we \nsee what is actually happening today. Now three-fourths of the Iraqis \nwant Americans to leave. They are glad Saddam Hussein is gone, but now \nthey want us to be gone. That was something that was not predicted.\n  We were wrong about the protection of our troops. The fact that our \nHumvees were not properly armored has meant that one out of four \nAmerican lives were lost because of this lack of preparedness. We were \nwrong about body armor. A third of our troops in Iraq, as of last year, \ndid not have body armor to protect them personally. We were wrong about \nprotection when it came to the helicopters which sadly still do not \nhave the necessary defensive equipment to fight off shoulder-fired \nmissiles.\n  We have been wrong, as well, in terms of the human lives, the lives \nwe have given; wrong in terms of the dollar costs. This administration \nin February said we need no more money to execute this war. As of last \nweek, they said we need $25 billion. Mr. Wolfowitz said it might be $50 \nbillion more to finish this war at least into the beginning of next \nyear. And we were wrong in the prison at Abu Ghraib with improper \npersonnel not properly trained, not properly supervised.\n  Frankly, we have been wrong on the impact of the war on terrorism. We \nbelieved somehow that standing our ground in Iraq would help us in the \nwar on terrorism. It has made it more difficult. This has become a \nmagnet for terrorists who come to Iraq to kill American soldiers and \nAmerican civilians. That is something that was not predicted.\n  So this administration has been wrong--wrong in its policy, as we \nfind every single day. The American people still stand foursquare \nbehind our men and women in uniform. They are doing their patriotic \nduty and we are proud of them. But this administration has not prepared \nus, did not prepare us, for this invasion and, sadly, we are paying \nthat price today.\n  There is another important element beyond foreign policy. It is the \nquestion of the domestic policies of this administration. The question \nwhich should be asked is not a question from a Democrat but one that \nwas asked by President Ronald Reagan in 1980. It is very basic. The \nquestion you have to ask yourself every time we have an election is: \nAre you better off as an American today than you were 4 years ago?\n  Take a look at the state of our economy and you can understand we are \nnot. The middle Americans across America have to say, frankly, we are \nnot better off. In the first 2 years of the Bush administration, real \nincome has dropped by almost $1,500 per household. Growth and wages, \nremarkably weak. After growing at a healthy rate during the Clinton \nadministration, wages have barely kept up with inflation under \nPresident George W. Bush. In fact, the Labor Department recently \nreported that in the last 12 months, wages and salaries grew at the \nslowest rate in over 20 years.\n  At the same time, Americans are facing skyrocketing costs. Take a \nlook at this. Flat wages during the period that the President has been \nin office, average weekly earnings, are up 1 percent. Gasoline prices \nare up 25 percent, college tuition prices are up 28 percent, and family \nhealth care premiums are up 36 percent. These are the real costs of \nfamilies across America.\n  So when this administration says, We are in recovery, things are \nlooking a lot better, take a look at the reality of the bills that \nAmerican families have to pay. These are, sadly, families who are not \ndoing better today under President George W. Bush's economic plan.\n  For many Americans the problem is even worse than flat wages and high \ncosts. For millions, the problem is because they have lost their job. \nWe have lost 2.2 million private sector jobs under President George W. \nBush. Under President Clinton, we increased the number of people \nworking in America by 21 million. Under President George W. Bush we \nhave lost 2.2 million jobs.\n  The manufacturing sector has been devastated, with jobs lost in 36 \nout of the 39 months under this President. We\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nhave lost 2.7 million manufacturing jobs not likely to ever be replaced \nby jobs paying as well.\n  In 2000, the unemployment rate was 4 percent when President Bush took \noffice. Today it is 5.6 percent. There are 8.2 million Americans out of \nwork, a third more than when the President took office.\n  In addition, long-term unemployment has nearly tripled under \nPresident George Bush. Look at the situation with long-term employment. \nWhen he took office, 649,000 people were out of work. Today, 1.9 \nmillion are out of work. There are long-term unemployed and the \nRepublican administration refuses, still, to provide unemployment \nbenefits for these people struggling to keep their families together \nwhile they are out of work.\n  In addition, what we have seen is this administration has also turned \nrecord surpluses under President Clinton into record deficits. When \nPresident Bush took office, we were on track for a 10-year surplus of \nover $5 trillion. Sadly, in this situation today, we are headed toward \na 10-year deficit of over $3 trillion.\n  In 2000, we were saving every penny of the Social Security trust fund \nfor those who needed it in the future. Since 2001, we have raided it \nevery year to pay for President Bush's tax cut for the wealthiest \nAmericans. That does not add up. It does not add up to income security \nfor seniors. It does not add up to fiscal responsibility, which this \nadministration promised.\n\n  In addition, because of the weak state of the economy, State taxes \nhave been on the increase, rising by $14.5 billion in 2002 and 2003 \nafter 7 straight years of going down.\n  So while the President may talk about tax cuts for wealthy people, \nState taxes and local taxes are increasing to make up the difference. \nHousehold debt has increased among families in America from $7.1 \ntrillion in the year 2000 to $9.4 trillion at the end of last year, a \n32.8-percent increase. Our public debt has reached record levels under \nthis President and, unfortunately, that debt comes down to $20,000 for \nevery American--a $20,000 mortgage we are carrying because this \nPresident insisted on tax cuts while we fought a war, the first \nPresident to ever ask for that. Consumer confidence has fallen by 20 \npercent under this President.\n  And we come back, again, to the famous question asked by President \nReagan in 1980. That question--are you better off now than you were 4 \nyears ago?--it is hard to see in any circumstance why families, on an \neconomic basis, could be considered better off. Their wages are flat, \njobs have escaped us, and the costs of doing business in America and \nraising a family in America continue to go up.\n  It is clearly a time for a new direction in America. We need strong \nleadership to point us in a new direction of fiscal responsibility and \neconomic growth. For the next 4 years we need to dedicate ourselves to \nworking families struggling to make ends meet and raise a family that \nin the future can enjoy even a better standard of living than their \nparents.\n  We are not better off than we were, but we can be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5564-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5564-S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time and save what \nDemocratic morning business is still allocated to others. I compliment \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois for his comments this morning.\n  This week it will be our hope to discuss the question about how it is \nthat Americans view themselves as we enter this critical decisionmaking \nperiod for our country, choosing its national leadership for the next 4 \nyears.\n  Senator Durbin has put his finger on the question that was so \nappropriately posed by then-candidate Reagan in 1980. The question he \nasked in 1980 to the American people was: Are you better off? In many \ncases, Americans had a right to say yes in 1980, but there was a \nperception that on many specific issues and circumstances they were not \nbetter off.\n  So we felt it was appropriate that we have some analysis of our \ncircumstances today in the year 2004. Are we better off than we were in \n2000? Are we better off in education today than we were back then, \nhaving passed but not funded the No Child Left Behind Act? Are we \nbetter off with our own national security and homeland security today \nthan we were in 2000? Are we better off in our fiscal policy, our \neconomic policy? Are we better off with regard to crime statistics? Are \nwe better off with infrastructure? Where is it that we are better off?\n  I dare say no one could possibly say we are better off.\n  Well, this week, we hope to analyze a little bit of the lay of the \nland as the American people see it today. Wondering out loud, \nexpressing concern, and certainly providing some of our own reaction to \nthe question, Are you better off today?\n  Senator Durbin, our distinguished colleague from Illinois, said it so \nwell with regard to our circumstances for average working families. In \nasking the question, Are you better off than you were 4 years ago, when \nyou look at the first 2 years of the Bush administration, real income \nactually dropped by $1,500 per household, and throughout the last 4 \nyears growth in wages has actually been very weak.\n  After growing at a healthy rate during the Clinton administration, \nwages have barely kept up with inflation under the Bush administration. \nIn fact, the Labor Department recently reported that in the last 12 \nmonths wages and salaries grew at the slowest rate in 20 years. At the \nsame time, Americans are facing skyrocketing costs. Whether it is a 25-\npercent increase in gasoline prices at the pump, a 28-percent increase \nin college tuition, a 36-percent increase in family health care \npremiums, the middle class is being squeezed.\n  This chart says it as graphically as one can. Here you have the \naverage weekly earnings for a typical American household. It has gone \nup 1 percent over this period of time. In that same timeframe, while \nwages have only gone up 1 percent, gasoline prices have gone up 25 \npercent; college tuition, 28 percent; health care premiums, a whopping \n36 percent. So at times like these, the last thing you want to do is \nthreaten wages, but that is exactly what the Bush administration is \nplanning to do in August, by implementing rules that will actually \nstrip millions of Americans of the ability to cope with this situation.\n  Here you have an increase in earnings of 1 percent. One of the ways \nAmericans have historically coped with that situation is to say: OK, if \nI am only making a 1-percent increase, I am going to work harder and \nlonger.\n  We already have the longest workweek in the world with regard to \nindustrialized nations--the longest workweek in the world and Americans \nrespond to these increasing pressures by saying: I am going to work \nlonger. If they work longer, under current law, they are allowed \novertime. But what the administration says is: We are going to make you \nwork even harder and longer because we are going to take away some of \nyour overtime. So the pressure is even greater.\n  For many Americans, the problem is even worse than just flat wages \nand high costs. For millions, the problem is no wages because they have \nlost their jobs. We have actually lost 2.2 million private sector jobs \nunder President Bush, compared to 21 million jobs created during the \ntime President Clinton was in office. The manufacturing sector has been \nparticularly hard hit, with jobs lost in 36 out of 39 months under the \nBush administration. In all, we have lost 2.7 million manufacturing \njobs. And a net of 2.2 million private sector jobs lost--the first time \nsince the Hoover administration we have actually seen an actual job \nloss over the 4 years of any one President's term in office.\n  So here you have it: During the Clinton administration, 21 million \nprivate sector jobs created; under the Bush administration, a loss of \n2.2 million private sector jobs.\n\n  In 2000, the unemployment rate was 4 percent. Today, it is 5.6. Mr. \nPresident, 8.2 million Americans are actually out of work, a third more \nthan when President Bush took office. In addition, long-term \nunemployment has nearly tripled in the last 4 years.\n  In 2000, the number of long-term unemployed people was 649,000. Now \nthere are 1.9 million long-term unemployed people, three times what it \nwas in 2000\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nwhen President Bush took office, chronically long-term unemployed \npeople who have virtually given up any real prospect of gaining \nemployment any time in the short term.\n  Put simply, the Bush administration has the worst jobs record since \nthe Great Depression. As a result, millions of Americans are now worse \noff than they were 4 years ago.\n  It is not just jobs and unemployment, however. As I said, these cost \npressures that American families are feeling go beyond their income and \nthey go beyond their employment. They go to the very nuts and bolts of \nmaking ends meet on a weekly basis. There is no better illustration of \nthe problem they are facing with pressure on prices than we have seen \nin gas prices over the last several months.\n  In 2001, gas prices were averaging $1.47 per gallon. Today, the \nnationwide average is $2.01 per gallon, and the Bush administration \nrecently announced that it expects the average price to climb even \nhigher by June. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has done nothing \nto help consumers relieve that pressure.\n  During the 2000 campaign then-candidate Bush urged President Clinton \nto put pressure on OPEC to increase oil production. But today, \nPresident Bush is actually refusing--refusing--to follow his own \nadvice, and his administration has said it won't call on OPEC to \nincrease production.\n  The administration has also failed to take other action that could \nhelp stem the rise in gasoline prices. It has refused to defer \ndeliveries of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, in fact, has \nnot investigated anticompetitive actions in the gasoline market.\n  While Americans struggle to pay higher prices at the pump, oil \ncompanies are posting record profits. In the first quarter of 2004, \nBritish Petroleum reported a 165-percent increase in their profits; \nChevron-Texaco reported a 294-percent increase in their profits; \nConoco-Phillips, a 44-percent increase in their profits; and Exxon \nMobil, a 125-percent increase in their profits.\n  The Bush administration has been totally unengaged, not providing one \nscintilla of leadership in addressing gasoline prices as these prices \ncontinue to flummox the American people and press them into longer \nworking hours without the wage increases through overtime.\n  There is also a concern for fiscal irresponsibility. The Bush \nadministration has turned record surplus into record deficit. When \nPresident Bush took office, we were on track for a 10-year surplus of \n$5 trillion. Now we are headed for a 10-year deficit of $3 trillion.\n  This graph shows the budget surplus/deficit just in the 4 short years \nPresident Bush has been in office. In 2000, we had a $236 billion \nsurplus. This year, we are going to have the largest single deficit in \nour Nation's history.\n  We're now on track to take $2.9 trillion from the Social Security \ntrust funds. On an individual basis, that means the Government will end \nup borrowing an average of $18,500 for every worker covered by Social \nSecurity last year. Much of that money, which belongs to the workers, \nwill be used to finance the tax cuts we have heard so much about with \nthis administration.\n  While millionaires get billions in Federal tax breaks, middle-class \nAmericans are facing dramatic increases in their State taxes. State \ntaxes actually rose by $14.5 billion in 2002 and 2003, after 7 straight \nyears of decline. Household debt has climbed from $7.1 trillion in 2000 \nto $9.4 trillion at the end of last year. That is a 32-percent \nincrease.\n  What does that tell you? What that tells you is that American \nhouseholds, because they are paying higher State taxes, higher gas \nprices, higher health insurance premiums, and higher tuition costs, \nwhat they are now doing is borrowing more and more. They are putting \nmore of that debt on their credit cards, maxing out their credit cards \nat the very time when they do not have the ability to pay back that \ndebt on a monthly basis.\n  By 2001, we had actually seen a reduction in the amount of public \ndebt. It had fallen for 4 years, and we were on track to eliminate the \ndebt by 2009. Now we are on track to reach $5.9 trillion in public debt \nby 2009. That is more than $20,000 for every American child, every \nAmerican parent, every American family member.\n  We have heard a lot about the death tax, the so-called death tax, \nwhich is the estate tax paid by some who have large property transfers \nfrom one generation to the next. I do not hear my Republican colleagues \ntalk about the birth tax.\n  There is now a birth tax of more than $20,000 because of fiscal \nirresponsibility and mismanagement. That birth tax is paid not just by \npeople who inherit but by every single American child when they are \nborn.\n  The consumer confidence index has fallen by 20 percent in the last 4 \nyears. The NASDAQ has dropped over 30 percent. Standard & Poor's 500 \nhas dropped by over 18 percent, and the Dow Jones by 5 percent.\n  We come back to the question posed famously by President Reagan: Are \nwe better off? Are wages better off? Are gasoline prices better off? \nAre we better off with college tuition or health care costs? Do we have \nmore or fewer jobs? Have we provided more or less tax relief when the \nentire picture of taxes paid by workers is taken into account? The \nquestion provides a simple and very obvious answer to all of us: We are \nnot better off. Americans are not better off than they were 4 years \nago.\n  But we can do better. We are a ``can do'' country. We can be stronger \neconomically, stronger in national security. We can be strong in \nmeeting the values and ideals of our heritage.\n  We proved during the Clinton administration that Federal deficits can \nbe eliminated, that the stock market can boom, that 22 million jobs can \nbe created, and that low interest and inflation rates could increase \nthe quality of life for families from Maine to Washington. We are not \nbetter off than we were, but we can be and we will be with a new \nmajority, with a change in administration policy, and new leadership in \nthe White House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is said that we inherit this great \ncountry of ours from our parents and we borrow it from our children. \nYet, for all of us, it is what we do with this country, in what shape \ndo we leave it for our children?\n  All of us aspire to give our children something more, leave a country \nto our children that is a better one, a stronger one, with better jobs \nand growth and opportunity.\n  My colleague asked the question: Are you better off today than 4 \nyears ago? That was a question President Reagan asked repeatedly many \nyears ago. It is a fair question. We have some serious challenges: the \nchallenge of responding to the threat of terrorism; the challenge we \nnow find in Iraq and Afghanistan; the challenge in this country of \nfinding a way to create new jobs, to pay our bills and avoid running up \nvery large deficits, and to deal with our trade imbalance. These are \nvery significant challenges. In many ways the answer to these \nchallenges relates to our values.\n  David McCullough wrote a wonderful book about John Adams, who \ntraveled a great deal as they tried to put this new country together. \nHe was in London and France. He would write right back to Abigail and \nhe would ask the question in his letters plaintively: Where is the \nleadership? Where will the leadership come from to help put this \ncountry of ours together? Then he would answer his question by saying: \nThere is really only us. There is Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, \nGeorge Washington, me, Mason, Madison.\n  In the rearview mirror of history we know the ``only us'' represents \nsome of the greatest talent in human history. But for every generation, \nthe question has been, Where will the leadership come from? Now more \nthan ever the question is, Where will the leadership come from?\n  Let me talk for a moment about some of the challenges we face. I \nmentioned terrorism, the war in Iraq, Afghanistan. Let me talk about \nthis country's fiscal policy and specifically trade policy with respect \nto large and growing and dangerous deficits.\n  This year we will have the largest Federal budget deficit in history, \nthe largest ever in the world by any country. Last week we saw a story \nin the Washington Post that says: ``U.S. Trade Deficit Grows \nUnchecked,'' $46 billion gap in March is the biggest monthly trade \ndeficit in our history. Think of that, $46 billion in 1 month,\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nover $10 billion of it to China alone. This is at a time when the \ndollar is weakening, and they expect that our trade deficit will begin \nto shrink. Our trade deficit grows.\n  We have the largest budget deficit in history, the largest trade \ndeficit in history, and the administration acts as if this is just \nroutine. They say: What problem? This is not a big issue. What problem?\n  Ultimately, our children will repay this trade deficit with a lower \nstandard of living. They will inherit the budget deficit and have to \nrepay it. As important as that is, the combination of these deficits \nthat are choking our economy mean we will have fewer jobs and less \nopportunity and a less robust economic growth in the future. That is a \nfact.\n  Where are the values that deal with these questions? Should we not as \na country begin to address this? Where is the leadership?\n  I know conservatives who say this is not true. It is true. The \nPresident says: Let's increase spending. He says: Let's increase \ndefense spending by well over $100 billion a year. Let's increase \nhomeland security spending. Let's increase spending on health care \nissues because health care spending is increasing. He proposes we pay \nthat. So we have very large spending increases and at the same time he \nsays, Let's cut taxes and cut taxes again. Yesterday's CQ Daily talks \nagain about an additional tax cut campaign.\n  The question is, How do you pay for all this? Does it add up to have \nbudgets proposed by this President that say, let's increase spending in \ncategory after category and then, by the way, let's cut revenue and \nlet's have the kids pay for all this?\n  Now we have a proposal for $25 billion in additional funding for \nIraq. That is on top of the nearly over $80 billion we appropriated \nrecently just months ago. Part of that money, incidentally, which is \nnot paid for and that is charged to the kids, is to reconstruct Iraq.\n  We have a program in this country offered to us by the administration \nfor Iraq, a domestic program. They have a roads program for Iraq. They \nhave a jobs program. They have a health care program for Iraq. They \nhave an energy program for Iraq--all paid for by the American taxpayer. \nIs that what we ought to be doing?\n  Iraq has the second largest reserves of oil in the world. I had a \nsoldier tell me he was standing on some sand in a low spot one day in \nIraq and his boots got black with oil. It was seeping out of the sand. \nThey have the second largest reserves of oil in the world. I believe \nthe Iraqi people ought to sell Iraqi oil to pay for Iraq \nreconstruction. That is not the job of the American taxpayer. Yet this \nadministration again, even on this issue, says: Let's borrow money and \nlet the kids pay for it in order to provide a domestic program to \nreconstruct Iraq. In my judgment, it is fundamentally wrong. It means \nfewer jobs in our country, less economic growth, and less opportunity \nhere.\n\n  Unless we get our hands around these issues, a reckless fiscal policy \nthat has now given us the largest budget deficit in history and a trade \npolicy that seems oblivious to fairness for American producers and \nworkers, when you hear people talk about trade policy who espouse these \nthings, you wonder whether the tongue is in any way connected to the \nbrain. What on Earth could they be talking about, setting up trade \npolicies with other countries that undercut our producers and undercut \nour workers?\n  I could give you examples. I have done it in recent weeks. Huffy \nbicycles are made in China; the little red wagon, that is made in \nChina, not in America. You want to buy Mexican food, go buy a Fig \nNewton. Fig Newton used to be an all-American cookie. That is now made \nin Mexico; Fig Newton is Mexican food. You wear Fruit of the Loom \nunderwear? You are not wearing American underwear anymore. It is made \nin Mexico and China. And Levis, that isn't all-American. They are gone, \ntoo.\n  This country has to have a trade policy that begins to ratchet these \nhuge deficits down. Instead, they are going up. This administration \ndoesn't care. Their interest? Go do another trade deal with another \ncountry, just do another deal. It undercuts the interests of our \ncountry. It is perfectly appropriate, as the Democratic leader said, to \nask: Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago? The answer with \nrespect to this country's economy and long-term outlook is, no, we are \nnot.\n\n  The answer to John Adams' question, Where will the leadership come \nfrom, is the leadership needs to come from an administration that says \nwe have to pay for that which we consume. Why are we not asking in this \ncountry that we begin to pay for that which we are spending? If we want \nto increase defense spending $100 billion a year, as the administration \nhas done and Congress has approved, should someone pay for that? If \nhomeland security needs, in order to deal with the threat of terrorism, \nhave increased, we must increase spending in homeland security, should \nsomeone pay for that, or is this all the obligation of our children?\n  We need leadership, and we need it now. This administration \nunderstands, or should understand, that in fiscal policy and trade \npolicy, these large deficits--large, abiding, and growing deficits--\nwill choke this economy, and that is not what we should aspire to want \nfor our country's future. We can do better than that.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). There is 10 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield back that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5566-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3104, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3104) to provide for the establishment of \n     separate campaign medals to be awarded to members of the \n     uniformed services who participate in Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and to members of the uniformed services who \n     participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is controlled. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes off of the time \non this side, and then the remaining 4 minutes will be reserved for the \nSenator from Arkansas who is in the Chamber to speak. I know Senator \nWarner intends to speak as well.\n  First, I thank the majority leader, the Democratic leader, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Levin for their leadership in bringing this \nlegislation to the Senate floor today for a vote.\n  H.R. 3104 is a bill to honor our service men and women in Iraq and \nAfghanistan with campaign medals that recognize--appropriately \nrecognize, in my view--their service and their sacrifice.\n  A few days from now we will all honor those who have given their \nlives in defense of this great Nation. That is, of course, Memorial \nDay. This year it takes on special meaning since we clearly are engaged \nin two wars in which we have suffered many losses. Many fathers and \nmothers, sons and daughters will spend this Memorial Day not with \nfamily and friends but instead in Afghanistan or in Iraq. It is for \nthem and their families that I believe we need to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, we have been flooded with horrific images of \nIraqi prisoners mistreated at the hands of a few soldiers. This set of \nincidents has cast a dark shadow over the honorable and courageous \nservice of over 2 million men and women in uniform. Today, we have an \nopportunity to send a strong, unequivocal message of support for our \nbrave young men and women who have served and continue to serve both in \nIraq and in Afghanistan.\n  H.R. 3104 will provide the special recognition to these soldiers \nthat, in my view, is long overdue.\n  The administration made a decision to award a generic global war on \nterrorism expeditionary medal to all of the men and women who have \nserved in\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nthose two theaters of war. In my view, that is an effort to essentially \npractice a one-size-fits-all solution. I think it missed the mark. I \nthink we can do better. This legislation will do better.\n  A campaign medal, such as is contemplated in this legislation, is \ndifferent from an expeditionary medal. We can look back into the \nhistory of campaign medals and expeditionary medals awarded by our \nDepartment of Defense in previous campaigns and see that the campaign \nmedals are reserved for those engaged in actual combat, or duty that is \nequally hazardous as combat duty, during the operation with armed \nopposition. That is what our men and women are facing today both in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Clearly, service in those two locations warrants \nthe authorization of campaign medals.\n  I am very pleased to see many of my colleagues have chosen to \ncosponsor the Senate version of this bill. This bill now has 24 \ncosponsors, including Senators Lugar, Lott, Landrieu, Inhofe, Gregg, \nJohnson, Rockefeller, Pryor, Reid, Daschle, Lincoln, Boxer, Durbin, \nBiden, Akaka, Edwards, Kerry, Clinton, Bayh, Feingold, Nelson, Conrad, \nKennedy, Stabenow, Dole, and Byrd. And, of course, I wish to thank the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee again \nfor their important leadership in getting this legislation enacted.\n  Also, I wish to acknowledge the very hard work and good work that was \ndone by Representative Vic Snyder, who was the sponsor of this measure \nin the House.\n  This measure we are going to vote on is identical to the bill we \nintroduced in the Senate, and Representative Snyder deserves great \ncredit for his hard work in getting it enacted there.\n  Mr. President, I am informed there is some additional time. I have \nbeen informed we do not expect to start the vote until about 11:30 a.m.\n  Let me continue for another minute and say that after a particularly \ndangerous and brutal April, America now mourns the deaths of nearly 800 \nservice men and women in Iraq, as well as 119 in Afghanistan. There \nhave been nearly 3,000 Americans injured in those campaigns.\n  More than a year after the initial Iraqi invasion, the administration \nhas announced plans to maintain a force of at least 135,000 troops in \nIraq through 2005. Despite the assurances we would be able to handle \nthis with an $87 billion supplement through this fiscal year, we now \nsee that is not going to be possible. This is a significant military \noccupation. It is a significant reconstruction effort. In fact, it is \nthe most significant we have ventured into since World War II. We must \nnot underestimate the importance of the sacrifice these men and women \nare making.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly will not object, but we should \nclarify that the vote will now go off at 11:30 a.m. Therefore, why \ndon't we equally divide the time and the Senator from New Mexico take \nsuch time as he wishes, and our distinguished colleague from Arkansas \nwishes to speak. I do not think there is any rush. The Senator can take \nthe time he wishes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I concur with that assessment, and ask \nthe additional time between now and 11:30 a.m. be split equally between \nthe two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be divided equally, after \nsubtracting the time that has already been consumed, I suspect.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will conclude. This legislation and \nthe establishment of these campaign medals will also serve to honor \nthose who will not return home from these conflicts, including those \nwho have fallen from my home State of New Mexico: Army SP James Prittle \nfrom Carlsbad, NM; Air Force Special Operations pilot, CPT Tamara \nArchuleta from Albuquerque, NM, a single mother whose helicopter \ncrashed in Afghanistan; Marine PFC Christopher Ramos of Albuquerque, \nNM; and Marine Cpl Aaron Austin of Lovington, NM.\n  These heroes gave their lives for this Nation. This medal will honor \nthat sacrifice as well. The great men and women of our military forces \nare doing their jobs every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is \nappropriate that we honor them with an award that truly stands for \ntheir heroic service. The Iraq and Afghanistan campaign medals will do \nthat.\n  As I indicated before, I will now yield time to my colleague from \nArkansas, and he can take as much time as he would like of that which \nremains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to indicate my full support for the \npassage of this legislation, H.R. 3104, which requires the President to \nestablish separate campaign medals for service members who participate \nin Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. My good friend and colleague, Congressman Vic Snyder of \nArkansas, has worked tirelessly to pass this measure in the House. \nCongressman Snyder is a man of character and conviction, and he has \nworked to develop a bill that rightly recognizes the service of our men \nand women in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  This bill truly is a credit to his leadership and his ability, and \nonce again he is demonstrating his effectiveness in the Congress.\n  I am a cosponsor of S. 2262, the Senate companion measure offered by \nSenator Bingaman, who has also shown great leadership on this issue. I \nwant to acknowledge that and thank him for championing this measure in \nthis distinguished body.\n  This is a solid measure. The Senate Armed Services Committee, whose \nchairman is in the Chamber today, Senator John Warner, my distinguished \ncolleague from Virginia, has shown tremendous leadership over the last \nseveral months and even over the last years as chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. The committee has passed identical language \nin the Defense authorization during the committee markup. The committee \nalso reported favorably H.R. 3104.\n  This bill was not intended to replace the administration's Global War \non Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal. Instead, it complements the Global War on Terrorism \nMedals by providing additional separate campaign medals that would be \nawarded to qualified service members.\n  As we view and read about the difficulties that our troops are facing \nin Iraq, we see the camaraderie that exists between people who have \nserved in the same war. There is definitely a unique bond. Separate \ncampaign medals for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom honor those two distinct and separate military campaigns.\n  Separate campaign medals provide our men and women in uniform who \nserve in these operations with tangible acknowledgment of their duty to \ntheir country. I think this humble token of acknowledgment is the least \nwe can do, and I urge my colleagues to support this very important \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to support this \nlegislation, as it recognizes America's fighting men and women serving \ntoday in Iraq and Afghanistan. These soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines are serving their country, in harms way, in two distinct \ntheaters, and it is time that we recognize them appropriately.\n  The armed forces of this country have defended us valiantly for the \nlast two hundred and twenty nine years. When our Nation has been \nchallenged, each generation has risen to the occasion. And I do need to \ninform anybody in this chamber that the current generation has done the \nsame, and that they are fighting valiantly in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAmerica knows all too well that many of our troops have given what \nPresident Lincoln called the ``last full measure of devotion.''\n  The generation that fought in Vietnam was given a medal for their \nservice, as were the men and women who served in Korea. The generation \nthat fought in World War II was awarded with a medal commemorating the \nvictory, as well as service in the Pacific, European/African, and \nAmerican theaters. And today we bestow the same honors upon the current \ngeneration that their fathers and grandfathers received.\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\n  This legislation is the right thing to do, and I am proud to join my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, in this effort.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor to \nexpress my support of legislation introduced by Senators Bingaman, \nInhofe, Landrieu, and Lugar which would establish separate campaign \nmedals to be awarded to those members of the Armed Forces who \nparticipate in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF, and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, OIF.\n  Campaign medals in the United States have a long history and date \nback to George Washington's time when he received a gold medal from \nCongress for the recovery of Boston on March 17, 1776. By 1907, members \nof the Army were wearing newly issued campaign medals, and by 1908, the \nNavy and Marine Corps began to recognize exemplary service with \ncampaign medals.\n  During World War II a series of area campaign medals were authorized \nfor service in the American Theater, the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, and \nthe European-African-Middle Eastern Theater of the war. These medals \nwere the same for all services and inaugurated a trend that exists \ntoday by recognizing the valor and service of military members involved \nin specific difficult deployments.\n  I had the privilege of traveling to Iraq and Afghanistan in March \n2004 where I met many of our men and women proudly serving our nation. \nIt was an honor for me to witness their dedication to duty and country. \nWhile our Nation is engaged in a global war on terrorism, it is clear \nthat our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are engaged in distinct \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some of them have served in both \noperations and deserve separate medals.\n  Campaign medals were specifically designed to recognize the service \nof military members in specific operations during a period of active \nhostilities. Service men and women deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan \ndeserve this distinctive honor. I fully support this bill which would \nestablish campaign medals for members of the Armed Forces who \nparticipate in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nBingaman and Senator Pryor and acknowledge our colleague in the House, \nMr. Snyder. I would like to add to that Congressman Ike Skelton. He \ntalked to me about it. He feels very strongly. He is a marvelous man. \nHe is the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n  So I think this is a splendid initiative. I strongly urge Members of \nthis Senate to support it. It is H.R. 3104, the act to provide for the \nestablishment of separate campaign medals for those uniformed services \nparticipating in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  The bill before us passed the House in late March by a vote of 423 to \n0. During the markup of the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2005 on May 6, the committee unanimously decided to include the text of \nthis provision in the bill as section 542. At the same time, in order \nto expedite its enactment, the committee also voted favorably to report \nout this bill. So we covered it in both ways in the Armed Services \nCommittee, again showing our strong support.\n  I will touch on a little bit of history. Going back to World War II, \nwe had a campaign medal called the Asiatic/Pacific Campaign Medal, and \nthat covered all of the operations in the Pacific region. There was \nanother separate medal for the Philippine campaign, to my recollection, \nbut basically it was one to cover the many actions in the Pacific. \nLikewise, a second was the European/African/Middle Eastern Campaign \nMedal awarded to those who served between 1941 and 1946, which covered \nall of the operations in those three theaters.\n  There was a third medal which was sort of a medal that covered those \nwho saw service, but their training and other duties did not require \nthem to go overseas. They were largely in the continental limits of the \nUnited States and participated in actions along the coastlines of \nAmerica, the Atlantic side, and, of course, the Pacific side.\n  Then when we came down to the campaigns in Korea, there was the \nKorean Service Medal given from 1950 to 1954. My distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, worked on a slight revision for the \nqualifications, which I supported, expanding the period of time, which \nI thought was a wise decision.\n  Then when we came down to the question of the service in Vietnam, \nagain, we had the Vietnam Service Medal. So there are many precedents \nfor this type of action regarding the very important recognition of the \nindividuals who participate.\n  These particular categories of decorations indicate the geographic \narea where that individual saw service during the periods of conflict. \nThrough experience I have found that the men and women of the Armed \nForces--again, I say with the deepest humility I was entitled to the \nKorean Service Medal for very modest service--but I remember this \nweekend, as other Members do, where we traveled back to our States to \nseek out those who saw service in Iraq, and I met with six individuals \nin connection with a graduation speech. They had been reservists at \nthis small college. They had been called back into active duty, and \ncoincidentally with my visit they had just gotten home from their year \nobligation of service in Iraq.\n  The first question they asked me was, What sort of recognition do we \nget for service over there? Now, two of them had been wounded and, of \ncourse, received the Purple Heart, but they were anxious to know was \nrecognition forthcoming. That is why I have joined in total support of \nthis effort to bring to the attention of those people in this country \nthe remarkable service that has been performed in both these theaters \nof operation in the past year or so.\n  So I strongly support this bill. The superb service rendered by our \nNation's fighting forces since September 11 fully warrants the \nestablishment of campaign medals for service in Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I urge all of my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  I again thank those who have taken a leadership role, our \ndistinguished colleagues Senators Bingaman and Pryor, and the two \nindividuals on the House side.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take another minute to conclude \nthe discussion. Again, I thank Senator Warner particularly for his \nleadership in getting this bill up for a vote today, and, of course, \nSenator Pryor, who was here a few minutes ago to speak; I appreciate \nhis efforts. Of course, the majority leader and Senator Daschle on the \nDemocratic side have both participated in helping do this.\n  This is an important step for us to take, to honor the brave men and \nwomen who are serving our country in distant locations. I have had a \nsimilar experience to the one Senator Warner described, talking to \nservice men and women who have returned--in the case of my State, from \nAfghanistan, the ones I spoke to, 2 weeks ago. They are very proud of \nwhat they have done. They have great reason to be proud of what they \nhave done. This awarding of these campaign medals will help us to \nrecognize that.\n  Let me also indicate my appreciation to David Montotya of my staff \nfor the consistent work he has done trying to move this legislation \nahead, both last year and again this year. I think the dedicated \nefforts of our staffs often go unrecognized. He deserves credit. Trudy \nVincent, my staff legislative director, also deserves credit.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I can proceed \nfor a minute or two in a colloquy with my distinguished friend from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I agree we need 2 minutes on our side, also.\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We do not need the time now.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could have a brief colloquy, the leadership needs to \nfocus on working with Senator Levin and myself, as we always do each \nyear on this bill. We are hopeful to finish this bill this week. I \nthink that is shared by the other side of the aisle.\n  Our Members are going back for the Memorial Day weekend, and the \nprovisions in this bill are provisions that relate to so many of the \nmen and women in the Armed Forces with whom they will undoubtedly be \nassociating over the course of this weekend. It is definitely in the \ninterest of Members to move forward on this bill.\n  While we have a hearing in the Armed Services Committee tomorrow \nmorning on the questions related to prison abuse, the bill is going \nforward. Members of our committee will be in the Senate intermittently \nas the hearing is going on. That will not in any way, I hope, be viewed \nas an impediment to forward progress.\n  I, personally, am willing to stay here as long into the evenings as \ndesired by our leadership to get this done. In years past, my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada has been most helpful in moving \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the distinguished Senator, \nfirst, on behalf of the people of the State of Nevada, and I think I \nspeak for the country, the way the Senator has handled this committee \nwith Senator Levin during this very difficult time has been admirable. \nThe Senator is my stereotype of the Senate. The Senator is a proud \nmember of the Republican Party, yet the Senator has the wisdom and the \nexperience to be able to set those partisan desires to one side. That \nis good for the country. The Senator has certainly indicated that \nduring the past few days. We respect the Senator for that.\n  Mr. President, we will be happy to cooperate with the distinguished \nchairman in attempting to finish this bill this week. It is a big \n``ask,'' because we have on our side, and the Senator has on their \nside, Members offering amendments. I see the distinguished junior \nSenator from Mississippi is shopping an amendment. We have a number of \nbipartisan amendments being talked about.\n  We are in the mode of wanting to cooperate. We understand the \nimportance of this legislation. It may be very difficult to finish. We \nhave Tuesday, we have Wednesday, we have Thursday, and Friday.\n  As the Senator knows, this is the Friday before the Memorial Day \nrecess. The Senator is more experienced than I, but come Thursday \nnight, Friday morning, Members will have parades and things to do so it \nwill be very difficult to finish this bill. However, the Senator should \nunderstand that on this side we will cooperate in any way we can to \nfinish the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I emphasize tomorrow \nmorning's hearings will not interfere with progress on the bill. We \nhave three of our combatant commanders, coincidentally, in Washington \nfor a variety of reasons.\n  The letter Senator Levin and I sent to the Secretary of Defense \nscheduling additional witnesses offered the option of a teleconference \nhearing, thinking they would not be back, but we are fortunate they \nhave returned for not only this hearing but a wide range of additional \nduties they are performing in Washington by way of consultation. That \nwill not be an impediment. We will move forward tomorrow as scheduled \nwith our work on the committee.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to move ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on third \nreading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first I have a couple of housekeeping items. \nI am delighted to join in support of a truly bipartisan amendment. The \nlead sponsors of the amendment are Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, \nSenator Snowe of Maine, Senator Feinstein of California, Senator \nCochran of Mississippi, and Senator Daschle of South Dakota. We do have \nbroad bipartisan support as original sponsors.\n  I would like to begin by describing the amendment. This will take \napproximately 10 minutes, and then perhaps Senator Dorgan can have 10 \nminutes and then Senator Cochran would like to be recognized. We will \ntry to get the opening statements in before we break for the policy \nluncheons, and then we can discuss during the break the timing on the \namendment and how we proceed from there.\n  Does the manager of the legislation have a comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and leader for \nbringing up this amendment at this time. I approached him on the floor \nsaying we are anxious to get the bill moving, and he accepted the \nchallenge. I am not sure If I am going to support him on this \namendment, but, nevertheless, we will have a good and thorough debate.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, and I conferred earlier \nthis morning. We are both of a frame of mind that we want to move with \ntremendous momentum. Today is a good day to move on. I urge Senators to \nbring their amendments to the floor. We are willing to stay here into \nthe evening and participate in the process.\n  During the hearing of the Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning \nat 8:30 to sometime midday, we will have members of the committee on \nthe floor. We will not lose a step in moving forward on this bill. It \nis important to have this hearing tomorrow. We are fortunate that the \nDepartment of Defense brought back commanders for a variety of reasons, \nnot just our hearing. Senator Levin and I had made the offer to do it \nby telephone conferences. It is important we continue the continuity of \nthe hearings of our committee.\n  The point of this is, I would hope, if I can frankly say to our \nleadership, that perhaps we could get a unanimous consent agreement \nlater tonight to lock in those amendments that we know are out there on \nthis bill. I hope we can do that. I have seen a list of 50 amendments. \nYet I think it is an incomplete list. Perhaps within the course of the \nday we can explore that option with our leadership.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. I will be glad \nto yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Mississippi will yield, forgive me, I \njoin our chairman in urging all of our colleagues to bring the \namendments to the floor, share the language with us, and allow us to \nmove expeditiously on this bill by doing that.\n  We are going to proceed, as the chairman indicated, tomorrow morning \non the floor to consider amendments at the same time that we are \nholding a hearing with the three generals who have been outlined. We \ncan do both at the same time with the cooperation of all of our \nMembers. We have the cooperation of all of our Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted we are moving forward with \nthis amendment. I know how much the managers like to get the process \nstarted and consider major amendments. I believe this is an issue that \ndeserves some consideration and some debate\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\nduring the day and early on. We will be prepared to work with the \nmanagers to get a reasonable time agreement and get to a vote because I \nthink this is the best way to proceed on legislation such as this. We \nare not interested in delaying tactics.\n  I rise to offer this amendment which would modify the Base \nRealignment and Closure Act of 1990, BRAC, to first consider our needs \noverseas before we move forward with closing more bases at home.\n  Let me emphasize what this amendment is not. This is not an amendment \nthat would eliminate or terminate the next BRAC round. This is not an \namendment that would even delay it for 2 years, as the House Armed \nServices Committee language now provides. I believe they would delay \nthe next base closure round until 2007. No, this amendment specifically \nsays let's go forward with the realignment overseas. Let's look at our \nforce structure. Let's determine how many installations are truly \nneeded and required overseas, what their missions are, and what will \nthe future call for.\n  We have talked about needing a more mobile, lighter force with a lot \nof prepositioning, but as we found out in Iraq, that may not be all \nthat we need.\n  Then the question is, if we decide to bring back some of these \ndivisions, such as the 1st Armored Division now based in Germany, where \nwould we put them? The question is, before we go to the next domestic \nround, let's get this decision on realignment and changing of force \nstructure overseas, see what we are going to need over there, where we \nare going to put our troops, and what are we going to do with them when \nthey come home. Then the BRAC Commission would go forward with the \ndomestic round.\n  I want to emphasize a couple of points about how this would work.\n  It would make clear that section 2913, the selection criteria, for \nthe 2005 round does not apply in that we would have the overseas \nrealignment first and then the domestic. It would keep the existing \nschedule for the Pentagon's mission of a list and for a BRAC \nconsideration of that list. It specifies that the Secretary's May 16, \n2005, submission to the BRAC Commission should include a number of \nitems.\n  The Secretary's May 16, 2005 submission to the BRAC commission should \ninclude a detailed plan for eliminating excess physical capacity at the \noverseas bases and facilities of the Department of Defense, the \noperation, sustainment, and recapitalization of which diverts scarce \nresources from defense capability; a list of overseas bases and \nfacilities that will be closed or realigned during the period 2005-2010 \nand a schedule for implementing each base closure or realignment; where \nthe personnel and equipment from each base on the list will be \nrelocated to; the infrastructure investments that are required at each \nreceiving base; an estimate of the annual net savings for each of the \nmilitary departments that will result from the closures and \nrealignments; and a certification whether the need exists for an \nadditional round of domestic base closures and realignments in 2007.\n  It also says in developing the overseas base closure plan, the \nSecretary shall take into consideration the report of the Commission on \nreview of overseas military structures of the United States that is due \nto report its findings by December 31, 2004. In other words, this \nprocess is underway, but we need to get those Commission reports. They \nneed to take into consideration the overseas decision before they go to \nthe next domestic round. That is basically what this amendment does.\n  I want to cite, though, why I feel so concerned about this. The \nrecord is clear that I have never thought BRAC was a good idea. I think \nthe way it should be done is the way it was done always up until the \n1980s. The Pentagon determines where they have overlap or duplication, \nthey send up foreclosure recommendations to the Congress, and Congress \nacts.\n  The argument might be that Congress wouldn't act. They did. Congress \nacted in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, and up to the midpart of the \n1980s and numerous bases throughout the country were closed. It is an \nassumption we cannot assume our rightful role in this Government or in \nthat process. So that is something that is clear.\n  There are other factors now. As I have looked at domestic bases and \nlooked at overseas bases, the very idea we are now going to move \nforward with a base closure round that would close up to 25 percent of \nour existing bases is a real concern, if that is going to be done \ndomestically. As a matter of fact, CBO says the four--count them, the \nfour BRAC rounds we have already had resulted in little or no excess \ncapacity in the United States--little or no excess capacity. Yet the \nPentagon is insisting on moving forward with this BRAC at this time.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, too, they are doing it differently this \ntime. The list is not being compiled by uniformed services, but it is \nbeing pulled up to the Office of the Secretary of Defense level. That \ndoes worry me.\n  We are doing this at a time when we have our troops all over the \nworld, in combat situations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The American \npeople are concerned about our troops, concerned about our capacity to \nhave sufficient numbers there. We have National Guard and reservists \nserving now and doing a tremendous job, I think, up to perhaps as much \nas 40 percent of the troops are deployed in those locations. Keep this \nin mind. The next BRAC round will include National Guard. We didn't \nhave that in the past. But National Guard facilities will probably--\nwill, under the definition they are going forward with, be included in \nthis process.\n  These are communities all over America, in almost every State. I have \nhere a list of the bases that have been on earlier BRAC closure lists \nor would probably be on the list, based on the criteria as we now \nunderstand them. All over America, communities and States are worried \nabout the situation. They are employing consultants to represent the \ncommunities or the States. It is running into the millions of dollars \nbecause of this sheer uncertainty: Is it going forward or not? Are we \ngoing to be affected or not? And, by the way, the Secretaries of \nDefense--and I say Secretaries because I have talked to three of them \nabout it--refuse to set up this criterion in such a way where you look \nat the places where you know you have duplication or overlap. Why put \neverybody on the list, everybody in an uproar, when you know as a \nmatter of fact the duplication is in this place or that place? No, they \ndon't want to define it in that sort of limited way.\n  Here is the point. We need to decide what we are going to do overseas \nfirst. We need to be careful about what we do domestically because it \ncould be affected by what we do overseas. At a time when we are at war \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, at a time when our people are already \nconcerned about what the future is for their military men and women in \ntheir communities and in fact their families, let's do this in such a \nway that people will feel comfortable we are going about it in the \nright way.\n  There have been some bases eliminated overseas since the wall came \ndown. In fact, I think 700 facilities in Europe have been closed. But \nwe still have 200,000 troops stationed overseas--80,000 in Germany \nalone, and that doesn't count some of the reservists and civilians. I \nsuspect there are as many as 100,000 in Germany alone. Let me give \nan example here with this chart of what we are talking about. This is \nGermany--unified Germany, surrounded by Belgium, France, Switzerland, \nAustria, Czech Republic, Denmark. I don't think they are threatened by \nany of those countries.\n\n  You will see on this chart the sites where we have Army and Air Force \nbases in Germany. They are, of course, right across the central part, \nbut they are also now in what was East Germany. There are 310 \ninstallations, an estimated 100,000 people in Germany alone. Do we need \n310 installations? Some of them are small, but let me assure you on my \nrecent trip to Berlin it was clear they wanted to keep all these bases \nand it was clear why. Because economically it is helpful--economically \nhelpful to Germany. Yet we are talking about closing bases here at \nhome, when we have 310 bases there.\n  By the way, this is also a country that has recently said they would \nno longer provide 2,500 troops to guard our installations in Germany \nwhile the troops ordinarily stationed there are in Iraq not even 2,500 \ntroops.\n  I am saying let's take a strong look at Germany. It is not only \nGermany. I don't want to pick on Germany. We have, I think, 18 \ninstallations in Belgium, 12 in The Netherlands. Let me\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\nmake sure I have the exact numbers--18 in Belgium, 310 in Germany, 12 \nin The Netherlands, 101 in South Korea, 54 in the United Kingdom. There \nis a list here of what we have overseas, a total of 721 facilities \noverseas.\n  Do we need to have a hospital or Air Force bases in Germany? Sure. Do \nwe need to have naval bases in Spain? Sure. Do we need to have \nprepositioning at various places around the world? Absolutely. We have \nheard a lot of talk about this restructuring or realignment overseas, \nbut we still have not gotten it done. In fact, if you look at the force \nstructure plan for BRAC 2005, based on the Pentagon's forecast, it \nassumes the same forces as now, from 2005 to 2009. It apparently \nassumes the forces that are based overseas now will remain based \noverseas.\n  Are we going to have a realignment and bring some home or not?\n  I think this amendment makes good sense. It does not stop BRAC. It \nallows it to go forward. But it puts the horse before the cart. Let's \nlook at the overseas situation. Let's assess what we need there. Let's \nfind out what we are going to do with them if we do bring them back \nhome and then go forward with the next step.\n  I talked with Senator Dorgan a lot about this. We thought about it \ncarefully. We want to do the right thing. Surely there are some bases \nwe could close and installations in the United States that could be \nclosed. But I think we should do it in an orderly way and I think the \ntiming of doing it now could not be worse.\n  I don't trust this process. Some people say if you do the commission, \nit takes it out of politics. Who believes that? Commissions are beyond \npolitics? Take a look at the last commission. We got in a terrible \nconflict based on a decision that involves the States of Texas and \nCalifornia. I am not picking on those States, but it happened.\n  Let's take more time. Let's do the overseas situation first and then \ngo forward with the domestic bases a year or two from now, when we will \nhave a better feel for what is happening in the world.\n  Since we are limited on time, I would like to withhold further \ncomments at this time so Senator Warner or Senator Dorgan could speak \nand perhaps Senator Cochran wishes to be heard on this issue, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We are off to a very good start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the hour for purposes of \ndiscussing these opening remarks be extended to 12:45.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder----\n  Mr. WARNER. We could have some division between Senator Levin and \nmyself. Perhaps if we could----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator would amend that to 12:40?\n  Mr. WARNER. You have 12:40. Why don't we reserve, say, 5 minutes \nwithin that period, or 6 minutes for the Senator from Michigan and \nmyself and allocate the remainder of the time to our other two \ncolleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Time has \nbeen extended until 12:40.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It sounds to me as though we are left with 3 or 4 \nminutes, as I understood it. I don't think that accomplishes it. I will \nspeak only 2 or 3 minutes at the moment. I know I have two colleagues \nwho perhaps would like to speak for a couple of minutes. I would be \nglad to come back after our caucuses----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we certainly could come back after the \ncaucuses. I am trying to help to get a little bit of time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me do 3 minutes, and then I will yield the floor so \nmy colleagues might also say a word or so. My colleague, Senator Lott, \nexplained the reason for this.\n\n  Let me explain what this bill is not. This amendment is not an \namendment that would obliterate or abolish next year's BRAC Commission. \nIt does not do that. It does say next year's BRAC Commission should \nmake judgments and recommendations to the Congress on the overseas base \nstructure.\n  It makes good sense that we would understand and try to think through \nwhat our basing structure should be internationally before we decide \nwhat our needs are here at home. If, for example, at some point we do \nnot have 100,000 troops in Germany and we bring home 50,000 of those \ntroops to this country--incidentally, we ought to consider that because \nit is very expensive to keep 100,000 troops in Germany--if we did that, \nwhere would we put 50,000 troops? At which base? What set of bases?\n  So we propose something that would make good sense, make judgments in \nnext year's BRAC Commission about the overseas bases, where we should \nretain overseas bases.\n  Since we authorized the BRAC round, we have had the continuing war on \nterrorism, a war in Afghanistan, and a war in Iraq. We have had a \nseries of things that have altered in many ways what our \nresponsibilities are around the world. The cold war is over. We have \nnew challenges and new responsibilities.\n  The question we should answer first is, What should our base \nstructure be internationally and from that, then, what kind of needs do \nwe have to house troops at home?\n  My colleague mentioned several other features of this bill. Let me \nleave it at that. I will come back this afternoon after the caucus \nlunch and discuss in greater detail why we have offered this amendment. \nWe do not intend to trip up the Pentagon or trip up the managers of the \nbill. We intend to see if we cannot have the base-closing process \nhappen in an orderly way, figure out what the overseas structure should \nbe, and from that, then if the Congress considers a 2007 round, have an \naffirmative vote to do that and make that judgment with respect to \ndomestic bases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will defer my statement until after the \npolicy luncheon at 2:15, but I want to say I truly appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Dorgan and Senator Lott in this matter. It is \ncritical we concentrate on this particular issue in terms of the impact \nfor the future.\n  Senator Lott indicated so eloquently that there is no question there \nis a problem with this process. It is not transparent. We are in a \ndifferent threat environment than we have ever been. Clearly, we have \nto reevaluate, reassess the base-closing process in that light.\n  I will defer all of my comments until 2:15.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a very significant amendment, in light of the \nhistory of the Senate now for consecutive years, deciding to go forward \nwith the BRAC process that is well underway.\n  I share the viewpoints expressed by Senator Lott, Senator Snowe, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota, the need to address the overseas \nsituation. When time permits later on, I will explain what has been \ndone to date by the Department of Defense in conjunction with the \nongoing BRAC Commission regarding these bases. It is very significant.\n  The Department of Defense has moved forward. I think shortly they \nwill submit to the Congress drawing down forces and bases in both the \nareas referred to by Senator Lott and others; I might add also \nsignificant drawing down of forces inside Korea. That is underway.\n  Part of this proposed legislation in this amendment is the 2-year \ndelay. I draw on the very comment made by my distinguished colleague, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, of the turbulence in the \ncommunities engendered by the existing law as they are struggling to \nget high-powered assistance and expert advice from every possible \nsource, depending on the community budget, to try to preserve their \nmilitary installation. That process is now continued for another 2 \nyears. This is a somewhat heavy burden on many of these small \ncommunities to try to do the best they can to fight the existing law.\n  That is the key question Members have to consider: Are they going to \nextend these hardships under the existing law for 2 more years as we \naddress the overseas situation, which I can assure Members later this \nafternoon is being thoroughly addressed by the Department of Defense in \nthe context of the existing law.\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have received now a letter from the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff representing all of the chiefs \nurging the Senate to continue their unequivocalness to continue the \n2005 round of base realignment and closures as authorized by Congress. \nThey are pleading with us not to leave this issue unresolved because \nthe savings which are essential for the transformation of our military \nare savings they want to achieve. They are working very hard on the \ntransformation of our military. They clearly intend there be a global \nposture review, and there will be a global posture review, taking into \naccount the closing of bases overseas.\n  There is a commission that must be created this year and is required \nto report to us on the review of the overseas military facility \nstructure. This is referred to in the amendment. As I understand it, \nthey have not yet been appointed, but it is required that the \nleadership appoint that commission, and it is required, obviously, that \nthe Secretary of Defense and Department of Defense next year, in making \ntheir recommendations, take into account the very report this amendment \nsays should be taken into account.\n  So we have a global posture review which is underway. It will be \ncompleted. We have a commission to review overseas military facilities. \nThat is all in place. It is all ongoing. It is all in order. There is a \nlogic to it all in terms of looking at the overseas bases first.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from Mississippi and the \nSenator from North Dakota. Of course, you will look at overseas bases \nfirst. That is what is going on now. That is the global posture review. \nThat is the commission on the review of the overseas military facility \nstructure which is in the process of being appointed and will report \nthis year.\n  But to disrupt all that and to leave every base in the United States \nin limbo for another 2 years is not doing a favor either to our \nmilitary structure or to the bases around our country. We all have \nbases. Are we going to leave them nervous? Are we going to leave them \nin limbo for 2 more years? That is not doing them a favor and it is \ndoing a significant disfavor to our military posture and the \nrequirement that we transform, as the chief said, the combat capability \nof the Department of Defense.\n  I hope this amendment would be rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply add that right in this letter, and I ask \nunanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record at this point, a \ncomprehensive overseas basing review is nearly complete. It is \nsignificant.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing this letter to emphasize \n     our continued and unequivocal support for conducting a 2005 \n     round of base realignment and closure (BRAC), as authorized \n     by the Congress. The convergence of ongoing strategy and \n     overseas basing actions, the transformational direction in \n     all the Services and force structure changes together afford \n     us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to truly transform the \n     Department's combat capability in an enduring way. A delay of \n     this BRAC round, or a modification of the legislation that \n     limits the Department's flexibility to execute it, will \n     seriously undermine our ability to fundamentally reconfigure \n     our infrastructure to best support the transformation of our \n     forces to meet the security challenges we face now and will \n     continue to face for the foreseeable future.\n       A comprehensive overseas basing review is nearly complete. \n     The continued concentration of forces in Cold War locations \n     highlights the need for a global repositioning to locations \n     that best support our strategic goals. In order to ensure \n     that the Department examines its entire infrastructure, the \n     rationalization of our domestic infrastructure as conducted \n     by the BRAC process must closely follow the Global Posture \n     Review. Both efforts are necessary for a genuine \n     capabilities-based infrastructure rationalization and to \n     further transformation of our warfighting capabilities.\n       We ask for your careful consideration of the importance we \n     place on conducting a 2005 BRAC round as currently \n     authorized. BRAC has proven to be the only comprehensive, \n     fair, and effective process for accomplishing this \n     imperative. We assure you that the Department will conduct \n     BRAC 2005 in a way that ensures it maintains force structure \n     and infrastructure that is flexible enough to surge and \n     respond to changing threats to our national security.\n     Peter Pace,\n       General, USMC, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Richard B. Myers,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Peter J. Schoomaker,\n       General, U.S. Army, Chief of Staff, U.S. Army.\n     Vern Clark,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval Operations.\n     John P. Jumper,\n       General, USAF, Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force.\n     Michael W. Hagee,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will respond, of course.\n  I must point out, to proceed as current law anticipates, we should \nanticipate it will cost us money in the short term. We are struggling \naround here to find money but we will actually expend more money in the \nshort term with respect to the 2005 BRAC round, and we do not propose \nwe obliterate this entire process.\n  What we propose is to establish an order that makes sense. The order \nthat would make sense would be to evaluate where we would house \noverseas troops, given the new realities of the world, and then from \nthat understand what our domestic needs are. That seems to me to be the \nlogical and right approach. I don't think it poses any additional risk \nfor anyone.\n  The current 20-year plan, the unclassified portion of the 20-year \nforecast for the threat and for basing, apparently assumes the same \nsize force as we now have and apparently assumes the same forces that \nare based overseas, which largely remain based overseas. I don't think \nthat is likely to be the case.\n  We are proposing a structure which would put the horse in front of \nthe cart. That is the amendment we have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 \nminutes, not on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, Mr. President, I yield back all time on our side. \nI believe that completes the debate, at this point, on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). All time has expired.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my dear colleagues for allowing \nme this time. I apologize for taking a little extra time today, but I \nthink it is important.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch are printed in today's Record under \n``Executive Session.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate your patience and I \nappreciate this extra time.

At \nthat meeting, Mr. Card committed that there would be no further circuit \nand district judicial recess appointments during the remainder of the \nPresident's term, and the Democratic leader committed to vote on, by \nthe end of June, 25 judicial nominations now pending on the Executive \nCalendar.\n  I ask Senator Daschle if I have correctly summarized where we now \nstand on these nominations.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader is correct. With \nthese 25, we will have confirmed 198 of the President's judicial \nnominees, 100 of which were confirmed thanks to the efforts of Senator \nLeahy and the other members of the Judiciary Committee while the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate. In return for the President's \ncommitment, which Mr. Card has conveyed to us, that there will be no \nfurther judicial recess appointments for the remainder of his term, we \nhave committed to confirm now 25 of the judicial nominations currently \non the Executive Calendar by the end of June. Some may entail more \nfloor time than others, but there will be a vote on each of the 25 \nnominations and, if necessary, I will support cloture on any of these \n25 that should be necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5574-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5574-S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    NOMINATION OF MARCIA G. COOKE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n   Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be vitiated \nand the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of \nCalendar No. 606, the nomination of Marcia Cooke to be a United States \ndistrict judge for the Southern District of Florida.\n  I further ask that the Senate proceed to vote on the nomination and \nthat following the vote the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Marcia G. \nCooke, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nFlorida.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want my remarks to be thought of as \nconstructive remarks rather than not constructive.\n  Yet another week has gone by without this body confirming a judicial \nnominee. That makes more than 9 weeks since the last judicial \nconfirmation. Only four judges have been confirmed this year, and that \nis hardly a record of progress.\n  It is not enough for the minority to point out how many nominees were \nconfirmed under their watch 2 years ago. We must also look at what is \ngoing on now, and this is a dismal record even for a Presidential \nelection year.\n  Over the last six Presidential election years, both Republicans and \nDemocrats won the White House and both Republicans and Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. On average, the Senate has confirmed 45 judicial \nnominees in the six most recent Presidential election years, and \ncontinued confirmations until October in four of the last six \nPresidential election years. At this same point in the last six \nPresidential election years, the Senate confirmed, on average, 21 \njudicial nominees by now. I repeat, so far this year we have confirmed \njust four judges.\n  This is not for any lack of activity on the part of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The committee is actually one-third ahead of the average for \nrecent Presidential election years in voting out judicial nominees to \nthe full Senate. We have held 10 nomination hearings this year alone.\n  Yet 32 nominees languish on the Senate calendar in a minority-imposed \nlimbo despite the fact that we all know that if we took the simple up-\nor-down votes on each and every one of these nominees that the \nConstitution contemplates, it is probable that virtually all 32 of \nthese nominees would be confirmed.\n  Fully 22 of the 32 nominees on the calendar were reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee without even one negative vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee. And that is saying something because our committee is known \nto be the home of some of the most vigorous debates and debaters in the \nSenate. As anyone who has ever attended one of our markups can verify, \nno one on the Judiciary Committee is shy about expressing an opinion on \nmost any subject or reticent to reflect or register a dissenting point \nof view.\n  When a nominee goes through the Judiciary Committee without \nopposition, the nominee is truly a consensus candidate of high \nqualifications and deserves prompt consideration by the full Senate.\n  For me and many others, a nominee's American Bar Association rating \nis a factor to consider. I do not think it is the be all and end all of \nthe confirmation process, but it is something that can be helpful in \nevaluating a nominee's qualifications. During the Clinton \nadministration, I can recall that some of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle took the position that the ABA rating was the ``gold \nstandard'' with respect to judicial confirmations.\n  Well, where are they now when 24 of the 32 nominees on the Executive \nCalendar have received the highest rating, ``well qualified,'' by the \nABA? And what is more, 14 of the 24 nominees rated ``well qualified'' \nby the ABA received this ``well qualified'' rating by a unanimous vote \nof the ABA evaluators.\n  The Constitution requires, and this body has traditionally provided, \na vote for every judicial nominee reaching the full Senate. Every \nClinton nominee that reached the Senate floor got a vote, and President \nClinton nearly broke the all-time confirmation record set by President \nReagan who set this record with 6 years of a Republican-controlled \nSenate, while President Clinton only had 2 years of a Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate to help him. President Bush's nominees should receive \nthe same treatment and get a vote on the floor.\n  I remain hopeful that this body will not abandon past practice and \nextend the recent spate of unprecedented filibusters of appellate court \nnominees to district court nominees. That is why I have continued to \nencourage the leadership on both sides of the aisle and the White House \nto arrive at an acceptable compromise on the 32 judges on the Senate \nCalendar.\n  I fully support the nomination of Ms. Marcia Cooke to serve as a \nDistrict Judge on the Southern District of Florida.\n  Before the Senate votes on the Cooke nomination, it is only \nappropriate that we spend a few minutes considering her qualifications. \nCurrently serving as Miami Dade County's Assistant County Attorney, Ms. \nCooke is one of those nominees who received the ABA's highest ``well-\nqualified'' rating. Her experience includes service as both a public \ndefender and prosecutor, a plaintiff's attorney and defense counsel, a \nprivate practitioner and public servant, and both an advocate and a \njurist. I might add that Ms. Cooke is a graduate of Georgetown \nUniversity and is an active leader in that fine school's alumni \nassociation.\n  Marcia Cooke served for 8 years as a Federal magistrate in Michigan. \nShe has been an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Michigan and Florida. She \nhas served as Florida's Chief Inspector General. Both of Florida's \nDemocrat Senators support her. The position to which she has been \nnominated has been vacant so long it is now considered a judicial \nemergency. If confirmed she would be the first African-American woman \nto serve as a Federal judge in the Southern District of Florida.\n  It is no wonder why the Judiciary Committee approved her without a \nsingle dissenting vote. Today, the full Senate should act to support \nher.\n  I am pleased that a more reasonable and responsible atmosphere has \nreturned to the Senate and this cloture vote has been vitiated as part \nof a larger agreement on judges.\n  We should all recognize that a cloture vote on a highly qualified, \nhighly respected district court nominee such as Marcia Cooke is not a \npositive sign. It indicates that our friends across the aisle may be \nprepared to extend their policy of delay and filibusters to even \ndistrict court nominees.\n  Many believe that the true target of these unprecedented filibusters \nof judicial nominees is to set the stage for the next Supreme Court \nvacancies. What\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\nthey are trying to do is to, in effect, rewrite article II, section II, \nclause II, of the Constitution to require a 60-vote supermajority for \nSupreme Court vacancies. In the process, these misguided efforts have \ngreatly damaged the confirmation process and diminished our efforts to \nwork together on all judicial nominees.\n  Despite many challenges this year on the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy and his Democratic colleagues have worked with us to approve many \nhighly qualified consensus candidates.\n  I hope that the progress that we have made in the committee will not \nbe derailed on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to my colleagues for \nmoving forward on this nomination, and other nominations to follow over \nthe next few weeks.\n  I know these have been difficult negotiations. So I express my thanks \nto the President, to his chief of staff, Andrew Card, to Senator Frist \nand to Senator Daschle for bringing this agreement to the Senate. I \nalso thank Senator Leahy and other members of the Judiciary Committee \nfor their cooperation. I look forward to continuing the work of the \nCommittee, and this agreement will help us in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial published \ntoday by the Miami Herald in support of the confirmation of Marcia \nCooke be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Miami Herald, May 18, 2004]\n\n Nomination Faces Key Vote; If Confirmed, Marcia Cooke Would Become the \n First Black Woman Appointed to a Federal Judgeship in Florida.; U.S. \n                                 Courts\n\n            (By Gary Fineout, Frank Davies and Tere Figueras)\n\n        Republicans trying to nudge along judicial nominations \n     made by President Bush will force Democrats today to take a \n     potentially embarrassing vote on stalling the appointment of \n     the first black woman to a Federal judgeship in Florida.\n        Last week, Senate Republicans set in motion today's \n     scheduled vote to close off debate on the appointment of \n     Marcia Cooke, an assistant Miami-Dade County Attorney and the \n     former chief inspector general for Gov. Jeb Bush.\n        A successful vote for the Republicans would force a final \n     vote on Cooke's nomination, hastening her ascent to bench of \n     the Southern District of Florida, which stretches from Fort \n     Pierce to Key West.\n        Cooke is caught in a Democratic fight to gain more control \n     over judicial nominations by blocking confirmation votes on \n     even noncontroversial nominees like Cooke.\n        In Tallahassee, the younger brother of the president \n     called on Democrats to support Cooke's nomination.\n        ``This is ridiculous,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush, who spoke to \n     reporters following a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary \n     of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court \n     decision. ``Marcia, who served here in Tallahassee, did a \n     great job as inspector general, is well qualified to be a \n     Federal judge. If the Democrats hold this up for political \n     purposes, it stinks.''\n        The nomination of Cooke has become a small part of a \n     raging battle over judgeships in the Senate. Cooke is backed \n     by Sens. Bob Graham and Bill Nelson, both Democrats.\n\n\n                          registered democrat\n\n        And Cooke, a Bay Harbor Island resident, is herself a \n     registered Democrat.\n        But Senate Democrats, angered by Bush administration \n     ``recess appointments'' of other judges, have tried to block \n     confirmations until an agreement can be reached with the GOP \n     on how to handle controversial nominees.\n        Leaders of both parties were still negotiating Monday, \n     trying to reach some agreement on the process of \n     appointments. If Cooke is confirmed, she would fill a vacancy \n     left by the death of pioneering jurist U.S. District Judge \n     Wilkie D. Ferguson Jr., the first black man appointed to the \n     Miami-Dade Circuit bench and the Third District Court of \n     Appeal.\n        Cooke, 49 and a native of South Carolina, was unanimously \n     approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n        A spokesman for Graham said Monday the senator was hopeful \n     that the nomination would be ultimately approved. ``Sen. \n     Graham has been very pleased to support Marcia Cooke and \n     considers her an outstanding nominee,'' said Paul Anderson \n     from his Washington office. ``He hopes some agreement can be \n     reached to avoid partisan gamesmanship on the floor \n     tomorrow.''\n        It takes 60 votes for the motion to close debate to \n     succeed. There are 51 Republicans in the U.S. Senate, meaning \n     the nine Democrats would have to support the motion in order \n     for it to pass.\n        Anderson predicted that when Cooke's name went before the \n     full Senate that she would be ``overwhelmingly'' approved.\n        ``There should be no need for a procedural vote,'' said \n     Anderson. ``We hope the opportunity will present itself soon \n     for an up or down vote. When that vote comes, she should pass \n     overwhelmingly.''\n\n\n                           tapped by gov. bush\n\n        Cooke earned a degree from Georgetown University in \n     Washington D.C. and a law degree from Wayne State University \n     in Michigan. She worked for legal aid and neighborhood legal \n     services in Michigan before earning a spot as a Federal \n     magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Michigan. She \n     worked seven years for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami \n     before Gov. Bush tapped her as his chief inspector general in \n     1999.\n        She has been an assistant county attorney for Miami-Dade \n     County since 2002, and has also served as an adjunct \n     professor at the University of Miami law school.\n        ``She will be an excellent addition to that Federal \n     bench,'' said former U.S. Attorney Roberto Martinez. ``That \n     she would be the first African American female Federal judge \n     in the state is important. but her qualities and attributes \n     go beyond her ethnic background.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend our two leaders. I have \nbeen working with Senator Daschle for months, as well as with the White \nHouse, to find a way out of the impasse in judicial confirmations. \nSenator Frist and I have spoken at length about this, and he has been \nworking on it, as well.\n  I was delighted to see the meeting that Senator Daschle, Senator \nFrist, and Mr. Card had today in which the White House agreed to no \nmore recess appointments of judges. I think we have demonstrated our \ngood faith. In the 17 months that the Democrats were in charge of the \nSenate, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees to lifetime \npositions on the Federal bench. And the Republicans, during the 23 \nmonths that they have been in charge of the Senate, they have confirmed \nanother 73 plus one today. With this agreement, I think we should be in\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\na position to confirm another two dozen judicial nominees and achieve a \ntotal this is outstanding for a Presidential term. So I commend my \nfriend from Tennessee. I commend my friend from South Dakota. And I \nappreciate their work in helping achieve this arrangement.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has now received assurances from the \nWhite House that the President will not further abuse the recess \nappointment power by making judicial recess appointments this \npresidential term. It was the White House's refusal to reach a \nreasonable accommodation of the concerns of many Senators about the \nunilateral approach of the President regarding his recess appointments \nto the federal courts that complicated our efforts to reach agreement \nregarding votes on less controversial judicial nominees. Thanks to the \nwork of the Democratic leader and the Republican leader, we have now \nreceived a firm commitment from the White House in that regard.\n  I supported the nomination of Marcia Cooke. The Florida Senators \nsupported the nomination of Marcia Cooke. All Democratic members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee supported the nomination of Marcia Cooke. I \nam pleased to vote today to confirm the nomination of Marcia Cooke.\n  The selection of Ms. Cooke to be a judicial nominee for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida serves as an example of how the judicial \nnominations process should work. She was interviewed and recommended by \nFlorida's bipartisan judicial selection commission. This selection \ncommission was created by Senators Graham and Nelson in a negotiated \nagreement with the White House and it has produced talented and well-\nrespected attorneys for the lifetime appointments on the district \ncourts in Florida.\n  Ms. Cooke currently serves as an assistant county attorney in Miami-\nDade County. She previously worked for 3 years as Governor Jeb Bush's \nInspector General in Florida with oversight responsibilities regarding \nFlorida administrative agencies. Ms. Cooke also was selected as a \nFederal Magistrate Judge in Detroit, after serving as a Federal \nprosecutor and also as a public defender.\n  I acted to report her nomination unanimously from the Judiciary \nCommittee and welcome her confirmation today. Marcia Cooke is highly \nregarded. I congratulate Ms. Cooke and her family on her unanimous \nconfirmation vote today.\n  I note that President Bush has nominated only 16 African Americans to \nthe Federal courts, only about a quarter of the number of African \nAmericans nominated by President Clinton to the federal bench. In fact, \nthis President has put more people actively involved in the Federalist \nSociety on the bench than African Americans, Hispanics and members of \nother minority groups combined.\n  With today's confirmation vote on Marcia Cooke to the U.S. District \nCourt in Florida, the Senate has already confirmed 174 judicial \nnominees of President George W. Bush in 3\\1/2\\ years and blocked only a \nhandful of the most extreme. Due to Democratic cooperation and \nbipartisanship, the Senate has confirmed more judges for this President \nthan in President Ronald Reagan's entire first 4 years in office--and \nit was President Reagan who ultimately appointed more judges than any \nother President in U.S. history. In fact, we have cooperated in \nreducing the 110 vacancies we inherited from Republican obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nomination to near 40 and attained the \nlowest vacancy level in 14 years.\n  Today, the Senate and the White House reached an agreement regarding \n25 of this President's judicial nominations pending on the floor, \nincluding Judge Cooke. Not all of these nominees are uncontroversial \nand some may require significant debate before their confirmation vote. \nWith this agreement, the Senate is poised to confirm 198 judicial \nnominees of President Bush for lifetime positions on the Federal \ncourts, including 35 circuit court nominees.\n  We have already confirmed 30 circuit court nominees of President \nBush. More of his circuit nominees have been confirmed than President \nReagan had confirmed by this point in his first term. Recall that from \nthe time Republicans assumed majority control of the Senate in 1995 \nuntil Democratic control in the summer of 2001, circuit court vacancies \nmore than doubled from 16 to 33. We have worked to cut those vacancies \nin half by confirming 30 of President Bush's circuit court nominees. \nWith five additional circuit court nominees part of the agreement, \nPresident Bush will exceed the number of circuit court appointments \nduring President Reagan's first term, as well.\n  Republicans rarely acknowledge that 100 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees to the bench were confirmed under Democratic Senate leadership \nduring 17 months. During the 23 months I have not served as Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and Republicans have been in control, the \nSenate has confirmed 74 additional judges. So in 30 percent more time, \nSenate Republicans have confirmed 26 percent fewer judges.\n  With the agreement reached today, the Senate will confirm a total of \n29 judicial nominees of President Bush this year, including five \ncircuit court nominees. With the progress we have already made this \nyear and under the action agreed to today, the Senate will reach this \nmark before the July 4th recess. This is 29 times more judicial \nnominees than were allowed to be confirmed by Republicans before July \nduring 1996, the last time an incumbent President was seeking \nreelection. During that session, Senate Republicans did not allow a \nsingle judicial nominee of President Clinton's to be confirmed before \nJuly. During that entire session Republicans allowed only 17 judicial \nnominees to be confirmed, none of them for the circuit courts. During \nthat session when Republicans were in control of the Senate, they made \nsure that none of President Clinton's circuit court nominees were \nconfirmed all session, not a single one. With our fifth judicial \nconfirmation this year, we are well ahead of 1996.\n  Republicans have made no apology for the way in which they acted in \n1996 but seek to employ a double standard now that a Republican \noccupies the White House.\n  All told, Republicans blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. Yet Republicans Senators now routinely claim that \nevery judicial nominee of President Bush is entitled to a confirmation \nvote. Suddenly, without regard to history, including their own very \nrecent history, they claim that the Constitution requires a \nconfirmation vote, at least for Republican nominees. The Constitution \ncertainly does not say that. Republicans seem to have ``confirmation \namnesia'' when they complain that Senate Democrats have filibustered \nsix judicial nominees of President Bush after Republicans defeated by \ndelay 10 times more judicial nominees of President Clinton through \nanonymous holds and without accountability.\n\n  Republicans know that they filibustered Justice Abe Fortas' Supreme \nCourt nomination and several Clinton nominees. Republicans cannot erase \ntheir history, try as they might. Republicans defeated more than 60 \nClinton judicial nominees and more than 200 of his executive branch \nnominees through delay. One judicial nomination was defeated when the \nRepublican caucus took the unprecedented action of voting lockstep \nalong party lines against confirmation of Judge Ronnie White.\n  With the agreement reached today, we are likely to adjourn with fewer \nvacancies than at any time in nearly a quarter of a century, since \nPresident Reagan's first term and well below the level of vacancies \ntolerated by Republicans during President Clinton's two terms. Having \ndefeated more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees, including almost \ntwo dozen circuit court nominees, through concerted inaction, Senate \nRepublicans have no standing to complain about the way in which the \nSenate is acting on President Bush's nominees. We have acted more \nfairly, more quickly and on more nominees than Republicans would allow \nwhen President Clinton was making much more moderate nominations.\n  I am pleased that the White House has promised to refrain from any \nmore abuses of the recess appointment power. With that commitment, we \nhave agreed to vote on two dozen judicial nominees this year. Even with \nthe historically low vacancy levels we will reach as a result, I have \nno doubt that some partisan Republicans will still\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\ncomplain that they did not get 100 percent of their judicial nominees \nconfirmed. Something no President in memory has achieved. This Congress \nwe reached the lowest level of vacancies since 1990. There are more \nfederal judges on the bench now than at any time in U.S. history.\n  Unfortunately, we are faced with continued White House defiance of \nthe Senate's role as part of the checks and balances established by our \nConstitution. President Bush defied the Senate by recess appointing \nWilliam Pryor and Charles Pickering, who were widely opposed due to \ntheir records of activism and poor ethics. No American President has \never abused the recess appointment power to put judges on the bench \nwhose nominations were debated at length by the Senate and on which it \nhad withheld its consent. The President's appointment of Charles \nPickering was unprecedented, yet we noted our objection, turned the \nother cheek and continued to cooperate in the confirmation of judicial \nnominees. When the President abused his power a second time and \nappointed William Pryor, we had no alternative but to make our \nobjection meaningful by seeking assurances from the White House that \nsuch abuse would not happen again.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have shared with the Senate \ninformation about a number of divisive developments regarding judicial \nnominations including the Pickering recess appointment during the \nweekend for commemorating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In spite of all \nthe affronts, Senate Democrats cooperated in confirming four additional \njudicial nominees this year and continued to participate in hearings \nfor judicial nominees.\n  The President's recess appointment of William Pryor was the last \nstraw. It was properly termed an abuse of power by the Senate \nDemocratic Leader. It was an abuse of the constitutional authority of \nthe Executive to make necessary recess appointments during the \nunavailability of the Senate. The judicial recess appointments of \nnominees debated at length by the Senate was unprecedented.\n  Actions like this showed the American people that this White House \nwas determined to try to turn the independent federal judiciary into an \narm of the Republican Party. Doing this further erodes the White \nHouse's credibility as well as the respect and confidence that the \nAmerican people have for the courts.\n  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people \nbut that has chosen time and again to act in ways that divide us, to \ndisrespect the Senate and our representative democracy. This is an \nadministration that squandered the good will and good faith that \nDemocrats showed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. This is an \nadministration that refused to acknowledge the strides we made in \nfilling 100 judicial vacancies under Democratic Senate leadership \nduring 17 difficult months in 2001 and 2002, while overcoming the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the subsequent anthrax attacks and in spite of \nRepublican mistreatment of scores of qualified, moderate judicial \nnominees of President Clinton.\n  This is an administration that has time and time again demonstrated \nits unilateralism, arrogance and intention to divide the American \npeople and the Senate with its controversial judicial nominations. With \nits recess appointments, the President acted--as he has in so many \nareas over the past 3\\1/2\\ years--unilaterally, overextending and \nexpanding his power, with disregard for past practice and tradition, \nand the rule of law.\n  The recess appointment of Mr. Pryor threatens both the independence \nof the judiciary and the constitutional balance of power between the \nlegislative and executive branches. We entrust to the stewardship of \nlifetime judges in our independent Federal judiciary the rights that \nall of us are guaranteed by our Constitution and laws. That is an \nawesome responsibility. Accordingly, the Constitution was designed so \nthat it would only be extended after the President and the Senate \nagreed on the suitability of the nomination. The President chose for \nthe second time in as many months to circumvent this constitutional \ndesign and impose his will unilaterally.\n  I have sought in good faith to work with this administration for the \nlast 3\\1/2\\ years in filling judicial vacancies, including so many left \nopen by Republican obstruction of President Clinton's qualified \nnominees. When Chairman, I made sure that President Bush's nominees \nwere not treated the way his predecessor's had been. They were treated \nfar more fairly, as I had promised. Republicans had averaged only 37 \nconfirmations a year while vacancies rose from 65 to 110 and circuit \nvacancies more than doubled from 16 to 33. Under Democratic leadership, \nwe reversed those trends and opened the system to public accountability \nand debate by making home-State Senators' objections public for the \nfirst time. We openly debated and voted on nominations. We were able to \nconfirm 100 judges in just 17 months and virtually doubled the \nRepublican annual average of 37 with 72 confirmations in 2002, alone.\n  I have urged that we work together, that we cooperate, and that the \nPresident live up to the promise he made to the American people during \nthe last campaign when he said he would act as a uniter and not a \ndivider. I have offered to consult and made sure we explained privately \nand in the public record why this President's most extreme and \ncontroversial nominations were unacceptable.\n\n  Both his recess appointments are troubling. The President says that \nhe wants judges who will ``follow the law'' and complains about what he \ncalls ``judicial activism.'' Yet, he has acted--with disregard for the \nconstitutional balance of powers and the Senate's advice and consent \nauthority--unilaterally to install on the Federal bench two nominees \nfrom whom the Senate withheld its consent precisely because they are \nseen by so many as likely to be judicial activists, who will insert \ntheir personal views in decisions and will not follow the law.\n  In the case of Mr. Pryor, he is among the most extreme and \nideologically committed and opinionated nominees ever sent to the \nSenate. Mr. Pryor's nomination to a lifetime appointment on the Federal \nbench was opposed by every Democratic member on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee after hearings and debate. It was opposed on the Senate floor \nbecause he appears to have extreme--some might say ``radical''--ideas \nabout what the Constitution should provide with regard to federalism, \ncriminal justice and the death penalty, violence against women, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the Government's ability to \nprotect the environment on behalf of the American people. He has been a \ncrusader for the ``federalist'' revolution. He has urged that Federal \nlaws on behalf of the disabled, the aged, women, minorities, and the \nenvironment all be limited. His comments have revealed insensitivity to \nthe barriers that disadvantaged persons and members of minority groups \nand women continue to face in the criminal justice system. He has \ntestified before Congress in support of dropping a crucial part of the \nVoting Rights Act and has repeatedly described the Supreme Court and \ncertain justices in overtly political terms. He received the lowest \npossible qualified rating from the American Bar Association--a partial \nrating of ``Not Qualified''--underscoring his unfitness for the bench. \nIn sum, Mr. Pryor demonstrated that he is committed to an ideological \nagenda that puts corporate interests over the public's interests and \nthat he would roll back the hard-won rights of consumers, minorities, \nwomen, and others.\n  Mr. Pryor's nomination was considered in committee and on the Senate \nfloor. The Senate debated his nomination, and had enough concerns about \nhis fitness for a lifetime appointment that two motions to end debate \non his nomination failed. That is the constitutional right of the \nSenate.\n  But President Bush decided to use the recess appointment clause of \nthe Constitution to end-run the Senate. As far as I know, this power \nhas never been used this way before this President. Of course this is \nthe first President in our Nation's history to renominate someone \nrejected after hearings, debate and a fair vote by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He did that twice. He has now twice overridden the Senate's \nwithholding of its consent after hearings and debate on judicial \nnominees. This demonstrates contempt for the Constitution and the \nSenate. The New York Times editorialized about ``President Bush . . . \nstacking the courts with right-wing judges of dubious judicial \nqualifications'' and even\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nthe Washington Post observed that recess appointments of judges \n``should never be used to mint judges who cannot be confirmed on their \nmerits.''\n  The recess appointments clause of the Constitution was not intended \nto change the balance of power between the Senate and the President \nthat is established as part of the fundamental set of checks and \nbalances in our Government. Indeed, the appointments clause in the \nConstitution requires the consent of the Senate as just such a \nfundamental check on the Executive. This was meant to protect against \nthe ``aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.'' The \nclause was debated at the Constitutional Convention, and the final \nlanguage--with shared power--is intended to be a check upon favoritism \nof the President and prevent the appointment of unfit characters.\n  The President's claimed power to make a unilateral appointment of a \nnominee the Senate considered and effectively rejected, slights the \nFramers' deliberate and considered decision to share the appointing \npower equally between the President and the Senate. This President's \nappointment of Mr. Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit--after he was \nconsidered by the full Senate seems irreconcilable with the original \npurpose of the appointments and recess appointment clauses in the \nConstitution. Perhaps that explains why the Pryor and Pickering recess \nappointments by this President are the first times in our centuries-\nlong history that the recess appointment power has been so abused. No \nother President has engaged in this manner. No other President sought \nsuch unilateral authority without balance from the Senate.\n  The President chose to sully the Martin Luther King Jr. weekend with \nhis unilateral appointment of Judge Pickering. Sadly, he chose the \nPresidents' Day congressional break unilaterally to appoint Mr. Pryor. \nAfter the Presidents' Day weekend, we resumed our proceedings in the \nSenate with the traditional reading of President's George Washington's \nFarewell Address. The Senate proceeds in this way every year. I urge \nthis President and those in his administration to recall the wisdom of \nour first President. George Washington instructs us on the importance \nof not abusing the power each branch is given by the Constitution. He \nurges the three branches of our Government to ``confine themselves \nwithin their respective constitutional spheres.'' He said more than 200 \nyears ago words that ring true to this day:\n\n       The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers \n     of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever \n     the form of government, a real despotism . . . The necessity \n     of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by \n     dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and \n     constituting each the guardian of the public weal against \n     invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \n     ancient and modern. . . To preserve them must be as necessary \n     as to institute them.\n\n  The current occupant of the White House might do well to take this \nwisdom to heart and respect the constitutional allocations of shared \nauthority that have protected our nation and our rights for more than \n200 years so brilliantly and effectively.\n  The recess appointments power was intended as a means to fill \nvacancies when the Senate was not available to give its consent; it was \nintended to ensure effective functioning of the government when the \nSenate adjourned for months at a time. It was never intended as an \nalternative means of appointment by the Executive when the President \nchose to serve some partisan short-term goal by simply overriding the \nwill of the Senate to employ his own--especially with respect to our \nthird branch of Government, the Federal judiciary.\n  This administration and its partisan enablers have demonstrated their \ndisdain for the constitutional system of checks and balances and for \nshared power among the three branches of our Federal Government. By \nsuch actions, this Administration shows that it seeks all power \nconsolidated in the Executive and that it wants a Judiciary that will \nserve its narrow ideological purposes.\n\n  Such overreaching by this administration hurts the courts and the \ncountry. President Bush and his partisans have disrespected the Senate, \nits constitutional role of advice and consent on lifetime appointments \nto the Federal courts, the Federal courts, and the representative \ndemocracy that is so important to the American people. It is indicative \nof the confrontational and ``by any means necessary'' attitude that \nunderlies so many actions by this administration and that created a \nclimate on the Judiciary Committee in which Republican staff felt \njustified in spying upon their counterparts and stealing computer \nfiles.\n  After 8 years in office in which more than 60 judicial nominees had \nbeen stalled from consideration by Republican partisans, President \nClinton made his one and only recess appointment of a judge. Contrast \nthat appointment with the actions of the current President:\n  President Clinton acted to bring diversity to the Fourth Circuit, the \nlast federal circuit court not to have had an African-American member. \nJudge Roger Gregory was subsequently approved by the Senate for a \nlifetime appointment under Democratic Senate leadership in the summer \nof 2001. This was made possible by the steadfast support of Senator \nJohn Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I have commended my \nfriend for his actions in this regard. When Judge Gregory's nomination \nwas finally considered by the Senate, it passed by consensus and with \nonly one negative vote. Senator Lott explained his vote as a protest \nvote against President Clinton's use of the recess appointment power. \nHow ironic then that Judge Pickering now serves based on President \nBush's abuse of that power.\n  Judge Gregory was one of scores of highly qualified judicial \nnominations stalled under Republican Senate leadership. Indeed, Judge \nGregory and so many others were prevented from having a hearing, from \never being considered by the Judiciary Committee and from ever being \nconsidered by the Senate. Sadly, others, such as the nominations of \nBonnie Campbell, Christine Arguello, Allen Snyder, Kent Markus, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, Jorge Rangel, Carlos Moreno, and so many more, \nhave not been reinstated and considered. But President Clinton did not \nabuse his recess appointment power. Instead, his appointment of Judge \nGregory was in keeping with traditional practices and his use of that \npower with respect to judicial appointments was limited to that one \noccasion.\n  By contrast, the current President made two circuit recess \nappointments in 2 months and his White House had threatened that more \nwere on the way. These appointments are from among the most \ncontroversial and contentious nominations this administration has sent \nthe Senate. After reviewing their records and debating at length, the \nSenate withheld its consent. The reasons for opposing these nominations \nwere discussed in hearings and open debate during which the case was \nmade that these nominees were among the handful that a significant \nnumber of Senators determined had not demonstrated their fairness and \nimpartiality to serve of judges.\n  Contrast Roger Gregory's recess appointment, which fit squarely in \nthe tradition of President's exercising such authority in order to \nexpand civil rights and to bring diversity to the courts, with that of \nMr. Pryor. Four of the five first African American appellate judges \nwere recess-appointed to their first Article III position, including \nJudge William Hastie in 1949, Judge Thurgood Marshall in 1961, Judge \nSpottswood Robinson in 1961, and Judge Leon Higginbotham in 1964. The \nrecent appoints of Judge Pickering and Mr. Pryor stand in sharp \ncontrast to these outstanding nominees and the public purposes served \nby their appointments.\n  The nominations of Judge Pickering and Mr. Pryor were opposed by \nindividuals, organizations and editorial pages across the Nation. \nOrganizations and individuals concerned about justice before the \nFederal courts, such as Log Cabin Republicans, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, and many others opposed the Pryor \nnomination. The opposition extended to include organizations that \nrarely take positions on nominations but felt so strongly about Mr. \nPryor that they were compelled to lodge their opposition in the record, \nsuch as the National Senior Citizens Law Center, Anti-Defamation \nLeague, and Sierra Club. Rather than bring people together and move the\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\ncountry forward, this President's recess appointments are more examples \nof unnecessarily divisive action.\n  Further, the legality of this President's use of the recess \nappointments power, without precedent and during such a short Senate \nbreak, is itself now a source of division and dispute. Recent Attorneys \nGeneral have all opined that a recess of 10 days or less does not \njustify the President's use of the recess appointments power and would \nbe considered unconstitutional. Starting in 1921, Attorney General \nDaugherty advised the President that he could make recess appointments \nduring a mid-session adjournment of approximately four weeks but two \ndays was not sufficient ``nor do I think an adjournment for five or \neven 10 days can be said to constitute the recess intended by the \nConstitution.'' More recently, a memo from the Reagan administration \nJustice Department concluded: ``Under no circumstances should the \nPresident attempt to make recess appointment during intrasession recess \nof less than 10 days.'' This year, a Federalist Society paper noted the \ndubious constitutionality of appointments during short intrasession \nbreaks.\n  We will not resolve the question of legality of these recess \nappointments here today, but we can all anticipate challenges to \nrulings in which Mr. Pryor participates. Thus, we can expect this \naudacious action by the administration will serve to spawn litigation \nand uncertainty for months and years to come.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for the statements he made and the \nactions that he took in connection with the abuse of the recess \nappointment power by this President. I remind the Senate that a few \nyears ago when President Clinton used his recess appointment power with \nregard to a short-term Executive appointment of James Hormel to serve \nas Ambassador to Luxembourg, Senator Inhofe responded by saying that \nPresident Clinton had ``shown contempt for Congress and the \nConstitution'' and declared that he would place ``holds on every single \nPresidential nomination.'' Republicans continued to block nominations \nuntil President Clinton agreed to make recess appointments only after \nCongress was notified in advance. On November 10, 1999, 17 Republican \nSenators sent a letter to President Clinton telling him that if he \nviolated the agreement, they would ``put holds for the remaining of the \nterm of your Presidency on all of the judicial nominees.''\n  In November 1999, President Clinton sent a list of 13 positions to \nthe Senate that he planned to fill through recess appointments. In \nresponse, Senator Inhofe denounced 5 of the 13 civilian nominees with a \nthreat that if they went forward, he would personally place a hold on \nevery one of President Clinton's judicial nominees for the remainder of \nhis term. That led to more delays and to the need for a floor vote on a \nmotion to proceed to consider the next judicial nomination, in order to \noverride Republican objections.\n\n  When President Clinton appointed Judge Gregory at the end of 2000, \nSenator Inhofe called it ``outrageously inappropriate for any president \nto fill a federal judgeship through a recess appointment in a \ndeliberate way to bypass the Senate.'' When the Gregory nomination was \nconfirmed with near unanimity under Senate Democratic leadership in \n2001, Senator Lott's spokesperson indicated that Senator Lott's \nsolitary opposition was to underscore his position that ``any \nappointment of federal judges during a recess should be opposed.''\n  Democrats have been measured in our response. Indeed, we continued \nour work after the unprecedented recess appointment of Judge Pickering. \nIt was only with the repeated abuse of the recess appointment power to \nplace Mr. Pryor on the Federal bench and the threat of additional \nrecess appointments that we acted. I urged the White House to renounce \nthis abuse of the recess appointment power so that we could resume \nSenate consideration of judicial nominations and increase our record \nnumber of confirmations before the end of the year. I am glad that the \nWhite House has finally decided to make a firm commitment against any \nadditional judicial recess appointments.\n  We are defending fair courts. We have acted to protect the Senate's \nrole as a check on excessive White House power grabs and to block the \nlifetime appointments of a handful of nominees for lifetime seats, \nnominees who have records of extremism. The American people deserve a \nFederal judiciary with fair judges who will enforce their rights and \nuphold the law. Rather than work with all Senators, the White House has \nfixated on forcing through the most divisive people for these lifetime \njobs. This White House has the wrong priorities and is taking the \ncountry in the wrong direction.\n  President Bush ran as a ``uniter'' but has consciously chosen to send \ndivisive nominees to the Senate. As a Presidential candidate, Bush \npromised the American people he would have ``no litmus test'' for \nFederal judges on reproductive rights ``or any other issue'' and that \nhe would choose ``competent judges'' who would ``not use the bench for \nwriting social policy.'' As President, he has broken these and other \npromises repeatedly.\n  President Bush's choices for the only lifetime jobs in our system of \nGovernment show that he views the Federal courts as a spoils system for \npartisan activists, including some whose records prove that they will \nnot be fair and impartial judges, but would use the Federal bench to \nwrite social policies they prefer into the law. Under our Constitution, \nthe power to make lifetime appointments to the courts is shared: the \nPresident has the power to nominate or propose judges, but only the \nSenate has the power to confirm or reject those nominations. Throughout \nAmerican history, the Senate has rejected judicial nominees. Not even \nPresident Washington saw all of his nominees confirmed. Senate \nDemocrats have opposed only the most troubling judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush.\n  In his judicial appointments, President Bush has sought out judicial \nactivists, often quite young, with the hope that these judges will rule \nfor decades to come in ways that advance the Republican Party's narrow \nand partisan political and social agenda. President Bush has proposed \nmany nominees to the federal courts, especially the appellate courts, \nwho have records of extreme partisanship, activism or just plain poor \nethics.\n  For example, President Bush nominated 41-year-old William Pryor for \nthe appeals court after Mr. Pryor led the effort to undermine \nprotections against age, sex and disability discrimination, to limit \nthe reach of the Clean Water Act, to repeal the Voting Rights Act, to \noverturn Roe v. Wade, and to oppose lawsuits for tobacco-related deaths \nand illnesses. Mr. Pryor himself believes that President Bush should \nnot appoint moderate judges to the federal courts, stating: ``I'm \nprobably the only one who wanted [Bush v. Gore] 5-4.'' He said, ``I \nwanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary and \njudicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice \nSouter.''\n  Justice Souter's apparent ``offense'' was to be more faithful to the \nConstitution than to the partisan politics of the party of the \nPresident who nominated him to the highest court. Mr. Pryor was \nrejected under the Senate's longstanding Rules after extensive debate. \nBut President Bush put him on the bench anyway. He is now sitting on \nthe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit temporarily.\n  President Bush also appointed Judge Charles Pickering to the appeals \ncourt even though the Senate refused consent to his nomination. Judge \nPickering was opposed due to the low quality of his judging, his habit \nof inserting his personal views into his decisions, and his \nquestionable ethics. Judge Pickering willfully violated judicial ethics \nby his extraordinary campaign to get around a mandatory prison sentence \nfor a man convicted by a jury of his peers of burning a cross on an \ninterracial couple's lawn. His record was criticized by civil rights \nleaders and organizations. Numerous African Americans in Mississippi \nand from across the country wrote in opposition to his nomination. \nPresident Bush recess appointed him to the Fifth Circuit on the weekend \ndesignated to honor the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n  President Bush also nominated to the D.C. Circuit Justice Janice \nRogers Brown of California who has a reputation for injecting her \npolitical views into her judicial opinions. In speeches and decisions, \nshe literally advocated turning back the clock 100 years to the\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nera when worker protections were declared unconstitutional by activist \njudges. Justice Brown has even described the year 1937--when her brand \nof judicial activism was repudiated--as ``the triumph of our own \nsocialist revolution.'' Her views are so extreme and rigid she has \nsuggested: ``There are so few true conservatives left in America that \nwe probably should be included on the endangered species list.'' The \nSenate refused to grant consent to her nomination at the end of the 40-\nhour talkathon Republicans engineered to shut down the Senate last \nyear.\n  President Bush also selected State Judge Carolyn Kuhl for an \nappellate judgeship after she spearheaded a failed effort to give tax-\nexempt status to racially discriminatory schools like Bob Jones \nUniversity, led the effort to get the Reagan Justice Department to seek \nthe reversal of Roe v. Wade, sought to curtail discrimination laws, and \ntried to limit protections for     whistleblowers. Before she was \nnominated to the Federal bench, Judge Kuhl also ruled in a case that a \nbreast cancer patient had no privacy claims against a doctor who \nallowed a drug salesman to watch her breast examination without her \npermission. Both California Senators opposed Judge Kuhl's nomination \nand the Senate withheld its consent.\n  Additionally, President Bush chose Texas Supreme Court Justice \nPriscilla Owen for the federal bench after statements by her fellow \njudges in a wide range of cases--from environmental regulation to \npersonal injury law to privacy to discrimination--that she was \ninjecting her personal views into her opinions. Her opinions were \ncalled, among other things, ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric'' \nand an approach that ``defies the Legislature's clear and express \nlimits on our jurisdiction.'' One opinion in which she tried to write \nher preferred social policies into law was called ``an unconscionable \nact of judicial activism'' by then Justice Alberto Gonzales, who is now \nPresident Bush's White House Counsel. The Senate withheld its consent \nfrom her nomination after extensive debate.\n\n  The nomination of Miguel Estrada, who was 39 when nominated to the \nnation's second highest court, is another example of President Bush's \npractice of dividing instead of uniting Americans. Despite concerns \nthat were raised whether Mr. Estrada could keep his personal views out \nof his legal work at the Justice Department and the ample precedent for \nthe Senate's request for legal memos in nominations. President Bush \ndecided to stonewall the Senate. This stonewalling, combined with Mr. \nEstrada's refusal to answer numerous questions about his views prompted \nthe extended debate that led to his withdrawal.\n  Currently pending are William James Haynes, II and Brett Kavanaugh. \nMr. Haynes has been less than forthcoming about his actions as the \ngeneral counsel at the Department of Defense and his role in subverting \nlegal protections in ways that may have contributed to the breakdown of \ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions, our treaties against torture \nand the Constitution. Mr. Kavanaugh is another youthful nominee whose \nbackground as an aide to Kenneth Starr and in the White House is among \nthe more partisan we have seen, even among this President's very \npartisan nominees.\n  For doing their job and upholding their constitutional \nresponsibilities, Democratic Senators have been wrongly attacked as \nanti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti-Christian and anti-Catholic. Those \ncharges are reprehensible, ad hominem attacks without basis. This is \npartisan sniping at its worst. Republican Senators have been all too \nwilling to fuel such baseless claims and the President has shown his \nwillingness to play partisan politics with judicial nominations.\n  Some of this President's appointments have already started using \ntheir seat on the Federal bench to write their political, social or \ncultural views into law, despite promises that they would not do so. We \nare now seeing the impact of the Bush judges the Senate has confirmed \nin courts all over the country where a radically narrow view of the \npower of Congress, informed by a Federalist Society philosophy, is \nbeginning to take hold. Let me give you a few examples of the ways in \nwhich these judges are attempting to remake the legal landscape in \ntheir own reactionary ideological image.\n  Judge Jeffrey Sutton has written a dissent in a federal arson case \nputting forward a distressingly narrow interpretation of Congress' \npower under the Commerce Clause. Judge Sutton was an extremely \ncontroversial Bush nominee who promised the Senate that he would not \nhave an agenda on the bench to narrow congressional power and he was \nconfirmed by one of the smallest number and proportion of positive \nvotes in history, 52-41.\n  Judge John Roberts, another controversial nominee of President Bush, \nhas questioned the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act \nunder a similar theory, showing his willingness to curtail Congress's \nability to protect the environment. He has also ruled for the \nadministration in the ongoing case seeking more transparency and \naccountability from Vice President Cheney and his Energy Task Force.\n  Judge Edith Clement of the Fifth Circuit, another Bush circuit court \nnominee, has also showed her Federalist bent by voting to limit the \nHobbs Act, also under the reasoning that Congress' ability to legislate \nunder the Commerce Clause is more narrow than legal precedent actually \nshows. Other Bush judges have taken extreme positions and been \ncriticized by their peers, often other conservatives, for overstepping \nbounds or substituting their views for the trial court's. Their tenure \non the federal bench has so far been short, but even these few examples \nshow that as it lengthens, the number of ideological opinions will \ngrow.\n  While Democrats have not imposed ideological litmus tests on the Bush \nnominees, it is clear that President Bush has. President Bush has named \nto the bench many who have been leaders in the right-to-life movement \nand none who have been leaders on the other side of that social issue. \nThe President has sought out people he hopes share his social agenda \nfor our Federal courts.\n  President Bush has also used federal judgeships to reward lawyers who \nworked closely with Ken Starr or on the Florida recount, including some \nfor lifetime seats who were as young as 34 years old. Many of his \nnominees have been drawn from a select group of neoconservatives whose \nviews are surprisingly rigid given their youth. Indeed, more than half \nof President Bush's circuit court nominees have been involved with the \nFederalist Society and overall almost a quarter of all of his judicial \nnominees have been associated with this organization whose mission is \nto ``reorder the legal priorities'' along ideological lines. In fact, \nPresident Bush has chosen more judicial nominees involved in the \nFederalist Society than nominees who are Hispanic, African American or \nAsian Pacific combined.\n  No one is entitled to a lifetime job as a judge, entrusted with \nmaking decisions that affect the lives, liberties and property of \nmillions of Americans. I will continue to oppose judicial nominees who \nI do not think will be fair, independent Federal judges. We are \ncommitted to defending the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to \nensuring that our Federal courts have fair judges who will be faithful \nto the Constitution and its precedents, not loyal to the partisan \npolitical agenda of President Bush. The fairness of the Federal \njudiciary is indivisible from our American ideal of justice for all.\n  Whether Congress may regulate lead in our water, whether we can \nprovide leave for families during medical crises, and whether \nfundamental protections for our liberty, equality and privacy will be \npreserved, all these matters will be reviewed and decided by Federal \njudges. Our freedoms are the fruit of too much sacrifice to confirm \nthose who will not fully enforce Federal protections.\n  It is imperative that there be fair judges for all people--poor or \nrich, Republican or Democrat, of any race or religion. A number of \nPresident Bush's nominees have records that do not demonstrate that \nthey will be impartial. Democrats have refused to rubber-stamp judicial \nactivists. We know that the Federal courts should not be an arm of the \nRepublican Party.\n  There are any number of issues and bills that the Senate could and \nshould be addressing instead of arguing over cloture petitions for \njudicial nominees. Judicial vacancies is about the only number going in \nthe right direction.\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\nWith the deficit up, the debt up, the numbers of uninsured, unemployed \nand impoverished Americans up, but the number of Federal court \nvacancies going down, the Senate has much more to do.\n  Of course, April 15 was the legal deadline for adoption of a Federal \nbudget. Even though Republicans have excluded congressional Democrats \nfrom the discussion, they have not been able to agree even among \nthemselves on the Federal budget resolution. That statutory requirement \nis being violated daily.\n\n  The transportation bill is long overdue. Again, it is Republicans who \ncannot agree on a transportation bill that will fix our roads, bridges \nand provide for public transportation. That bill would mean hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to our local communities and States all across the \ncountry.\n  A supposed priority this year was going to be welfare legislation. \nRepublicans have not agreed on a welfare reform extension.\n  We have no legislation to confront the soaring gas prices that affect \nall Americans, nor will the Republican leadership schedule action on \nthe bipartisan NOPEC bill that was unanimously reported by the \nJudiciary Committee to clarify that OPEC cannot act collusively with \nimpunity from the law.\n  This week we mark the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark decision of the \nUnited States Supreme Court. It offered African-Americans throughout \nour Nation hope that the Government of the United States was prepared \nto make real Jefferson's declaration that ``all men are created \nequal.'' It made good on Justice Harlan's famous words of dissent in \nPlessy v. Ferguson: ``In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the \nlaw, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of \ncitizens. There is no caste here.''\n  Of course, the decision in Brown was not universally celebrated at \nthe time. It was condemned from some quarters and sparked defiance in \nmany parts of this nation. It was the beginning, not the end, of a long \nprocess of desegregation that was fought vigorously in many \ncommunities. Even today, 50 years later, there is still significant \nwork to be done to ensure equal educational opportunity for all of our \nchildren. Schools in our cities are all too often in disrepair, both \nphysically and in the quality of education they can offer to the most \nvulnerable children among us.\n  As we commemorate Brown, we must also note that the Republican \nCongress has funded Title I--the Federal program most directly targeted \ntoward those schools and toward reducing educational inequality--at \n$6.3 billion below its authorized level for the current year.\n  We should celebrate the brave families who desegregated our schools, \nand the accomplished lawyers, including Thurgood Marshall, who led the \nfight. We should commemorate the nine Justices who were unanimous in \ntheir dedication to the constitutional principle of equality. And we \nshould remember the many leaders who have continued the battle for \njustice in the decades since.\n  This anniversary should not be the cause of complacency or self-\ncongratulation--our work is not done. There is much else we could be \ndoing--but are not--in the area of civil rights. The Voting Rights Act \nis slated to expire in 2007, and the Majority Leader and the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee have said they want to make its key \nprovisions permanent. I have said that I support this goal and want to \nmake sure we achieve it in the way most likely to survive an inevitable \nconstitutional challenge before a Supreme Court that shows little \ndeference to Acts of Congress. Senator Kennedy and I have both said we \nwant to work with Senators Frist and Hatch to begin committee \nconsideration of the Voting Rights Act and build the legislative \nhistory that would justify making it permanent to the judicial branch. \nUp until now, we have received no response.\n  We have been fighting now for many years to pass hate crimes \nlegislation that would both improve our existing hate crimes laws and \napply them against criminals who target gay and lesbian Americans. I am \none of 49 cosponsors of S. 966, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct. This bill has passed the Senate before, only to be blocked by the \nRepublican leadership in the House. In recent years, however, we have \nbeen unable to get the Senate to adopt it. In the last Congress, almost \nevery Republican Senator voted against cloture on the hate crimes bill, \ndooming it to failure. In the current Congress, we have not considered \nthe bill.\n  Meanwhile, the bipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act \n(``ENDA'') of 2003 (S. 1705) is bottled up in the HELP Committee. This \nbill has 43 cosponsors. It would prohibit workplace discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation. One might think that opposing firing \npeople simply because they are gay is a rather commonplace position in \n2004. In the Senate, however, we cannot get a vote on ENDA.\n  The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (``DREAM \nAct'') S. 1545, continues to languish on the Senate calendar. This is a \nbill that the Judiciary Committee approved last November. It has 46 \ncosponsors, including a dozen Republicans. Its lead sponsors are \nSenator Hatch and Senator Durbin. It would restore to States the right \nto provide in-state tuition to undocumented aliens who graduate from \nU.S. high schools.\n  The beneficiaries would be young people who came here as children, \nnot of their own volition. They would be people like Jazmin Segura, a \nLos Angeles high school senior from a high-crime neighborhood with a \n3.88 GPA. Ms. Segura, who came to the United States from Mexico when \nshe was nine years old, was featured in a Wall Street Journal article \nlast month. She had been accepted at the University of California at \nBerkeley and at UCLA, but did not know whether she would be able to \nafford to go.\n  We have legislation at the ready that could help Ms. Segura and many \nothers like her. If we held a vote on this bill right now, it would \nundoubtedly pass by a wide margin. But the Republican leadership--eager \nto reach out only rhetorically to the Hispanic community--has refused \nto bring it up for a vote.\n  I came to the floor nearly two weeks ago to decry the Senate's \nfailure to consider legislation to respond to a crisis affecting \nindustries throughout the economy that depend on temporary labor. More \nthan 2 months ago the Department of Homeland Security announced that \nfor the first time ever the annual cap for H-2B visas had been met. \nThese visas are used by a wide range of industries throughout the \nnation to fill temporary labor needs. In my home State of Vermont, they \nare used primarily by the tourist industry.\n  In response to this announcement, I joined with a substantial \nbipartisan coalition in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of \n2004. Senator Kennedy is the lead sponsor of this bipartisan bill, \nwhich has 18 cosponsors, including 8 Republicans. Our bill would add \n40,000 visas for the current fiscal year, providing relief to those \nsummer-oriented businesses that had never even had the opportunity to \napply for visas. Senator Hatch introduced a competing bill sponsored \nonly by Republicans, S. 2258. I do not think that bill is as good as \nour bipartisan bill, but it is certainly better than nothing. \nUnfortunately, a small minority of the Republican caucus has demanded \nwe do nothing, and the Republican leadership has acceded to that \ndemand. Either the Save Summer Act of Senator Hatch's bill would \ncommand the support of an overwhelming majority of Senators, but the \nmajority leader has brought neither forward for a vote.\n  When it comes to immigration, the Republican leadership has ignored \nnot only the concerns of the tourism industry and other businesses that \ndepend on temporary summer workers, but even to the needs of farmers. \nSenators Craig and Kennedy joined together in introducing S. 1645, the \nAgricultural Job, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act. This bill \nhas 62 cosponsors, including 25 Republicans. It would solve problems in \nthe H-2A program that have plagued American farmers for years, while \nalso providing a path to legalization for farm workers who have been \nworking here illegally for years. It has the vociferous support of both \nfarmers and farm workers; it is indeed an example of the sort of \ncompromise legislation that used to be a\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\nhallmark of this body. But we cannot get a vote on this bill.\n  So while the Republican leadership has devoted time last week and \nthis to an impasse over judicial nominees caused by the President's \nabuse of the recess appointment power, we have seen little effort to \nwork on matters of significance that can and should be considered and \nacted upon by the Senate to make bipartisan progress for all Americans.\n  While we celebrate progress today on judicial nomination, I hope that \nwe will also soon see progress on these legislative matters. Through \nbipartisan action we can do much to serve the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5582-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5582-S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is the pending business amendment No. 3158?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is right. That amendment is \npending.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have confirmed with Senator Snowe and \nSenator Lott that they would permit me to set their amendments aside \nfor 3 minutes so that I could offer a nonproliferation amendment. I ask \nthe Senate for that privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending amendment will be set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nask consent my amendment be in order, as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, do we have the amendment? \nHave the managers had a chance to view that? I don't know that there is \na problem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is report language. All I want to do is have the same \nkind of courtesies. If I could ask, then, at least it be considered \nafter the floor managers have an opportunity to review the amendment.\n  If there is an objection, that would be satisfactory with me. But it \nis relevant. Otherwise, I will insist on the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nintend to, I don't even believe it is my role, I don't know that anyone \nhas had a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was waiting for my time. You were next to offer your \namendment and were going to take 90 minutes. I was prepared to remain \nhere and, hopefully, we are alternating amendments. This is directly \ngermane. My good friend from New Mexico offered his amendment and asked \nfor consent to do it. I was trying to get the same courtesies.\n  I am glad to play by whatever rules the Senator wants to play by, but \nif we are waiting our turn to get here and someone asks consent to be \nable to advance their amendment, all I am asking is to get the same \nkind of consideration. That is the only thing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent agreement to \nset aside an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). To dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Has there been an agreement to set the pending amendment \naside to offer this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, there has been.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, Mr. President, if that question was put to the \nSenate, I certainly did not hear it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I made the request and the Lott amendment was pending \nand I asked it be set aside for 3 minutes so I could offer an \namendment. That was granted.\n  Mr. REID. I heard the Senator from New Mexico. I thought he said \nthere had been an agreement to that effect. If you check the record, \nthat is what it said.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I said, and I ask the Senate grant me that \nprivilege, after I made that statement to which you are referring.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the same privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from----\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, might I suggest, and I ask \nmy good friend--and the Senator knows I will support him--could you \nwithdraw that at this time so Senator Levin and I, together with the \nleaders, can determine the order in which we will take amendments?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw my request, in courtesy to my friend from New \nMexico.\n  I ask consent that I be recognized to offer an amendment at the \nconclusion of the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts in \nhis typical courteous manner for the way he has handled it. I know the \nmanagers will work with him.\n  Mr. REID. So the consent now before the body is, following the \ndisposition of the pending amendment--that is, the amendment of the \nSenators from Mississippi and North Dakota--Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized to offer his amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to object. I fervently asked that the two managers \nwork with our respective leadership and those desiring to bring up \namendments. So I suggest that we continue with the Lott amendment and \nyou be ever so kind to hold yours in abeyance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They have already agreed on mine and it will take 3 \nminutes. I don't doubt that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. There has been no agreement on the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What?\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand, Senator Domenici--and I was distracted--\nasked he be allowed to offer the amendment. As I understand it, there \nhas been no agreement to the amendment, the time agreement on the \namendment. The manager is asking the Senator from New Mexico would he \nnow withhold that amendment so we can sort this out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, and I ask that we pursue the opportunity \nto have a time agreement on the Lott-Dorgan amendment.\n  First, I ask the distinguished Senator from Mississippi how much time \nthe Senator desires--and we will talk about it in terms of it being \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have talked back and forth and we think \nthat 45 minutes a side should be sufficient.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. An hour and a half equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Forth-five minutes to the side?\n  Mr. LOTT. An hour and a half equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, we want to keep moving with this bill. It seems to \nme the subject is pretty well understood. I was hoping maybe an hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, we do have Senators who \nhave not been heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Very well, I am agreeable if the----\n  Mr. LOTT. If we have time and we do not need it all, we can always \nyield it back--an idea I like.\n  Mr. WARNER. This issue has an intensity of its own.\n  If an hour and a half is agreeable to the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senators would be willing to modify \ntheir amendment, it is my understanding following the hour and a half \nthat there would be a vote on or in relation to that amendment with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that be part of the consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the original consent is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein have\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\nbeen patiently waiting, Senator Cochran wishes to speak, as well as \nSenator Dorgan.\n  Would the Senator from New Hampshire have a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to get 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator be willing to withhold so we can proceed \nwith the Senator from Maine?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly, unless the Senator from Maine----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3158\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment that has been offered by Senator Dorgan, Senator Lott, \nSenator Feinstein, and myself to refocus the provisions that are \nincluded in the underlying legislation that authorizes a base closure \nround in 2005 from our domestic installation to our overseas military \ninfrastructure.\n  I do so because I am firmly convinced today in this unprecedented era \nof global war on terrorism, as we continue operations in Afghanistan to \nroot out the seeds of terror, as we are engaged in ensuring a free Iraq \nin the heart of the Middle East, it makes no sense to consider closing \nnearly a quarter of our domestic military infrastructure in addition to \nthe 21 percent that has already been lost over the past 15 years in \nAmerica.\n  I arrive at this debate as a veteran of a number of issues that are \nkey to our deliberations. First, I have been all too intimately \nacquainted with every base closure round since the first occurred in \n1987, as well as the accompanying pitfalls, failures, and foibles of \neach--and there are many.\n  Also, in my capacity of both the House and the Senate, as ranking \nmember of the Operations Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee \nof the House that oversaw terrorism and in my position in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and former Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee.\n\n  I cannot and will not ignore the pattern I have discerned of the \nfailure to ``connect'' the critical ``dots'' in the past, and the \nimplications of these shortfalls on our ability to project into the \nfuture.\n  What most concerns me is the inadequacy of the military's threat \nassessment projections time after time accompanying the requirement, \nincluding enacting BRAC legislation in 1991 that stipulates the \nSecretary of Defense ``shall include a force structure plan for the \nArmed Forces based on an assessment by the Secretary of the probable \nthreats to the national security during the six-year period beginning \nwith the fiscal year for which the budget request is made.''\n  It is very important to understand the requirements and the \nobligations of the Defense Department. They have to make those \nprojections. Unfortunately, whether they make those projections 20 \nyears into the future or 6-year projections, the track record has been \npoor.\n  I can say this because I have reviewed the military threat \nassessments not only contained in the force structure plans the \nDepartment provided, along with their justifications for the 1991 base-\nclosing round, but also the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, as well as other \nkey assessments made by the Department during that time, such as the \n1993 Bottom-Up Review, the 1997 Quadrennial Review, and the 2001 \nQuadrennial Review.\n  Specifically, I wondered how actual events and results matched their \nexpectations. How did their threat assessments dovetail with the new \nrealities, such as terrorism, asymmetric threat, and homeland security \nor homeland defense?\n  I then went back a little more than 21 years ago to the bombing of \nthe U.S. Embassy in Beirut, and looked at significant terrorist events \ndirected against Americans throughout the world, as chronicled by the \nState Department. I put it on this chart because I think it is \nimportant to recall exactly what the events have been over the last 20 \nyears with respect to terrorism.\n  A defining moment in 1983 was when our marines were under attack, \nwhen 242 brave marines were lost because of a suicide bomber.\n  In 1985, TWA flight 847 was hijacked, and U.S. Navy diver Robert \nStethem was killed. Then, of course, we had the Achille Lauro. Then we \nhad, of course, the Berlin disco that was bombed, and a number of \nAmerican soldiers were killed or injured. We also know what happened \nwith Pan Am flight 103 that was destroyed over Lockerbie.\n  These are a few of the significant events that occurred throughout \nthe 1980s. In fact, I am illustrating only a few of the 17 events that \nwere identified by the State Department where Americans were the target \nof terrorists.\n  Yet, after all these events, let's look at what was identified in \nthese base-closing reports that are required under the legislation. We \nhad a four-page report that was a result of the 1991 base-closing \nround, and they submitted a military assessment for the years, because \nthey have to project out. In this case, it was 1992 to 1997. What did \nit have to say?\n\n       The most enduring concern for U.S. leadership is that the \n     Soviet Union remains the one country in the world capable \n     of destroying the U.S. with a single devastating attack. . \n     . .\n       [T]he Soviet state still will have millions of well armed \n     men in uniform and will remain the strongest military force \n     on the Eurasian landmass.\n\n  But when it came to terrorism, they said: Our efforts to promote \nregional stability and to enhance the spread of democracy will continue \nto be challenged by insurgencies and terrorism.\n  So there was only a passing mention of this issue as an impediment to \nregional stability and the enhancement of democracy worldwide. But \nthere was no discussion of it as a context, as a threat to the United \nStates. There was no mention, as you can see, of it as an asymmetric \nthreat or as a threat to our homeland security. And then what happened?\n  On February 26, 1993, we had the bombing of the World Trade Center. \nIt was badly damaged, and 1,000 people were injured, leaving 6 people \ndead. Yet the military threat assessment, issued less than 1 month \nlater--it would have been a matter of weeks later--in the 1993 base-\nclosing round report again referred to the regional crises with North \nand South Korea, India and Pakistan, the Middle East, and Persian Gulf \nStates. It went on to say:\n\n       [T]he future world military situation will be characterized \n     by regional actors with modern destructive weaponry, \n     including chemical and biological weapons, modern ballistic \n     missiles and, in some cases, nuclear weapons.\n\n  But note in this report there was suddenly, once again, no mention of \nterrorism after the World Trade Center bombing less than a few weeks \nlater, maybe a month. And as to an asymmetric threat? Nothing. And \nhomeland security? No reference whatsoever to homeland security.\n  Furthermore, the bottom-up review that occurs within the Defense \nDepartment, which is a wide-ranging review of strategy, resources, and \nprograms to delineate our national defense strategy for the future, \nthat was signed out in October of 1993--and, of course, that was about \n8 months later--described four new dangers to U.S. interests after the \nend of the cold war. Again, no mention of particular asymmetric \nthreats, homeland security, or anything with respect to terrorism. Even \nat that point, they did mention state-sponsored terrorism as a \nreference, but, again, they stated the World Trade Center bombing in \n1993 was the result of the mastermind Sheikh Omar Rahman, who was a \nnon-state-sponsored terrorist.\n  But, as you can see, in 1993, then, we had two Defense Department \nreports, one in response to the requirements under the base-closing \nprocess, and the second one was a bottom-up review by the Defense \nDepartment within the same year, having the foreknowledge of what \nhappened and what transpired at the World Trade Center, and nothing was \nreferenced with respect to terrorism, asymmetric threat, or homeland \nsecurity.\n  The timeline continues to 1995. We have the Tokyo subway with the \nsarin gas. Ironically, that is sarin gas equivalent to what was \ndiscovered in Iraq last week. I was stunned then to look at what \nhappened in the 1995 force structure report that was also required in \nresponse to the base closure round of 1995 that had to address the \nthreats between 1995 and 2001. Other than the removal of a few \nsentences, it was exactly identical, the same as the 1993 \n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nBRAC threat assessment. So much for rigorous analysis. Still there was \nno mention of terrorism, no mention of asymmetric threat, and no \nreferences to homeland security. And this is less--less--than 6 years \nbefore September 11, when we had those catastrophic and devastating \nevents.\n\n  Remember, this particular base closure round is required to project \nout 20 years. So now we are referring to a base-closing force structure \nplan in 1995, given all the preceding events of terrorism in which \nAmericans were victims and a target, and there was no identification of \nterrorism being a major threat to the United States, or that there was \nan asymmetric threat, or that there was a threat to our homeland \nsecurity. This was 6 years out.\n  After the 1995 report, we go to 1996. We have Khobar Towers. We have \nthe East Africa Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Then, of course, we \nhave the USS Cole in the year 2000. Again, we do not have any \nidentification that we are now being threatened, in these base-closing \nforce structure plans, in our homeland security, or by the threat of \nworldwide terrorism.\n  By 1997, the Department was acknowledging the fact terrorists using \nasymmetric means might attack the homeland. Again, I might add, yet it \nstill remained a fourth-tier concern in their Quadrennial Defense \nReview--a fourth-tier concern--in spite of the continuing onslaught of \nterrorism around the world.\n  Then, of course, we have all the preceding events. So this, in my \nopinion, raises some serious concerns about the ability of the Defense \nDepartment to project into the future, and particularly when talking \nabout projecting 20 years out.\n  I happened to review the Quadrennial Defense Review report issued in \n2001. Mind you, that was issued 19 days after the attack of the World \nTrade Center on September 11, and it obviously identified that we were \nbeing challenged by adversaries who possessed a wide range of \ncapabilities regarding asymmetric approaches. Obviously, at that point \nit was not an astute observation. But interestingly, in examining the \nQDR, there was a lack of mentioning al-Qaida by name--not once. In the \n70-page report, there is not one mention of al-Qaida, when we are \ntalking about 19 days after the events at the World Trade Center on \nSeptember 11.\n  I think this all indicates the significant dose of skepticism with \nwhich we should examine the current force structure plan and the \naccompanying threat assessment submitted by the Department to justify \nthe base-closing rounds of 2005. Considering that we now base decisions \non a 20-year assessment--never mind just 6, and even the 6-year \nprojections proved spotty at best--and considering the volatile times \nin which we live, I have to say that what we received, over a month \nlater than was required by the base-closing legislation--and I might \nadd it is about what we expected, not much--indeed, my sense is they \ntook these assumptions that were made for the Future Year Defense Plan \nthat the Department submits as part of their overall budget \nauthorization and simply extended it to 2009.\n  But even after 20 years of constant assault, of terrorism on \nAmericans either here or abroad, the Defense Department still has not \nmatched its force structure with those assumptions. Indeed, they have \navoided the entire issue of these threats that the Nation will face \nover the next 20 years by claiming that today's security environment \n``is impossible to predict with any confidence which nations, \ncombination of nations, or non-state actors may threaten U.S. interests \nat home and abroad.''\n  And when the Department claims they have adopted an approach to force \ndevelopment based on capabilities rather than threat-based requirements \nand will need a flexible, adaptive, and joint capability that can \noperate across the full spectrum of military contingencies, exactly \nwhat does that mean? That is a very good question. What does that mean? \nClearly, it indicates an uncertainty upon which we should be \nconsidering closing military bases.\n  It is obvious that the Defense Department is not certain, and this is \nnot the basis upon which we can make decisions that are irreversible \nwhen it comes to our military infrastructure. Indeed, a retired Navy \ncaptain, Ralph Dean, succinctly placed a column in a Maine newspaper \nwhere he said:\n\n       Surprisingly it showed--\n\n  In reference to this force structure plan that was recently submitted \nby the Defense Department--\n\n     virtually no changes in overall force structure during that \n     long period. This may indicate the Department of Defense is \n     unable to make projections about the future threat with any \n     degree of certainty. This uncertainty must be addressed, \n     because BRAC actions are irreversible.\n\n  Exactly. And therein lies the problem. We are required to make \ndecisions on force structure, on threat assessments based on plans that \nare submitted to the Congress and to the base-closing commission. We \nare going to make permanent decisions. We cannot retreat from those \ndecisions once they are made. You cannot retract those decisions once \nthey are put in motion.\n  Let's look at the overall picture in the context of the threat \nenvironment in which we live today. How can we possibly project out 20 \nyears to ascertain our military requirements? We are learning in Iraq \nthat the quantity of troops matters, as DOD is forced to recalibrate \nand send an additional 20,000 troops there. Moreover, this underlying \nlegislation, the Department of Defense reauthorization legislation we \nare currently considering, is actually increasing the Army's end \nstrength of more than 30,000 soldiers. Yet at the same time we are \nsuggesting that we are going to reduce the number of our bases at home? \nIndeed, the BRAC force structure plan of 2005 addresses neither the \npotential surge requirements that we may confront in these protracted \nstruggles, nor the need for more troops.\n\n  Indeed, there seems to be some confusion within the Defense \nDepartment between DOD and the services. I saw a report the other day \nthat interested me that appeared in the Boston Globe making reference \nto the fact that the Navy is planning to inactivate a number of \nsubmarines over the next few years. It was reported that the Navy is \nconducting a study that might reduce the attack submarine force \nsubstantially downward for the fiscal year 2006 budget submission, and \nwe are told there are no changes, as indicated in the Future Year \nDefense Plan, upon which the force structure plan that was submitted \nfor this base-closing round was predicated. So how can we be certain of \nthe type of projections the Defense Department is going to make beyond \nthe year 2009?\n  There is no mention of any changes up to 2009 in terms of its force \nstructure requirements. How then are we going to base the kind of \ndecisions within the base-closing process when we have not had an \nadequate projection of threat assessment for the next 20 years and what \nit will require in terms of force and also infrastructure? And what are \nthe joint warfighting plans that are still being developed? If BRAC \ndecisions are based on untested joint concepts, then the Department of \nDefense could well face limited options down the road because of the \nlimitations of facilities.\n  I think it doesn't make any sense at this point to continue with the \ndomestic base-closing round without a complete understanding and \nevaluation of our overseas basing requirements. This amendment will \nallow Congress time to conduct adequate oversight to ensure that these \ninvaluable decisions that we will be making, permanent decisions, \nirreversible decisions, do not have implications for the future of our \ncapacity to respond to the changing threat environment in which we \ncurrently are.\n  I am hoping that Members of this Senate, however they felt in the \npast about the base-closing process, will understand there is an \nenormous gap between threat assessments and force structure projections \nby the Defense Department and all of the previous base-closure rounds, \nand that is a serious problem in the world in which we live and \ncertainly in the context of needing more flexibility when we are \nconducting a war on terrorism. As the President said, this is going to \nbe an ongoing struggle for a long time in the foreseeable future. \nTherefore, we have to reconsider and look abroad for our overseas \nfacilities as opposed to those at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take.\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\n  I ask my distinguished colleague from Maine, have you had an \nopportunity to examine the letter that was sent by the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and all of the other Chiefs in which they say ``a \ncomprehensive overseas basing review is nearly complete.'' I have other \ndocumentation. They have done a conscientious job on the overseas base \nstructure. They are coming forward with a very balanced program to work \nwith the existing law.\n  My concern is, if we dislodge the existing law by adopting this \namendment, it would have the effect of delaying the process another 2 \nyears and putting on to the Department of Defense the added cost of \ncontinuing to maintain structure that they simply do not need for \ntoday's and the foreseeable military strength of our country.\n  I have to tell my distinguished colleague, in the course of the lunch \nperiod, I talked with a number of individuals. They said: John, the \nmost persuasive case to me is that I have called home and talked to \nseveral of the communities that have hired the lobbyists, and they \npleaded with me: We can't afford this infrastructure that we felt \nnecessary to defend our base under the existing 205 BRAC procedure. You \nadd another 2 years, you are going to draw down those precious small \namounts of tax dollars in those communities by another 2 years. Is the \nsentiment in your State to go on for another 2 years with all of the \nuncertainty?\n  A lot of communities cannot attract new business for fear that the \nbase may leave. They have to have a decision and get on with this.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's comments. \nFirst, with respect to overseas facilities, in this legislation, under \nthe current law, it requires the Department of Defense to submit that \nreport only 4\\1/2\\ months prior to when the base-closure commission's \nfinal decisions are completed. I think that is going to be a totally \ninadequate period of time in which to make a current examination as to \nwhether or not to close the facilities. You can have an impact at home \non domestic installations. We are talking about increasing the number \nof troops in the underlying legislation. Where are they going to be \nhoused? There are a lot of decisions. We have never thoroughly \nevaluated overseas installations. I think that needs a thorough \nexamination. We deserve that.\n\n  Frankly, I do not have confidence in the process. I can tell my \ncolleague, as the Senator from Mississippi has indicated, I have no \nconfidence in the integrity of the process. They have not been in \nposition to ever not only provide a credible force structure plan in \nidentifying the future threats, they have not been accurate in their \nprojections.\n  Secondly, if you talk about the examination of savings--and I did not \nget into that subject because that is a wide-ranging subject--GAO, in a \nreport yesterday, said the Department of Defense does not have any \nadequate methodology by which to ascertain whether they have made or \nachieved any savings. In fact, there may be one base closing round that \nhas achieved any savings in the first 6 years--maybe.\n  We are going to be talking about spending a lot of money before we \neven get to that process even if we do because it costs so much in \nremediation in the cost of closing down those facilities, in \nconjunction with the war on terror, in conjunction with the conflict in \nIraq, and all the potential costs associated with that which remain \nunknown in the foreseeable future.\n  That is why I say to the chairman, I think it is important, not for \nthe sake of expediency and efficiency, but for the sake of fairness in \nlooking abroad as to exactly what we need. We have more than 700 \nfacilities that have not heretofore been examined. With regard to \nforward-deployed forces, many nations would not allow us to put our \ntroops there when it came to the conflict--Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n  The time has come to look at this situation very differently. We are \nin a very different environment, as the chairman well knows, and I \nappreciate that. But I think the time has come to understand there are \nhuge gaps in understanding what our future threat environment is going \nto be all about, and that has enormous implications for the future.\n  Finally, may I mention, in this legislation there is a joint \nresolution of approval by the Congress in 1997 to make a decision as to \nwhether to proceed to an additional base-closing round.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senator from California has been \nwaiting to speak. Will 10 minutes be sufficient, or if she does not \nneed all that time, we will reallocate the time. I yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I had the privilege of listening to the Senator from Maine. I feel \nvery privileged to join in this effort along with the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from North Dakota. The Senator from Maine \nmade an excellent case, and I concur wholeheartedly.\n  Specifically, what we are trying to do with this amendment are two \nsimple things: modify the 2005 base closure round to make it apply \nsolely to military installations outside the United States. As Senator \nSnowe said, we need to begin to look at the 700 operations and \ninstallations we have around the globe and make some decisions with \nrespect to them in this new asymmetrical war on terror we face.\n  Secondly, provide for expedited consideration of a request for a \ndomestic base closure round in 2007.\n  I thought the Senator made the excellent point that Congress \nauthorized the 2005 base closure round in 2001. Our military and our \nNation have been confronted by several new challenges since that time: \n9/11, the war on terror, the overthrow of the Taliban and the Hussein \nregime, and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq. We now know our \nenemy may well be rogue states, may well be nonstate entities who seek \nto find weapons of mass destruction. They may well be international \ngroups which have replaced the Soviet Union as the greatest threat to \nAmerican interests and security.\n  These challenges, we believe, mandate us to reexamine the role and \ncomposition of our military in this new era: What kind of force \nstructure will be needed? How many troops will be sufficient? And, yes, \nwhat sort of infrastructure and basing needs will be required to meet \nthese new threats?\n  It seems very shortsighted to me to proceed with a new round of \ndomestic base closures that was approved before 9/11 took place and \nbefore any of these questions were raised. In fact, the criteria for \nthe 2005 base closure round is almost identical to the criteria for the \npast four rounds. How can we be sure this process will be fair and \nbalanced and in the best interest of our military and our national \nsecurity interests if it is based on criteria appropriate for 1995?\n  For example, as Senator Snowe pointed out, there was no Department of \nHomeland Security in 1995. We are only beginning to understand how our \ndomestic military infrastructure can play a role in providing for the \nactual defense of our homeland. That is a very important point. I do \nnot think there is anyone who would say our homeland is beyond attack. \nAs a matter of fact, I think a majority of us, certainly on the \nIntelligence Committee, would say there are very good chances that \nthere will be another attack; therefore, domestic military has a new \nand different role to play in our country.\n  I do not think now is the time to rush forward. We still have 112,000 \ntroops based in Europe, 37,000 in Korea, 45,000 in Japan in bases \ndesignated, devised, and intended for cold-war-era threats. Those \nthreats have changed.\n  We see on the Military Construction Subcommittee how the thinking is \nnow changing with respect to force structure, the location of force \nstructure in Korea, as well as in Europe, moving more of the European \ncomponents south of the Alps so that we may be able to move them more \nrapidly into the Middle East and into Africa.\n  Suppose after the 2005 round is completed it is determined several \noverseas bases need to be closed and the troops relocated to the United \nStates. Where will they go? Will closed bases have to be reopened?\n  Let us also remember there is an economic impact on a community that \nmust be taken into consideration. When a base is closed, jobs are lost, \neconomic growth is stunted. Even the threat of a base closure is enough \nto scare away investment.\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\n  Should we not take a look at our overseas basing structure first \nbefore we ask our communities to make additional sacrifices?\n  Senator Hutchison, who is the chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee, and I, as ranking member, introduced legislation last \nyear to create a congressional commission to take an objective and \nthorough look at our overseas bases. We met with that commission last \nweek and gave them their charge to look at the mission and then make \nsome recommendations to us with respect to the placement of bases \nneeded by that mission.\n  It seems to me the way one approaches this issue is to build on that \nlegislation and first look at overseas basing needs in 2005, since they \nare, in fact, changing, and then turn to domestic bases, if necessary, \nin 2 years' time.\n  I also want very briefly to mention the impact of base closures on my \nhome State of California. California has had 29 military bases closed. \nIt has cost the State more than 93,000 jobs, of which 40,000 were \ncivilian positions.\n  According to the executive director of the California Institute for \nFederal Policy Research, California lost more jobs than all of the \nother States combined in the last four rounds. While at the time we had \nonly 15 percent of the Nation's military personnel, we shouldered 60 \npercent of the net personnel cuts. I believe we have sacrificed enough.\n  If California is called on to make additional sacrifices and \nadditional bases are closed in a future domestic BRAC round, we should \nknow that our Government did a complete and thorough examination of the \nthreats our country will face in the future and the military \ncapabilities we will need to face those threats.\n  While we are mentioning this, I also want to raise another real \nproblem and that is the gross underfunding of cleanup and remediation \nof the bases. This has been short funded by literally billions of \ndollars. Let me make a couple of points.\n  It is estimated it will cost $1.3 billion to clean up the former \nMcClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento. That process will not be \nfinished until 2033. The cleanup of Fort Ord will not be finished until \n2031. Castle Air Force Base will not be completed until 2038, and the \nlist goes on.\n  What is the rush to close more bases that cannot be rapidly \ntransitioned into civilian use because of the inability to fund \nremediation and cleanup of environmental hazards?\n  So I think Senator Snowe made an excellent argument with respect to \nthe need to take a good look at the overseas bases first--700 of them--\nand make some decisions with respect to where we are going in this new \nasymmetric war on terror and to leave intact America's bases for the \nnext 2 years and then, in 2007, to consider an expedited round.\n  I am very proud to join with Senators Dorgan, Lott, and Snowe in this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise in opposition to the Lott amendment and I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we have to keep in mind that the main \nmission is to secure the safety of Americans both at home and abroad. I \nbelieve we are responding to the terrorist threat. We have stood up \nNorthern Command in the military. We have set up a whole new Department \ndealing with homeland security.\n  At the very beginning of his administration, President Bush made it a \npriority to build and transform our military after 8 years of operation \nand maintenance funding shortfalls under the previous administration. \nWhere does one get the money? If the bases and mission are being \ntransformed, savings have to be figured somewhere. I think it is \nentirely appropriate, both at home and abroad, to review our mission.\n  I agree with many of the points that are being made on this \namendment. We have to look at our bases overseas. Certainly our mission \nhas changed considerably over there. As opposed to a large frontal \nassault, we are now dealing with a terrorist problem which requires a \nmore mobile and modern military to address that threat.\n  We have the same threat at home, and we also need to look at whether \nbases at home are meeting the mission of the modern threat from \nterrorism. Those of us in the Senate have heeded the call of the \nPresident and I am pleased we are about to take the next step in \nmaintaining a military fully capable of defending our Nation and \nmeeting our foreign policy goals.\n  I continue to support the President's plan to transform our military. \nThis authorization bill builds on the work we in the Congress have \nalready accomplished toward that end. This amendment tends to undermine \nthat effort.\n  I will take this opportunity to review where we are with BRAC. \nCongress granted the administration the authority in fiscal year 2002, \nthat is the National Defense Authorization Act, to conduct a BRAC round \nin 2005, providing a critical opportunity to eliminate excess capacity \nand achieve additional savings that could be used to modernize and \ntransform our Armed Forces to address emerging global threats.\n  The fiscal year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act improved the \nBRAC language from previous rounds to ensure future infrastructure \nsatisfies emerging national security requirements and to correct \nearlier abuses of the process.\n  A 2002 GAO report on the 387 closures and realignments in four \nprevious rounds; that is, in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995, reaffirmed \nthat the Department of Defense generated a substantial net savings of \nsomewhere around $17.6 billion, and expects the annual savings of $6.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2003 to grow.\n  DOD further estimated in March of 2004 that a BRAC round in 2005 will \nsave $5 billion in 2011 and $8 billion annually thereafter. Now, BRAC \nis a key enabler for DOD transformation initiatives, including global \nbasing and the rebalancing of Active and Reserve Forces.\n  I believe a delay of the 2005 BRAC round already underway delays the \neffort for us to modernize our forces. I cannot accept the argument \nthat if we do not close bases that somehow or another we are better \noff. I think we need to have some savings. We need to save money. In \nthe long run, there is going to be more money available for us to meet \nthe changing threat from the terrorists that we now face today.\n  If we are serious about modernizing our facilities and being ready to \nmeet the changing mission, we need to defeat the Lott amendment and we \nneed to move forward with the provision that we have currently in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Lott amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining in \nsupport of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those in support of the amendment have 16 \nminutes. The opposition to the amendment has 36 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, does Senator Dorgan wish to use some of the \ntime at this point?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would be happy to but I wonder if the \nopponents might want to use some of their time.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time remains on the opposition side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 36 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Levin has not spoken and Senator Inhofe is here, so \nperhaps we could take some more time off the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment of Senator Lott and Senator Dorgan. The first argument they \nmake is that we ought to look first at overseas bases before we have \nour commission next year look at the domestic bases. I agree with that. \nI think it does make more sense to look at the overseas bases before we \nlook at ours, and that is exactly what we provided for by law.\n  We have created a commission which will look at overseas bases and \nreport back to the Department of Defense and to the Nation by the end \nof this year. That commission has now met and I believe they had their \nfirst meeting, in fact, this month and they have already scheduled a \nsecond meeting.\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\n  In terms of the argument that we should surely look at these bases \nall around the world before the commission which will be appointed next \nyear looks at domestic bases, I think the argument is a good one, and \nwe have provided for that argument.\n  The Global Posture Review, which is a requirement that the Department \nof Defense is now meeting, which is to see whether our forces are \nproperly deployed around the world in order of addressing where the \nlikely hotspots are, that Global Posture Review is also going to be \ncompleted this year. So there is a logic, there is a chronology, which \nmeets the supporters' argument, the proponents of the amendment of \nSenator Lott, that there is a sequence which should be followed.\n  We should first look at the overseas facilities before looking at \nours is a sequence which we now have placed in law for many years. \nThis, of course, has been in law and is now unfolding, as it was \nprojected to unfold by law.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and all of the chiefs have written \nus a letter. That letter has been printed in the Record. It is dated \nMay 18, but I just quote from it to emphasize the importance of going \nthrough with a base realignment and closure round as authorized in the \nyear 2001, and the importance to our uniformed military leadership.\n  The letter is addressed to Chairman Warner. It says:\n\n       We are writing this letter to emphasize our continued and \n     unequivocal support for conducting a 2005 round of base \n     realignment and closure (BRAC), as authorized by the \n     Congress.\n       The convergence of ongoing strategy and overseas basing \n     actions, the transformational direction in all the services \n     and force structure changes together afford us a once-in-a-\n     generation opportunity to truly transform the Department's \n     combat capability in an enduring way. A delay of this BRAC \n     round, or a modification of the legislation that limits the \n     Department's flexibility to execute it, will seriously \n     undermine our ability to fundamentally reconfigure our \n     infrastructure to best support the transformation of our \n     forces to meet the security challenges we face now and will \n     continue to face for the foreseeable future.\n\n  There is transformation going on. We are shifting to meet new \nthreats--the best that we can foresee them. It has been argued that you \ncan't perfectly foresee future threats. That is true. But that is \nsurely no argument for not attempting to make the assessments in a \nthorough way, in a conscientious way, and then to structure your forces \nand to structure your infrastructure in a way that will most readily \nand most effectively meet those projected threats.\n  How can we reconfigure our military, which I think everybody \nrecognizes is necessary in a new world of new threats, if we freeze \ninto place the infrastructure that we have in this country? Somehow or \nother, the argument is made that because there are changes in the \nworld, therefore we should not change, we should not allow our \nstructures here to change. The opposite, it seems to me, is the case. \nThe world has changed and changed dramatically, and the threats are \nvery different. Surely we should not be frozen into our current \nstructures here or around the world in response to a changing threat \nenvironment.\n  So the more we point out, and accurately so, and the more we argue \nhow different the threats are following 9/11, it seems to me the more \nwe should be willing to allow a process to work which first looks at \nour structures, our infrastructure, our base structure around the \nworld, and then next year, after the foreign structures are looked at \nand the foreign bases are looked at, then our base-closing commission \nwill look at the domestic bases.\n  I believe one of the Senators who spoke argued that the vote in 2001 \ncame prior to 9/11 and that everything has changed since then. \nAccording to the information I have, our vote took place on September \n25, 2001, 2 weeks after 9/11, the vote to sustain the title in the bill \nwhich authorized an additional round of base realignments and closures. \nI believe that vote--maybe my records are wrong here--took place after \n9/11 and not before 9/11.\n  We also had a vote last year as to whether we should not proceed with \nanother round of base closings. That vote last year also surely came \nafter 9/11. We went through the same arguments, essentially, on our \nvote last year, whether the world has changed as to whether there are \nreally savings that are created by the closing of bases.\n  On the savings point, I would simply give the best information \navailable to us relative thereto. We have talked about the necessary \nclosing of and realigning of bases in order to meet the new threats. \nBut there is also a significant savings issue here as well. Here \nquoting from the Department of Defense report of March 2004, which we \nrequired, on page 55, this is the conclusion:\n\n       The four prior rounds of base realignments and closures \n     have generated significant savings for the Department of \n     Defense. Through fiscal year 2001, the end of the four prior \n     rounds' implementation period, the Department had accumulated \n     net savings of about $17 billion over BRAC implementation \n     costs from the closure and realignment actions approved in \n     those four rounds.\n\n  Then the report goes on to say that:\n\n       These BRAC-created savings continue, and the Department \n     realizes recurring savings of almost $7 billion each year. \n     These savings were realized even after environmental \n     restoration funding was processed through BRAC accounts.\n\n  So the savings here are real. The necessity of closing unnecessary \nbases in order to meet new threats is real. It seems to me, as \ndifficult as it is for all of us to confront the reality that some of \nour bases are in excess and do not meet the current threat situation, \nthat we ought to proceed.\n  The amendment as written would require a new act on the part of \nCongress in order to restore a round of base closing. This is not a \nsituation where the base closing is automatically going to take place. \nThe commission would be allowed to recommend base closings in a future \nyear. According to this amendment, it would require a subsequent act of \nCongress in order to restore a round of base closings in order to have \na commission which would have the power to make those recommendations, \nboth to the executive branch and to the Congress.\n  So this is not just simply a matter of delay, even though I think \nthat would be a serious mistake. This is a matter of eliminating the \nround of base closings which is scheduled unless there is a subsequent \nenactment by Congress of a bill which would set up a round of base \nclosing in the year 2007.\n  If we delay it or if we take the action that is proposed--technically \nmore than a delay but actually a repeal in the absence of, \nsubsequently, Congressional legislation--we will be leaving the bases \nin this country in limbo. It is hard enough. We all have bases in our \nStates. It is difficult enough for our bases to go through this \nprocess, and we know that. We have all suffered some pain, some States \nmore than others--my State a lot. But there is still a lot of real \nconcern about the existing bases we do have in our State. But to simply \nsay we are going to leave you in limbo for a few more years and then \nsee whether Congress in 2007 adopts another round it seems to me is the \nworst of all worlds for everybody.\n  We have a need to realign bases. We have new threats. We have costs \nwe cannot afford. It seems to me we have a process in place, which is a \nlogical process looking first at the bases overseas, doing that this \nyear through a Global Posture Review and through a report of a \ncommission which specifically has been placed by law in operation to \nlook at foreign bases, and then next year, according to a law which we \npassed in 2001, the next President, whether it is President Bush or \nwhether it is President Kerry, would then appoint a commission that \nwould look, in an objective way, at all of the bases, having before it \nthe work of the commission which is looking at the foreign bases this \nyear and having before it the Global Posture Review, which is being now \nadopted by the Department of Defense.\n  I want to close with another paragraph from this letter from the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. Again, this was signed by every one of the \nChiefs. It reads, in the second paragraph, as follows:\n\n       A comprehensive overseas basing review is nearly complete. \n     The continued concentration of forces in Cold War locations \n     highlights the need for a global repositioning to locations \n     that best support our strategic goals. In order to ensure \n     that the Department examines its entire infrastructure, the \n     rationalization of our domestic infrastructure as conducted \n     by the BRAC process must closely follow the Global Posture \n     Review.\n\n  In other words, we have a Global Posture Review which is being \nadopted\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nthis year, and for the BRAC process to be delayed or to be rendered \nuncertain at least until the year 2007 means there will be a disconnect \nbetween the Global Posture Review, which looks at our force structure \naround the world, a disconnect between that and the decision as to \nwhich bases to close.\n  Our chiefs say both efforts are necessary. Both efforts are \nnecessary--the Global Posture Review as well as a BRAC process--for a \ngenuine capabilities-based infrastructure rationalization and for \nfurther transformation of our war-fighting capabilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Mississippi. I believe it is the proper process by which \nwe should go forward with BRAC. BRAC is an extraordinarily complicated \nundertaking. I participated in four prior BRAC events and I can tell \nyou from personal experience that it is intense, it is complicated, and \nit requires a great deal of planning and thought before it should go \nforward.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is proposing we make the logical step at \ntaking what is the first first; specifically, that we look at those \noverseas bases and see how many should be addressed relative to \nclosure; and if we decide that a series of bases overseas should be \nclosed, it is more than likely that much of what they do and what they \nare responsible for will have to be moved back to the United States. \nWhen that returning of troops, materiel, and mission comes to the \nUnited States, that is going to adjust how we should approach the BRAC \nprocess here in the United States.\n  We all recognize there is excess in the military, although the last \nfour BRAC processes have significantly reduced that. But we also should \ngo forward in addressing that excess in an orderly and thoughtful \nmanner. An orderly and thoughtful manner means you look at overseas \nbases first and decide which ones should be closed, and then look at \ndomestic bases to determine whether they are going to have to take on \nnew responsibility as a result of the closures overseas or whether they \nshould also be closed.\n  It is, therefore, an extremely constructive proposal and one which I \nstrongly support and look forward to voting for, and hopefully it will \npass.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the time to Senator Lott.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we go again. We have now been through \nthis on several occasions in the past. These are tough decisions. I \nthink people realize this could have significant impact on the \neconomies of their States, and of their districts in the case of \nMembers of the House.\n  But I think we need to again remind people that we are in a situation \nwhere the defense spending increases and our requirements to fight the \nwar on terror in general and increased costs of the war in Iraq \nabsolutely mandate that we do everything we can to institute savings \nfor the American taxpayers as far as the expenditure of their tax \ndollars are concerned.\n  I don't in any way dispute the fact that when a base is closed it has \na very significant and sometimes short-term devastating impact on a \nState or locality in which that base is located.\n  I do think it is well to point out that Taxpayers With Common Sense \nand the Center for Defense Information prepared an independent report \nwhich was released in October of 2001. There may be some surprise by \nthose of my colleagues who are citing economic concerns as to why they \noppose further base closure rounds. Of the 97 bases closed in four base \nclosure rounds, 88 percent experienced per capita personal income \ngrowth as high as 36 percent, and averaging nearly 10 percent; 75 \npercent experienced gains in average earnings per job; 87 percent had \npositive employment rates; 68 percent beat the national average; the \naverage job replacement rate of all bases closed is 102 percent; by the \nbeginning of 2001, only 3 of the 97 counties had higher unemployment \nrates than the BRAC announcement year; and 53 percent had unemployment \nrates lower than the national average. I think it is important to put \nit in that economic context.\n  Far, far more important than that is the fact that we are going \nthrough a significant realignment to meet the post-cold-war needs and \nchallenges.\n  The Department of Defense is well on its way to establishing an \nintegrated commonsense basing strategy that will feed directly into the \nBRAC process. The Office of the Secretary of Defense is finalizing the \ndecisions in the integrated global presence and basing strategy that \nwill specify who will be coming back and who will be going forward as \nwe transition away from a cold-war posture to a global war on terror \nposture.\n  The decisions from the new global lay-down would be precursors to and \nwill greatly influence the BRAC process. It will take both processes \nacting in a close manner to optimize the deployment of our forces \naround the world. Delaying BRAC or disrupting the symbiotic \nrelationship between the integrated global presence, basing strategy, \nand BRAC processes will ultimately minimize our efficiency in the \ncombat effectiveness of our forces in fighting the global war on \nterrorism.\n  That is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense--\nall knowledgeable people who could be viewed as objective outside \nobservers--agree that we have to move forward with this process. We \nhave voted on it before. We will vote on it again, maybe, although I \nhope not between now and the time that is appointed. I don't think \nthere is any doubt that at this particular time it would be a serious \nmistake for us to delay.\n  I add again that the economic benefits associated with base closure \nare generally very much more positive than negative. I hope my \ncolleagues will understand the views of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, the President of the United \nStates, and all others who strongly feel that we need to move forward \nwith this process.\n  I look forward to seeing a list of the bases in my State when the \nSenator from Mississippi hands it out. As he handed out a list the last \ntime, he left my State off the list. I hope he corrects that oversight \nthis time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto Senate amendment No. 3158, which intends to delay for 2 years the \nprocess of base realignments and closures that is set to begin in 2005.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, the Senate passed legislation calling for a round \nof base closures in 2005. I strongly supported that legislation, and I \ncontinue to believe it is important that we move forward with plans to \nrealign and eliminate excess military infrastructure.\n  In March, the Defense Department estimated that we support a defense \ninfrastructure that is in excess of 24 percent. Rather than continuing \nto pay for unneeded or duplicative facilities, our limited defense \ndollars can and should be better spent to meet the most pressing needs \nof our Armed Forces.\n  United States military forces remain engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAn American military presence remains important in Asia, including \nKorea, and U.S. soldiers are deployed to support peacekeeping \noperations in Southeast Europe and other parts of the world. With such \ndemands on our men and women in uniform, it is imperative that our \nmilitary resources are directed to meet our most critical defense \nneeds.\n  I agree with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, that we must move \nforward with implementation of the BRAC legislation that was passed \nduring consideration of the fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorization Act.\n  Two years ago, the Armed Services Committee concluded:\n\n       The committee believes that the arguments for allowing the \n     closure of additional facilities are clear and compelling. \n     The department has excess facilities. Closing bases saves \n     money, and the military services have higher priority uses \n     that could be funded with those savings.\n\n  This remains true today. The fact that we remain engaged in efforts \nto fight the global war on terrorism and promote peace and stability in \nIraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world,\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\ndoes not mean that we should put the BRAC process on hold. To the \ncontrary, it makes action even more important. Now, more than ever, we \nneed the resources that are spent to maintain excess infrastructure to \nmeet more pressing defense needs.\n  Our highest-ranking military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff General Richard Myers, agrees with this assessment. In a \nletter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of both the Senate and House \nArmed Services Committees dated May 18, 2004, General Myers and the \nJoint Chiefs concluded:\n\n       A delay of the BRAC round, or a modification of the \n     legislation that limits the Department's flexibility to \n     execute it, will seriously undermine our ability to \n     fundamentally reconfigure our infrastructure to best support \n     the transformation of our forces to meet the security \n     challenges we face now and will continue to face for the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  Our highest-ranking men and women in uniform are requesting this \nauthority so that we can best transform our military, moving beyond the \ncold war and preparing for current and future threats to U.S. national \nsecurity interests at home and abroad.\n  Last week, I joined four of my Senate colleagues for a breakfast \nmeeting with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. During the meeting, \nSecretary Rumsfeld shared with us his vision for our global footprint. \nIn an effort to better meet challenges to national security, the United \nStates is changing its deployment of forces overseas. As the Secretary \nof Defense confirmed at that meeting, the realignment and closure of \nmilitary installations, both at home and abroad, is critical as we look \nto continue that process.\n  As a result of prior rounds of base realignments and closures, \nthrough fiscal year 2001, the Department of Defense had accumulated net \nsavings of approximately $17 billion. Savings continue annually, \nfreeing up nearly $7 billion each year. These resources have been \nreinvested to meet urgent defense needs.\n  Given the fact that we still have a military infrastructure that is \nin excess of 24 percent, we can continue to generate even more savings \nwith an additional round of base closures. The Defense Department \nestimates that an additional round of base closures could save more \nthan $3 billion, with savings of $5 billion annually thereafter. Given \nthese savings, there should be little doubt that additional rounds of \nclosures will help to redirect expenditures where we need them the \nmost.\n  As I have long advocated during my time in public office, I believe \nwe should work harder and smarter and do more with less. That is what \nwe are being asked to do. By maintaining excess and unneeded military \ninstallations, we are keeping scarce and critical resources from more \nimportant defense priorities. It just doesn't make sense.\n  Given the looming budget deficit, ongoing military operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and other spending needs here at home, it does not \nmake sense to spend billions of dollars each year on defense \ninfrastructure that is not needed. We simply cannot afford it.\n  While I strongly support the BRAC process, I believe that every \nfacility in Ohio can justify its existence on the merits, and I will \nwork hard as a partner with local communities and my colleagues in \nOhio's congressional delegation to support Ohio's defense \ninstallations.\n  I believe that base closures are essential to allowing our men and \nwomen in uniform to best serve the strategic and national security \ninterests of the United States, and I strongly oppose any amendment \nthat would delay the base realignments and closures process, or attempt \nto stop the process in its entirety.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant amendment to look at closing excess overseas military bases \nbefore moving forward on any future round of base closures in this \ncountry.\n  Over the past several years, I have consistently opposed additional \nrounds of base closures. The loss of a military base can have a \ndevastating impact on local communities. This is not the time to \nsubject our fragile national economy to the impact of another round--\nespecially when the DoD is threatening to close one-quarter of our \ndomestic bases.\n  In addition, I object the Department of Defense request for more base \nclosures when it has failed to clean up former military bases shuttered \nduring the previous four rounds. It will be decades before \nenvironmental remediation is complete at some former bases in \nCalifornia. The DoD must meet its responsibilities to the people of \nCalifornia before moving forward with any future rounds of base \nclosures.\n  Given the ongoing war on terrorism and our current military \noperations in Iraq, now is not the time to close more bases. We must \nensure that we have sufficient military assets to meet our growing \nchallenges. At a time that our forces are stretched thin, it does not \nmake any sense to waste resources in going forward with next year's \nround of base closures. These are uncertain times and it is impossible \nto know what the force structure of the U.S. military will be in the \nnear future.\n  This amendment is a compromise. It allows the base closure process to \nmove forward next year--but only for our installations overseas. It is \nlogical to look at excess capacity overseas before looking at our \ndomestic bases here at home.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this important amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Presiding Officer kindly advise the Senate as to \nthe time allocation remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would Senator Warner be willing to yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course; whatever time our distinguished colleague \nwants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague for yielding to me, but especially I thank him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  We have had experience with base realignment and closure rounds in my \nState over a period of years, and not ad infinitum but ad nauseam.\n  Economically, these have been disasters for the communities and the \nStates because they required the hiring of consultants and advisers to \ntry to come in and prepare the defense for the bases that are located \nthere. It is a flawed process. It has not worked well. It needs to be \nchanged.\n  Senator Lott has pointed to a very real and important concern; that \nis, the enormous expenditures we are making overseas for bases and \nfacilities, many of which are outdated, many of which were placed there \nbecause of cold-war concerns and NATO responsibilities which no longer \nexist.\n  We are seeing troops shifted from European facilities to new \nfacilities in Italy because that is closer to where the action is in \nthe Persian Gulf area or the Middle East.\n  We see changes being made, and the Congress has a role to play \nannually to authorize expenditures and to appropriate the funds for \nthese changes. At any time, if the Congress believes we need to change \nthose policies, we can make those changes legislatively. If the \nPresident believes that is inappropriate, he has the veto power. We do \nnot need to turn this over to an unelected commission with no direction \nfrom the Congress.\n  This amendment gives some direction. First, look at our bases \noverseas, and let's make decisions about how we can improve and make \nmore proficient our deployments there, and then consider proceeding to \na base closure and realignment in the United States.\n  This amendment makes good sense. I compliment my friend, and I urge \nSenators to support the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, some colleagues have represented that this \nBRAC, which is law today, preceded September 11. The record is very \nclear: Congress authorized BRAC in December of 2001. After careful \ndiscussion with DOD as to whether we still require and should proceed, \neight former Secretaries of Defense wrote Congress in 2002 that support \nfor another round is unequivocal in light of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\n  I hope that is right in the Record. I hope it does not influence the \nearlier statements some of my colleagues made. This situation is \nextremely serious. If we were now to virtually repeal that law in many \nrespects and thrust upon these communities the enormous expense to \ncontinue to try and work their cases such that BRAC does not take their \ncase, I commend them for it. It is essential they do that. But the cost \nis enormous to so many small communities.\n  This question of the overseas bases, we all recognize that structure \nhas to be brought down. Our Nation's basic defense policy for years has \nbeen to engage our adversaries beyond our shores. To do that, we had to \nhave a base structure. We are now addressing how with terrorism there \nare no boundaries to the threats. This country no longer is protected \nby two mighty oceans. It is a one-world terrorist threat, and every \nsingle American citizen is on the front line in the war on terrorism. \nNo one is behind any barricade anymore.\n  The Pentagon recognizes this and is beginning to restructure our \noverseas base forces in such a way as to reduce and bring the forces \nback home and to have fewer and fewer installations. But they have to \nintegrate that into the various procedures now going on, consistent \nwith the law of the land, the BRAC that we passed. For instance, \nGeneral Jones and General LaPorte testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee this year on their plans in Europe and South Korea, \nrespectively, to draw down and consolidate forces at each location.\n  The committee has also received testimony from department heads to \nsubmit their Global Posture Review to Congress within the next 3 weeks. \nIt is on target.\n  I wish to accord the opportunity for other Members to speak, \nincluding the Senator from Alabama, a valued member of our \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak after the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it has been a great pleasure for me to \nwork with Senator Warner, the chairman of this committee, and Senator \nLevin, the ranking member.\n  This BRAC issue has been one we have debated for quite a number of \nyears, and one to which all Members have given serious consideration.\n  Like a lot of Senators, we have military bases in my State. Year \nafter year, month after month, we had the top military officers in the \ncountry telling members we needed to be able to spend our money more \neffectively; that they should be allowed to reconfigure our base \nstructure; that it could save money and make this Nation stronger.\n  I became convinced that was true. And that is why--in December of \n2001 we had that vote--I voted for this idea.\n  I led a delegation last month to Europe. We visited 12 installations \nin Europe. We talked with GEN Jimmy Jones, the Supreme Allied Commander \nof Europe, and heard from him about his vision for major drawdowns of \nour force strength in Europe, consolidation of bases. We could reduce \nthat number by two-thirds. A huge number needs to be reduced and \nconsolidated in Europe.\n  We can bring home, in my view, both infantry divisions and probably \nother troops, too. Troops from the Pacific can be brought home and \nmaintained in the United States so we can keep expeditionary bases \naround the world.\n  That is part of what they are planning this very moment. It will not \nbe long, and we will hear their report. I think it will be bold. I \ndon't think it will be a little-bitty deal. I think they will recommend \nsubstantial alterations of past policy.\n  We do not have the threats in Germany that we had when the Soviet \nUnion existed. It is not there. We can be much lighter in Europe, and \nwe can be much more effective in our deployment of forces, keeping much \nlarger numbers of people in the United States. I don't see a conflict \nbetween allowing this to happen at the same time.\n  In fact, General Jones said to us in our conversation, he envisioned \nit happening at the same time. In other words, we would reconfigure \nAmerican bases while we were drawing down the foreign bases, and we \nwould make our decisions about where they will go as we restructure and \ntransform existing defense basing structure in the United States. That \nis the right way to go.\n  I have been checking in my State, and some other Senators have heard \nfrom their States. People are ready to get this over with. It has been \nout there for several years. The communities have worked on their \nbases. They have developed plans and arguments and ideas to demonstrate \nto the Department of Defense why they have an enduring installation. \nThat has been good and healthy and they are prepared to do it. To delay \nagain is not wise. We voted this down before.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Mississippi, my \nneighboring State, but this is the right thing to do. I take no \npleasure in it, but it is not like in the mid-1990s when we were \nreducing the number of personnel in the military by 40 percent and \nreducing equipment and capabilities at the same time. We are still \nincreasing our Defense Department.\n  What General Schoomaker envisions is a young person enlisting in the \nArmy. They can stay at a major enduring base for 7 years without having \nto move his or her family around. They can be promoted and be trained. \nUnits can remain with their integrity and their training capability for \nmuch longer periods of time than we have today.\n  Fewer, more properly configured bases can help strengthen the \nNation's defense. That is why I have concluded it is right for America. \nIt is the right way to strengthen our national defense.\n  Do not let anyone say this BRAC process in some way weakens defense. \nI would never vote for it if I thought that was so. In fact, all the \nuniform commanders say this will help make us a stronger America.\n  I thank Chairman Warner for his leadership and courage in this \nmatter. He certainly has bases in his State, as I do. But we believe it \nis the right procedure, after having heard the testimony in the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. Yes, \nwe are very proud of our base structure. Almost every one of our \ncommunities now has engaged the lobbyists, and so forth. Listen to \nthis, I say to the Senator. Delaying BRAC benefits one group; and that \nis, the lobbyists and the consultants paid by these communities and, \nindeed, State taxpayers.\n  The Congressional Research Service has estimated over $23 million \nwill be spent in fiscal 2004 to pay lobbyists and consultants for \nservices to defend installations. A delay of BRAC by 2 years will cost \nthe taxpayers of one State, that is paying a firm $50,000 a month, over \n$1.2 million.\n  There is the debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. We better check on the time.\n  Mr. President, how much time, please, does the Senator from Virginia \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is 6 minutes. My distinguished colleague from \nMississippi?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is 14 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, under a unanimous consent agreement, I am \nto be recognized, so I do have the floor now, but I will yield to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon. I say to the Senator, you have the \nfloor now?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. He had a unanimous consent earlier to go after Senator \nSessions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be glad to let you go first.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will step down.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. That is fine. I want to be sure I keep my UC in \nplace. I do not want to lose it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was going to suggest for the lobbyists, it is time to \nbring that to an end. As some wise person told me in Alabama, they \nexist to blame the politicians if they close the base, and to claim \ncredit if it is not closed.\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma, if he needs that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish the Senator from Alabama would stay \non the floor for a minute.\n  First of all, I direct this statement to my chairman, whom I deeply \nrespect. There are three amendments floating around right now. There is \na lot of confusion as to which one we are voting on now.\n  I say to the Senator, your statement, the statement from the Senator \nfrom Virginia, and the Senator from Alabama, if, in fact, this is a 2-\nyear delay, I would agree wholeheartedly. For all the lobbyists in \nthere--and I have five major installations in my State of Oklahoma--if \nthis is a 2-year delay, as I have said publicly before, and as I said \nas recently as our policy meeting, I would say let's go ahead and do \nit, and do it now.\n  It is my understanding--and I would certainly yield to anyone who \ndisagrees with this--this is killing this BRAC round; that if it should \nbecome necessary to have it, you would have to reauthorize it in 2007. \nThat is now my understanding. It is not a delay. This is not the House \nlanguage. I would like to ask if there is anyone who would correct me. \nIf I am wrong, I need to know it.\n\n  Apparently, I am not.\n  Let me ask the author of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's ask Senator Lott, who authored it. As I read it, \nthere is a 2-year delay.\n  Mr. LOTT. This amendment is not the same as the House language, which \nis a 2-year delay.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That I realize.\n  Mr. LOTT. This amendment says when you get the global review, you \nwould go forward with a BRAC for overseas bases, and then have the \ndomestic round, presuming that is completed. It is not a 2-year delay. \nIt could be that we would go forward with it after only 1 year. If the \nrealignment in force restructuring that is going on globally would \noccur next year, then it could go forward next year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This kills it, and it has to be reauthorized; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I ask that time not be taken \naway from my time because I feel very awkward about this. The Senator \nfrom Alabama talked about spending time with General Jones, which I did \nover there. I have spent quite a bit of time, and I think I have a \npretty good idea of what is going on. I have actually been to Bulgaria \nand Romania and Ukraine, looking at how we are going to restructure and \nbring home our troops who are stationed for these 2- and 3-year periods \nwith their families, so we could actually get out there and have short \ndeployments so they would not have to take their families with them. I \nthink General Jones is right on target. That is going to have a \ntremendous effect on what we do in terms of base closures.\n  I answered a whip check, and I want to correct it right now, so \neveryone knows that whip check was not worded properly. It said: Would \nyou support defeating a 2-year delay? I would support defeating a 2-\nyear delay for the very reasons that have been outlined here, that we \ndo not want our communities to have to continue to go through that.\n  But if you will remember the debate we had when I vigorously opposed \nhaving this fifth round, I used the argument that we are going to be \nchanging our force structure, that we are going to be making changes \nthat might make us relook as to what we are going to do in our \ninstallations here in the United States.\n  I was elected to the House in 1986, so I was there during the \nformulation of the BRAC process. I was a staunch supporter for the \nfirst three rounds. For the last one, I did not like the way it went. \nIt became political. I have had the fear that would happen again. We \nclosed some 97 installations in the last four rounds, and that is not \nonly low-hanging fruit; a lot of great installations that were closed.\n  I believe, if this amendment kills it, and it would have to be \nreauthorized after such time that we know what the restructuring looks \nlike, that I will support this amendment. I am going to find out \nbetween now and when the vote takes place if I am correct. But I \nbelieve my understanding now is correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since we have more time, I believe, \nremaining on this side, the side of the proponents of the amendment, I \nyield such time as he may consume--the remainder of that time--to \nSenator Dorgan, who has been very much involved and a leader in this \nprocess for several years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for \nhis leadership on this amendment.\n  Let me address a few of the issues that have been discussed. First of \nall, 5 days before September 11, 2001--5 days before September 11--the \nfirst vote occurred in the Senate on this BRAC round. It was September \n6, and it was a vote in the Senate Defense Authorization Committee. \nThat first committee vote, 5 days before September 11, 2001, is what \npropelled a base-closing commission proposal to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The opponents of this amendment are quite correct when they say the \nfinal vote of the Congress occurred after September 11. But the origin \nof this, including the vote in the authorizing committee, occurred \nbefore September 11.\n  The reason I make that point is this: Things are changing. The world \nhas changed. I will bet on September 6, 2001, there was not one member \nof the Armed Services Committee or a Member of the Senate, and I will \nbet not one person serving in the Pentagon, who would have predicted \nthat within a matter of months we would be occupying an old Soviet air \nbase in Uzbekistan in order to house our troops to prosecute a war in \nAfghanistan. No one would have predicted that. No one would have had \nthe foggiest idea that was in front of us. Yet the world has changed.\n  We now fight a war against terrorism. We fought a war in Afghanistan, \nquite successfully. We are now fighting a war in Iraq. The world is \nchanging. So our force structure will likely change. Our basing \ndecisions will change. We no longer have a cold war with the Soviet \nUnion. The Soviet Union is gone, it has disappeared.\n  So what next? Well, my feeling, and the reason I support this \namendment and have worked on this amendment, is we ought to do first \nthings first. I have voted for four previous base-closing rounds. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma said we have voted to close some 97--nearly \n100--military installations. I have voted for all of that, as I believe \nhave most of my colleagues. So I am not a bit unwilling to vote to \nclose military installations. We have done that on four occasions.\n  In this case, however, as I said, the world is changing very rapidly. \nI would ask the question of my colleagues if, in fact, there has been \nall of this activity about reevaluating overseas bases, given the \nchanges in the world, and the fact we are no longer in a cold war, why, \nthen, do we have nearly 100,000 troops still in Germany? Why?\n  My colleague from Alabama said, well, we could bring a lot of those \nfolks back. I think he said we could probably bring a half to two-\nthirds of them back to this country.\n  Well, here is what the Congressional Budget Office said. It said: The \nU.S. Army has little or no excess capacity at bases in the United \nStates. The need to house forces in the U.S. that are now stationed \noverseas could preclude some base closures.\n  So if that is the case--and it is--wouldn't you do first things \nfirst? Wouldn't you decide what it is you are going to do with overseas \nbases first so you understand what your obligation is with respect to \nbases here at home? If you are going to bring 50,000 Army troops from \nGermany back to American soil, where are you going to put them? \nWouldn't you want to make those decisions before you have a base-\nclosing commission here for domestic bases?\n  And one other point, I wonder if perhaps, with respect to the \ninternational war on terrorism, and the substantial need for homeland \nsecurity, which we did not spend so much time thinking about years ago, \nI wonder if when we talk about domestic military installations whether \nwe might not think about them in a slightly different way.\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\n  Perhaps we need more. I don't know. I would sure like all of these to \nbe handled and discussed and debated and thought about in a logical \nway. Frankly, that has not been the case.\n  We have a very large Federal budget deficit. We are now going to be \nasked for a $25 billion reserve fund to fund the war in Iraq. The \nCongress is going to provide that. We are not going to ask the American \nmen and women in uniform to go in harm's way and then not provide the \nfunds that are necessary. But at a time when we have a very large \nFederal budget deficit and the need to provide funding to prosecute the \nwar in Iraq, a base-closing commission next year will result in us \nspending more money, not saving money, spending more money. If you \nquestion that, look at all the previous rounds and ask yourself what \nthe result has been of those rounds in the years following the round. \nIt cost us more money to proceed with the recommendations of the BRAC \nCommission.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma asked the question: What is this amendment? \nThe amendment is very simple. The amendment says the 2005 BRAC round \nshall proceed, but it shall proceed to evaluate and recommend \nrealignment and closure only with respect to overseas bases. Why is \nthat the case? Because that ought to be done first. First things first, \nbut put the horse in front of the cart, evaluate what are the \ninternational, what are the worldwide needs and interests of our \ncountry with respect to our military troops and installations, and then \nfrom that you will determine what kind of military installations and \nneeds you have in this country domestically.\n  That is what our amendment does. It provides for the 2005 round to \nproceed with respect to overseas bases. Then secondly it says, \nfollowing that report and disposition of its recommendations by the \nSenate, a motion will be in order by someone who wishes to propose a \nmotion for a new BRAC round. Under expedited procedures, that motion \nshall be considered, and there shall be a vote of the Senate on whether \nto implement another BRAC round. The Senator from Oklahoma, with \nrespect to the question he asked, was absolutely correct.\n  I have great respect for the chairman and ranking member of this \ncommittee. They do outstanding work. They are both wonderful \nlegislators, and I regret that we find ourselves on different sides of \nthis question. I have great respect for their position. But I believe, \nas do many of my colleagues who have spoken today, that the better \ncourse for this country, given what we face, our challenges and the \ncircumstances that now exist, would be to proceed with the amendment, \nhave an overseas BRAC round next year, decide what it is we want to do \ninternationally with overseas bases, and then proceed from that basis \nand make further judgments.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, he has correctly \ndescribed how this operates, but the reality is, by killing the \ndomestic BRAC program and putting it in abeyance subject to a future \nvote by the Congress--and mind you, any Member of Congress can trigger \nthat vote; am I not correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. All Presidents have supported BRAC. You know that message \nis coming up. So what happens to the lobbyist? He tells the community: \nKeep me on the payroll, that vote is coming, and you do not know which \nway that vote is going to go. They will breathe fear into these \ncommunities, unlike anything before, to keep those lobbyists on the \npayroll. Those communities will be shelling out the money year after \nyear.\n  I will close with the following comment: We are to soon receive a \nletter which will have this statement in it: Base Realignment and \nClosure, BRAC--the administration strongly opposes any provision to \nmodify, delay, or repeal the BRAC authority passed by the Congress 3 \nyears ago. If the President is presented a bill that modifies, delays, \nor repeals the BRAC authority, the Secretary of Defense, joining with \nother senior advisers, would recommend that the President veto the \nbill. Rather than waiting for the resolution of infrastructure issues \nas proposed by the committee, BRAC needs to move forward so it can be \ndone in concert with such a resolution. A delay would postpone the \nachievement of a basing structure more suited to 21st century threats \nand delay billions and billions of dollars in savings. The current \nexcesses in base and facility capacity create unnecessary demands on \nthe Department of Defense resources needed to maintain military \nreadiness and transform for the future.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi controls 2 \nminutes 22 seconds. The Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield that to my distinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there has been a number of votes on BRAC. \nJust to clarify, it was not just that the Congress voted to keep a BRAC \nprocess going after 9/11; the Senate itself, on September 25, 2001, \nvoted to table an amendment which struck the BRAC title. That was after \n9/11. It was the Senate itself that voted on that.\n  Secondly, the point about first things first, it seems to me, is \nright. We ought to consider overseas bases first. That is why we \ncreated a commission last year in the 2004 appropriations bill, the \nMILCON appropriations bill. We appointed the Commission on Review of \nOverseas Military Facility Structures of the United States. That \ncommission is meeting now. That commission is going to make a report \nthis year. First things first, that is exactly what we are doing with \nthat commission--reporting first on overseas structures.\n  The real question is whether we get to the second thing. This \namendment kills BRAC. I think the sponsors have clarified it. This \nkills BRAC unless there is, as the Senator from Virginia points out, a \nvote in 2005 to have a BRAC process. That will be the vote that all of \nthe lobbyists will be pointing to. Every one of our States has bases. A \nlot of those bases are nervous. They have hired people to lobby us. Now \nthe focus will be on a 2005 vote. So the cost to the communities to \nkeep this pot boiling will continue. The communities will be left in \nlimbo because these bases' future will be uncertain.\n\n  The vote in 2005 will be certain. The outcome will not be certain, \nbut there will be a vote in 2005. We know that because of the amendment \nlanguage. So the beneficiaries of this amendment are the lobbyists and \nrepresentatives of the communities, the communities kept nervous, kept \nin limbo. Keep the pot boiling; don't resolve this issue. The only \nargument to do that is first things first.\n  We did that. We have our overseas basing commission in place, \nappointed, meeting. That is the logical process. We ought to let it \nplay out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the administration has begun \nto address the overseas basing issue. I have visited bases, as have \nmany of my colleagues. I have seen training constraints where you don't \nhave the airspace to stay in training or you don't have the artillery \nrange to stay in training. We have not had enough time to fully look at \noverseas bases and also know what our end strength is going to be. We \ndon't know right this minute what our end strength is going to be and \nour force structure because we are having to adapt to some incredible \nchanges in our security environment.\n  We are going to have the last round of BRAC at some point, but it \nneeds to be at the right time, and it needs to be done right. The Lott \namendment would give us that extra time to make sure we do it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  This commission on overseas bases is a Global Posture Review. It is \nnot a closure or realignment process. It is a review of requirements \nthat should then inform an overseas base process. But it is not a base \nclosure. This commission which reports in December guarantees that \nnothing will happen. I\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nwant to make sure everybody understands that. We are trying to get an \noverseas realignment and base closure process.\n  Secondly, I am shocked with all this talk about the key factor here \nis the lobbyists: We don't want our communities or States to keep these \nlobbyists who are going to be working to try to keep the commission \nfrom closing this base or that base. I really can't really believe that \nhas been the argument.\n  I have an answer to that. Take them off the payroll. I know how it \nhas been working. Some of these people have been paid for 4 years, and \nthere has not been a BRAC process underway. That is why we are here. We \nare here as representatives of the people. We do not need these people \non the payroll. Surely, that is not the best argument.\n  I guarantee this: Some of the communities, some of the bases, some of \nthe people will say this will give us 2 more years, at least, on life. \nWe will take those 2 years. The very idea of ``shoot me and get it over \nwith'' when, as a matter of fact, some of these bases are really \nneeded--CBO has said there is not excess capacity.\n  My last point is, if we are going to have a base-closure process, \ntarget the excess bases; do not target every base in America. I urge we \nadopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. All time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 1 minute 26 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my good friend, a very \nvaluable adviser for these many years, this BRAC legislation is to take \nCongress and remove it, once we make the decision to go forward with a \nBRAC, because the very essence of BRAC was so distorted by a certain \npolitical individual some years ago.\n  I have to tell my dear friend, it took a lot of effort to get this \nlaw in place. To dislodge it and terminate it, as this amendment does--\nthis is a killer amendment to BRAC--and then leave in limbo these \ncommunities with 2 years of uncertainty, not being able to attract \nbusiness, not being able to do things in their community, with this \ncloud over their head as to the probability or improbability of their \nbase remaining, is a dangerous situation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to grant my good friend----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an \nadditional 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thirty minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Thirty seconds, to wrap up this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to emphasize again, think about what \nwe are doing. Think about the time. Think about how much has happened \nin the last 2 years. Think of the troops, the Reserve and Guard forces \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Think about the families, the mothers, and \ncommunities already very much concerned about the future of our \nmilitary men and women, where they are going to be, and now add this to \nit. I think the timing is wrong. To say we are not going to even \nidentify what bases will be subject to this review is not the way to \ngo.\n  I say again, think about these issues. I do not think we have any \nguarantee overseas bases will be realigned. I have evidence to indicate \nthey will have the same numbers overseas in 2025. We have heard a lot \nof talk about realignment overseas and restructuring. It has not \nhappened. This will make sure we first have overseas bases realigned \nand a new structure and then the domestic bases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3158. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Lautenberg) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 98 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bunning\n     Inouye\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n  The amendment (No. 3158) was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their cooperation \ntoday. We made some progress on the bill. But at this time, on behalf \nof the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a \nperiod of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I want the Record to reflect we were prepared to go ahead \nwith our amendment this evening for debate and discussion. I understood \nthe Senator from New Mexico had an amendment. We were here at 3:30 or \nso, 4 o'clock. I was reminded by our ranking member about the desire to \nmove ahead on the Defense authorization bill, so I want to be sure the \nranking member and the floor manager of the bill, my friend and \ncolleague, knows we are here ready to go with an amendment. It is an \namendment of very significant importance about the Iraq policy. We were \nprepared to debate that amendment this evening and have discussion \nabout this matter. I want to say, I certainly want to cooperate with \nthe floor manager.\n  We are all looking forward to the hearing tomorrow morning at 8:30, \nwhen we will have General Abizaid and General Sanchez, and others--\nGeneral Miller--who are going to be there, which will necessitate my \nattendance. I want to cooperate in every way, and will certainly, but I \ndo want to indicate many of us who feel strongly about this issue and \nthe importance of it were prepared to deal with this through the \nevening time. But it is evidently the wish of the floor manager to \nbring us into morning business. I would like to ask if I cannot at \nleast have my amendment pending after the Senator\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\nfrom--as I understand, the Senator from New Mexico had intended to \noffer an amendment. As the floor managers remember, I tried to follow \nthat Senator, considering the fact we had the Lott amendment, and then \nthe Domenici amendment, that we might have an amendment from over on \nthis side.\n  I want to try to work it out, but I do want to try to at least find \nout if we can get in the queue on this issue so we can notify our \nMembers. I am inquiring from the manager if we cannot at least get the \namendment pending after the disposition of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, before we go into morning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in reply to my distinguished colleague on \nthe Armed Services Committee, at this time I am not in a position to \nsuggest how we proceed tomorrow, other than to say we, as a matter of \ncomity, will rotate one amendment to another. The pending business, of \ncourse, at this time on this bill is the Lautenberg amendment. I would \npresume if that is disposed of tomorrow, then we would go to an \namendment on our side, and we would then come back to your side.\n  But at this time I would not be able to participate in trying to line \nup with certainty any amendments other than the fact that the \nLautenberg amendment is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will not object, although it is \nperfectly satisfactory with the Senator from New Jersey for us to move \nahead in the way I have outlined here, but if the chairman, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, wants to proceed in that way, it is obviously his right \nto do so. I am going to ask at least that my amendment get sent to the \ndesk, not that it be in order but that it be sent to the desk prior to \nthe time we go into morning business, if that is agreeable with the \nSenator, so it can be printed in the Record.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I am not prepared to enter \ninto any unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, then I object.\n  Mr. WARNER. Filing is a Senator's right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. He can file, but I did not hear the word ``file.''\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize. I thought there was. Will the Senator yield so \nthe Senator can send his amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator participates in the withdrawal of the quorum \ncall. Yes, the quorum call can now be withdrawn. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the quorum call----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no quorum call. The Senator from \nVirginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a unanimous consent request \npending?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nto this legislation be printed at the appropriate place at the end of \nthe discussion on this legislation here today.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3174\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on the efforts of the President to \nstabilize Iraq and relieve the burden on members of the Armed Forces of \n    the United States deployed in Iraq and the Persian Gulf region)\n\n       On page 247, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss a \nmatter which I have talked to executive officials about, and my \ncolleagues in the Senate about, and that is to urge consideration for a \nprompt trial of Saddam Hussein.\n  The judgment, I think, is correct to try Saddam Hussein in Iraq so \nthe people of Iraq and the people of the world will have confidence in \nwhat happens at a trial. It has obviously been difficult to constitute \na judicial tribunal to try Saddam Hussein. But now, as we are \napproaching June 30 and the prospect of the transfer of sovereignty--\nand there is proceeding for an interim government and a constitution--I \nthink\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\nthe time has come to lay the groundwork for a trial of Saddam Hussein.\n  I believe it would be very salutary to have on the public record the \natrocities where Saddam has been charged: crimes against humanity; \ngenocide; murder; torture; embezzlement; public corruption; conspiracy \nto murder Israelis by soliciting suicide bombers and paying their \nfamilies once the suicide bombing was completed.\n  There is no doubt the United States and the coalition of the \nwilling--Great Britain and others who have supported the United \nStates--have been subjected to a great deal of criticism in world \npublic opinion, and especially in the Arab world. It is my thought that \nmuch of that criticism would be dissipated if there was presented in a \npublic trial the evidence of Saddam Hussein's atrocities.\n  We have had a great deal of speculation on the issue of weapons of \nmass destruction. Just yesterday, a casing was found which contained \nchemical substances, a question as to whether that weapon of mass \ndestruction was in Saddam's hands immediately before the war began.\n  We know with certainty that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction in December of 1998 before he kicked out the United \nNations. This may have been an old shell or it may have been a recent \nshell. The issue of weapons of mass destruction is still subject to \nspeculation. Yet evidence may be established that Saddam did, in fact, \nhave weapons of mass destruction when the United States and Great \nBritain and the coalition of the willing moved against Saddam Hussein. \nOnce the evidence is submitted of the atrocities of Saddam Hussein, I \nbelieve the issue of weapons of mass destruction, while still \nimportant, will recede into the background.\n  We have had the issue raised, and properly so, of the abusive \ntreatment of Iraqi prisoners. Those investigations have to be pursued \nand the guilty have to be punished. We have seen the brutal \nassassination, murder and beheading of Nicholas Berg, and we have seen \nthe Secretary of State Colin Powell roundly criticize the Arab world \nfor not condemning that brutal assassination.\n  I have had an opportunity recently to view a video which purports to \nbe atrocities by Saddam Hussein on film, the ghastly, ghoulish \nbeheading of a man purportedly in Saddam's custody. I say \n``purportedly'' because I haven't seen the authentication of the tape \nas acts committed by Saddam's henchmen or Saddam's subordinates. But a \ntrial would bring out the evidence as to what Saddam did on genocide. A \ntrial would bring out the specifics of the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction against the Kurds, Saddam's own people. A trial would bring \nout the use by Saddam Hussein of chemical weapons against Iran in the \nIran-Iraq war. I had occasion to talk to a man, an Iranian who \nrecounted an incident where he was the victim of a chemical attack by \nIraqi forces under the control of Saddam Hussein. A trial of Saddam \nHussein would disclose the specifics on the torture he committed and \nthe embezzlement and secreting of vast wealth which belonged to Iraq, \ndeposited in foreign accounts, great sums of cash which were found by \nU.S. forces when Iraq was invaded.\n  It would be my hope that plans would be made now for the prosecution \nof Saddam. A prosecution will take some time to prepare. We couldn't \nproceed to have a trial realistically before June 30. But if we set in \nmotion now the works to establish a court, security would be a matter \nof considerable concern. Judges have to be designated. Prosecutors have \nto be designated. There would be the opportunity for defense counsel. \nThere has been some speculation as to some counsel already having been \ndesignated or in the process of being designated. But this would be \nsomething that ought to be accomplished at a very early date.\n  I have had some experience in the criminal process. From the \nexperience I have had, it would not be all that complicated, once you \nhave the provisional government established, a court, give it criminal \njurisdiction, which it could be granted under the appropriate Iraqi \nprocedures, and the designation of the trial judge or the designation \nof prosecutors, to move on with the trial.\n  I think once the details of Saddam's brutality are put on the public \nrecord, it would have a very profound effect on world public opinion, \nincluding Arab public opinion. I think it would put in an \nunderstandable light the action by the United States in toppling Saddam \nHussein in the interest of stability in the Mideast and in the interest \nof bringing a violent perpetrator to justice. There is no doubt that it \nis very painful to see the casualties and fatalities of our service men \nand women in Iraq, the brutal assassination yesterday of the Iraqi \nleader, but I submit that if we are able to succeed with establishing a \ndemocracy in Iraq, it will be a historic achievement.\n  It will put great pressure on Iran, where there is an interest in \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, which is a separate subject that we have to \nmove against on the international front with the United Nations. \nHopefully when the G-8 meets in the near future, they will take action \nto impose international safeguards, standards, and inspections to be \nsure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. It will put a lot of \npressure on Saudi Arabia to stop the tyranny on the Saudis and the \nterrible degradation of Arab women throughout the entire region, lend \nsecurity to the Mideast. It would be very helpful to security for \nIsrael, and that is a lofty goal worth our very resolute efforts.\n\n  But in the interim, I would like to see consideration started and a \ndebate progress and thought given to the trial of Saddam Hussein, which \nwould be very helpful to reinforce the position of the United States \nand influence world public opinion, especially the Arab world, of the \njustification for U.S. military action to bring down Saddam Hussein.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to take a minute to compliment the Senator. \nActually, a lot is going on with reference to Iraq, but it seems that \nsomehow or another, once Saddam was captured--whatever is happening to \nhim, I hope it is humane, and we have every reason to think that it \nis--it seemed to pale in the background. It kind of went away--I am \nsure not in your mind, I am sure not in many minds, but in a sense \nbecause other things have happened that are somewhat gruesome. The \nenormity of Saddam Hussein's actions versus those kinds of events is \nactually inconceivable.\n  We talk about a prison. We talk about, even from their standpoint, \nBerg being decapitated. We talk about those four people they drug down \nthe road. But imagine what he did to his people in comparison. I think \nthe Senator is right. To put in perspective the conduct in that part of \nthe world and the difficulty in changing things and the difficulty in \nbringing people together, which we are trying to do, would begin to put \nitself together. If we had him there with adequate prosecutors and \nevidence and people, I would assume some witnesses--you would have a \nlot of pictures--as to what he did, it would be a tremendous \nimprovement in balancing what is going on. I commend the Senator.\n  I wish we had a way--this body--of expediting that.\n  But we don't. I think what you are doing helps. I commend you for it. \nI don't think a resolution here urging it would have much effect. It \nmight have the reverse effect. I don't know. I thought maybe we would \nhave one saying what we think. But in a sense they want to do their \nthing, and I think that is correct.\n  I do believe, while we turn their government over to them, turn over \nthe governance, we ought not forget the issue of a judiciary and a \ncriminal jurisdictional court for that purpose.\n  That is big enough to be considered even in the transfer of \ngovernance because it has to happen. We do not want to do it, but we \nwant it done right.\n  I understand what the Senator from Pennsylvania is saying. They can \ndo it right. Actually, we ought to be able, in the transfer, to in some \nway indicate the gravity of the situation and how we feel about it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis support and comments. I have considered and still am considering \nthe possibility of a Senate resolution on this subject. We pass \nresolutions with some rapidity around here, and it may well be that \nmost of the resolutions do not accomplish a whole lot. But it is\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\ntime, in my judgment, that we spoke out on this issue.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is exactly right. Saddam was captured in \nmid-December. Five months have passed, and it is time to proceed. Mr. \nPresident, 9/11 has occurred and thousands of Americans were killed in \nthat brutal attack by flying hijacked planes into the World Trade \nCenter, the Pentagon, and one probably was headed for the Capitol but \nwent down in western Pennsylvania.\n  While many of us are worried on a daily basis, the President receives \na CIA briefing every morning, and there is great concern about homeland \nsecurity. In the public mind, the threat recedes. Understandably, it is \nhuman nature to have a short attention span. But what is going on in \nIraq today is enormously problemsome.\n  The United States is taking it on the chin in world public opinion \nand especially in the Arab world. When you have the brutal \nassassination of Nicholas Berg--his head was cut off in public view--\nand the Secretary of State has to remonstrate, criticize the Arab world \nfor not condemning that act of brutality, and meanwhile we are \nsubjected to all sorts of criticism--and the criticism on the \nmistreatment of Iraqi prisoners is well placed, it is justified. But we \nare acting on it, and we acknowledge the problems, the President has \nand the Secretary of State has--people forget why we are there. It is \nvery painful to have the casualties and fatalities, but we are dealing \nwith large stakes in establishing a democracy there.\n  If Saddam's defalcations and crimes were put on the public record, \npeople would understand why we are there and how important it is to \nchange. When the Iraqi resistance comes up and the Iraqi terrorists \ncome up, let them understand that when there is a change in \nsovereignty, that they are acting against their own people, a duly \nconstituted Iraq Government which would bring Saddam to trial. We \ncannot bring him to trial. Nobody would trust a trial by the United \nStates, as good and fair as our system is, and as just as we are with \nprocedural due process.\n  We ought to let it be known that it is our recommendation that the \nIraqis will have to make the final decision.\n  I would like to start consideration, which is why I have taken a few \nminutes of our time today, not that there is any rush on the Senate \nfloor. The Senator from New Mexico and I are the only ones here.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his support and comments. \nI yield the floor, Mr. President, and in the absence of any Senator \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate is in a period for morning business, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 35 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5596-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5596-S5598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense \nauthorization bill and ask that we proceed quickly to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I thank Chairman Warner for his leadership throughout this session. \nClearly, the outcome of the bill reflects his commitment to our \nmilitary men and women. We live in a very complicated world, and our \nnational security depends on understanding that complexity, reacting to \nit appropriately when we must, and keeping ahead of it when we can. I \ncommend Senator Warner for a job well done, both during the committee \nmarkup and with the full committee in responding to the recent prisoner \nabuses in Iraq.\n  I also wish to take a moment to thank the ranking member of the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator Bill Nelson, for his efforts on \nour portion of the bill. While we do not always see eye to eye, there \nis much on which we agree, and I appreciate the opportunity to work \nwith Senator Nelson on important issues that confront us.\n  I am also pleased by the work the Armed Services Committee has done \non both sides of the aisle and fully support the passage of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  At the very beginning of his administration, President Bush made it a \npriority to rebuild and transform our military after 8 years of \noperation and maintenance funding shortfalls under the previous \nadministration. Those of us in the Senate have heeded this call, and I \nam pleased that we are about to take the next step in maintaining a \nmilitary fully capable of defending our Nation and meeting our foreign \npolicy goals.\n  I continue to support the President's plan to transform our military, \nand this authorization bill builds on the work we in the Congress have \nalready accomplished toward that end.\n  In fact, since 2001, President Bush and Congress have given the \nDepartment of Defense the tools to accomplish the following: Fight the \nwar on terror on the offensive; remove threats to our security in \nAfghanistan and Iraq; liberate nearly 50 million people; provide a more \nthan 21-percent pay raise to our service men and women; expand the use \nof targeted pay and bonuses; begin to transform our Nation's defenses; \nimprove readiness rates; increase research and development funding by \n56 percent; improve the quality of housing for military personnel and \ntheir families through privatization and new construction; double \ninvestments in missile defense systems; and deploy the first ever land- \nand sea-based system this fall.\n  Overall, the Committee tackled the difficult task of simultaneously \nmaintaining the transformational efforts in the department, while \nensuring enough resources are available to guarantee success for our \ndeployed soldiers overseas. The defense authorization bill includes \nmore than $422 billion in budget authority for Defense programs and \nrepresents an increase of 3.4 percent in spending over the last fiscal \nyear. I believe that this bill helps to maintain the high state of \nreadiness that is expected of our military, and also focuses the \nDepartment on the future in terms of research and development programs \nand technologies.\n  Specifically, the more than $68 billion in research and development \nand the $11 billion directed toward science and technology programs \nwill continue to ensure that our military is the best equipped and \nprepared force in the future. These increases over fiscal year 2004 \nhave supported a wide range of new systems including the F-22 and the \nJoint Strike Fighter, the destroyer DDX program, unmanned aerial \nvehicle programs, the Army's future combat system, satellites, \ncommunications equipment, and intelligence systems designed to \naccelerate the availability and capability of future weapons programs. \nWe must continue to make these research and development investments in \norder to skip a generation of weapons and transform our military into \nthe 21st century fighting force it must become. Investing 3 percent of \nthe budget toward science and technology has long been our goal and \nwith the bill before us, we move a step closer to that goal.\n  While I am pleased at the focus on the weapons and technology \navailable to our warfighters, it is heartening that the committee has \nnot neglected our most valuable resource--the service members \nthemselves.\n  The authorization includes a 3.5 percent pay increase across the \nboard, and also permanently authorizes family separation and imminent \ndanger pay created originally for Operation Enduring Freedom and \ncontinuing to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The men and women in the military make great sacrifices for us all as \ndo their dependents and families. The continued progress of improving \ntheir quality of life, compensation, and family housing programs should \nnot be overshadowed by any weapons program. As I stated before, our \nmost valuable resource is the personnel in the armed forces, and we \nmust continue to provide the best possible environment for them.\n  In addition to the resources available for personnel and their \nfamilies, the authorization also provides the near-term readiness and \nprotection equipment needed for the war on terror. Specifically, force \nprotection measures for\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nour troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were given considerable attention by \ncommittee members. No resource should be spared to ensure that our \nwarfighters have the equipment and training in place to provide for \ntheir safety.\n  To that end, $107 million was added for the rapid fielding \ninitiative, $603 million was devoted toward protection gear and combat \nclothing, and $925 million was added for additional up-armored Humvees \nand add-on ballistic armor. Clearly this reflects the committee's \nconcern that our soldiers have all the tools they need to be successful \nwhile they fight the war on terror.\n  Turning to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, which I have the \npleasure of serving as chairman, we exercised oversight for the \nDepartment of Defense budget request for strategic, space, \nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and intelligence support \nactivities. The DOD budget request in these areas included $8.9 billion \nin procurement, $28.2 billion in research and development, and $3.1 \nbillion in operations and maintenance. The administration budget \nrequest also included $15.4 billion for the Department of Energy \nnuclear weapons and environmental management programs and activities.\n  The committee bill reflects a net increase of about $80 million in \nresearch and development and procurement, and the amount requested in \noperations and maintenance. It also reflects the requested level of \nfunding for Department of Energy programs and activities. The program \nsupports the development and fielding of transformational capabilities, \nenhanced readiness, and capabilities directly relevant to defending the \nhomeland from current and anticipated forms of attack.\n  The reductions reflect a thorough examination of the administration's \nbudget request. A number of programs were identified in which excess \nfunds were requested or the requested funds were not executable. Others \nwere based on unrealistic schedules or showed unjustified program \ngrowth. The committee reduced these funding requests appropriately.\n  As the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, ensuring full \nsupport of missile defense is my most important priority. As I have \nstated on the floor many times before, it is abundantly clear how \nimportant missile defense is to our country. The development of this \nprogram is central to homeland defense and to the protection of our \nfriends, allies and deployed forces against growing threats.\n  Overall, $10.2 billion was requested, and the markup reduces that by \na net of about $40 million. Significant funding actions in the markup \ninclude an increase of $75 million for the ground-based missile defense \nelement to enhance the ability to operate and test concurrently; a $35 \nmillion reduction for long lead items for some GMD interceptors; an \nincrease of $90 million for additional PAC-3 missiles; and a reduction \nof $200 million for the ballistic missile defense system interceptor \nproject, also known as the kinetic energy interceptor, or KEI.\n  The markup includes two missile defense legislative provisions, \nincluding one identical to a provision last year that authorizes the \nuse of this year's missile defense R funds to field an initial \nmissile defense capability. The other provision of interest relates to \nthe role of the director of the Missile Defense Agency in the Army's \nPatriot-MEADS program. The provision is intended to ensure that the \nPatriot MEADS program remains thoroughly integrated in the ballistic \nmissile defense system.\n  Concerning Department of Defense space programs, the markup sustains \nthe amount requested, but does shift some of the funding. Significant \nreductions are recommended in the transformational communications \nsatellite, or T-SAT, to try to put the program on a healthier \ndevelopment track; and to the EELV launch program because of a delay in \none of the launches for which services were being procured in fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  Significant increases recommended include: $35 million in the \nadvanced EHF program, $35 million in the space based infrared program, \n$25 million for a new operationally responsive satellite payload \neffort, $15 million for the wideband gapfiller satellite program, and \n$15 million for ballistic missile range safety technology.\n  The markup includes three space-related provisions, including one \nthat would establish a panel to examine the future of military space \nlaunch, and another establishing a new program element for \noperationally responsive satellite payloads.\n  The markup includes minor adds for strategic forces and intelligence \nprograms, and no significant legislative initiatives in these areas.\n  Related to the Department of Energy, the markup includes $15.4 \nbillion for the Department of Energy Atomic Energy Act programs for \nfiscal year 2005, the amount requested by the administration. Of this \namount, $7.8 billion is for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, a $117.9 million increase above the budget \nrequest.\n  Key NSSA increases in the subcommittee mark include:\n  $62.9 million for the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, \nRTBF, program, which will help NNSA continue to reduce the amount of \ndeferred maintenance and repair;\n  $20.0 million for the Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization \nProgram, FIRP, to help revitalize the infrastructure of the nuclear \nweapons complex. This additional funding will reduce the cost and \naccelerate the completion of the FIRP program;\n  $35 million for safeguards and security. After the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, the Secretary of Energy developed and issued a new \ndesign basis threat, which added security requirements across the \nnuclear weapons complex. This additional funding is to help address the \nincreased needs for safeguards and security, including force \nmultiplying technologies.\n  The subcommittee mark provides adequate funding for the National \nNuclear Security Administration to advance directed stockpile work, \nscience-based campaigns, and naval reactors programs. These efforts \nhave been funded at the budget request for fiscal year 2005, a $367.0 \nmillion increase over the fiscal year 2004 appropriated levels.\n  The subcommittee mark includes authorization at the budget request \nfor several of the continuing nuclear weapons initiatives, including \nthe feasibility study on the robust nuclear earth penetrator, RNEP, the \nadvanced concepts initiative, ACI, the NEPA study on the modern pit \nfacility, and test readiness enhancements. No funding was requested nor \nauthorized for the engineering development, production or deployment of \na new or modified nuclear weapon. As was enacted in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, there can be no \nengineering development, or subsequent phase of development, of a low-\nyield nuclear weapon nor a robust nuclear earth penetrator without a \nspecific authorization from Congress. No such authorization was \nrequested in the fiscal year 2005 budget request and no authorization \nis included in the subcommittee mark.\n  Turning to the Environmental Management, EM, program, the \nsubcommittee mark includes $7 billion for these activities. This will \nbe the last full fiscal year of funding for the first three major \nclosure sites, including the Rocky Flats Site, the Fernald Closure \nProject, and the Mound Closure Project. The planned 2006 closure of the \nthese three sites is very good news for DOE and for the United States. \nThe early closure of these sites is expected to result in a cost \nsavings of over $12 billion.\n  Now that DOE will begin shifting the oversight of the closure sites \nfrom the Environmental Management program to the Office of Legacy \nManagement, LM, new challenges emerge. Environmental stewardship \nresponsibilities, pension and health care needs, and community concerns \nwill all require a high level of attention to ensure a smooth \ntransition.\n  The subcommittee mark includes a provision that would authorize the \nSecretary of Energy to exclude from treatment as high-level radioactive \nwaste, that which is stored Department of Energy, DOE, radioactive \nmaterial resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel as long \nas the waste can be appropriately characterized as low-level or \ntransuranic waste.\n  The subcommittee mark also includes $566.6 million for other defense \nactivities, a reduction of $97 million\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nbelow the budget request for fiscal year 2005, and $108 million for the \ndefense nuclear waste disposal, a reduction of $23 million below the \nbudget request for fiscal year 2005. These amounts authorized include a \n$92.4 million reduction to the defense related administrative support \naccount. The committee has consistently rejected funding for this \naccount because the funding is for non-defense activities.\n  Once again, I thank my chairman for his superb leadership. I believe \nthat the defense authorization bill is a good one, and that programs \nthat fall under the purview of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee have \nbeen dealt with in a measured and responsible way. The Armed Service \nCommittee and its staff have worked diligently and in a bipartisan \nmanner to ensure our military remains the best equipped and best \ntrained fighting force in the world. I would ask my colleagues that we \nproceed quickly with the Defense authorization, and urge support of the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and my remaining time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5598-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5598-S5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the \nSupreme Court's decision to reverse the long-standing principle of \n``separate but equal'' in our public schools. The ruling handed down in \nBrown v. Board of Education was the great catalyst America needed to \nmove toward equal opportunities for all children.\n  On May 17th, 1954, the Supreme Court spoke unanimously: ``. . . in \nthe field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has \nno place.''\n  When we talk about Brown v. Board of Education, it is natural to \nthink about its application and enforcement in the South, because that \nwas where the most publicized acts of segregation and discrimination \ntook place.\n  But it is naive to think that the South was the only region of \nAmerica grappling with the new educational and racial standard of \nequality. Western states like Nevada struggled to adapt as well.\n  Nevada was not a place widely associated with having a large \npopulation of African Americans back in 1954 . . . but in fact it was \nhome to many African Americans who migrated from Arkansas, Louisiana, \nand Texas--primarily seeking employment in Law Vegas' hospitality \nindustry.\n  Clark County's classrooms were segregated before the Brown Decision--\nand they remained so afterward. While there were no written laws \nsegregating schools in Clark County, there were impenetrable school \nzoning laws that made it pretty clear that children could only go to \nschool where they lived . . . and because of housing discrimination, \nmost black people lived in concentrated areas.\n  Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, yet Clark County \nschools were not officially integrated until much later, when attorney \nCharles Kellar arrived in Nevada in 1959. Thurgood Marshall, then head \nof the NAACP Bar Representation Program, solicited Mr. Kellar to move \nto Nevada to establish a chapter and legal representation.\n  At the time, one had to live in Nevada for one year before sitting \nfor the bar exam. So, to establish residency, most white law students \nwould engage in paralegal work, Mr. Kellar spent his year studying real \nestate at an unknown little college called UNLV in order to qualify for \nresidency.\n  When he was finally eligible to sit for the exam, the hotel he \nreserved for his stay refused to admit him. He had to spend his two \nnights sleeping in the airport. To add insult to injury, Mr. Kellar was \naccused of cheating on his exam, for his results were near perfect. He \nhad to sue the Nevada State Bar in order to gain admission, which he \nwas finally granted in 1965.\n  The first case he filed was a class action suit against the Clark \nCounty School District in 1968, charging that access to an equal, \npublic education was denied to African American students--in spite of \nthe Brown v. Board of Education ruling 14 years earlier. Despite the \nfact that he won the case, the school district decided to convert the \nWest Las Vegas schools to sixth grade centers, which would be fully \nintegrated. However, the white students would be bused to the schools \nwhile the black students would have to walk.\n  Mr. President, the landscape of Clark County is much different today \nin the sense that we now publicly educate a much more diverse \npopulation of students. But there are still factors in our school \nsystem that separate and discriminate against certain groups of \nstudents: economic status, English language learners, students with \nlearning disabilities, and so on.\n  I am concerned about these barriers, just as I am concerned about the \ngap in academic achievement between different groups of students. This \ngap says to me that we still have a lot of work to do in terms of \nproviding truly equal opportunities for all of our children.\n  And even after 50 years, in spite of the law, segregation itself is \nstill alive and well.\n  Taylor County High School in Butler, Georgia, held its first \nintegrated prom in 31 years last year--in 2003. This year, the white \nstudents decided to return to their old tradition of holding their own \nprivate party--a segregated prom. It is disappointing to realize that \nsegregation is still preferred by some people. But it just goes to show \nthat we still have work to do.\n  The Brown decision truly was a landmark . . . it showed that America \nhad come a long way since Plessy v. Ferguson. Before Brown, we knew \nthat segregation was wrong. After Brown, we knew that it was illegal.\n  That was a tremendous step, and I am certainly grateful for it . . . \nbut we cannot rest on our laurels.\n  We must keep struggling until we can live up to the spirit of the \nBrown ruling, and to the letter of the Civil Rights Act that followed \n10 years later. Until we provide every child with an equal--not \nseparate--opportunity to get a good education.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, 50 years ago our Nation witnessed a \nsignificant step in providing equal education for every child of every \nrace. On May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor \nof a young girl who had been denied enrollment in her neighborhood \nschool simply because of the color of her skin. On the 50th Anniversary \nof the Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education ruling, I want \nto recognize the courage, vision and boldness of that decision and \ncelebrate how far our country has come--and focus on a new bold vision \nthat will lead us into the future.\n   The Brown decision not only called for an end to segregation--it \nbegan a process of healing in America, still needed almost 100 years \nafter the Civil War. The Brown decision affirmed the constitutional \npromise of equality for all Americans. It overturned laws that denied \nmillions of school children freedom and choice in education and set \nthis country on a new course, affirming civil and human rights while \ndemanding the full respect and protection of the law for all people. \nBrown vs. the Board of Education was a decision of courage and \nconviction and was one of the finest moments of the American judicial \nsystem. But while this decision paved the way for the establishment of \nequal learning environments, today there is evidence of work yet to be \ndone.\n  Unfortunately, 50 years later, we still have a relatively two-tiered \neducation system. Many students are in schools where they are receiving \nan incredible education; other children are in mediocre classrooms, \nemerging at the end of each school year barely even able to read at the \nlevels of their peers. The reality is disheartening: nationally, at the \nfourth-grade level, the achievement gap in reading between blacks and \nwhites is 28 percentage points. And consider this: only one in six \nAfrican-Americans can read proficiently after graduating from high \nschool. It truly is hard to believe such disparity exists today.\n  Years after opening the doors of opportunity to every child--\nregardless of their race--we have yet to truly take advantage of the \npossibilities Brown vs. Board created. Breaking through prejudice in \nschool enrollment was the first step--educating each and every student \nto his or her full potential is the next. I give President Bush much \ncredit for recognizing this problem and applaud his willingness to make \nit an issue in the last national election. He said that, if elected, he \nwould institute change, and he did. Within four days of assuming \noffice, he provided a blueprint that became the No Child Left Behind \nAct of 2001--an act that was passed with wide bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n  With this law our country is beginning to address the achievement \ngap. The ``old ways'' will no longer be tolerated. Along with many \nmothers, fathers, teachers and school administrators, we are demanding \nequity, justice and inclusion for every child.\n  This significant piece of legislation raises academic standards, \nholds schools accountable for performance, requires that every child \nlearn to read, works to ensure that there is a quality teacher in every \nclassroom, and provides more choices and flexibility for parents.\n  Accountability is the cornerstone of what makes No Child Left Behind \nso bold and visionary. In the past, the Federal Government would send \nchecks to fund education and hope something good might happen. Now the \nGovernment is sending checks--at record levels, contrary to partisan \ncharges--and asking school systems to show what progress they are \nmaking and what problems remain to be addressed.\n  While many years passed before the Brown vs. Board decision made a \nvisible difference in our classrooms, it took far less time to see the \nchanges initiated by No Child Left Behind. I am pleased to say we have \nwitnessed this progress in my home State of North Carolina. In \nCharlotte, our State's largest city, reading levels have risen \nsignificantly. Dr. Jim Pugsley, superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nSchools, has a lot to be proud of. Just a few years ago, only 35 \npercent of African-American fifth graders in his district were reading \nat grade level, but today, that number has more than doubled to 78 \npercent of African American fifth graders reading at grade level.\n  Schools all over the country are celebrating similar results. The \nChicago Sun Times recently reported that Chicago public school children \nwho transferred from schools in need of improvement to higher \nperforming schools under NCLB showed an 8 percent greater learning gain \nin reading and math than the national average.\n  Granted, you cannot set lofty goals for thousands of schools without \nproviding the funding to back it up. I am pleased to say president \nBush, along with this Congress, is working to secure significant \namounts for our school system. In fact, the United States spends more \nmoney in our K-12 education system than any other country in the world \nwith the exception of Switzerland. This year, the President has \nrequested unprecedented funding increases for education in his overall \nfiscal year 2005 budget. Never before has a President invested so much \nin education. Total spending for K-12 education has gone up $9.7 \nbillion since No Child Left Behind was signed into law. In fact, the \nPresident's 2005 budget requests $2.5 billion for North Carolina \neducation--that is 54 percent more than when President Bush took \noffice. The 2005 budget also increases title I funding to $290.5 \nmillion to help our State's neediest children. That is more than $113 \nmillion above 2001 levels. Funding for schools in North Carolina and \nthroughout the country is finally tied to real accountability for real \nresults. I will continue to work with the education leaders in my home \nState to ensure that each child receives the best education possible--\nand to ensure that No Child Left Behind continues to build on the \nfoundation the Brown Decision laid for closing the opportunity gap in \nclassrooms across America.\n  Our classrooms are the training ground for America's future, and our \nschools and teachers are entrusted with the minds of tomorrow. We must \nguarantee that those minds are being challenged, educated and \nencouraged to their greatest potential. Together with the standard of \nexcellence provided by the No Child Left Behind Act, teachers, parents \nand students have the opportunity to continue the dream first realized \n50 years ago through the Brown vs. the Board of Education ruling. A \ndream where every child has the right to be educated--and none of them \nwill be left behind.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, 50 years ago on a Monday in May, the \nSupreme Court revealed the soul of our Constitution when it said, ``. . \n. in the field of education, separate but equal has no place.'' It was \na moral decision just as much as it was a legal decision that ended \ndiscrimination in every place across America.\n  Some of you remember that day. I was just born and can only imagine \nwhat it was like to experience that moment of truth. To hear those \nwords ``has no place'' To see those headlines, ``Supreme Court bans . . \n. '' To feel the advance of justice. It was a glorious day in America \nand for all those families, children, teachers, and heroes of the last \ntwo centuries who risked their lives to move America to that moment.\n  All of that effort and success and history was wrapped in the family \nname, Brown. But we can never forget that there were other families \ninvolved in that case.\n  One of these cases began in my birth state of South Carolina. The \nAfrican-American kids had to walk up to nine miles each way between \ntheir homes and their only school in Summerton. The white kids had 30 \nschool buses to take them back and forth to their schools. The African \nAmerican parents went to the Clarendon County School Board with a \nsimple request--one school bus.\n  The school board said no. So J.A. De Laine, a minister, convinced a \nhumble farmer named Levi Pearson to sue the Clarendon County school \ndistrict for buses. That case was Briggs v. Elliott and became one of \nthe five cases from around the country that were consolidated and \neventually became known as Brown v. Board of Education.\n  The long journey from the back roads of South Carolina to the \nchambers of the Supreme Court was mapped out and led by attorney \nCharles Hamilton Houston. Together with his protege Thurgood Marshall, \nCharlie Houston patiently, painstakingly and brilliantly used the \nConstitution to correct itself and end legal segregation forever.\n  And the other cases were from Delaware, Virginia, and the District of \nColumbia. The other names were Belton, Davis, and Bolling. And in \nTopeka, there were 12 other families involved, nearly 200 total. This \nwasn't one case and one person and one school, but the cause of \nmillions, and ultimately a cause for all of America.\n  You and I know that this country has made progress. The ``White Only \nSigns'' have come down. Thurgood Marshall went on to serve on the \nSupreme Court. We have Congressman and women and Senators who have \ntaken their place in our national leadership. And we have doctors and \nlawyers and storeowners in every neighborhood and in any town.\n  We have come far, but we're not there yet.\n  I grew up in an America that was growing up too with this landmark \ndecision. This is something I've lived with my entire life living in \nthe South in the '50s and '60s.\n  We all have a responsibility when it comes to issues of race and \nequality and civil rights, but as a Southerner, I feel an especially \nenormous responsibility to lead on this issue. We Southerners have this \nspecial responsibility, not only because we know America's tragic and \npainful history on race, but also because we have led the way in \nbreaking free from that history.\n  From the time I was very young, I saw up close the ugly face of \nsegregation and discrimination. I saw young African-American kids \nshuttled upstairs in movie theaters. I saw white only signs on \nrestaurant doors and luncheon counters. When I was in the sixth grade, \nmy teacher walked into the classroom and said he wouldn't teach in an \nintegrated school.\n  But even in the struggle's darkest days, countless Southerners stood \nas profiles in courage. For every George Wallace, we had a Terry \nSanford. There were four Southern Justices on the Court that decided \nBrown. And it was Lyndon Johnson, a Texan, who told a joint session of \nCongress in 1965, ``We SHALL overcome!''\n  I have heard some of these pundits and politicians on television \ndebate where and when in America we can talk about this issue. They \nthink it is fine to stop and pat ourselves on the back on special days \nlike today or Martin Luther King Day or during Black History Month. But \nthey don't think we should talk about race and equality and civil \nrights any other time. But we need to talk about this everyday and \neverywhere.\n  Why? Because this is not an African-American issue. This is not a \nHispanic-American issue or an Asian-American issue. This is an American \nissue. It is about who we are. What our values are. What kind of \ncountry we want to live\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nin. What kind of country we want our children and grandchildren to live \nin.\n  We have come far, but we are not there yet.\n  We need leaders who not only talk the talk of civil rights and \nequality, but are willing to DO something about it. We need leaders who \nunderstand that 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education we still \nhave two public school systems in America: one for students who live in \naffluent communities and another for students who don't. There are \nstill students in our rural areas and in our cities who try to learn in \na crowded trailer, learn to read under a crumbling ceiling, and try to \nstudy science with equipment that ought to be seen only in their \nhistory books.\n  Yes, there are signs of hope. In my own State, for example, schools \nin Charlotte and Durham and elsewhere are raising test scores while \nalso closing the achievement gap.\n  But the truth is that while our best public schools are among the \nbest in the world--the state of many of our schools remains the shame \nof our Nation.\n  Education has made all the difference in my life. I was the first \nmember of my family to go to college. But millions of our children are \nbeing denied the opportunities I had.\n  Poor and minority students come to school with greater challenges, \nand our education system then turns around and gives them less of \neverything that matters. We spend less in their classrooms. We give \nthem fewer qualified teachers. And we teach them a weaker curriculum. \nOne Washington, DC, high school enrolls three times more students in \n``office reprographics''--training on photocopiers--than in pre-\ncalculus and calculus combined.\n  Millions of our young people drop out, turning their backs on their \nfutures. Minority students have only a 50-50 chance of finishing high \nschool.\n  Those who do make it to their senior year are four years behind their \npeers in reading and math. That's right--minority seniors test at the \nsame level as white eighth-graders.\n  And just last week, a judge in Topeka, KS, of all places, ordered the \npublic schools shut down because the funding was so inequitable that it \nutterly failed to serve the needs of poor, minority, disabled and non-\nEnglish speaking children.\n  In his opinion, Judge Bullock quoted directly from Brown: ``Today, \neducation is perhaps the most important function of State and local \ngovernments. . . . It is required in the performance of our most basic \npublic responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. . . . In \nthese days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to \nsucceed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such \nan opportunity, where the State has undertaken to provide it, must be \nmade available to all on equal terms.''\n  We have come far, but we are not there yet.\n  Fifty years later, we are still fighting that fight. But thank God we \nhave some courageous judges who uphold our civil rights laws and ensure \nequal justice for all. We have to continue to fight for judges who will \nenforce our civil rights laws and stand up for equality in America. We \nhave so much work to do with economic equality and educational \nequality. That takes leadership, not slogans and photo ops.\n  The administration can talk about ``No Child Left Behind'' all they \nwant. It is great rhetoric.\n  But the reality is that children are being left behind all over the \ncountry. They sit in the back of the classroom, wishing they could do \nbetter, but no one hears them, no one sees them. They walk the halls \nand go unnoticed because our schools are so crowded now that no one \nknows their names. They try their best, but drop out of high school--\nthey give up on their education because the education system has given \nup on them.\n  None of us would tolerate that for our own children. Well, these ARE \nour children. Every single one of them. Their failure is our failure. \nAnd their success is our success. We've got to do better by them. Yes \nwe must have high expectations of them. But as David Broder noted in a \nrecent column, we also have to provide the resources they need to meet \nthose standards.\n  And that takes real leadership not rhetoric. Real leadership is \ncourage, and commitment, and action. It means doing everything we can \nto make equality a reality--not only in our laws, but in our lives, in \ncommunities where poverty and discrimination remain a scar on our \nNation.\n  More than anything, leadership means recognizing that social justice \nis not a zero-sum game where ``we'' give something to ``them''--whether \nit's women or minorities or immigrants. The Brown decision was not \nabout some ``them.'' It was about ``us.'' All of us.\n  We have come so far, but we are not there yet.\n  I believe that the best way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Brown \ndecision is to push onward with all of the strength and determination \nwe can muster to ensure that the promise of Brown is finally realized. \nIt is time to honor those heroes who would not quit, who would not \nsettle for anything less than the right book to read, a school bus to \nride on, and a great teacher to guide them.\n  In moving forward, we honor the Little Rock Nine who walked passed \nangry mobs, and inspired the Nation with their grace. We honor James \nMeredith, who persevered despite the full weight of Mississippi \ndemanding that he stay home. We honor little Ruby Bridges, who needed \nU.S. Marshals to protect her from the wall of human hate that stood \nbetween her and her new school--a scene so compelling that Norman \nRockwell used it as the basis for his painting, ``The Problem We All \nLive With'' that I have hanging in one of my Senate offices. And all of \nthe families who joined the NAACP to take down Plessy vs. Ferguson once \nand for all.\n  When those walls were raised; when all the doors and gates were \nlocked, the African American community found its own gateway to a good \neducation. Despite all of the odds, despite those in power who said, \n``You can't have this chance,'' ordinary people stood together tall and \nstrong and said, ``Yes we can!''\n  These moments of history shadow us today. These heroes are looking \nright over our shoulders. They are urging us to move forward. They are \ntelling us, ``we've brought you this far, but you're not there yet.''\n  Our journey to one America is the greatest mission of our history. \nOur work, our effort, our commitment must be constant. I know mine is. \nTogether, from the heights of national power to every local Head Start \ncenter, we must strive to open doors, to make sure that there's always \na seat at the table, and the voices of all Americans will be heard.\n  I believe that wherever you live, whoever your family is, and \nwhatever the color of your skin is, if you are willing to work hard, \nyou ought to be able to go as far as your God-given talents and hard \nwork will take you. We believe in bringing people together. What we \nbelieve, what I believe, is that the family you are born into and the \ncolor of your skin will never control what you are able to do or how \nfar you can go in this, our America.\n  That is the America we should all believe in. That is the promise of \nthe Brown decision. And that is the America we can create, not just for \na precious few, but for everyone.\n  We have come far and we are not done, but I do believe that we WILL \nget there yet.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print an article from the Washington Post \nwritten by David Broder entitled ``Still Separate and Unequal.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 13, 2004]\n\n                       Still Separate and Unequal\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       In his ``two Americas'' stump speech--the single most \n     powerful message anyone delivered in the Democratic primaries \n     this winter--Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina talked \n     bluntly about the differences between the education, health \n     care, housing and other basics available to the well-off and \n     the working poor in this country.\n       ``We have two different school systems,'' Edwards said in \n     countless appearances, ``one for people in the most affluent \n     communities and another for everyone else.'' That message--\n     largely dismissed by the Bush White House and de-emphasized \n     by John Kerry in his reach for middle-class votes--is of \n     special relevance as the nation prepares to note the 50th \n     anniversary on Monday of the supreme Court decision that \n     formally ended racial segregation in our schools.\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\n       Brown v. Board of Education was a legal landmark, but the \n     reason that the anniversary is being observed, rather than \n     celebrated, is what Edwards had the courage to point out. In \n     far too many places, the notion of equal opportunity in \n     education is still far from reality.\n       In ``Beyond Brown v. Board: The Final Battle for Excellence \n     in American Education.'' written for the Rockefeller \n     Foundation and published this week, Ellis Cose of Newsweek \n     cities example after example of the holes that remain in the \n     system. ``[B]lacks (and Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans) \n     do not, for the most part, go to the same schools, or even \n     the same types of schools, as do the majority of non-Hispanic \n     whites,'' Cose wrote. ``They are more likely to go to schools \n     such as those found in parts of rural South Carolina; schools \n     that, were it not for the American flags proudly flying over \n     the roofs, might have been plucked out of some impoverished \n     country that see education as a luxury it can barely \n     afford.''\n       The law firm headed by Richard Riley, the former secretary \n     of education in the Clinton Cabinet, represents parents and \n     school officials in several of those poor South Carolina \n     counties in a lawsuit seeking to force the state to provide \n     more funds for those schools. With integration--the original \n     goal for the Brown decision--thwarted in many places by \n     residential segregation, resistance to busing and the growing \n     reluctance of federal courts to impose their orders, Cose \n     points out that the new legal battleground has become state \n     court lawsuits seeking ``adequacy'' in school funding.\n       The suits, which have begun to win scattered success in \n     states as diverse as New York, North Carolina, Arizona and \n     Idaho since the first breakthrough in Kentucky in 1989, ask \n     the courts to require that the state determine what it takes \n     to educate a child adequately--in staff, facilities, books \n     and equipment--and come up with the money to provide it.\n       The movements fits logically with the standards set in \n     President Bush's No Child Left Behind education reform. The \n     2002 law aims at either rescuing or shuttering low-performing \n     schools and especially at helping students who have been \n     shuffled through grades without really getting an education.\n       By measuring youngsters' competence in basic skills at \n     regular intervals and requiring adequate progress for all \n     parts of the school population--not just the bright \n     students--NCLB pressures states and districts to take steps \n     to eliminate education failures. And that in turn sets up a \n     demand for better principals and teachers and materials.\n       But standards by themselves will not end the two-track \n     education system. Resources have to flow to the schools and \n     districts that lack the tools they need. A recently published \n     ``Look Inside 33 School Districts'' by the Center on \n     Education Policy, an independent advocate for more effective \n     public schools, draws the contrast.\n       The Romulus, N.Y., school system, a small suburban district \n     between Rochester and Syracuse, has found no difficulty \n     meeting the first two years of NCLB requirements. ``The \n     district has taken steps to not only recruit well-qualified \n     teachers for any vacancies that arise, but also retain \n     them,'' the report says. ``Romulus has established an \n     extensive mentoring program that taps the expertise of \n     retired teachers by matching them in mentor relationships \n     with new teachers'' that continue for a full year. No \n     surprise, then, that ``Romulus students perform at high \n     levels.''\n       A few pages later in the report one finds the Cleveland \n     Municipal School District, whose officials ``applaud the \n     spirit of NCLB and agree that schools should be held \n     accountable'' but where ``implementation has been rocky.'' \n     The district could not reach its mandated improvement goals, \n     with 27 schools on a watch list for failing to meet \n     standards. Officials cannot say how many Cleveland teachers \n     rate as ``highly qualified.'' And state budget cuts cost \n     Cleveland schools $33 million in the current biennium.\n       The Romulus schools are 97 percent white; the Cleveland \n     schools, 80 percent non-white. Fifty years after Brown, John \n     Edwards' description still applies.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \nlandmark United States Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  On May 17, 1954, Justice Earl Warren read the unanimous decision of \nthe United States Supreme Court, which stated, ``We conclude that, in \nthe field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has \nno place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''\n  The decision made a statement about the course that this country \nneeded to take to achieve the greatness that we, as a Nation, are \ncapable of achieving. Brown v. Board of Education became the measure of \nequality--and a platform on which the civil rights era was born.\n  In December 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a \nMontgomery, AL, bus to a white person and was arrested. This sparked an \noutrage in the African American community, who decided to boycott the \ncity's buses as a way to challenge the city's segregation laws. The \nboycott led to a 1956 Supreme Court decision that banned segregated \nbuses.\n  In September 1957, the commitment to equality in education was \nreiterated in Little Rock, AK, when President Eisenhower sent troops to \nCentral High School to uphold the Supreme Court's desegregation order \nprotecting the rights of the ``Little Rock Nine.''\n  In 1960, four freshmen from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical \nCollege in Greensboro, NC, were refused service at a lunch counter at \nthe F.W. Woolworth Store. They sat quietly, without being served, until \nthe store's closing. The next day, they returned with 25 more students \nfrom the college. Peaceful protests at lunch counters across the \ncountry were initiated and lasted for weeks. The lunch counter protests \nresulted in a number of stores integrating prior to the passage of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\n  On October 1, 1962, federal officials escorted James Meredith, as he \nbecame the first African American to enroll at, and later graduate \nfrom, the University of Mississippi.\n  On August 28, 1963, hundreds of thousands of marchers--of all races--\ndescended on Washington, DC to urge Congress to pass legislation to \nprovide equal access to public facilities, quality education, \nsufficient employment and housing options for African Americans.\n  The Brown decision and the events flowing from it were major \ncatalysts that led the way for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n  While we must never lose sight of the benefit and the power of the \nBrown v. Board of Education decision, we must not believe that the \nfight for true equality is over and won.\n  Fifty years later, our country is struggling along the path toward a \ntruly equal society. Unfortunately, today, in many areas, we are still \nseparate and unequal. Individuals come to work in integrated \nenvironments and return home to segregated neighborhoods. Parents send \ntheir children to schools that seem to be returning to those \nreminiscent of the days of segregation.\n  The road to Brown v. Board of Education was not an easy one, nor was \nit swift. So, on this, the 50th Anniversary of the Brown v. Board of \nEducation decision, it is important that we not only recognize the \nstruggle behind the Civil Rights movement, but that we rededicate \nourselves to the goal of providing equal opportunity for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5601-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember and pay tribute \nto the late Senator Jacob Javits on what would have been his 100th \nbirthday. I have the honor of currently serving in his Senate seat and \nI remember Jack with the deepest admiration and affection. We shared \nmany passions, and one true love--New York and its citizens.\n  Jack did both jobs of Senator so well. He was a big thinker, a \ncompassionate and visionary legislator, an important actor in global \naffairs. But when an ordinary citizen or a non-profit group or \nstruggling company in New York needed his help, he was there. And that \nwas his legacy; he made all our lives better.\n  Born in a tenement on the lower east side of Manhattan on May 18, \n1904, Jack was the son of Jewish immigrant parents from Galicia and the \nTurkish Empire. He was educated in New York City's public schools, \nattended night classes at Columbia University and graduated from New \nYork University Law School in 1926. From there he practiced law in New \nYork City until joining the Army in 1941. Javits served in both Europe \nand the Pacific during World War II and was discharged as a lieutenant \ncolonel in 1945. After the war, Jack resumed practicing law until he \nran for office in 1946.\n  In 1946, Jack was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in New \nYork's traditionally Democratic 21st District, which included \nManhattan's upper west side, home to Columbia University. He served in \nthe House for 8 years and had a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. \nHe then served as New York's attorney general from 1954 to 1956. In \n1956, Jack won election to the United States Senate, defeating New York \nCity Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. He would go on to serve 24 years in \nthe Senate, tied with Senator Moynihan for the longest service of any \nNew York Senator.\n  He served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1969, later \nattaining the position of ranking Republican member. His service on \nthat committee would spur a lifelong interest and involvement with \nforeign affairs and particularly Israel. He also served as ranking \nmember of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Although he had a long and distinguished Senate career, Jack was most \nbeloved and admired for his courageous efforts in the civil rights \nstruggle. From his very first days in the Senate, Jack was a courageous \nleader in the fight against segregation and racial discrimination. He \ncampaigned passionately for passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act and \nplayed a major role in the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of \n1964 and in other civil rights legislation that followed.\n  During the Vietnam era, Jack became a major critic of the war, and \nsubsequently, one of his major concerns became the question of who has \nthe power to make war. Jack was a primary sponsor of the War Powers \nResolution of 1973, which reestablished congressional responsibility, \nrather than presidential, to commit U.S. armed forces abroad in the \nabsence of a formal declaration of war.\n  He was deeply troubled that the Congress had in many ways abdicated \nits proper role during the Vietnam War. I think many of us today share \nthe very same concerns that Jack had some 30 years ago. For Jack cared \ndeeply about the U.S. Senate, its debates, its constitutional \nauthority. Its Members were his best friends. It did not matter whether \nhe agreed with them or if they challenged or even attacked him--they \nwere all his colleagues.\n  Jack once said of the Senate, ``I was stimulated by the ebb and flow \nof debate and the philosophic tensions of the work we did--balancing \nlofty principles against sectional or selfish interests, welding \ntogether antagonistic human and economic and ideological forces into \nthe coherent schemes of governance that we call laws.'' Jack respected \nthe Members of the Senate with a full heart and his great affection for \nthem was returned in full measure.\n  A 1981 New York Times article remarked, ``whether or not you agreed \nwith him on a given issue, you always knew that Mr. Javits was one of \nthe brightest, hardest working and most effective elected officials in \nWashington in our time.''\n  After leaving the Senate in 1980, Jack visited and corresponded with \nmany of his former political colleagues and maintained his interest in \nforeign affairs. In 1981, he served as special advisor on foreign \npolicy issues of then Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr. He was \na member of the American Jewish Commission on the Holocaust and wrote \nnumerous articles on international matters in publications such as the \nNew York Times, Newsday, and Foreign Affairs.\n  The last project of his final, heroic years combined those elements \nthat meant most to him. Jack created the concept of the Javits Senate \nFellowship, a program that made available to the Senate many of the \nfinest graduate students in public policy that our country could \nproduce.\n  He asked these students of outstanding academic background to carry \nout his commitment to excellence in public service, to learn firsthand \nabout the Senate and to bring to their own lives the values and \nexperience which they had gained in the Senate. Many of these young \npeople have gone on to very distinguished careers and accomplishments.\n  Jack knew that, in truth, the best way to be remembered would be \nthrough the accomplishments of the next generation, through those who \nwould carry forward his spirit, his commitment to public service, and \nhis abiding respect for, and love of, the United States Senate.\n  We remember Jack with deep admiration on what would have been his \n100th birthday. His accomplishments for New York and the Nation will \nlong be honored and remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5602-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5602-S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATION OF MAJOR GENERAL DAVID H. PETRAEUS\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments to talk \nabout the nomination of Major General David H. Petraeus to be \nLieutenant General in the U.S. Army.\n  I believe President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld have made an \nexcellent decision to promote General Petraeus and assign him to chief \nof the Office of Security Transition in Iraq. I congratulate General \nPetraeus and wholeheartedly support his nomination.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has moved so quickly on his nomination. \nWe received it 2 weeks ago and he was confirmed yesterday. This is \nfitting because last Friday he transferred command of the 101st \nAirborne Division, Air Assault, to his successor at the helm of the \nScreaming Eagles.\n  General Petraeus led the 101st Airborne to stunning success in Iraq. \nHis division performed superbly in combat, and is responsible for \nbringing Saddam Hussein's two ruthless sons to justice. Unfortunately, \nthe division also suffered the largest number of combat casualties in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Equally impressive to the combat performance of the division under \nGeneral Petraeus were the successes in rebuilding the governing \nstructures and the hope of the Iraqi people in a significant portion of \nthe country. Six days\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nafter occupying the northern part of Iraq the first meetings were held \nto set up Province Council elections and those elections were held one \nweek later. The division worked with Iraqis to quickly restore power, \nwater, fuel, transportation, and industry. They set the model for \ncooperating with the local leaders and population to create a stable \nand prosperous Iraq. This all happened because of the leadership of \nGeneral Petraeus.\n  I visited General Petraeus and the Screaming Eagles in Iraq earlier \nthis year. I saw firsthand the results of his careful preparation and \nskillful execution of a plan to bring order and governance to the \npeople of northern Iraq. I was, and remain, impressed by what I saw.\n  Because he was so successful leading the 101st Airborne in Iraq, \nGeneral Petraeus has been assigned back to Iraq for the transition of \npower to the interim Iraqi government. I have no doubts that he is the \nright man for the job and will help the Iraqi transition to self-\ngovernment proceed smoothly.\n  Again, I want to congratulate General Petraeus and wish him well in \nhis new assignment. He is blessed with a wonderful family at home who \nwill be eagerly awaiting his return. I thank him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5603-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING AUSTRALIA FTA\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, May 18, 2004, is a historic day for \nU.S.-Australia bilateral relations. A landmark agreement on free trade \nwas reached today between the United States and Australia.\n  I believe the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is good for \nAmerica. An FTA with the world's 15th largest economy will bring \nsubstantial benefits to my state of Oregon and to the whole U.S. \neconomy. Australia is an industrialized nation with a high standard of \nliving that is already a large market for U.S. exports valued at over \n$23 billion annually. The Australia FTA will boost U.S. manufacturing \nand create U.S. manufacturing jobs by reducing 99 percent of all \nAustralian tariffs to zero. For the first time, the United States will \nhave a significant advantage over European and Japanese competitors in \nthe Australian market. U.S. goods and services will be able to compete \nfairly with other foreign exports in the lucrative Australian \nmarketplace. This will be worth over $2 billion a year to U.S. \nmanufacturers.\n  U.S. agricultural exports to Australia will grow by $700 million, as \ntariffs on all agricultural goods are zeroed out under the FTA; this is \nmoney in the bank for U.S. farmers.\n  Australia is an important market for my home State of Oregon. \nAustralia is the 10th largest export market, and is particularly \nimportant for high quality manufactured goods. Western Star--a \nsubsidiary of DaimlerChrysler--located in Portland, OR would save \nnearly $2 million a year in eliminated tariffs and duties that average \n$4,000 per truck exported to Australia. This money could be reinvested \nin expanded production and opportunities for workers in my home State \nof Oregon.\n  Trade with Australia also supports numerous other high-paying jobs in \nareas such as transportation, finance and advertising. Furthermore, \nOregon exports over $39 million per year in computers and electronic \nproducts. Access to 19 million potential customers is no small deal for \nOregon businesses.\n  Furthermore, Australia is the ideal trading partner for the United \nStates. It is an advanced, efficient high wage economy with dependable \nlegal and financial regimes. It has labor and environment standards \ncomparable to the United States. A free trade agreement with Australia \njust simply makes good sense.\n  The FTA will only strengthen our relationship with a close ally. \nAustralia and the United States have been true allies through good \ntimes and bad. We have fought together in every major conflict in the \nlast 100 years to defend peace and security. We must stand steadfast \nwith our ally, not only in the defense of peace, but also in the \nprospect and benefits of free trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5603-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             JASON METCALFE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

He has been a passionate \nadvocate on behalf of his son, raising awareness and promoting research \nefforts that offer the prospect of a cure for traumatic brain injury. \nThe Benigno's founded the Coalition for Brain Injury Research, which \nhas donated more than $125,000 in the past 2 years to the study of \nbrain cell repair. They raise funds through walkathons and a lecture \nseries, and Mr. Benigno has traveled throughout the country for \nresearch dollars.\n  Mr. Benigno has also turned to his elected representatives in New \nJersey and Washington, DC. His efforts have led to the creation of the \nCongressional Brain Injury Task Force, co-chaired by my good friend \nCongressman Bill Pascrell. For the last 6 years, Mr. Benigno has also \nlobbied local, State, and Federal legislators to support legislation \nthat would create a dedicated source of funding for medical research \ninto traumatic brain injuries.\n  His work has begun to pay off. On January 2 of this year, Governor \nMcGreevey signed the Brain Injury Research Act into law. With this \nlegislation, New Jersey becomes the first State in the Nation to create \na funding stream for researchers devising treatments and cures for \nbrain injuries. The act is expected to raise more than $3 million a \nyear for brain injury research from a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle \npenalties.\n  Dennis John is one of more than 5.3 million Americans who currently \nsuffer disabilities from brain injury, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control, CDC. Every year, 200,000 people sustain brain \ninjuries, a number that exceeds the incidence of HIV/AIDS and breast \ncancer. Right now, there is no cure. In fact, brain injuries are the \nonly catastrophic illness for which scientists have yet to readily \nidentify a cure as their research goal. The Brain Injury Research Act, \nfinally, offers hope to the hundreds of thousands who suffer from brain \ninjuries that an effective therapy may be in sight.\n  While religious authorities, ethics scholars, and we here in the \nhalls of government continue to debate the implications of stem and \nfetal cell research, the Benigno's remain focused\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\non one thing--supporting the research efforts that may find a cure for \ntheir son and others like him. As we make decisions that have the power \nto spark or extinguish the hopes of millions that the cures they pray \nfor may be found, we should keep the Benigno's in mind.\n  One point is very clear--this new law and the hope it nurtures are a \ncredit to Mr. Benigno's dedication, courage, and perseverance. He is an \ninspiration to all of us, and a testament to what one determined \ncitizen can achieve in our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5604-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MR. WILLIAM B. SCHATZ\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Mr. \nWilliam B. Schatz, General Counsel of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer \nDistrict, NEORSD, in Cleveland, OH. Mr. Schatz currently serves as the \nDistrict's representative to the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage \nAgencies, AMSA, and on May 24, 2004, will become president of this \norganization. Mr. Schatz was elected AMSA president based on his \nexemplary commitment and dedication to the clean water community in \nOhio and throughout our Nation.\n  AMSA's mission is to effectively maintain a strong leadership role in \nthe development and implementation of scientifically sound, cost-\neffective, and environmentally friendly policies for the protection of \npublic health and the environment. This month, AMSA celebrates 34 years \nof dedicated service to improving water quality nationwide.\n  Mr. Schatz has served with distinction at NEORSD since 1979 and for \nover 20 years has been a leader in the water quality arena, working on \nmany projects on behalf of NEORSD and AMSA. He has served as the ad hoc \nlegal advisor to the Association of Ohio Metropolitan Wastewater \nAgencies, a member of the Advisory Board of the National Enforcement \nTraining Institute, and a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency's Quality Review Committee on Grant Audits. At AMSA, Mr. Schatz \nhas served as chairman of both the Legal Affairs Committee and Joint \nAMSA-Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies Insurance Committee, a \nleader of the Wastewater Infrastructure Funding Task Force, and as a \nmember of AMSA's Board of Directors.\n  Mr. Schatz was instrumental in establishing NEORSD as a leading \nagency in the wastewater industry and in helping to guide its capital \nprograms. Mr. Schatz was also an influential leader in convincing \nCongress to fund the conversion of NEORSD's physical chemical Westerly \nPlant in Cleveland, Ohio, to a conventional biological process. \nThroughout his career, Mr. Schatz has played an important role in \nhelping to shape critical national policy issues on infrastructure \nfunding, enforcement, and construction grant audit appeals.\n  Mr. Schatz has been of great assistance to me in my efforts in the \nUnited States Senate to bring attention to our Nation's vital water \ninfrastructure needs. He is a well-known leader and someone who, day in \nand day out, goes above and beyond the call of duty. William B. Schatz \nhas made a significant contribution to improving water infrastructure \nprograms across America.\n  On behalf of the people of Ohio, I am pleased to commend William B. \nSchatz for his extraordinary efforts to improve public health and the \nenvironment and I congratulate him on being elected president of the \nAssociation of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5604-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PIONEER HIGH SCHOOL AND ITS AWARD-WINNING MUSIC PROGRAM\n\n Mr LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncongratulate the staff and students of Pioneer High School in Ann \nArbor, Michigan, for the school's designation as a 2004 GRAMMY \nSignature School. Pioneer is one of 41 high schools nationwide being \nhonored by the GRAMMY Foundation for making an outstanding commitment \nto music education during the 2003-2004 school year. I am also pleased \nto note that Pioneer's program was placed in the gold category, making \nit among the seven best in the Nation.\n  Established in 1989, the GRAMMY Foundation engages in programs and \nactivities that cultivate the understanding and appreciation of \nrecorded music and its impact on American culture. The GRAMMY Signature \nSchool program, with the most enthusiastic support of Dr. Pepper/7 Up, \nInc., honors schools that recognize the positive effects that the arts \nand music have on young people and rewards these schools with a \nfinancial grant that assists them in continuing their exemplary music \nprograms into the following school year.\n  Last fall, the foundation contacted more than 20,000 public high \nschools to learn more about each school's music program. Competing with \nlarge and small institutions situated in rural and urban communities \nacross America, Pioneer High School submitted its application to a \npanel comprised of top music educators and professionals. Its vocal and \ninstrumental repertoire distinguished Pioneer as a secondary school \ncommitted to providing its students with an exceptional music \neducation. As one of the gold category schools, Pioneer will receive a \ngrant of $5,000 that will help the music department preserve and \nenhance its already remarkable music program.\n  Providing an excellent music education for students enriches the \nentire learning experience. It is my honor to thank the staff and \nadministrators at Pioneer who are responsible for supporting a solid \nfoundation of music appreciation. I also wish to thank the young \nmusicians who willingly dedicate their time and energy toward enhancing \ntheir own music abilities and urge them to share their love of music \nwith the following generations. I am confident my colleagues will join \nme in offering our heartfelt congratulations for this outstanding \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5604-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5604-S5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION'S TRUDEAU MEDAL WINNER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Maine relative to the United States Postal Service; \n     to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the United States Postal Service, founded in 1775, \n     provides a means for commerce and communications and provides \n     postal services to all communities, rich and poor, urban and \n     rural, with uniform postage rates and it has for nearly 230 \n     years provided dependable, affordable mail service. The \n     United States Postal Service remains an important part of our \n     nation's economic infrastructure through which nearly $1 \n     trillion of economic activity is conducted each year and in \n     which 9,000,000 people are employed; and\n       Whereas, Americans currently enjoy the most extensive \n     postal service at the lowest postage rates of any major \n     industrialized nation in the world, and excessive below-cost \n     postage discounts to large business and advertising mailers \n     unnecessarily drain billions of dollars of revenue from the \n     United States Postal Service and ultimately cause small \n     businesses and ordinary citizens to subsidize those discounts \n     through higher postage rates. Millions of older, disabled and \n     economically disadvantaged Americans do not have easy access \n     to the Internet or to electronic banking and bill paying and \n     therefore are heavily dependent on the United States Postal \n     Service for communication and the conducting of business \n     transactions; and\n       Whereas, the President created the President's commission \n     on the United States Postal Service, which has recommended \n     far-reaching changes to postal operations and services, \n     including severing postal employees from federal employee \n     health, retirement and workers' compensation programs, and \n     the repeal of certain existing laws, which would pave the way \n     towards reducing rank-and-file wages and benefits while \n     eliminating the current salary cap on executive-level postal \n     positions in order to raise postal executive pay on par with \n     that of corporate CEOs and the commission has recommended a \n     new President-appointed, corporate-style board of directors \n     and the new Postal Regulatory Board that would give these new \n     politically appointed governing bodies broad authority to set \n     rates without prior approval, review and refine the scope of \n     the United States Postal Service's universal service \n     obligation and uniform rate structure and change and restrict \n     the scope of services currently protected under postal \n     monopoly regulations; and\n       Whereas, this broad authority would allow post offices to \n     be closed without community input and prices to be set with a \n     complicated postage rate structure or would even turn over \n     postal operations to private for-profit enterprises despite a \n     recent survey whose respondents had an overwhelmingly \n     favorable view of the United States Postal Service, with 3 \n     out of 4 saying no major changes are needed and 3 out of 10 \n     saying the United States Postal Service works extremely well \n     as is; and\n       Whereas, replacing the United States Postal Service's \n     public service obligation with a profit-seeking mandate would \n     undermine the United States Postal Service's historical \n     ``universal service'' obligation, weaken its national \n     infrastructure and divide our nation politically and \n     economically, and here in the District of Maine, the United \n     States Postal Service has unilaterally implemented a cost-\n     saving reduction of hours and access that restricts customer \n     service by curtailing hours; and\n       Whereas, this program has reduced hours of service at over \n     50% of post offices in Maine, severely affecting customer \n     service, without regard to customers' input and complaints. \n     Maine is a rural state and our elderly and disabled citizens \n     depend on postal services: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, request that the \n     President of the United States, Congress and the United \n     States Postal Service continue to maintain affordable, \n     dependable mail service at current levels because of its \n     social and economic importance to our nation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we oppose any effort to undermine the United \n     States Postal Service's universal service obligation and its \n     uniform rate structure, that the service hours be returned to \n     where they were before the report of the President's \n     Commission on the United States Postal Service and prior to \n     the implementation of the Small Post Office Reviews and \n     Standardization Program and that any recommendation from the \n     presidential commission that curtails public services related \n     to our current postal service be rejected; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, go on record against \n     any changes that would harm the workers of the United States \n     Postal Service, including legislation to close small offices, \n     take away or modify the collective bargaining system of \n     postal workers or change the current bargaining system for \n     employees benefits; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\n     States; the Postmaster General, United States Postal Service; \n     the Honorable Richard Cheney, President of the United States \n     Senate; the Honorable Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives; and each Member of the Maine \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-447.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2003; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 113\n\n       Whereas, An estimated 26,000 Americans care for one or more \n     adult family members or friends who are disabled, chronically \n     ill, or terminally ill. In addition, almost 25 percent of the \n     nation's elderly experience multiple chronic disabling \n     conditions that make it necessary to rely on others for help \n     in meeting their daily needs; and\n       Whereas, Every year approximately 600,000 Americans die at \n     home and many of these individuals rely on extensive family \n     caregiving before their deaths. The family caregiver role is \n     personally rewarding, but it can result in substantial \n     emotional, physical, and financial hardship. Of those \n     individuals needing assistance in daily living, nearly 42 \n     percent are under the age of 65; and\n       Whereas, Current respite care programs are insufficient to \n     meet the needs of this underserved population. Moreover, the \n     limited available respite care programs find it difficult to \n     recruit appropriately trained respite workers; and\n       Whereas, The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2003 will \n     encourage the creation of state and local lifespan care \n     programs. It will help improve the coordination and \n     dissemination of respite care information and resources to \n     family caregivers. It will also support evaluative research \n     to identify effective respite care services that alleviate, \n     reduce, or minimize any negative consequences of caregiving. \n     Further, the act will promote innovative, flexible, and \n     comprehensive approaches to respite care delivery and support \n     training programs helping family caregivers to make informed \n     decisions about respite care services; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan House of Representatives has begun \n     work on legislation that complements the Lifespan Respite \n     Care Act. With its passage, Michigan will be better prepared \n     to assist individuals in caregiving: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Congress to support the Lifespan Respite Care \n     Act of 2003; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-449. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Vermont relative to the No Child \n     Left Behind Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n     and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, Vermont has established high academic standards \n     for its students in the areas of reading, language arts, \n     mathematics, social sciences, science and technology, civics, \n     arts, and health, and\n       Whereas, Vermont has established and implemented rigorous \n     tests to measure achievement of its standards in reading, \n     language arts, and mathematics and consequences for schools \n     whose students fail to do well on the tests, and\n       Whereas, as a result of Vermont's insistence on rigorous \n     standards and testing, Vermont students do very well on \n     national tests; for example, Vermont students scored as \n     follows on the National Assessment of Education Progress \n     tests in 2003: 4th grade math--highest average score in the \n     nation, 4th grade reading--second highest average score in \n     the nation, 8th grade math--3rd highest average score in the \n     nation, 8th grade reading--2nd highest average score in the \n     nation, and\n       Whereas, the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of \n     2001 requires all states to develop high academic standards \n     in reading and math only, and to hold schools accountable for \n     student achievement of only those standards, and\n       Whereas, Congress has not provided sufficient funds for \n     Vermont schools to successfully implement NCLB, thereby \n     forcing them to direct resources away from Vermont's system \n     of comprehensive standards and assessments, a system which \n     has resulted in some of the highest test scores in the \n     nation, and\n       Whereas, NCLB represents sweeping federal intrusion into \n     state and local control of education, violating the time-\n     honored American principle of balanced federalism and respect \n     for state and local prerogatives, especially in the crucial \n     area of education: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That Congress be asked to amend the \n     No Child Left Behind Act immediately to include a mechanism \n     for a waiver from its provisions for school acountablity that \n     shall automatically be granted to states whose systems of \n     standards and accountability result in high student \n     achievement; and be it further\n       Resolved, That such waiver be available to these states so \n     long as they maintain their successful standards and \n     accountability programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the member of the Vermont Congressional \n     Delegation.\n       POM-450. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the Employee \n     Free Choice Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 77\n\n       Whereas, in 1935, the United States established, by law, \n     that workers must be free to form unions; and\n       Whereas, the freedom to form or join a union is \n     internationally recognized as a fundamental human right; and\n       Whereas, union membership provides workers better wages and \n     benefits, and protection from discrimination and unsafe \n     workplaces; and\n       Whereas, unions benefit communities by strengthening tax \n     bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic \n     participation; and\n       Whereas, workers want to organize, but are unable to, since \n     more than forty million United States workers say they would \n     join a union now if they had the opportunity; and\n       Whereas, even though, on paper, America's workers have the \n     freedom to choose for themselves whether to have a union, in \n     reality, workers across the nation are routinely denied that \n     right; and\n       Whereas, when the right of workers to form a union is \n     violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, \n     workplace discrimination increases, and job safety standards \n     disappear; and\n       Whereas, many thousands of America's workers are routinely \n     threatened, coerced, or fired each year because they attempt \n     to form a union; and\n       Whereas, most violations of workers' freedom to choose a \n     union occur behind closed doors and each year millions of \n     dollars are spent to frustrate workers' efforts to form \n     unions; and\n       Whereas, a worker's fundamental right to choose a union is \n     a public issue that requires public policy solutions, \n     including legislative remedies; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Free Choice Act (S. 1925 and H.R. \n     3619) has been introduced in the United States Congress in \n     order to restore workers freedom to join a union; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Free Choice Act has received broad \n     bipartisan support with over two hundred congressional \n     members as co-sponsors; and\n       Whereas, at its March 17 meeting, the Hawaii State AFL-CIO \n     Executive Board unanimously endorsed the Employee Free Choice \n     Act: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, That this body \n     supports the Employee Free Choice Act (S. 1925 and H.R. \n     3619), which would:\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\n       (1) Authorize the National Labor Relations Board to certify \n     a union as the bargaining representative when a majority of \n     employees voluntarily sign authorizations designating that \n     union to represent them;\n       (2) Provide for first contract mediation and arbitration; \n     and\n       (3) Establish meaningful penalties for violations of a \n     worker's freedom to choose a union; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this body urges Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation to support the Employee Free Choice Act and to \n     impel the United States Congress to pass this measure to \n     protect America's workers and preserve their freedom to \n     choose for themselves whether or not to form a union; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-451. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to Christopher Kangas; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary\n\n                        House Resolution No. 579\n\n       Whereas, On September 11, 2002, Hearing Examiner Doug Dodge \n     of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in the Department of \n     Justice determined that Christopher Kangas was not a public \n     safety officer within the meaning of the Public Safety \n     Officers' Benefits Act of 1976; and\n       Whereas, This ruling denies his survivors benefits under \n     the act and means that Christopher is ineligible to be \n     memorialized on the wall of the National Fallen Firefighter's \n     Memorial in Emmitsburg, Maryland; and\n       Whereas, The ruling has shocked and dismayed the Brookhaven \n     Fire Department in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, whose fire \n     chief, Rob Montella, has claimed: ``He was a firefighter . . \n     . what he was legally allowed to do, Chris did''; and\n       Whereas, When his last fire alarm sounded, Christopher \n     Kangas, a junior firefighter for Brookhaven and 14 years of \n     age, hopped on his bicycle to answer the call; and\n       Whereas, When he died of head injuries after being hit by a \n     car while answering that call on May 4, 2002, he received a \n     full hero's send-off and was laid to rest in a Class A \n     fireman's uniform at a funeral steeped in honor and fire \n     service tradition and attended by firemen from as far away as \n     Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, Flags at the National Fallen Firefighter's \n     Memorial flew at half-staff in his honor and memory; and\n       Whereas, Rob Montella himself, State Fire Commissioner Ed \n     Mann and Brookhaven line officers Dave Zamonski and Charles \n     Leslie, first and second assistant chiefs, respectively, \n     began their volunteer firefighting service answering fire \n     calls as junior firefighters on bicycles, and Mr. Montella \n     has said that Christopher was a firefighter who had a full \n     set of gear, attended all training sessions, answered the \n     calls and was in compliance with the Pennsylvania Junior \n     Emergency Service Compliance Manual; and\n       Whereas, Upon Christopher's death, his mother became \n     eligible for and received State and borough benefits because \n     he had died in the line of duty, but under Hearing Examiner \n     Dodge's September 11, 2002, opinion, he was denied Federal \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, This decision has concerned all firefighters who \n     have learned of it, as it narrows the definition of \n     firefighter and restricts their benefits; Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President of the \n     United States and the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation \n     to do all in their power to encourage the United States \n     Department of Justice to review its September 11, 2002, \n     refusal to classify Christopher Kangas as a ``public safety \n     officer'' under the Public Safety Benefits Act of 1976; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States and to each member of \n     Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5607-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Talent, and Mr. \n             Schumer):\n       S. 2430.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to diabetes self-management training by designating \ncertified diabetes educators recognized by the National Certification \nBoard of Diabetes Educators as certified providers for purposes of \noutpatient diabetes education services under part B of the medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce an important \npiece of legislation that will correct an oversight from the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. In 1997, Congress created a new diabetes benefit \nunder Medicare--diabetes self-management training--but did not create a \nnew provider group to deliver it. Congress assumed that the existing \ndiabetes education programs in hospitals would be able provide services \nto all who were in need.\n  Certified Diabetes Educators, CDEs, were not given the ability to \nbill Medicare directly for diabetes self-management training when \nCongress passed the new benefit in 1997 because they did not feel there \nwas a need to create a new provider since CDEs could work within a \nhospital setting and receive reimbursement through hospital billing. \nHowever, due to changing health care economics, hospital diabetes self-\nmanagement training programs have been closing at an alarming rate, \nforcing patients to seek other avenues for obtaining diabetes self-\nmanagement training, such as clinics and stand-alone programs.\n  While small in scope, the Diabetes Self-Management Training Act of \n2004 will correct this oversight to ensure our Nation's seniors with \ndiabetes have access to this important benefit.\n  Diabetes education is very important in my State of Nebraska. \nAccording to the Nebraska Health and Human Services System, about five \npercent of Nebraska's adults have diagnosed diabetes--or about 60,000 \npeople. An additional 20,000 Nebraskans probably have diabetes but have \nnot been diagnosed. While diabetes rates continue to grow at an \nalarming rate, lack of access to diabetes-self management training, \nwhich is critical to controlling diabetes and preventing secondary \ncomplications, has also become a chronic problem. Despite the fact that \ntwenty percent of Medicare patients have diabetes, and about a quarter \nof all Medicare spending goes to treat diabetes and diabetes-related \nconditions, less than one-third of eligible patients are currently \nreceiving the benefit.\n  Because CDEs are not able to bill Medicare directly for diabetes \nself-management training, patients have limited options for obtaining \nthe training they need to successfully manage their disease and prevent \nexpensive and debilitating complications. The potential for \ncomplications is enormous. If patients with diabetes cannot gain access \nto diabetes self-management training, serious complications will arise, \nsuch as kidney disease, amputations, vision loss, and severe cardiac \ndisease. In fact, half of all Medicare dialysis patients suffer from \ndiabetes.\n  By improving access to this important benefit, I believe we will take \nan important step toward helping patients control their diabetes, which \nwill not only save the Medicare program the significant costs \nassociated with the complications from uncontrolled diabetes, but more \nimportantly it will dramatically improve the quality of life for the \nmillions of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. That is why I am so \nproud to introduce this bi-partisan legislation, the Diabetes Self-\nManagement Training Act of 2004, along with my colleague Senator \nHutchison.\n  Throughout the Medicare debate last year, one of the top \nconsiderations for all Senators was the cost of the legislation and the \nlong-term solvency of the Medicare program. In fact, we passed new \nprograms in that legislation to begin studying new health care delivery \nmodels like Medicare that will improve the outcomes for beneficiaries \nwith chronic diseases. While I strongly supported those new \ndemonstration programs, we need not wait to begin helping our seniors.\n  With diabetes already directly affecting so many seniors, and the \nbaby boomers on the horizon, we cannot afford to deny seniors access to \nproven programs like diabetes self-management training any longer. I \nlook forward to working to pass this legislation and help those with \ndiabetes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Nelson to \nintroduce an important piece of legislation that will dramatically \nimprove the quality of diabetes care under the Medicare program.\n  Diabetes is a serious, debilitating chronic illness that afflicts \nmore than 18 million Americans, including eight million Medicare \nbeneficiaries. An additional eight million seniors suffer from a \ncondition known as ``pre-diabetes'' that, when left untreated, will \ndevelop into diabetes. Diabetes' devastating complications--kidney \nfailure, blindness, lower extremity amputation, heart disease and \nstroke--result in significant costs to the program. Although \nbeneficiaries with diabetes comprise only 20 percent of the Medicare \npopulation, diabetes related complications account for more than 30 \npercent of medicare expenditures.\n  This is indeed troubling, and there is much that can be done to \nreduce the burden of diabetes and prevent these costly complications. \nDiabetes self-management training, DSMT, helps people with diabetes \nlearn the skills they need to manage the daily regimen of diet, \nexercise, meal planning, medication and monitoring necessary to keep \nblood sugar under control. Certified Diabetes Educators, CDEs, are \nhighly trained healthcare professionals--often nurses, pharmacists, or \ndieticians--who specialize in helping people with diabetes develop \nthese skills. A CDE must be a licensed health care professional, \npossess a minimum of two years of professional practice experience in \nDSMT, have provided a minimum of 1,000 hours of DSMT to patients in the \npast five years, and have passed a rigorous national examination.\n  The value of DSMT is well documented. The Diabetes Prevention Program \nstudy of 2002 demonstrated that participants, all of whom were at \nincreased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, were able to reduce that \nrisk by implementing the lifestyle changes taught as part of DSMT. \nAdditional studies have found that patients with diabetes achieved \nsignificantly better outcomes when taking part in comprehensive \ndiabetes management programs.\n  Congress recognized the value of DSMT when it provided for this \nbenefit under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. At that time, CDEs were \nable to provide DSMT through hospital-based programs, billing under the \nhospital's provider number. Unfortunately, hospital-based DSMT programs \nare closing at a rate of two to five per month, leaving people with \ndiabetes without access to this life-saving benefit. Our legislation \nwould correct this problem by allowing CDEs to be recognized as \nproviders under the Medicare program for the purposes of providing \nDSMT. This would provide CDEs with the flexibility they need to ensure \nthat beneficiaries can access these critical services.\n  As it is, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, CMS, \nestimates that only 30 percent of beneficiaries are utilizing the \nbenefit. More must be done to increase access to life-saving DSMT \nprograms. Our legislation will help to accomplish that goal.\n  Diabetes already poses a serious burden for the Medicare program. As \nthe 76 million baby-boomers age into the Medicare program, the cost of \ndiabetes related complications could seriously undermine the financial \nstability of the Medicare program. We must act now to strengthen \nMedicare to ensure that beneficiaries with diabetes have the tools they \nneed to prevent diabetes complications.\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 2433. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nself-employed individuals to deduct health insurance costs in computing \nself-employment taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today my colleague, Senator Thomas, and \nI are introducing the ``Equity for Our Nation's Self-Employed Act of \n2004.'' This legislation would reduce the cost of health insurance for \nthe self-employed by allowing these workers to exclude the cost of \ntheir health insurance from their income for purposes of calculating \ntheir payroll taxes. Although the self-employed are now allowed an \nincome tax deduction for the amount they pay for health insurance, they \nmust still calculate their payroll taxes as if they were not allowed \nthis income tax deduction. Essentially, the self-employed are paying \npayroll taxes on the amount they pay for health insurance. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would stop this inequitable tax \ntreatment and allow the self-employed to deduct the amount they pay for \nhealth insurance from their calculation of payroll taxes.\n  This problem affects all self-employed who provide health insurance \nto their families. According to the Census Bureau, there are almost \n74,000 self-employed workers in New Mexico. While we have no idea how \nmany of these people in New Mexico have health insurance, we do know \nthat roughly 3.6 million working families in the United States paid \nself-employment tax on their health insurance premiums. Estimates \nindicate that roughly 60 percent of our Nation's uninsured are either \nself-employed or work for a small business. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, self-employed workers spend more than $9,000 per \nyear to provide health insurance for their family. Because they cannot \ndeduct this as an ordinary business expense, those that spend this \namount will pay a 15.3 percent payroll tax on their premiums resulting \nin almost $1,400 of taxes annually.\n  This problem was identified by the National Taxpayer Advocate in \nseveral of her annual reports to Congress and is supported by a variety \nof groups including the National Association for the Self-employed, the \nNational Small Business Association, the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, and the Small Business Legislative Council.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nlegislation passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 2434. A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of a National Museum of the American Latino Community to \ndevelop a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a \nNational Museum of the American Latino Community in Washington, D.C., \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncreate a national commission to study the potential establishment of a \nNational Museum of the American Latino Community in Washington, D.C.\n  I am pleased to introduce this measure today, and I am joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Barbara Boxer, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Jeff \nBingaman, all of whom have worked extensively with the Hispanic \ncommunity on issues of importance.\n  The Hispanic community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the \nUnited States, and in my home State of Utah, Hispanics now account for \nnearly 10 percent of the population. Utah is a wonderful mosaic, \nencompassing a diverse number of peoples and cultures, and in fact, the \nlatest census shows that Utah's Hispanic population has nearly doubled \nsince 1990. But this phenomenon is not just happening in Utah.\n  It is clear we are seeing remarkable growth in our Nation's Hispanic \npopulation. And with this growth, we need to recognize and find ways to \nbetter highlight the accomplishments of Latinos over their rich history \nin America. We need to express the importance of diversity, pride, and \nthe sharing of the cultures that contribute to the vibrancy and \nsplendor of our Nation.\n  Every day we are reminded of the fact that Latinos are among our \nNation's largest minorities, and numbers do have meaning. It is my \nbelief that Latinos in America exhibit a strong desire--a commitment to \nbuilding a nation where people are judged by their actions and not by \ntheir accents. They believe in the work ethic, patriotism, the \nimportance of families, the free enterprise system, and the value of \nfaith; they believe in these things and they experience these tenets, \nas they live them day in and day out here in America.\n  I believe strongly in preserving the sanctity of the heritage of \ncultures, and we should treasure these gifts. I believe that all \nAmericans are enriched by learning to view the history of our Nation \nthrough the prisms of other cultures and languages.\n  When American and foreign tourists visit Washington, They expect to \ngain a better understanding of our collective history and culture. They \nsee exhibits that educate visitors about our Nation's miraculous \ntechnological achievements, our military sacrifices and \naccomplishments, and the documents establishing the most sacred tenets \nof our democratic traditions. Yet, as demonstrated by the efforts to \nestablish the National Museum of the American Indian and the National \nMuseum of African American History and Culture, the lessons taught by \nour institutions are incomplete.\n  Children who visit museums in Washington should have the opportunity \nto learn the full history of who we are and who we are becoming as \nAmericans. Nearly 40 million U.S. residents share a cultural heritage \nthat is only beginning to be understood as wholly American, yet few of \nthe exhibits in the Smithsonian's and other museums in Washington \ncommemorate American Latino cultural contributions.\n  This legislation would take the next step toward ensuring that the \nlessons taught by our premier institutions for the arts and humanities \ninclude a better representation of American Latino cultural \ncontributions. I hope that we will soon be able to say that the \nNation's Capital truly exhibits America's rich cultural diversity.\n  I would like to note that Representative Xavier Becerra has \nintroduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives, and I am \nhonored to introduce this companion legislation in the Senate. I hope \nthis measure will be approved by the Senate in short order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2435. A bill to permit Inspectors General to authorize staff to \nprovide assistance to the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Missing \nChild Cold Case Review Act of 2004,'' which will allow an Inspector \nGeneral to authorize his or her staff to provide assistance on and \nconduct reviews of the inactive case files, or ``cold cases,'' \ninvolving children stored at the National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children (NCMEC) and to develop recommendations for further \ninvestigations.\n  I am pleased that Senator Grassley joins me as the lead cosponsor of \nthis bipartisan legislation. I thank him for his leadership in this \narea.\n  Speed is everything in homicide investigations. As a former \nprosecutor in Vermont, I know firsthand that speed is of the essence \nwhen trying to solve a homicide. This focus on speed, however, has led \nthe law enforcement community to generally believe that any case not \nsolved within the first 72 hours or lacking significant leads and \nwitness participation has little likelihood of being solved, regardless \nof the expertise and resources deployed. With time, such unsolved cases \nbecome ``cold,'' and these are among the most difficult and frustrating \ncases detectives face because they are, in effect, cases that other \ninvestigators, for whatever reason, failed to solve.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies, regardless of size, are not \nimmune to rising crime rates, staff shortages and budget restrictions. \nSuch obstacles have strained the investigative and administrative \nresources of all agencies.\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nMore crime often means that fewer cases are vigorously pursued, fewer \nopportunities arise for follow-up and individual caseloads increase for \nalready overworked detectives.\n  All the obstacles that hamper homicide investigations in their early \nphases contribute to cold cases. The National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children--our Nation's top resource center for child \nprotection--presently retains a backlog of cold cases involving \nchildren that law enforcement departments nationwide have stopped \ninvestigating primarily due to all these obstacles. NCMEC serves as a \nclearinghouse for all cold cases in which a child has not been found \nand/or the suspect has not been identified.\n  The bill that Senator Grassley and I introduce today would allow an \nInspector General to provide staff support to NCMEC for the purpose of \nconducting reviews of inactive case files to develop recommendations \nfor further investigation and similar activities. The Inspector General \ncommunity has one of the most diverse and talented criminal \ninvestigative cadres in the Federal government. A vast majority of \nthese special agents have come from traditional law enforcement \nagencies, and are highly-trained and extremely capable of dealing with \ncomplex, criminal cases.\n  Under current law, an Inspector General's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. Our \nbill would allow an Inspector General to permit criminal investigators \nunder his or her supervision to review cold case files, so long as \ndoing so would not interfere with normal duties. An Inspector General \nwould not conduct actual investigations, and any Inspector General \nwould only commit staff when the office's mission-related workloads \npermitted. At no time would these activities be allowed to conflict \nwith or delay the stated missions of an Inspector General.\n\n  From time to time a criminal investigator employed by an Inspector \nGeneral may be between investigations or otherwise available for brief \nperiods of time. This act would also allow those resources to be \nprovided to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \nCommitment of resources would be at a minimum and would not materially \naffect the budget of any office.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should be \nmoved easily through the Senate and House. It is supported by the \nDepartment of Justice Office of the Inspector General. I applaud the \nongoing work of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children \nand hope both the Senate and the House will promptly pass this bill to \nprovide NCMEC with the resources it requires to solve cold cases \ninvolving missing children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Missing Child Cold Case \nReview Act of 2004 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2435\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Native American Programs Act of \n1974; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reauthorize \nthe Native American Programs Act.\n  This act is administered by the Administration for Native Americans \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services. Funds appropriated \nfor the Administration for Native Americans enable the provision of \ngrants for social and economic development initiatives addressing the \nneeds of Native communities, for Native language preservation, and to \nprovide support for environmental initiatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 2437. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy under title III of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nis fundamental to our democracy. That issue is the right for each \nAmerican to know that their vote has been cast and accurately counted. \nEarlier today, I introduced legislation, the Voting Integrity and \nVerification Act, which would provide each American with those \nassurances.\n  The United States Constitution is sacred to Americans and it is the \nenvy of the free world. It preserves the rights and freedoms that \nAmericans hold so dear. Our Constitution also guarantees the right of \neach American to vote. Central to the integrity of our democracy is the \nright for each American to participate in our democracy.\n  Democracy works best when each eligible voter participates. As a \nNation, we learned in 2000 that even a Presidential election can be \ndetermined by handfuls of votes. I learned this lesson in my own 1998 \nU.S. Senate campaign against incumbent Senator Harry Reid. In one of \nthe closest Federal elections that year, a mere 428 votes separated us \nafter all votes had been counted statewide.\n  After the election I requested a recount in Clark County, the only \ncounty at the time using electronic voting machines. The result of the \nrecount was identical to the first count. That is because there was \nnothing to recount. After rerunning a computer program, the computer \nproduced the same exact tally.\n  I conceded to Senator Reid and was elected to Nevada's other Senate \nseat in 2000, but I was still troubled by the fact that Clark County \nvoters had no assurance that their votes had been accurately counted. \nInnocent computer malfunctions or intentional tampering could have \naltered their votes without anyone ever knowing.\n  That is why I led the fight for voter verification paper trails in \nthe Help American Vote Act (HAVA) that President Bush signed into law \nin 2002. A voter-verified paper trail would allow a voter to review a \nphysical printout of their ballot and correct any errors before leaving \nthe voting booth. This printout would be preserved at the polling for \nuse in any recounts.\n  Unfortunately, the language that is contained in HAVA has not \nresolved this issue. Now, I am working to address this issue once and \nfor all. By introducing the Voting Integrity and Verification Act, I \nwant to ensure that HAVA is clear--voters must be assured that their \nvotes will be accurate and will be counted properly. A paper trail \nprovides just such an assurance.\n\n  A paper trail is not just a hypothetical answer to electronic ballot \nmishaps that may not ever happen. On January 6, 2004, a special \nelection was held in Broward County, FL, for House District Seat 91. \nThe margin of victory was 12 votes, but the machine failed to record \nthe votes of 134 ballots. The results of this election have to be \ncalled into question, because the House seat was the only item on the \nballot. It is doubtful that 134 voters would go to the polling place, \nstand in line, enter the voting booth but leave without casting a vote. \nYet that was the explanation offered to explain the failure of the \nelectronic voting machines to record 134 votes. This triggered an \nautomatic recount under Florida law but there were no paper records \nwith which to conduct a recount. Election workers were left to rerun \nthe computer program. Just as happened in my Senate race, rerunning a \ncomputer program to conduct a manual ``recount'' did not change the \noutcome.\n  In Maryland on November 5, 2002, and in Fairfax County, VA, on \nNovember 4,\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\n2003, voters who used electronic ``touch screen'' voting machines \nwatched as the ``X'' they placed on the video screen next to one \ncandidate's name appeared in a box for the other candidate. There were \nno verified paper ballots, so a recount was not possible. The voters \nwho witnessed such an irregularity, and all voters who used those \nvoting machines, have no assurances that the machine accurately \nrecorded their vote. This calls into question any results determined by \nthese machines and shows that there is no limit as to the number of \nvotes that may have been miscounted.\n  It's not written in the Constitution this way, but it seems to me \nquite obvious that the right of citizens of the United States to vote \nshall not be denied on account of a lack of a paper trail. We must \nuphold the sanctity of our vote by making sure there is an accurate way \nto confirm and recount votes. I call on Congress to act swiftly to \npreserve America's faith in our election process and enact the Voting \nIntegrity and Verification Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5612-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5612-S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 364--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING \n                              OIL MARKETS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Reed, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nJohnson, and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S. Res. 364\n\n       Whereas the prices of gasoline and crude oil have a direct \n     and substantial impact on the financial well-being of \n     American families, the potential for national economic \n     recovery, and the economic security of the United States;\n       Whereas on Friday, May 7, 2004, crude oil prices reached a \n     13-year high of $40 per barrel, the weighted national average \n     retail price of gasoline was $1.96 per gallon, and the \n     average retail price of gasoline has broken all-time record \n     highs for 2 consecutive months;\n       Whereas despite the fact that crude oil prices were already \n     approaching record highs, the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced on April 1, 2004, its \n     commitment to reduce oil production by 1,000,000 barrels per \n     day;\n       Whereas the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created \n     to enhance the physical and economic security of the United \n     States, and the law allows the SPR to be used to provide \n     relief when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic \n     hardship;\n       Whereas the proper management of the resources of the SPR \n     could provide gasoline price relief to American families and \n     provide the United States with a tool to counterbalance OPEC \n     supply management policies;\n       Whereas it has been reported that the Administration's \n     current policy of filling the SPR at a rate of hundreds of \n     thousands of barrels per day, despite the fact that the SPR \n     is more than 94 percent full, has contributed to record high \n     gasoline contract prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange;\n       Whereas in order to combat high gasoline prices during the \n     summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released \n     30,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR, stabilizing the \n     retail price of gasoline;\n        Whereas the Administration has failed to manage the SPR in \n     a manner that would provide gasoline price relief to working \n     families; and\n       Whereas the Administration has failed to adequately demand \n     that OPEC immediately increase oil production in order to \n     lower crude oil prices and safeguard the world economy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING OIL MARKETS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should directly confront OPEC and \n     challenge OPEC to immediately increase oil production;\n       (2) the President should direct the Federal Trade \n     Commission and Attorney General to exercise vigorous \n     oversight over the oil markets to protect the American people \n     from price gouging and unfair practices at the gasoline pump; \n     and\n       (3) to lower the burden of gasoline prices on the American \n     economy and to circumvent OPEC's efforts to reap windfall \n     crude oil profits, the President should suspend deliveries of \n     oil to the SPR and release 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day \n     from the SPR for 30 days following the date of adoption of \n     this resolution, and if necessary, for an additional 30 days \n     beyond that.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, gasoline prices in Massachusetts just \npassed the two-dollar mark, and are expected to go even higher in the \nmonths ahead. A year ago, the average price of regular gas in \nMassachusetts was $1.53 per gallon. That means that the average two-car \nmiddle class family is paying $56 more per month for gasoline than they \nwere last year. That's the same as a $660 middle class pay cut for the \nyear.\n  In addition, the high price of gasoline is causing the prices of \nother consumer goods to go up as well, including groceries and other \nnecessities.\n  But while middle class families are hurting, the Bush Administration \nstands on the sidelines. They are doing nothing to encourage OPEC \nnations to increase production to bring down oil prices.\n  They are doing nothing to prevent price gouging by the \nAdministration's friends in the oil industry. The profits of the top \nfive oil companies jumped 300 percent in just the past year. That's \nmoney taken right out of the pockets of middle class America, and the \nadministration is doing nothing about it.\n  The President has failed the American consumer with his weak gasoline \npolicies and by pandering to the big oil companies.\n  Today, I stand with my colleagues and demand that President Bush take \nimmediate action to bring down prices at the pump that impose such a \nheavy burden on consumers. The President should confront OPEC and \ndemand an increase in oil production. And the President should stop \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and release a million barrels \nof oil a day until prices stabilize.\n  President Clinton released 30 million barrels in 2000 and this was \neffective in lowering the price of gasoline.\n  The Reserve was created for times of crisis, and I believe strongly \nthat it should be used sparingly and for true emergencies. Because the \nReserve is almost full today, I believe we can draw down on it without \njeopardizing our strategic interests. And the law allows it to be used \nwhen supply shortages cause economic hardships for the American people.\n  Finally, the President should direct the Attorney General to \nintervene with the big oil companies to prevent price gouging.\n  This is a crisis that is harming middle class families right now. We \nneed action and we need it now. Every day that the White House \ncontinues to turn a blind eye to Big Oil, the worse it gets for the \npocketbooks of average families. This legislation would call on the \nWhite House to reverse course and take immediate steps to provide some \nrelief to American consumers.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join with \n25 of my colleagues in calling on the President to delay scheduled \ndeposits to our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and to \nrelease some of the crude currently there to alleviate our current \nrecord-high gasoline prices. It is important for families in West \nVirginia and across the country to have affordable gasoline, and it is \ncrucial that our economy not be dragged down further by spiraling \ninflation fueled by high prices at the pump.\n  It has been more than a month since I joined with many of the same \nSenators who have cosponsored this resolution in a letter to the \nPresident calling on him to help reduce skyrocketing gasoline prices by \nputting further deliveries of petroleum into the marketplace instead of \nthe national reserve. Since then, crude oil prices have reached a \nthirteen-year high of nearly $42 per barrel, which has led to a rise in \nthe price of gasoline to $2.01 a gallon nationally. This is more than \n50 cents higher than a year ago. The burden of high gas prices is being \nfelt by all Americans, and is eating away at any ``relief'' the Bush \ntax cuts may have promised.\n  West Virginia has little or no public transportation, so for most \nWest Virginians the family car is the only lifeline to jobs, school, \nshopping, and healthcare. The relatively long distances and unforgiving \ntopography that West Virginians have to travel in the normal course of \ntheir lives makes an increase of just a few cents at the pump a \ncrushing blow to withstand. Today, from Beckley to Martinsburg, West \nVirginians can expect to pay close to, or in most cases, well over $2\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\nper gallon. In East Lynn, WV they are paying $2.19 a gallon; in \nMorgantown they're paying $2.11 a gallon; and in Ripley, my \nconstituents are lucky to find gas going for $2.05 a gallon.\n  In 2003, 56 percent of West Virginians received less than $100 from \nthe 2003 tax bill. This ``relief'' is offset greatly by the current \ntrend in gas prices. The current price spikes mean that the majority of \nWest Virginians will end up spending at least three times as much \nbuying gasoline than in any tax return they will have received.\n  And it is not just short-term affects, or the concerns of our \nconstituents that we have to contend with, but long term consequences \nas well. On May 12, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a \nstudy stating that higher oil prices have hurt the global economy and \nwill further depress economic growth, fuel inflation, and increase \nunemployment over the next 2 years if the prices stay near current \nlevels.\n  Knowing all of this, the Bush administration has yet to even address \nthe explosion of high gasoline prices here at home. In fact, Scott \nMcClellan, the White House Press Secretary said today that ``We will \ncontinue to do what we've been doing that is to stay in close contact \nwith producers around the world to urge them not to take action that \nwould harm our economy or hurt consumers here in America.'' This means \nthat the administration is content with the status quo and in doing \nmore of the same. That is why I stand with my colleagues in agreement \nwith this resolution on our Nation's oil reserves.\n  This resolution does three things: one) It asks the President to \nconfront OPEC directly; two) it asks the President to have the Attorney \nGeneral and the Federal Trade Commission exercise vigorous oversight \nover the oil markets to protect the American people from price gouging; \nand three) it asks the President to suspend deliveries of oil to the \nSPR and release a million barrels of oil per day from the SPR for 30 \ndays following the adoption of this resolution. All of these actions \nwould go a long way in reducing the burden of high gasoline prices on \nall Americans.\n  We have faced similar circumstances before and taken action. Four \nyears ago, President Clinton halted deposits to the national reserve \nand that action lowered the burden of high gasoline prices on the \nAmerican people without compromising our country's stockpile of oil. \nThe current administration needs to be engaged. It needs to take a role \nand provide leadership at a time when West Virginians and all Americans \nare feeling a pinch at that pump.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/18/senate-section/article/S5613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3157.
