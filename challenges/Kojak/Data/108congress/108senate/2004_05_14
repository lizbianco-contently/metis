Mr. President, I rise today to address a growing problem \nin my home State of Hawaii and the Nation, individuals that do not have \nhealth insurance. The total number of uninsured people in the United \nStates reached 43.6 million in 2002. Since 2000, the total number of \nuninsured has increased by 3.8 million. In the State of Hawaii, it is \nestimated that there are approximately 120,000 people who do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  The uninsured delay seeking medical treatment, which is likely to \nlead to more significant and more costly problems later on than if they \nhad sought earlier, preventative treatment or proper disease \nmanagement. Health insurance is essential to making sure that \nindividuals can access health care services and properly manage their \nchronic diseases, such as diabetes. A tremendous amount of needless \npain and suffering can be eliminated by ensuring that health insurance \nis universally available.\n  Everyone should have access to affordable health insurance. We must \nexpand Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP, to provide essential access to health care for more people. In \naddition, we must take steps to help rein in health care costs in an \nattempt to keep coverage affordable. Providing additional resources for \ndisease management programs and primary health care services will lead \nto long-term savings and benefits. Also, meaningful prescription drug \npatent law reforms need to be made to ensure that generic drugs can be \nbrought to market in a timely manner.\n  We are also obligated to help provide support to health care \nproviders that provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. In Hawaii, \nit is estimated that hospitals lost $95 million for uncompensated care \nin 2002. However, while other states benefit from Medicaid \ndisproportionate share hospital, DSH, payments designed to provide \nadditional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid \nand uninsured patients, Hawaii is left out of this important program.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, created specific DSH allotments \nfor each state based on each of their actual DSH expenditures for \nfiscal year 1995. In 1994, the State of Hawaii implemented the QUEST \ndemonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of \nuninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH \nprogram was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration \nprogram, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not \nprovided a DSH allotment.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the \nestablishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, States without \nallotments were again left out. Other States that have obtained waivers \nsimilar to Hawaii's have retained their DSH allotments. Only two \nStates, Hawaii and Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments. I was \ndisappointed that language similar to an amendment that I had offered, \nwhich was accepted as part of the manager's package for the Senate's \nprescription drug bill was not included in the conference report for \nH.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003. \nThe language that was finally included prevents Hawaii from obtaining \nits DSH allotment as long as the QUEST program remains in place.\n  Medicaid DSH funding is needed because our hospitals in Hawaii are \nstruggling to meet the elevated demands placed upon them by the \nincreasing number of uninsured people. DSH payments will help Hawaii \nhospitals meet the rising health care needs of our communities and \nreinforce our health care safety net. All 50 States need to have access \nto Medicaid DSH support.\n  While Hawaii continues to be denied this assistance, many States fail \nto fully utilize their DSH allotments. For fiscal year 1999, more than \n$1.2 billion was returned to the Treasury because States failed to draw \ndown their full Medicaid DSH allotments. More than $800 million was \nreturned to the Treasury for fiscal year 2000. It is unfair that while \ncertain States are declining to use their full allocation, States with \nno or small allotments are being denied the use of these resources. A \nviable option to provide relief for Hawaii and other low-DSH States is \nto redistribute funding that other States have returned to the \nTreasury. It is not fair that States that either lack any DSH funding \nor have low-DSH allotments cannot have an opportunity to apply for \nthese excess funds to help bolster their public health safety net.\n  I appreciate all of the work done by my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, to help provide relief to low-DSH States. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues to help restore \nMedicaid DSH payments to Hawaii. Also, we must continue our efforts to \nimprove access to health care so that everyone can obtain affordable, \ncomprehensive, and quality health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this week our country observes National \nPolice Week, a time to honor the men and women who put their lives on \nthe line every day to bring peace--and peace of mind--to America's \ncities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  Tomorrw, Police Week culminates in Peace Officers Memorial Day, when \nwe pay special honor to those officers who gave their lives in he line \nof duty.\n  This memorial has a long history. In 1789, a U.S. Marshal named \nRobert Forsyth was shot and killed in the line of duty.\n  Since then, over 14,000 law enforcement officers have given their \nlives to protect the liberties upon which America was founded.\n  Police officers have always served as the first line of protection \nfor our communities. But 3 years ago, on September 11, our Nation \ngained a new appreciation both for the dangers they face and for the \ncourage they routinely exhibit.\n  We owe our police officers a debt of gratitude that is immeasurable \nand unending.\n  Every year we honor those that lost their lives in the line of duty \nand carve their names into the Police Memorial so that future \ngenerations will know who they are, and that they lived, and died, as \nheroes.\n  This year, one of South Dakota's heroes will be honored and \nremembered.\n  Deputy Bill Davis joined the Moody County Sheriff's Office in 1982, \nwhere he served as deputy sheriff for 21 years.\n  Like so many of our officers, Deputy Davis's service to his community \nwas bigger than his badge.\n  Bill Davis was a veteran of the U.S. Navy and the National Guard.\n  He embodied the values of community service and civic duty throughout \nhis life. Last November, while investigating a car accident, Deputy \nDavis was struck by a car and killed.\n  As we commemorate the heroism of Deputy Bill Davis, and all those who \nlost their lives in the line of duty, we cannot help but acknowledge \nthe risks undertaken each and every day by America's police officers.\n  Our police officers do not ask for reward or recognition, merely the \ntools they need to do their job. And in return for all they have given \nus, we have an obligation to ensure they have every available resource \nnecessary to keep our neighborhoods safe.\n  Over the past year, I have spent a lot of time meeting with South \nDakota's police officers, asking about the specific challenges they \nface, and what we can do here in the Senate to support them.\n  The most pressing issue for our Nation's law enforcement is the added \nresponsibility and burden of being first responders in the event of \nterrorist attack. The complexity of this new role requires training and \ntools that no small local police department could be expected to have \non its own.\n  That is why I am pleased that South Dakota recently received $15 \nmillion in grants from the Department of Homeland Security to pay for \nnew\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\ncounterterrorism training and technologies.\n  In addition, dozens of our local police and sheriffs' departments \nreceived Federal grants last year for first responder training and \nequipment, such as bulletproof vests.\n  I was pleased that because of the great work being done in my State, \nwe were able to ensure that the South Dakota Police Chiefs and Sheriffs \nAssociations received $1.5 million in Federal funding in 2003, and an \nadditional $250,000 in 2004.\n  Rural communities, such as those in South Dakota, have a number of \nunique law enforcement challenges, as well.\n  People in rural areas face the same problems of gangs and drugs as \ntheir urban counterparts, but with fewer officers and across broader \ngeographic areas. Methamphetamine production and use, for example, is a \ngrowing concern for South Dakota's communities and families. Because \nthe ingredients and the equipment used to produce methamphetamines are \nso inexpensive and readily available, the drug can be produced in \nhomes.\n  Over the past several years, methamphetamine labs have proliferated \nthroughout South Dakota, and law enforcement has struggled to keep up \nwith its troubling growth.\n  To help law enforcement combat the spread of methamphetamine and \nother challenges, I have introduced the Rural Safety Act, which would \nauthorize grants to establish methamphetamine prevention and treatment \npilot programs in rural areas, and provide additional financial support \nto local law enforcement.\n  In addition, I have recently joined with Senator Johnson in \ncosponsoring the Federal Emergency Meth Lab Cleanup Funding Act of \n2004, which helps our local law enforcement and communities with the \ncontamination left behind by meth labs.\n  For all the work we are doing to support our police, this weeks \nreminds us that we are asking them to do more with less.\n  Unfortunately, under the administration's Fiscal Year 2004 budget, \nfunding for several important programs related to State and local law \nenforcement are drastically reduced. Of particular concern is the \nadministration's cut to the COPS program.\n  Since 1994, South Dakota has received $43.7 million from the COPS \nprogram for much-needed training, equipment, and new police officers, \nincluding officers for the Spearfish, Custer, Huron, and Tripp police \nand sheriff departments.\n  In the finest tradition of community policing, these officers are out \nin our neighborhoods, working with schools, churches, and businesses to \nfind new ways to make our streets safer.\n  Over the past 10 years, COPS is responsible for putting more than \n100,000 new police officers on the streets throughout our country and \nwas pivotal in the historic reductions in crime we saw during the \n1990s.\n  But despite its ongoing success, the COPS budget has been targeted \nfor cuts by this administration every year--in fact, last year the \nadministration proposed eliminating COPS altogether.\n  For FY 2005, the administration has proposed a staggering 86 percent \ncut for the COPS program--from $703 million to only $44 million.\n  More than ever, we depend upon our police officers' ability to \nprotect our communities from combating terrorism, to protecting our \ncitizens from the dangers of drug abuse, to helping young people stay \nclear of trouble.\n  State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers are contributing on \na daily basis to the effort to make our Nation safer and more secure. \nWe have a responsibility to provide them the support they need.\n  This week, we honor officers, such as Deputy Bill Davis who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our communities and for our safety.\n  The debt we owe them can never be repaid.\n  But this week, and every week, we have an obligation to commit \nourselves to ensuring that the priorities of America's police men and \nwomen are at the very top of our agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/14/senate-section/article/S5489-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5489-S5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SAME-SEX MARRIAGE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on May 17th, this Monday, the State of \nMassachusetts will begin to issue marriage licenses to same-gender \ncouples so they may marry. This rather surprising development, \nparticularly for those who have not been following the events in \nMassachusetts over the last few months, is not the result of the vote \nof the people of Massachusetts. Once a court decision--which I will \nspeak more about in a moment--was handed down, which compelled State \nofficials and local officials to issue these licenses to same-gender \ncouples, there was an attempt made to amend the Massachusetts \nConstitution. The first step in a three-step process has been \naccomplished and if that constitutional amendment is ultimately passed \nin 2006, it will ban same-sex couples from marrying.\n  But because of the structure of the constitutional amendment process \nin Massachusetts, the court order takes effect Monday, May 17th. \nEssentially the people of Massachusetts are left out of governing \nthemselves. They have been subjected to a court edict and their views \nconsidered irrelevant.\n  When we held the first of three Judiciary subcommittee hearings on \nthis issue last September, that was before the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt had made this ruling. It was a 4-3 decision, holding that the \nMassachusetts Constitution barred any restriction on marriage license \nissuance to exclusively one man and one woman.\n  The issue that we raised last September was, Is the Federal Defense \nof Marriage Act in jeopardy? We had witnesses on both sides, some of \nwhom concluded yes, it was, and some who concluded no, it probably was \nnot. I suggest the passage of time has proved the accuracy of the \nprediction of those who said yes, it is in jeopardy--that their views \nseem to be correct, while those who say no, it is not, appear to be \nwrong.\n  Because the Massachusetts Supreme Court is the only state supreme \ncourt in the Nation that has ruled marriage licenses must be issued to \nsame-sex couples, there are many people, many well-intentioned people \nwho say this is a local issue, and others--perhaps not being as \ninformed as they might be about constitutional law--say this is surely \nonly going to be confined to one State. They say that this is an issue \nthat ought to be handled on a State-by-State basis and requires no \naction by the Federal Government or by our elected officials in \nCongress.\n  I submit the evidence is becoming increasingly clear this is not a \nlocal phenomenon, nor is this a matter that can be addressed on a \nState-by-State basis. This is a national issue that requires a national \nresponse.\n\n  As we all recall, shortly after the decision in Massachusetts, the \nmayor and other officials in the city of San Francisco began issuing \nmarriage licenses to same-sex couples in that city--not just people who \nlived in that city but people who traveled to that State from other \nStates. The New York Times has reported in at least 46 cases out of \nthose several thousand illegal marriages, that took place in defiance \nof California State law--there is the potential now for lawsuits in 46 \nstates filed by those individuals who were married in San Francisco who \nthen moved back to their State of residence. In all but four states, \nthe seeds are there for lawsuits to be filed by couples demanding that \nthe court compel their State to recognize the validity of same-sex \nmarriage.\n  In addition, there are lawsuits that are pending now in Nebraska, in \nUtah, and most recently in Florida, asking the court to hold as a \nmatter of Federal constitutional law that restrictions on marriage only \nas between a man and a woman violate the Federal Constitution.\n  It is important to look back at what the first signal was that \ntraditional\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nmarriage was in jeopardy when it came to the courts. It goes back to a \ndecision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case called Lawrence v. \nTexas. This was a case that struck down the anti-sodomy provisions of \nTexas law. The most remarkable thing about that decision is not the \nresult, it was how the Court got to that result. Indeed, as many \npredicted, the Court overruled the decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, \nwhich upheld the anti-sodomy law of Georgia years ago. But in this \ncase, the Court not only struck it down on an equal protection basis--\nJustice Kennedy, writing for the Court, created a new constitutional \nright: To be free in one's intimate sexual and personal relationships, \nsuch that he held the Constitution now prohibited any sort of \nrestriction by legislation or by official policy on those intimate \nrelationships between adults.\n  Indeed it was predicted at that time, I believe it was Justice Scalia \nin dissent, who said this was the first step toward a ban on \ntraditional marriage. Lawrence v. Texas was a Federal constitutional \ndecision that was one of the bases upon which the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt interpreted its State constitution to require same-sex marriage \nin that State, a rather ominous succession of events. It is an ominous \nsituation for those of us who support traditional marriage and believe \nit is important to our society and to our children.\n\n  Now, there are those who want to say this debate that has ensued over \nsame-sex marriage is designed to be hurtful or harmful to those who \nmight take advantage of the opportunity to marry same-sex couples. I \nwant to make clear that is not true. I believe that Americans \ninstinctively believe in two fundamental propositions: First, we \nbelieve in the essential worth and dignity of every human being. Yet at \nthe same time, we also believe in the importance of traditional \nmarriage.\n  It is no accident that it was not until 224 years after the \nMassachusetts Constitution was written and ratified, in 1780, that an \nactivist supreme court mandated same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, \ncontrary to the wishes and the will of the people of that State. As I \nsay, now this is not just a local issue, nor a State issue; indeed, \nthis is a Federal issue, requiring a Federal national response.\n  So in all sincerity, I reiterate that those of us who argue in favor \nof a remedy to ensure the protection of traditional marriage do not do \nthat with an intent to disparage anyone personally. But we do believe \nthat traditional marriage is a positive good for our society, as the \nmost stabilizing and positive influence on family life in this country, \nas well as being in the best interests of children.\n  The fundamental question we are going to have to address, sooner or \nlater, is who will define marriage in the United States? Will it be the \nAmerican people, or will it be activist judges who are reading a newly \nfound right into a Constitution that for the last 200 or more years has \nnot included that right, or at least it was a right that went \nundiscovered by activist judges prior to this time? Put another way, \nthe question is, are the deeply held convictions of the American people \nwhen it comes to the importance of traditional marriage irrelevant?\n  I suggest to you the answer is no--unless, of course, we are giving \nup, after all this time, on what Lincoln called ``government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people.''\n  So the question is, what do we do? What do the overwhelming majority \nof the people in the United States of America do, those who believe in \nthe fundamental importance of traditional marriage for the stability of \nfamilies and for the best interests of our children? What are we to do \nto respond?\n  Well, the majority of States have responded but I would suggest to \nyou in a way that does not protect them anymore when it comes to the \ndefinition of traditional marriage. And that is, a majority of the \nStates, back in the middle of the 1990s, passed what are called defense \nof marriage acts, which defined marriage as exclusively an institution \nbetween one man and one woman.\n  Congress itself, as a matter of Federal policy, passed the Federal \nDefense of Marriage Act in 1996. Overwhelming bipartisan majorities in \nthe House and the Senate voted to pass the Defense of Marriage Act. But \nit is that very statute, that very law, that very expression of the \nnational will that has now been challenged most recently in a Florida \nFederal district court, claiming that the Federal Defense of Marriage \nAct violates the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Lawrence v. Texas.\n  The only response I know of, to judges who are basically making the \nlaw up as they go along, or trying to write their own personal or \nsocial agenda into the Constitution and to deny the American people the \nfundamental right of self-government, is a constitutional amendment. I \nknow--and we all know--the American people have been historically \nreluctant to amend our Constitution. In fact, it has only happened 27 \ntimes in our history. But it is important to recognize, at the same \ntime, that there is written into that very same Constitution a \nmechanism, under article V, which allows two-thirds of the U.S. \nCongress to vote on an amendment, which is then ratified by three-\nquarters of the States. This allows the American people to retain their \nfundamental right to determine what kind of nation America is and what \nkind of nation it will become, even against a judiciary run amok.\n\n  There are those I respect a great deal in this body and elsewhere who \nwould suggest that the Constitution is sacrosanct. Indeed, we put our \nhand on the Bible and we pledged to uphold the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States when we were sworn into this body. But I submit that \nwe take an oath to the whole Constitution, not just part of it, \nincluding article V, which provides a procedure for amendment so that \nthe Constitution can continue to reflect the will of the American \npeople.\n  I suggest to you that the Constitution is not a holy covenant to be \ninterpreted or amended by nine high priests on the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThese judges do not have the exclusive rights to the Constitution. We, \nthe American people, do. And sometimes--and this may very well be one \nof those times--it may be necessary for the American people to reclaim \ntheir right to determine what kind of nation we are and what kind of \nnation we will become, particularly when it comes to an issue as \nfundamental as traditional marriage. If, out of ignorance or apathy, we \nsacrifice our right to self-government, we have allowed the very nature \nof our Nation to be altered, and that would be very tragic indeed.\n  So I say in conclusion: this is a very serious matter. It ought to be \ndiscussed rationally and seriously in a dignified and civil manner, \nwith enmity toward none, but with a desire on the part of the American \npeople, who believe in the importance of traditional marriage and its \nbenefit to our society--we ought not to be afraid to stand up and say \nso. Nor should we be deterred by those who might be less civil, be less \ndignified and less temperate in their remarks. Indeed, we know that can \noccur.\n  But it is my hope that as we go forward, and particularly as we mark \nthis watershed event in America's history on Monday, May 17, with the \nissuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Massachusetts by \nvirtue of court edict and not a vote of the people. This is a matter \nthat will not go away, and ultimately the American people will insist \nthat we deal with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I note that his coming to the Senate and joining the \nJudiciary Committee has been a tremendous asset for that committee. His \nleadership of the subcommittee which he chairs and the serious and \ncomplete way in which he addresses issues has really helped us to \ntackle some of these very difficult issues.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the prisoner abuse in \nIraq and how it ties into the conduct of our war there to ensure that \nwe can prevail\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nin this struggle in which we have engaged. I want to begin by talking \nabout a New York Times newspaper article this morning which I think \nputs into better perspective the nature of the offense that has been \ncommitted in that prison and then move to a discussion of how our \ntroops are trained to conduct investigations at a military installation \nin Arizona, my State, and conclude with remarks that were offered this \nmorning in an op-ed piece by Charles Krauthammer that I think puts all \nof this into a perspective that we would do well to pay some attention \nto.\n  Let's begin with the last 10 or 12 days of discussion about what \noccurred in the prison in Iraq and how that has affected public opinion \nabout the morality of our effort there. There has been a lot of \nspeculation. I have urged colleagues and others to avoid speculating \nuntil the reports are in, until the facts are before us, because \nspeculation cannot only lead to wrong conclusions, it can actually \ndamage our position around the world.\n  Some seem all too anxious to prove that what happened there had to be \nthe result of orders from higher-ups, that it just couldn't possibly \nhave been the actions of a few soldiers acting in a very wrong way; it \nhad to come from higher-ups.\n  It is possible there were some orders from higher-ups that had an \neffect, but sometimes there seems to be almost a desire, a hope that we \nwill find it was the orders from somebody higher up, and the political \nimplications of that are obvious.\n  I have seen speculation that because families and friends of some of \nthese soldiers, understandably, were in disbelief that their friend or \nchild could have done this without being ordered to do so, that, \ntherefore, is proof the order had to come from above.\n  It is not proof. The defense is understandable. It may or may not be \ntrue. But what is becoming a little bit more clear is that, despite the \nnumber of photographs, these incidents appear to have been isolated, to \nhave occurred on few occasions in one place by a very few people \nwithout having been ordered from above.\n  This is the point of a New York Times article of today, ``U.S. \nSoldier Paints Scene of Eager Mayhem'' at Iraqi prison. It is the story \nof the statement given to investigators by SPC Jeremy C. Sivits who is \nunder court-martial. The statement was released by a lawyer for another \nsoldier. That is how the New York Times acquired it.\n  The sense of the story is that Specialist Sivits described a scene of \nmisconduct by a few of his colleagues:\n\n       . . . not authorized by anyone in the chain of command and \n     with no connection to any interrogations.\n\n  Of course, we have seen a lot of speculation that it must have been \nordered, it must have been in connection with softening up the \nprisoners. The first clear word of what happened by someone who was \nwilling to talk to investigators and admit his own culpability in the \nprocess suggests that is not true. Let me continue to quote:\n\n       The soldiers knew that what they had done was wrong, \n     Specialist Sivits told investigators, at least enough to \n     instruct him not to tell anyone what he had seen. Specialist \n     Sivits was asked if the abuse would have happened if someone \n     in the chain of command was present. ``Hell no,'' he replied, \n     adding: ``Because our command would have slammed us. They \n     believe in doing the right thing. If they saw what was going \n     on, there would be hell to pay.\n\n  The story goes on to note that this activity occurred at least in his \npresence apparently only on two occasions, most of it on one particular \nevening, and that at one point a sergeant heard the commotion and \nlooked down to see what was going on and yelled at them in anger to \nknock it off. The story obviously concludes that this is, according to \nthis specialist, a case of bad behavior by a few people who obviously \nhad inadequate supervision but who were not doing this to soften up \nprisoners or doing it at the command of anyone. And, indeed, they knew \nif their commanders found out there would be ``hell to pay.''\n\n  This is important because if it is true, what it demonstrates is that \nwhat we have been saying all along is right. America does not conduct \nits interrogations this way. It does not contain and handle prisoners \nthis way. This conduct was an aberration. It will not be tolerated. The \nguilty will be forced to pay, and we will try to understand what is \nnecessary to implement to see that it doesn't happen again.\n  Secondly, if in fact this is correct, as the New York Times has \nreported, it is not just these people who will pay but their immediate \nsuperiors who allowed them to conduct this activity. Because even \nthough those superiors may not have known about it or certainly \nparticipated in it, they created the circumstance under which this \ncould occur. They bear some responsibility as well.\n  What about the interrogation techniques? There has been a lot of \nspeculation about that. First, the official U.S. Government policy, the \nofficial Defense Department policy, is that the laws of the Geneva \nConventions will apply in Iraq, period. There is no exception for \nreally bad guys. There is no exception in order to extract information. \nSome confusion exists because of the fact that the Geneva Conventions \ndon't apply to a group such as al-Qaida. That is a fact. It is not \nsomething subjective.\n  The reason is because by the very terms of the Geneva Conventions, \nthey apply in cases where countries have signed the conventions, and \nthey apply to situations in which you have an army, a military force \nthat wears uniforms, that does not conduct activities against \ncivilians. In the case of the al-Qaida, none of those conditions \napplies. Technically the laws of the Geneva Conventions do not apply to \nal-Qaida. That is a true statement. Because people have made that \npoint, there has been then a leap to the conclusion that, therefore, \nthe U.S. Government is mistreating al-Qaida. But that is not true.\n  Our policy is that notwithstanding the fact the Geneva Conventions \ndon't apply to al-Qaida detainees, the humane treatment called for in \nthe Geneva Conventions will still be the rule, the law, the order of \nthe day for our handling of those prisoners so that the same kind of \ntreatment that is required by the Geneva Conventions will even be \napplied to people who are not technically entitled to the protection. \nThat is our official U.S. policy.\n  It is trained at Fort Huachuca, an Army base in southern Arizona, \nwhich has a mission, among other things, to train interrogation and \ncollection of intelligence.\n  Let me read a couple of items from an article from the Tucson Citizen \nof May 13.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a May 14 article from \nthe New York Times, a May 13 article from the Tucson Citizen, and an \narticle to which I will refer, an op-ed piece by Charles Krauthammer, \ndated May 14, from the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, May 14, 2004]\n\n      U.S. Soldier Paints a Scene of Eager Mayhem at Iraqi Prison\n\n                           (By Kate Zernike)\n\n       When a fresh crop of detainees arrived at Abu Ghraib prison \n     one night in late October, their jailers set upon them.\n       The soldiers pulled seven Iraqi detainees from their cells, \n     ``tossed them in the middle of the floor'' and then one \n     soldier ran across the room and lunged into the pile of \n     detainees, according to sworn statements given to \n     investigators by one of the soldiers now charged with abuse. \n     He did it again, jumping into the group like it was a pile of \n     autumn leaves, and another soldier called for others to join \n     in. The detainees were ordered to strip and masturbate, their \n     heads covered with plastic sandbags. One soldier stomped on \n     their fingers and toes.\n       ``Graner put the detainee's head into a cradle position \n     with Graner's arm, and Graner punched the detainee with a lot \n     of force, in the temple,'' Specialist Jeremy C. Sivits said \n     in his statements to investigators, referring to another \n     soldier charged, Specialist Charles A. Graner Jr. ``Graner \n     punched the detainee with a closed fist so hard in the temple \n     that it knocked the detainee unconscious.''\n       ``He was joking, laughing,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``Like \n     he was enjoying it.''\n       ``He went over to the pile of detainees that were still \n     clothed and he put his knees on them and had his picture \n     taken,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``I took this photo.''\n       Specialist Sivits's two statements, given to investigators \n     in January and released by a lawyer for another soldier on \n     Thursday, recount the evening's activities in graphic but \n     unemotional language, portraying a night of gratuitous and \n     random violence. Lawyers for the soldiers have explained the \n     abuse captured in hundreds of photographs now at the center \n     of the Abu Ghraib scandal by saying\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\n     the soldiers were operating on the orders of military \n     intelligence in an effort to get detainees to talk.\n       Last night, lawyers for the other charged soldiers repeated \n     that. They said that in a bid for leniency, Specialist \n     Sivits, 24, the first to be court-martialed, is expected to \n     plead guilty on Wednesday and testify against the others.\n       But Specialist Sivits described a scene of twisted \n     joviality not authorized by anyone in the chain of command \n     and with no connection to any interrogations.\n       ``She was laughing at the different stuff they were having \n     the detainees do,'' Specialist Sivits said, describing Pfc. \n     Lynndie R. England, another soldier charged.\n       The soldiers knew that what they had done was wrong, \n     Specialist Sivits told investigators, at least enough to \n     instruct him not to tell anyone what he had seen. Specialist \n     Sivits was asked if the abuse would have happened if someone \n     in the chain of command was present. ``Hell no,'' he replied, \n     adding: ``Because our command would have slammed us. They \n     believe in doing the right thing. If they saw what was going \n     on, there would be hell to pay.''\n       The evening began with Staff Sgt. Ivan L. Frederick II \n     casually telling Specialist Sivits to join him where the \n     detainees were held. They escorted the detainees from their \n     holding cells and piled them up. ``Graner told Specialist \n     Wisdom to come in and `get him some.' Meaning to come in and \n     be part of whatever was going to happen,''\n       Specialist Sivits told investigators, referring to \n     Specialist Matthew Wisdom.\n       ``A couple of the detainees kind of made an ahh sound as if \n     this hurt them or caused them some type of pain when Davis \n     would land on them,'' he said. Sergeant Javal C. Davis \n     responded by stepping on their fingers or toes, Specialist \n     Sivits said, and the detainees screamed.\n       The platoon sergeant standing on a tier above the room \n     heard the screams and yelled down at Sergeant Davis to stop, \n     surprising the other soldiers with the anger in his command, \n     Specialist Sivits said. But within two minutes, the platoon \n     sergeant left, and the soldiers resumed the abuse.\n       ``Next Graner and Frederick had the detainees strip,'' \n     Specialist Sivits said. ``Graner was the one who told them to \n     strip in Arabic language.'' The detainees hesitated. \n     Specialist Graner and Sergeant Frederick took them aside and \n     instructed them again. Specialist Graner told them to sit.\n       ``I do not know what provoked Graner,'' Specialist Sivits \n     said, ``but Graner knelt down to one of the detainees that \n     was nude and had the sandbag over his head'' and punched the \n     detainee unconscious.\n       ``I walked over to see if the detainee was still alive,'' \n     Specialist Sivits said. ``I could tell the detainee was \n     unconscious, because his eyes were closed and he was not \n     moving, but I could see his chest rise and fall, so I knew he \n     was still alive.''\n       Specialist Graner said little. He had wounded his hand. \n     ``Damn, that hurt,'' Specialist Sivits quoted him as saying. \n     After about two minutes, Specialist Sivits said, the detainee \n     moved, ``like he was coming to.'' Specialist Graner walked \n     over to pose with the pile of detainees.\n       Sergeant Frederick was standing in front of another \n     detainee. ``For no reason, Frederick punched the detainee in \n     the chest,'' Specialist Sivits said. ``The detainee took a \n     real deep breath and kind of squatted down. The detainee said \n     he could not breathe. They called for a medic to come down, \n     to try and get the detainee to breathe right. Frederick said \n     he thought he put the detainee in cardiac arrest.''\n       Specialist Graner, meanwhile, was having the other \n     detainees make a tower, all of them in a kneeling position \n     like a formation of cheerleaders.\n       ``Frederick and Graner then tried to get several of the \n     inmates to masturbate themselves,'' Specialist Sivits \n     recounted.\n       ``Staff Sergeant Frederick would take the hand of the \n     detainee and put it on the detainee's penis, and make the \n     detainee's hand go back and forth, as if masturbating. He did \n     this to about three of the detainees before one of them did \n     it right.''\n       After five minutes, they told him to stop. Specialist \n     Graner then had them pose against the wall, and made one \n     kneel in front of the other, Specialist Sivits said, ``So \n     that from behind the detainee that was kneeling, it would \n     look like the detainee kneeling had the penis of the detainee \n     standing in his mouth, but he did not,''\n       Specialist Sabrina Harman and Private England ``would stand \n     in front of the detainees and England and Harman would put \n     their thumbs up and have the pictures taken.''\n       Asked why the event took place, Specialist Sivits replied: \n     ``I do not know. I do not know if someone had a bad day or \n     not. It was a normal day for me, aside from the stuff I told \n     you about.''\n       Asked to describe Sergeant Frederick's attitude, he \n     replied, ``Same as ever, mellow.'' Specialist Harman, he \n     said, looked somewhat disgusted, but laughed, too, and so did \n     Specialist Sivits, in his own account.\n       ``What part did you think then was funny?'' investigators \n     asked. He replied, ``the tower thing.''\n       The evening was not an isolated case of violence, \n     Specialist Sivits said. He described another night when a dog \n     was set upon a detainee, and another when a detainee was \n     handcuffed to a bed.\n       ``Graner was in the room with him,'' he said. ``This \n     detainee had wounds on his legs from where he had been shot \n     with the buckshot.'' Specialist Graner, he said, would \n     ``strike the detainee with a half baseball swing, and hit the \n     wounds of the detainee. There is no doubt that this hurt the \n     detainee because he would scream he got hit. The detainee \n     would beg Graner to stop by saying `Mister, Mister, please \n     stop,' or words to that effect.''\n       ``I think at one time Graner said in a baby type voice, \n     `Ah, does that hurt?' '' Specialist Sivits added.\n       Guy L. Womack, a lawyer for Specialist Graner, said he had \n     not seen the statement from Specialist Sivits but doubted \n     that his client would have hit a detainee.\n       ``I don't think he was that kind of guy,'' Mr. Womack said. \n     ``He would have done it if he was ordered to do it.'' He said \n     that military intelligence soldiers were in one of the \n     graphic photographs, indicating that they were aware of what \n     was going on.\n       ``Sivits, as you know, has entered a plea agreement with \n     the government, getting lenient treatment for testifying \n     against other people,'' Mr. Womack said, ``and by definition \n     if he doesn't say something negative about other people he \n     would not get his deal.''\n       Similarly, a lawyer for Sergeant Frederick dismissed the \n     statement. ``Sivits is a rollover guilty plea, and that may \n     provide comfort to some,'' said the lawyer, Gary Myers. ``But \n     it has no impact upon the defense of any other case because \n     it has nothing whatsoever to do with the guilt or innocence \n     of my client.''\n       Specialist Sivits's lawyer has not responded to requests \n     for comments.\n       As for Specialist Sivits, investigators asked him in his \n     statements whether he thought any of the incidents were \n     wrong. ``All of them were,'' he replied.\n       Why did he not report the incidents? He replied: ``I was \n     asked not to, and I try to be friends with everyone. I see \n     now where trying to be friends with everyone can cost you.''\n       ``I was in the wrong when the above incidents happened,'' \n     he said. ``I should have said something.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Tucson Citizen, Thursday, May 13, 2004]\n\n                  Abuse Disgusts Fort's Interrogators\n\n\ntrainees taught right way to make subjects talk; students learn how to \n                     play on fears without violence\n\n                            (By C.T. Revere)\n\n       The abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison violated \n     all training standards for Army interrogators and has \n     commanders and students at Fort Huachuca angry and fearful of \n     potential repercussions.\n       ``It's anathema. It's not what we train. It's not our \n     values,'' said Maj. Gen. James Marks, commanding general of \n     the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. ``I can't fathom who would \n     do that . . . I'm disgusted by it. Those aren't interrogation \n     techniques. That's a bunch of rogue soldiers conducting evil \n     acts.''\n       Many at Fort Huachuca, home of the 111th Military \n     Intelligence Brigade, which includes the training programs \n     for interrogators and counterintelligence agents, say the \n     actions of a few soldiers at Abu Ghraib have cast a pall on \n     the Army's intelligence-gathering community.\n       ``Here we are, training hard and preparing ourselves, when \n     something like that happens,'' said Pfc. Ryan Johnson, 30, \n     who will complete Human Intelligence Collector training in \n     less than two weeks. ``It's a few individuals who have taken \n     it upon themselves to act outside of what they've been \n     trained to do. It reflects on the rest of us that are \n     training to do the right thing. I was disgusted with the way \n     they conducted themselves.''\n       In response to the abuse, officials at Fort Huachuca opened \n     their classrooms and training grounds to news media yesterday \n     to show how the ever-growing population of interrogators is \n     trained.\n       ``We do not authorize any form of hands-on in terms of our \n     use of interrogation techniques,'' Marks said. ``We try to \n     play on their existing fears, but it is not allowed to put \n     hands on during an interrogation. The only time you put hands \n     on is when you are physically moving them from one place to \n     another.''\n       Methods such as sleep deprivation, forcing detainees to \n     stand in one position for prolonged periods and physical \n     assaults of any kind are not part of the curriculum at Fort \n     Huachuca, Marks said.\n       ``We train soldiers to do what's right. Our Army is values-\n     based,'' he said.\n       Soldiers training to become interrogators complete an \n     intensive course that runs for 16 weeks and four days and \n     teaches 14 methods for interrogating ``in accordance with the \n     Geneva Conventions,'' said Joel Krasnosky, a retired Army \n     interrogator who is the chief of the Human Intelligence \n     Collector Course.\n       The first approach is to ask direct questions intended to \n     glean the information being sought, he said.\n       If that fails, interrogators can offer incentives for \n     information, appeal to emotions such as love of country or \n     hate for groups or ideas, intensifying or reducing fear, \n     appealing to pride or ego or convincing the person under \n     interrogation that there is simply no point to resisting.\n       Another approach calls for giving the impression that the \n     interrogators knows more than he or she does, sometimes by \n     using a ``prop'' dossier or file. Another tactic is to insist \n     the source has been identified as someone else they'd rather \n     not be.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n       Repeating the same question over and over can break down a \n     source, as can constantly interrupting the person or simply \n     sitting silently and waiting them out.\n       Once any of the approaches gets a source talking, \n     interrogators go back to direct questioning to get the \n     information they want, said Master Sgt. Steven Bohn, senior \n     enlisted instructor and a veteran interrogator.\n       ``Ninety-nine percent of the time that is the most \n     effective approach,'' Bohn said. ``You've got to get that \n     information. You beat around the bush all day long. That's \n     what we do. But then you've always got to go back to the \n     direct approach.''\n       All interrogations take place with a security guard \n     present, typically a member of the military police, Marks \n     said. Oftentimes, a contract interpreter is also present, but \n     he or she never participates in the questioning, he said.\n       ``They are a device through which an interrogator can get \n     to the person he is interrogating. We're not necessarily as \n     good as the guy we're trying to interrogate. We admit that,'' \n     he said.\n       Adherence to the military doctrine known as ``The Law of \n     War'' prevents soldiers from crossing the line even in trying \n     circumstances, Marks said.\n       ``The training has got to step in so that the soldier \n     doesn't even put his finger on the line,'' he said. ``It's \n     not just physical courage. It's moral courage.''\n       Better examples of military training are the two \n     noncommissioned officers, both trained at Fort Huachuca, who \n     developed the intelligence that led to the capture of Saddam \n     Hussein, Marks said.\n       While physical abuse and deprivation are not part of the \n     training for interrogators, they must take measures to obtain \n     information that is intended to save lives, he said.\n       ``I want them to be tired. I want them to be afraid of \n     me,'' he said. ``When they breathe, I want them to think the \n     interrogator gave them the right to expand their lungs. When \n     the interrogator enters that room, I want him to think, `Oh, \n     my God. What's going to happen next?' And I haven't touched \n     him.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 14, 2004]\n\n                          The Abu Ghraib Panic\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Democrats calling for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation invoke \n     the principle of ministerial responsibility: a Cabinet \n     secretary must take ultimate responsibility for what happens \n     on his watch. Interesting idea. Where was it in 1993 when the \n     attorney general of the United States ordered the attack on \n     the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, which ended in the \n     deaths of 76 people?\n       Janet Reno went to Capitol Hill and said, ``It was my \n     decision, and I take responsibility.'' This was met with \n     approving swoons and applause. Was she made to resign? No. \n     And remember: This was over an action that did not just \n     happen on her watch but that she orderd--an action that \n     resulted in the deaths of, among others, more than 20 \n     children.\n       Given the fact that when they were in power Democrats had \n     little use for the notion of ministerial responsibility, \n     their sudden discovery of it over Abu Ghraib suggests that \n     this has little to do with principle.\n       This is, of course, about politics. And for the \n     administration, the politics are simple: Cabinet members are \n     there to serve the president, and if they become a political \n     liability, they should fall on their sword for the greater \n     good of the administration.\n       If that were the case here, I am sure that Rumsfeld, who \n     does not need this or any job, would resign. He should not. \n     Throwing Rumsfeld to the baying hounds would only increase \n     their appetite.\n       Remember that when the scandal broke, there was lots of \n     murmuring among the chattering classes about the inadequacy \n     of the president's initial response because, for all his \n     remorseful groveling on al-Hurra and al-Arabiya, he had not \n     invoked the magic phrase: I'm sorry. So what happened when, \n     shortly after, in the presence of King Abdullah of Jordan, he \n     explicitly apologized? ``They've Apologized. Now What?'' \n     (headline, New York Times, the very next Sunday.)\n       In the Rumsfeld case, the ``Now What?'' is obvious. \n     Democrats will pocket the resignation, call it an admission \n     of not just ministerial responsibility but material \n     responsibility at the highest levels of the administration, \n     and use that to further attack the president.\n       In any case, the whole Rumsfeld debate is a sideshow. For \n     partisans it is a convenient way to get at the president. And \n     for those who have no partisan agenda but are shocked by the \n     Abu Ghraib pictures, it is a way to try to do something, \n     anything, to deal with the moral panic that has set in about \n     the whole Iraq enterprise.\n       This panic is everywhere and now includes many who have \n     been longtime supporters of the war. The panic is unseemly. \n     The pictures are shocking and the practices appalling. But \n     how do the actions of a few depraved soldier among 135,000 \n     negate the moral purpose of the entire enterprise--which has \n     not only liberated 25 million people from 25 years of \n     genocidal dictatorship but has included a nationwide \n     reconstruction punctuated by hundreds, thousands, of \n     individual acts of beneficence and kindness by American \n     soldiers?\n       We are obsessing about the wrong question. It is not: Is \n     our purpose in Iraq morally sound? Of course it is. \n     The question today, as from the beginning, remains: Is \n     that purpose achievable?\n       Doability does not hinge on the pictures from Abu Ghraib. \n     It hinges on what happens on the ground with the \n     insurgencies. The greater general uprising that last month's \n     panic-mongers had predicted has not occurred. The Sadr \n     insurgency appears to be waning. Senior Shiite clerics, local \n     leaders and demonstrators in the streets of Najaf have told \n     Moqtada Sadr to get out of town. Meanwhile, his militia is \n     being systematically taken down by the U.S. military.\n       As for Fallujah, we have decided that trying to fully \n     eradicate Sunni resistance is too costly in U.S. lives. \n     Moreover, this ultimately is not our job but one for the 85 \n     percent of Iraqis who are not Sunni Arabs--the Shiites and \n     Kurds who will inherit the new Iraq. We have thus chosen an \n     interim arrangement of local self-rule in the Sunni hotbeds. \n     And if that gets us through the transition of power to \n     moderate Iraqis, fine.\n       This seems entirely lost on the many politicians and \n     commentators who have simply lost their bearings in the Abu \n     Ghraib panic. The prize in Iraq is not praise for America \n     from the Arab street nor goodwill from al-Jazeera. We did not \n     have these before Abu Ghraib. We will not have these after \n     Abu Ghraib. The prize is a decent, representative, \n     democratizing Iraq that abandons the pan-Arab fantasies and \n     cruelties of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n       That remains doable. What will make it undoable is the \n     panic at home.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The Tucson Citizen's article in part reads as follows:\n\n       The abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison violated \n     all training standards for Army interrogators and has \n     commanders and students at Fort Huachuca angry and fearful of \n     potential repercussions. ``It's anathema. It's not what we \n     train. It's not our values,'' said Maj. Gen. James Marks, \n     commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. ``I \n     can't fathom who would do that * * * I'm disgusted by it. \n     Those aren't interrogation techniques. That's a bunch of \n     rogue soldiers conducting evil acts.''\n\n  Just a couple other sentences from the article:\n\n       Many at Fort Huachuca, home of the 111th Military \n     Intelligence Brigade which includes the training programs for \n     interrogators and counterintelligence agents, say the actions \n     of a few soldiers at Abu Ghraib have cast a pall on the \n     Army's intelligence-gathering community.\n\n  It goes on to note that ``it reflects on the rest of us that are \ntraining to do the right thing.'' And just one other quotation from \nGeneral Marks:\n\n       We do not authorize any form of hands-on in terms of use of \n     our interrogation techniques.\n\n  The article goes on to talk about precisely what kind of \ninterrogation is permitted, what the techniques are to get information. \nBut it makes it very clear none of the things that have been depicted \nin these photographs are even remotely authorized.\n  So it actually ties in with the article from the New York Times that \nthis could not have been done by military intelligence to gather \ninformation from these prisoners. That is an important point because \nsome have begun to question the morality of our involvement in Iraq and \nthe mission which so many of our young soldiers have put their lives on \nthe line to achieve, and now several hundred have died to achieve.\n  One of our colleagues made the point this prison had done horrible \nthings under the regime of Saddam Hussein, and now it was open under \nnew management, namely the U.S. Government.\n  I find that statement to be deplorable because it suggests a moral \nequivalency between what the U.S. stands for and has done and what \nSaddam Hussein has done in that same prison. We have heard about and \nseen some evidence, and I believe there will be additional evidence \ncoming out that reveals what Saddam Hussein did to people in that \nprison--the torture, the rape, the murder--absolutely despicable \nactions that have absolutely no comparative value to what occurred--if \non more than a couple of occasions--by a handful of American soldiers \nwho did wrong and who will be punished for doing wrong.\n  The difference between our morality and the morality of Saddam \nHussein is it was his intention to inflict this kind of despicable \nhorror, and the magnitude of it was horrific, whereas in the United \nStates, we stand for exactly the opposite. We will punish those who \nconducted this kind of activity and we will make it clear that is not \nour standard. Again, the moral equivalency is so utterly lacking it is \namazing to me anybody would even try to make that connection. This is \nespecially sad in the week in which Nick Berg's death was brought home \nto us in such a\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\ngraphic way by the same kind of terrorists who held sway in Iraq under \nSaddam Hussein.\n  This is the kind of enemy we are fighting. It requires us to take \nstock about what we need to do as policymakers in discussing this \npublicly, because the message we send to the world, to terrorists, and \nto the Iraqis in particular, is going to play a large role in how \npeople view our effort and, therefore, whether it can succeed in the \nlong run.\n  If our leaders are criticizing our effort as an immoral effort, as \nnothing more than a continuation of what Saddam Hussein was doing, then \nit is doubtful our effort can succeed. Americans must stand up for what \nis right in this country and what they know our country to be, and we \nmust make it crystal clear to the rest of the world we have a moral \npurpose, that we do have a commitment to the rule of law, and anything \nthat goes outside of that rule of law will be dealt with appropriately. \nThat is the difference between our society and the society we replaced \nin Iraq.\n  That is very critical for us to discuss and to not have our leaders \nundercutting us and, therefore, calling into question the legitimacy \nnot only of the mission but of the activities of our soldiers and \nothers fighting this war.\n  The third article I would like to discuss is an op-ed, actually, \nentitled ``The Abu Ghraib Panic,'' May 14, Washington Post, by Charles \nKrauthammer. As usual, it takes a person such as Charles Krauthammer to \nput this into perspective. He always comes to the rescue when \npolicymakers and pundits and others begin to fly off on tangents that \nmiss the point, that begin to take us down the wrong path in terms of a \nlogical analysis of what is going on. He tends to bring us back to the \ncentral point we need to consider and discuss and the policy that needs \nto be carried out.\n  His op-ed today brings us back to the central point by beginning with \nthe discussion of those who have called for the resignation of the \nSecretary of Defense. He points out this exercise is what he calls \n``ministerial responsibility''--the notion that, in some parliamentary \ngovernments, if something goes wrong down below, the leader of that \nparticular department resigns, or offers his resignation, in order to \ndemonstrate the responsibility of the government. He points out that is \nnot a doctrine that has held in the United States, where there is no \nresponsibility of the individual involved.\n  Indeed, he points out even when there is responsibility for the \nindividual--the higher up individual--and that individual takes \nresponsibility, it has not been the case in this country to call for \nthe resignation of the individual.\n  The example he gives is the one of former Attorney General of the \nUnited States Janet Reno, who not only was on duty when the Branch \nDavidian compound in Waco was attacked by American forces in 1993 but \nended in the deaths of 76 people. She not only was on duty, but she \nordered the attack, which resulted in, among other things, the death of \n20 children. That was an awful event. She took responsibility for it. \nShe said, ``It was my decision and I take responsibility.'' There was \nmuch applause for her willingness to do that. But she didn't resign. \nShe was not asked to resign. She was not fired by the President, \nnotwithstanding her direct responsibility for what had occurred.\n  Compare that to the case today with Secretary Rumsfeld, who, by all \naccounts, has done a tremendous job at the Department of Defense. He \nhas successfully executed two wars. He is trying to transform our \nmilitary. He is now involved in an effort to ensure the security of \nIraq so power can be turned over on June 30; and a handful of soldiers, \nat a very low level, in a prison in Iraq commit crimes against \nprisoners somehow becomes his direct responsibility, such that he has \nto actually resign from his position in order, somehow, to demonstrate \nthe morality of our position there.\n  He doesn't have to do that because it was not his responsibility. He \nwas responsible for saying the laws of the Geneva Conventions apply. He \nwas trying to make sure everybody under his command was doing their \nduty. In no way will it ever come to pass that responsibility, in terms \nof culpability for this action, went very far up the chain. As a \nresult, it is more a frustration that some people don't know anything \nelse to do that they call for his resignation. Of course, there is a \npolitical component, too. The President's enemies use this as a way to \nget at him. One can expect that in a political environment. But it has \nsevere consequences when people around the rest of the world begin to \nthink this is the opinion not only of key policymakers in America but \nrepresents a policy that should be carried out by our Government and, \nif it is not, somehow our Government is very wrong. So there are \nconsequences of the people who discuss this in that light.\n  As Charles Krauthammer points out, that has never been the standard \nin the U.S. If you look to the case of Janet Reno, where there really \nwas culpability, and yet she wasn't fired, or she did not resign, you \ncan see this could be, in the case of many people, a political exercise \nrather than an exercise in responsible criticism.\n  The point Krauthammer tried to make here is this whole business about \nSecretary Rumsfeld is a sideshow, in any event, and that what is \nhappening is some Americans who are not adequately grounded in what \nthis country is all about, what the war is about, are beginning to \npanic. Let me quote something and then wonder aloud. He says:\n\n       The panic is unseemly. The pictures are shocking and the \n     practices appalling. But how do the actions of a few depraved \n     soldiers among 135,000 negate the moral purpose of the entire \n     enterprise--which has not only liberated 25 million people \n     from 25 years of genocidal dictatorship, but has included a \n     nationwide reconstruction punctuated by hundreds, thousands, \n     of individual acts of beneficence and kindness by American \n     soldiers?\n\n  Indeed, this panic, I believe, is due, among other things, to the \nfact that America has enjoyed such success and has had to sacrifice so \nlittle in recent time that Americans unfamiliar with the sacrifices and \nthe moral purposes of previous engagements, such as World War I and \nWorld War II in particular, and Korea and Vietnam, unfamiliar with the \nhorror of war and the requirement of a citizenry to back their fighters \nwith steadfastness and courage and support, rather than panic at the \nfirst sign that something is going wrong.\n  This panic is due to a citizenry today that may not have been \nadequately educated to the fundamental purposes of why we are there--\nand to the extent that is the policymakers' fault, I will take \nresponsibility for that as well--and perhaps are insufficiently \ngrounded in the kind of conflicts we have fought in the past and why it \nwas so important for the citizens in doing their part to support the \neffort and not panic at the first sign that something was going wrong.\n  I think of D-Day, the anniversary of which is coming up soon, and the \nterrible decision General Eisenhower had to make with the weather \nforecast suggesting a very difficult crossing of the channel, the \npredictions of German fortifications having been weakened being wrong \nso that when our troops hit the beaches, they were cut down by \nwithering fire, the great number of casualties at Omaha Beach and all \nthe rest where we thought it was going to go better than it did, and \nsecond-guessing of our generals all the way up to General Eisenhower \nwould certainly have been warranted. But the American people did not do \nthat, and the British people did not do that.\n  Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and other leaders rallied the \nAmerican people and the British people, the allies, to support the \ncause, notwithstanding the number of casualties that were occurring, \nnotwithstanding the fact that efforts were going wrong.\n  This is what President Bush has tried repeatedly to do, to say: Look, \nwe knew when we went into this it would be difficult, it would be \ncostly, it would take a long time. I remember his State of the Union \nAddress in which he said that, and it has been repeated many times \nsince.\n  I think one thing we all appreciate about President Bush is that he \ndoes have a resoluteness, a willingness to make tough decisions and \nthen the courage to stand by them. But we Americans have to back him in \nthat. You cannot panic when the going gets tough. And in war, sometimes \nthe going does get tough.\n  This is a case where it was due to our own fault. Some of our own \nsoldiers did\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nsomething very wrong, and we have to deal with that. But that is not a \nreason to panic and believe that the effort in which the other 135,000 \nare engaged is wrong or is falling apart and cannot be achieved.\n  It is rather a time for us to go back to our moorings, what Americans \nbelieve in and what we understand was the purpose of this effort, and \ndo what we can do in this effort, which is to support the effort, to \nsupport the decisionmakers, to support the Commander in Chief and, most \nof all, to support the troops.\n  I think of Pat Tillman, who played football in my home State, who \ndecided to forego a lucrative football contract with the Arizona \nCardinals because he wanted to do his part in this effort. He went to \nIraq and then went to Afghanistan and was killed there. He did his \npart. The challenge to us is, what can we do? We cannot go over there \nand fight, but we can sure do something to support those who are doing \nthe fighting. I do not mean we cannot question. That is our job. We do \nnot just meekly go along with what everybody says about this, but we \ncan certainly not do anything to undercut the effort of those putting \ntheir lives on the line. That is what we can do. That is our part. And \nit starts with not panicking, as Charles Krauthammer said.\n\n  Things go wrong in war. They went wrong in every war we fought. We \npractically got pushed off the Korean peninsula in the Korean war. Then \nGeneral MacArthur, in a brilliant move in Inchon, landed behind enemy \nlines, drove the enemy back, and did what Americans always do in the \nend: We succeed when we do not panic.\n  I suggest to those who are wringing their hands today about what is \ngoing on in Iraq to just take a deep breath, stiffen your spine, and \nremember what this country has gone through in its great history. We \nhave sacrificed a lot and it has been for good, moral purpose, and such \nis the case in Iraq.\n  Let me quote again from the Krauthammer op-ed:\n\n       We are obsessing about the wrong question. It is not: Is \n     our purpose in Iraq morally sound? Of course it is. The \n     question today, as from the beginning, remains: Is that \n     purpose achievable?\n\n  Then he goes on to say this:\n\n       Doability does not hinge on the pictures from Abu Ghraib. \n     It hinges on what happens on the ground with the \n     insurgencies. The greater general uprising that last month's \n     panic-mongers had predicted has not occurred. The Sadr \n     insurgency appears to be waning. Senior Shiite clerics, local \n     leaders and demonstrators in the streets of Najaf have told \n     Moqtada Sadr to get out of town. Meanwhile, his militia is \n     being systematically taken down by the U.S. military.\n       As for Fallujah, we have decided that trying to fully \n     eradicate Sunni resistance is too costly in U.S. lives. \n     Moreover, this ultimately is not our job but one for the 85 \n     percent of Iraqis who are not Sunni Arabs--the Shiites and \n     Kurds who will inherit the new Iraq. We have thus chosen an \n     interim arrangement of local self-rule in the Sunni hotbeds. \n     And if that gets us through the transition of power to \n     moderate Iraqis, fine.\n       This seems entirely lost on the many politicians and \n     commentators who have simply loss their bearings in the Abu \n     Ghraib panic. The prize in Iraq is not praise for America \n     from the Arab street nor goodwill from al-Jazeera. We did not \n     have these before Abu Ghraib. We will not have these after \n     Abu Ghraib. The prize is a decent, representative, \n     democratizing Iraq that abandoned the pan-Arab fantasies and \n     cruelties of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n       That remains doable. What will make it undoable is the \n     panic at home.\n\n  As I said, as usual, he is right on target.\n  So what does that teach us? Getting back to the beginning of the \ndiscussion of the Secretary of Defense and his responsibility, let's be \ncareful of the message we send to the rest of the world. Some of my \ncolleagues have said the Secretary must resign because we need to send \na message to the Arab world. What message is it? That we are sorry? We \nhave sent that message. That we take responsibility? We have already \ntaken responsibility.\n  I think it sends a message of weakness. Remember what the mantra of \nOsama bin Laden is--that there are weak horses and strong horses, and \nthe world will respect the strong horse. He believes he is the strong \nhorse, that we are the weak horse. He cites over and over Lebanon, \nSomalia, Vietnam, and he believes that Iraq falls into the same \ncategory; that if his al-Qaida and their allies in Iraq can continue to \ninflict casualties on us, if we continue to have self-doubt, disunity, \nundercut our leadership, panic over what a few of our soldiers did in \nthe prison, in the long run he will prevail because he is the strong \nhorse and we are the weak horse. That is his entire philosophy, and it \nmotivates a lot of people in that part of the world who hate us.\n  The way to defeat that philosophy is to be the strong horse because \nof our morality as well as our military power, because of what we stand \nfor in terms of returning freedom to people who did not have it, and \nbecause we do not mean to gain anything personally from it except an \nadditional degree of security from terrorists.\n  Mr. President, what we say matters. We need to conduct the debate \nand, indeed, a debate is entirely appropriate, but we need to conduct \nthe debate in a way that will not undercut the effort of those who are \nputting their lives on the line. Sometimes even words in this Chamber \ngo over the top. Sometimes words of my colleagues go over the top.\n  Certainly, there are many outside of this Chamber who reveal a panic \nof the kind that Charles Krauthammer has written about, which will \nundercut our ability to carry out our mission, and that, at the end of \nthe day, is the important point.\n  So I urge my colleagues and all others who are discussing this issue \nto try to conduct the debate and discussion in a serious, responsible \nway that does not undercut the efforts of our leaders and our troops on \nthe ground. If we do that, then we will have done our part in achieving \nvictory. We will have been responsible. We will not have undercut the \neffort, and I think we will have distinguished ourselves in the one way \nthat we can act to achieve victory.\n  Teddy Roosevelt made a comment that kind of wrapped up what he did in \nlife with all of the actions in which he engaged. Somebody asked him a \nquestion about his life and he said: I just have appreciated the \nopportunity that I have had to work on work worth doing.\n  What we are doing today is work worth doing. We need to remember \nthat, be supportive of it, and be supportive of those we have asked to \ndo the work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/14/senate-section/article/S5495-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5495-S5496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this week brought the disturbing news that \nthe Senate, the House, and the White House might not be able to agree \non a new transportation funding bill, that we would have to set it \naside then until next year to be acted upon. That would be disastrous \nfor my home State of Minnesota, and I suspect for many of the States my \ncolleagues represent.\n  Traffic congestion in our main metropolitan areas in Minnesota has \nworsened at alarming rates during the past decade. The deterioration of \nour roads, highways, and bridges throughout greater Minnesota, more \nrural areas of our State, has also reached crisis levels. More and more \nof our highways have become unsafe due to this deterioration and \ncongestion.\n  More motorists are dying, being injured or maimed as a result. \nBusiness owners and farmers find that transporting their goods and \nproducts to market takes longer and is more costly. Some of the \nseasonal national weight restrictions force major employers such as \nPolaris, Artic Cat, and Marvin Windows, which are located in \nnorthwestern Minnesota, to have to reroute their trucks, adding time, \nexpense, and unreliability that become major drawbacks to operating a \nbusiness in Minnesota.\n  Businesses executives, their employees and their families, have to \ntake longer to drive to and from work, school, and weekend cabins, and \nthey are less safe in doing so. Every day and night, many thousands of \nMinnesotans endure these delays and disruptions.\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\nThey are angry and frustrated, and they rightfully want their \nGovernment to act on their behalf now. They have paid and they will \ncontinue to pay their Federal gasoline tax dollars into the highway \ntrust fund, and they want that money fully expended on vitally needed \nhighway improvement projects starting now.\n  Our Senate bill, the one we passed some time ago, responded to their \nneeds. Our bill increased the highway and transit funding significantly \nover the next 6 years compared to the last 6 years. For my State of \nMinnesota, the increase is 81 percent, thanks to the overall increase \nwhich was passed with bipartisan support at the committee and the full \nSenate level, and with special appreciation to Senator Grassley of \nIowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for correcting the \nethanol penalty which was penalizing Minnesota and other States that \nplaced a mandate on ethanol consumption as part of every gallon of \ngasoline.\n  Senator Coleman, my colleague from Minnesota, and I worked together \nto keep these provisions benefiting Minnesota in the Senate bill. \nUnfortunately, the House scaled back their overall bill from what even \nmost of their Members wanted themselves, at the insistence of the White \nHouse. But the President said even that reduced level in the House bill \nis too high, and the Senate's version is too high a figure. In fact, \nthe President set a level of funding that is $60 billion less than in \nour Senate bill. That is $10 billion a year less for highway and other \ntransit projects throughout America.\n  We are told that every $1 billion of spending on transportation \nprojects creates 47,500 jobs. So $10 billion a year less spending means \n475,000 fewer jobs this summer, next summer, and throughout the next 6 \nyears--475,000 jobs, American jobs, jobs that we could be putting into \nplace right now. People in my State and your State would be going to \nwork right now to perform vitally needed infrastructure improvement \nprojects with dollars that have already been committed and received and \nare set aside for this purpose. Why doesn't that matter to the White \nHouse? Why can't we act as we should anyway to move this matter \nforward?\n  The President has his rightful prerogative to veto a bill with which \nhe does not agree. I am told by the manager of the bill in the Senate \nthat he believes we have the votes to override that veto because these \nprojects are so important to so many Members, and rightfully so. He \nbelieves the House has the necessary votes to override a Presidential \nveto because the projects in the bill are vitally important to their \ndistricts. That is the way the system is supposed to work. If the \nPresident vetoes, we can attempt to override so the public interest is \nserved.\n  From what I am reading this week, the majority leader and the Speaker \nof the House have said they will not take the conference committee \nreport, the final legislation, to the White House if the President is \ngoing to veto it. That means the President can dictate to the Congress \nthe level of funding he will accept, and we have no choice but either \nto agree to that reduced level or to set the bill aside until next \nyear.\n  That is not the way the process is supposed to work, if we believe in \nsomething--and we do. I commend Senator Inhofe, the manager of the \nbill, who has been tenacious and terrific at standing up for the needs \nof, I am sure, the State of Oklahoma, but also reflective of the urgent \nneeds in my State of Minnesota and elsewhere, and saying this is the \nright thing to do.\n  On paper this may look like it is some kind of brand new fiscal \nresponsibility that we certainly have not seen from the White House in \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years, with budget deficits extending now as far as the \neye can see at record levels. But this is the wrong bill to sort of \nsuddenly get fiscal religion and go on to make a spectacle of because \nthese are capital expenditures that are going to benefit our country \nfor an extended period of time, and as business owners, farm owners, \nhomeowners know, the proper reason to go into debt is for capital \nexpenditures for long-term improvements. If you are going to be \nfiscally prudent, then you pay cash for current consumption.\n  We have it backward. We are creating enormous deficits based on \ncurrent consumption, and then when we get to a bill where we should \nlegitimately be incurring debt, if we need to, for long-term capital \nexpenditures, we are going in the other direction--for politics, for \nreelection politics, not for the public interest. We know that. I bet \nthe Speaker knows that. Certainly the members in his caucus know that.\n\n  We need to stand up and speak out and insist that our voices be \nheard, that our proffer of responsibilities in this body on behalf of \nthe people of our States be exercised. Our leader and the House leader \nshould take this bill to conference and protect all the projects that \nare of concern to myself and members of my caucus--as the projects of \nimportance to the members of the majority caucus will be, I am sure, \nprotected, as they should be, just as is the tradition in the House. \nWriting those into the actual House bill will, I am told, ensure they \nwill be protected, honored, for both the Republican and Democratic \nMembers. That is the way the system has worked, I am told, in the past.\n  Frankly, I think we should dispense with all of those earmarked \nprojects which benefit some States far more than others--more than my \nState--because of the way the memberships on committees and seniority \nfalls, but that is a discussion for another day.\n  Given that is the system we have, I certainly understand why I and my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle need to and should have the right \nto assurances that our projects are going to be treated as they have \nbeen in the past and not just discarded in the committee, as so many of \nour amendments and proposals have been in other legislation earlier \nthis year and last year.\n  But that is something that can readily be resolved. That is a very \nminor consideration compared to what, I am told, is the real obstacle \nright now, and that is to get the leadership of the Senate and the \nHouse to be willing to take a bill to the President that we say is the \nright thing to do. We know what that is. It is what our Senate bill \nprovided overall and for our respective States. It is a fiscally \nresponsible bill because it uses every dollar in the highway trust fund \nover the next 6 years--not more than that, not less than that. We know \nour States need those expenditures.\n  Let the President veto the bill if that is his decision. Then let's \noverride it here and in the House and then it becomes law. Then those \n475,000 Americans who are either drawing unemployment benefits--or many \nof them, I believe, have probably exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits; just this week we found the Senate unwilling to provide an \nextension of those benefits--can go back to work in construction jobs \nand related jobs.\n  This bill more than anything we have done in tax adjustments will put \nAmericans to work--now, this summer, right away--when they need work. \nWe can't turn our back on that opportunity and that responsibility. \nLet's make the system work the way it is supposed to work. Let's pass \nthis bill. Let's get it to the White House. Let's take it back and do \nwhat is necessary to make it law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I speak \nabout a true friend and colleague. For 26 years, Hope Harris served the \npeople of Rhode Island as a member of my staff, and prior to that, on \nthe staff of my late father, Senator John H. Chafee. Hope Harris was \nknown to thousands of Rhode Islanders who have visited and telephoned \ntheir Senator as the sympathetic and trustworthy professional answering \nthe phone and the door at the front desk in their Senator's Providence \noffice. She was without peer in her ability to convey, in a brief \nencounter, that the mission of the Senator's State operation is to help \npeople in any way possible. On May 12, Hope died after a difficult \nstruggle with cancer.\n  Hope's impact on my ability to represent the people of Rhode Island \ncannot be overstated. Her impact was felt by every anxious senior \ncitizen who experienced a problem with Social Security, by every parent \ncalling to plan a family trip to Washington, every young\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nidealist determined to save the world, and every beleaguered citizen \nconvinced that the government is after them. When they called or \nvisited my office seeking help--an answer or action or reassurance--\nHope was the first person they encountered in their quest. In the space \nbetween saying, ``Good morning, Senator Chafee's office,'' and hitting \nthe ``transfer'' button, Hope put people at ease, instilled calm, \nbecame a friend.\n  People were not numbers to Hope; they were souls in search of a \nconnection, one that maybe Hope could help them find. One of her \ngreatest gifts was her ability to see the humanity of all people, \nregardless of social station, political power, religion, or race. In \nthat, she remains an example for us all. Thanks to Hope's extraordinary \nability to convey that human connection, Rhode Islanders knew that our \noffice was a welcoming and responsive place.\n  Hope remained optimistic and of good cheer regardless of what was \ngoing on in her personal life. In 2001, she lost her husband. And she \nhas faced, and lost, a daunting battle with cancer. Through it all, \nHope demonstrated the highest level of dedication to her job, never \nbetraying to any individual constituent that they were anything but the \ncenter of her universe.\n  Hope was involved in many volunteer organizations throughout the \ncourse of her career. She was most recently active with the AIDS \nProject of Rhode Island and she cherished her involvement with the \nFirst Pentecostal Church and the Congdon Street Baptist Church.\n  In 2003, Hope celebrated her 25th year as a Senate employee. And just \nrecently, on May 3, 2004, Hope was the proud recipient of the Federal \nEmployee of the Year Award by the Rhode Island Association of Federal \nEmployees. This honor was richly deserved. All of the Chafee family and \nthe myriad of people who have been touched by the life of Hope Harris \nwill miss her joy for living. She was the heart and soul of our \nProvidence office.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of an \narticle that appeared in the Providence Journal on March 11, 2004, that \nspeaks to the true essence of Hope Harris.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, Mar. 11, 2004]\n\n                  On the Job: Hope Harris, Chafee Aide\n\n                         (By M. Charles Bakst)\n\n       Hope Harris, 72, the receptionist in Sen. Lincoln Chafee's \n     Providence office, likes looking out from her desk at 170 \n     Westminster St. The view from this 11th floor aerie is \n     striking and she says, ``It gives you a sense of being close \n     to the Lord.''\n       Harris's is the voice you are likeliest to have heard if \n     you've phoned the Chafee shop during the last quarter \n     century. For most of that span, of course, the senator was \n     John Chafee, Lincoln's late father.\n       Harris is enthusiastic, pleasant, and at peace. She has an \n     advanced case of cancer that has spread from her liver to her \n     breast area. She comes in now only four days a week; if she \n     tires, she goes home. I find it remarkable that she works at \n     all, but Harris says, ``I love what I'm doing.''\n       Barbara Berke, a Harris pal and former colleague says, \n     ``She's happy and she wants to make the world happy.''\n       Chafee marvels at Harris's patience in fielding constituent \n     calls. ``People like to tee off, they like to vent, and \n     sometimes they go over the top,'' he says.\n       How ironic that some people don't realize Harris is black.\n       A man phoned to grouse about Jesse Jackson. Harris, no \n     Jackson fan, said she wouldn't argue. But the man said, ``I \n     wish they's put him on a boat and send him back to Africa--\n     and all the rest of them, too.'' Harris said, ``Well, I \n     didn't do anything. I don't want to go to Africa. I don't \n     know anybody there.'' The man laughed and said he didn't mean \n     her. By the end of the conversation, Harris says, they were \n     friends.\n       Once a man who'd called for years came in to meet her. ``He \n     looked at me. He said, `Are you Hope?' I said, `Yeah.' He \n     said, `You're black!' I said, `I know. What should I do?' He \n     said, `Oh, nothing, it's all right.' ''\n       Harris hears from people with immigration problems, or \n     folks looking for a job reference, or who think Republican \n     Chafee should bolt parties, or who are lonely, or who have \n     strong views on abortion--including backers of legislation \n     outlawing a form of late-term abortion and who talk about \n     fetuses having their brains sucked out. ``They want me to get \n     the willies,'' she says. (Like Chafee, she opposes such \n     bans.)\n       Harris adds, ``Everybody that calls here is somebody \n     important to me because they're a voter. . . . When they are \n     abusive, when I'm through with them, they're nice. They calm \n     down. John Chafee said, `Hope can tame the wildest beast.' ''\n       State Rep. Maxine Bradford Shavers, D-Newport, Harris's \n     sister-in-law says the key to understanding her is that \n     ``she's a Christian.''\n       While Chafee press aide Debbie Rich, who is Jewish, sits by \n     and listens, Harris defines ``Christian'' this way: ``It \n     means that Debbie and I have the same blood running through \n     our veins. If Debbie bleeds, I get the Band-Aid. If I bleed, \n     Debbie gets the Band-Aid. If I know you're hurting, I will \n     get you water. I love you with all of my heart and I love \n     everybody.''\n       As Harris, who was raised a Baptist, mulls her cancer, she \n     says her life is in God's hands and she has no fear. She \n     knows who she wants to speak at her funeral, which will be at \n     Beneficent Congregational Church, more spacious than the \n     Providence Church of God where she currently worships. She \n     has picked out some hymns, including ``How Great Thou Art.''\n       When I talk of death, I say someone has died. But you might \n     hear Harris say ``passed.'' She explains, ``It means they go \n     from one degree of grace to another. They pass over.'' Though \n     her body will return to dust, ``My spirit will soar.''\n       She declares, ``In my heart, I just look to the heavens and \n     I think, `My God! Some day I'll see Him face to face.'

Mr. President, this week our Nation's police officers \ngathered in Washington, DC to commemorate National Police Week. The \nweek long tribute to our Nation's Federal, State, and local police \nofficers honors those who have died in the line of duty and those who \ncontinue to serve and protect us at great personal risk everyday.\n  The first National Police Week was celebrated in 1962 when President \nJohn F. Kennedy signed an Executive Order designating May 15 as Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as ``Police \nWeek.'' Every year since, tens of thousands of Federal, State and local \npolice officers have come to Washington to honor those that have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  In addition to a number of other events, police officers join for a \ncandle light vigil at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. \nThe first memorial service took place on May 15, 1982. On that date, \napproximately 125 police officers assembled in the Senate park to honor \nthe law enforcement officers who had been killed that year. Over the \npast 22 years, over 3,000 law enforcement officers from around the \ncountry have been so honored.\n  Today, there are approximately 870,000 sworn law enforcement officers \nserving in the United States. Over the past 10 years, a total of 1,658 \nlaw enforcement officers have died in the line of duty, of which 145 \nwere killed in 2003. Over the course of this week, all 145 of these \nofficers have been honored and tonight their names will be added to \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  One way we can further honor the sacrifices of these brave men and \nwomen is to pass sensible gun safety legislation. A number of my \ncolleagues, with my support, have sought to do just that. That is why I \ncosponsored the Gun Show Background Check Act introduced by Senator \nReed. I support that bill because I believe it is an important tool to \nhelp to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. This \nbill simply applies existing law governing background checks to persons \nbuying guns at gun shows. It is supported by a variety of law \nenforcement organizations including the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs of Police, National Black Police \nAssociation, Police Foundation and National Troopers Coalition.\n  The law enforcement community has also asked Congress to reauthorize \nthe 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific \nweapons, as well as a number of other weapons incorporating certain \ndesign characteristics such as pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet \nmounts, and flash suppressors. The assault weapons ban also prohibited \nthe manufacture of semiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two \nof these military features and which accept a detachable magazine. This \nlaw is scheduled to expire on September 13, 2004.\n  I support the efforts of the law enforcement community who are \ncalling for legislation extending the law. In 1994, I voted for the \nassault weapons ban and, last month, I joined a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate in voting\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nto extend the assault weapons ban for 10 years.\n  Law enforcement support for the assault weapons ban is broad. It \nincludes the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, the Police Foundation, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Association of School Resource Officers, the National \nFraternal Order of Police, National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, the Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation, and the National Black Police Association. I hope the \nSenate will stand with our Nation's law enforcement community and \nsupport these important pieces of gun safety legislation.\n  I know all of my colleagues join me in remembering those who have \nserved and continue to serve in our Nation's law enforcement community \nand thanking them for their sacrifices.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n   Mr. SARBANES. This week, beginning May 9th, we celebrate \nNational Police Week, culminating in Peace Officers' Memorial Day on \nMay 15th. It is a time for us to remember the dedicated men and women \nwho put their lives on the line every day to make our communities \nsafer.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15th as Peace \nOfficers' Memorial Day, and the week in which May 15th falls as \nNational Police Week. During this week, tens of thousands of law \nenforcement officers from around the world converge on Washington, DC \nto participate in activities highlighting the importance of law \nenforcement to citizens' daily lives.\n  This past year, 154 police officers were killed in the line of duty. \nThat is 154 fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, daughters, and sons \nwho did not go home to the families waiting for them at the end of the \nworkday. Since the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund \nstarted keeping such statistics, 16,500 police officers have been \nkilled in the line of duty. In my home State of Maryland, we have lost \na total of 246 police officers. On average, one law enforcement officer \nis killed somewhere in America every 53 hours. The risk encountered by \nthose law enforcement officers serving in communities throughout this \ncountry--men and women who get up every morning to go to work knowing \nit is entirely possible they will not come home at the end of the day--\nis enormous. Such commitment deserves more than one week to appreciate.\n  We spend a lot of time, especially in this day and age, as we should, \nworrying about and praying for the nearly 150,000 young men and women \nserving in our armed services in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same \ntime, I believe it is important to reflect on the 870,000 men and women \nserving in law enforcement who protect our homeland day in and day out. \nThese are the police officers who ensure that our children get to \nschool safely, that our roads are safe from the dangers of speeding or \ndrunk drivers, that ensure our neighborhoods are protected from the \nviolence associated with gangs and drugs, and that come to our aid when \ntragedy strikes.\n  I want to make mention of a few poignant examples of the risk that \nthose involved in this profession face every day. Maryland State Police \nTrooper First-Class Anthony Jones was killed last week when a drunk \ndriver struck him while he was fulfilling his duty seeking to help \nanother trooper respond to a car accident. Trooper Jones left behind a \nwife and two daughters.\n  Then there is Detective Thomas Newman of the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment who was shot to death in 2002 in retaliation for his \ntestifying against a man who had shot another police officer in 2001. \nDetective Newman was ambushed by three assailants who continued to fire \nat him even after he fell to the ground.\n  Also deserving of our thoughts and prayers this week are the families \nof Prince George's County Sheriffs Deputies Elizabeth Magruder and \nJames Arnaud. The two were shot and killed while serving a court order \nfor an emergency psychiatric evaluation on a man in Prince George's \nCounty. Magruder left behind a husband and four-year-old son while \nArnaud left behind a wife, son, daughter and grandchildren.\n  These are just a few examples of the brave men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line so that all of us can sleep more soundly at \nnight. The sacrifices they and their families have made are too \nnumerous to count and to deep for words to express. But at least during \nthis National Police Week, we are able to take a moment to appreciate \ntheir efforts and the efforts of their colleagues that are still \nserving. As St. John said, ``No one has greater love than this, to lay \ndown one's life for one's friends.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/14/senate-section/article/S5498-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5498-S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STRENGTH (JOBS) ACT\n\n\n                         irs free file program\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, for their work \non the Tax Administration Good Government Act. The legislation provides \ntaxpayer safeguards, streamlines tax administration, and simplifies the \ntax code. I do have some concern with one provision in the bill. \nSpecifically, the bill also includes a provision on the IRS Free File \nProgram. The Free File Program is the result of a public-private \npartnership agreement between the IRS and the Free File Alliance, LLC, \na group of tax software companies managed by the Council for the \nElectronic Revenue Communication Advancement, CERCA. It is important to \ncontinue to promote these types of public-private partnerships and it \nis my hope that we can work together on this provision as we move to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Virginia. The IRS Free File \nProgram is a direct result of the goal that Congress set for the IRS to \nhave 80 percent of returns filed electronically by 2007. The \npartnership agreement calls for the Free File Alliance to provide free \ntax preparation and filing to at least 60 percent of all taxpayers or \napproximately 78 million individuals who file an individual tax return. \nEach participating software company has its own eligibility \nrequirements. The eligibility requirements ensure that lower income, \ndisadvantaged and under-served taxpayers benefit from the free file \nprogram with the Free File Alliance, LLC. The provision in the bill was \nintended to ensure that the taxpayers participating in the Free File \nProgram were affirmatively consenting to solicitation for other \nproducts or services. I look forward to working with him to ensure that \nwe continue to promote such public-private partnerships.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with Chairman Grassley. It is our intent with the \nFree File provision to protect the integrity of our voluntary tax \nsystem by providing lower income, disadvantaged and under-served \ntaxpayers the ability to meet their filing obligation without \nsubjecting themselves to unwanted marketing. I also commit to work with \nSenator Allen as we conference with the House.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the chairman and ranking member.\n\n\n                       continuing care facilities\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, for including a provision that I supported as part of the Tax \nAdministration Good Government Act to level the playing field for \nresidents of qualified continuing care retirement communities.\n  Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, are the oldest form \nof seniors housing in America, dating back to the late 1800s--offering \na variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate residents \nof all levels of physical ability and health. The goal of a CCRC is to \naccommodate changing lifestyle preferences and health care needs. In \ngeneral, CCRCs make independent living, assisted living, and skilled \nnursing available all on one campus. The CCRC approach offers residents \nthe pyschological and financial security of knowing that, should they \nrequire increased levels of care, it is readily available at one \nlocation. As a private pay option, CCRCs also play an important role in \nthe Nation's long-term care delivery system because very few, if any, \nCCRC residents will ever require Medicaid funding for their long-term \ncare.\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Florida for his comments. This \nis a provision that I have also supported. The provision included in \nthe bill will go a long way for those seniors who live in the affected \nCCRCs. I also want to clarify one point with Senator Baucus. It is my \nunderstanding that the purpose of the amendment is to bring the tax \ntreatment of those CCRCs described in section 7872(g) into alignment \nwith the treatment that has historically been afforded to those CCRCs \nthat are not described in section 7872(g). In other words, there is no \nintent to alter the treatment that the IRS has historically provided \nfor CCRCs that are not described in section 7872(g). I am committed to \nworking with Senator Graham as we move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the chairman. There is no intent to alter \nthe treatment that the IRS has historically provided for CCRCs that are \nnot described in section 7872(g). This is a critical point that could \naffect a large number of seniors. We do not want there to be any \nmisunderstanding on this issue since the immediate consequences could \nbe significant--with large numbers of seniors potentially having to pay \nadditional taxes. I also know that Senator Mikulski has expressed an \ninterest in this provision. I give my commitment to both Senators \nGraham and Mikulski to work with them on this provision as we go to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the chairman and ranking member for \nclarifying the intent of this provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/14/senate-section/article/S5499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Edgar Garzon, 35, died three weeks after he was attacked when leaving \na gay bar in Jackson Heights, NY, on August 14, 2001. Garzon suffered a \nskull fracture in the attack and died at Elmhurst General Hospital. \nGarzon had just left Friends Tavern when two men in a red car exchanged \nwords with him and followed him toward his home.

The two leaders have \nbeen working the last several days to come up with some way to dispose \nof judges who are on the Executive Calendar. We believe we have done a \ncredible job as a Senate. We have approved 173 judges. There have been \nfive turned down by the minority. We now have the lowest vacancy rate \nin some 14 years.\n  There are two problems with going forward. Of course, I don't think \nit is any secret President Bush has defied the Senate with recess \nappointments. So we have to have some finality there as to what he is \ngoing to do in the future. The other problem is the judges we voted on \nmultiple times before. There has to be some consideration to those \nissues and how we deal with them. I think with the conversations going \non between the two leaders we should be able to do that. I am confident \nand hopeful we will not need the cloture vote set for Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL.
