Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I note that in \na few minutes the Senate will begin a series of three rollcall votes. \nWith the completion of these three votes, the Senate will have passed \ntwo appropriations bills. The first of these votes will be on the \nSessions AmeriCorps amendment. Following that vote, the Senate will \nvote on passage of H.R. 2657, the legislative branch appropriations \nbill, which will immediately be followed by a vote on passage of H.R. \n2559, the military construction appropriations bill. The second and \nthird votes in this series will be 10-minute votes. Therefore, Senators \nare encouraged to remain in the Chamber until all three votes have been \ncompleted. The majority leader will have more to say on the schedule \nfollowing these votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are 15 minutes on the motion of the \nSenator from Alabama to strike. He will have 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nother 7\\1/2\\ minutes will be under my control.\n  First, I would like to see if the distinguished Democratic whip would \nlike to make some comments. I do have a motion to make.\n  Mr. REID. I am here for the motion by the Senator.\n\n\n               Further Modification to Amendment No. 1201\n\n                    Amendment No. 1206, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the modification I send to \nthe desk to amendment No. 1201, offered by Senator Reid and myself and \nSenator Feinstein, previously agreed to, be modified pursuant to this \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent that the following technical \nmodification to amendment No. 1206, offered by myself and Senator \nLandrieu, be further modified by the language at the desk.\n  These amendments were modified on the floor, and last evening we \ndiscovered they had to be perfected, so I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The further modification to amendment No. 1201 is as follows:\n\n       On page 53, line 19, strike ``$36,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$61,000,000''.\n       On page 53, line 20, insert before the colon the following:\n       ``of which $25,000,000 shall be available for emergency \n     actions to reduce the threat to human safety in areas \n     declared under a State of Emergency by the Governor of any \n     State due to the danger of catastrophic fire from\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\n     dead and dying trees, including--(1) clearing of evacuation \n     routes, (2) clearing around emergency shelter locations, (3) \n     clearing around emergency communication sites, and (4) \n     clearing buffer zones around highly populous communities in \n     order to prevent fire sweeping through such communities''\n\n  Amendment No. 1206, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Making emergency appropriations to the Corps of Engineers for \n                         emergency assistance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: Provided \n     further, That for an additional amount for ``Corps of \n     Engineer--Civil, Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies,'' for \n     emergency expenses due to flood control, hurricane, and shore \n     protection activities, as authorized by section 5 of the \n     Flood Control Act of August 16, 1941, as amended (33 U.S.C. \n     701n), $10,000,000, to remain available until expended:''\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCornyn of Texas be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the $100 \nmillion for AmeriCorps that is contained in the emergency supplemental \nportion of this bill. The President did not request these funds. The \nadministration does not support this appropriation as part of an \nemergency supplemental. These funds are not offset. In fact, every \nsingle penny that will be spent of this $100 million will go directly \nto the debt of the American people. It will increase the debt entirely, \nbecause we are in a deficit situation and emergency spending by \ndefinition is above our budget, and even our budget takes us into debt.\n  This is not an emergency. It is just one more typical bureaucratic \nfailure in a governmental program that caused them to run short, and \nnow they want the taxpayers to run up the debt to pay for the \nshortfall. I think it is just not the right thing to do.\n  It is suggested that we have to have this money now. But if you read \nthe language in the legislation, it says the funds are to remain \navailable until September 30, 2004. That means this could come up in \nthe regular appropriations bill for VA-HUD, and they could put it \nwithin the budget and fund it through next year, fiscal year 2004. That \nis really what should occur, if they want to spend extra money to bail \nout the mismanagement of the AmeriCorps program which all Senators--\neven those who support this bill--are critical of and are trying to do \nsomething about.\n  In addition, it says the educational awards will remain available \nuntil expended. That means they could be spent over a period of years.\n  Why are we bringing it forward on this emergency supplemental bill? \nIt is because it does not count against the budget allocation the \nappropriations subcommittee has for all of the programs within their \nvenue.\n\n  If they have to come up with extra money for appropriations under the \ncurrent law and under the budget, that means they may have to be tight \nacross the board and find the money somewhere else, or maybe they will \nhave to reduce what AmeriCorps would like to have.\n  Those are tough decisions. But that is what we get paid to do every \nday around here. By allowing them to tack this on top of the bill and \nadd directly to the debt of the American people relieves the pressure \nthat was caused by the mismanagement under these circumstances.\n  I note the chairman of the House VA-HUD Committee--a Peace Corps \nvolunteer himself, and a strong supporter of the AmeriCorps program, \nCongressman Jim Walsh of New York--is very strongly opposed to this \neven though he supported AmeriCorps from the beginning. He issued a \nnews release and full statement dealing with this issue. He makes a \nnumber of very important points--from a man who really cares about this \nprogram and doing the right thing.\n  For example, he said:\n\n       My opposition to the Senate's supplemental AmeriCorps \n     appropriations proposal comes down to an issue of \n     accountability. We shouldn't reward an agency that violates \n     Federal law and mismanages taxpayer dollars by providing \n     additional funding until clear and consistent reforms have \n     been enacted. Should these requested funds be appropriated, I \n     have little faith that the existing operation could get the \n     funding out of Washington to local community grantees \n     effectively or equitably by the end of fiscal year on \n     September 30.\n\n  He goes on to make other points.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this news release before they commit on \nhow they intend to vote. The emergency bill has disaster relief, space \nshuttle, wildfires, and AmeriCorps. I would add that Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste has written in opposition to this legislation. They \nurge it to be defeated. I note they intend to score this legislation, \nas do other groups that care about mismanagement, including Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for \nTax Reform, and others.\n  It is an important vote. We ought not to go around the budget we \npassed--and I served as a member of the committee--and tack on $100 \nmillion for a bureaucratic snafu and running that $100 million directly \nagainst the debt of the American people in violation of the Budget Act.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland, and 4 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  I rise in vigorous opposition to the Sessions amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  I offered the amendment in the Appropriations Committee to add $100 \nmillion for AmeriCorps in this urgent supplemental. It has strong \nbipartisan support. Senators Stevens, Byrd, Bond, and many others \nsupport my amendment. But it is not about supporting my amendment. It \nis about supporting AmeriCorps at this very troubled time.\n  If we do not do this $100 million, there will be a cut of over 15,000 \nAmeriCorps volunteers right this minute. These cuts are being announced \ntoday.\n  How did this happen? There was a bureaucratic boondoggle. There was a \nbureaucratic snafu. They overenrolled 20,000 volunteers. Every year, \nthe VA-HUD subcommittee funds 50,000 volunteers. But they overenrolled \nwith 70,000. How did we know about it? Senator Bond chaired the \nsubcommittee leading the fight for reform in fiscal responsibility, and \nuncovered it at the April 15 hearing. The House put out a press \nrelease. We put out performance. We found the mistake.\n  We worked on a bipartisan basis to correct the accounting. I called \nfor new leadership. But that is not a substitute for the need for new \nfunds.\n  This is an emergency today. Who are we going to punish, if we don't \ndo the money? Not the bureaucracy, not the boondogglers, but the \nvolunteers in our communities.\n  There is a question about why now. The law says funding for \nvolunteers and the awards that help them pay off their student debt \nmust be in the Federal checkbook when the volunteers begin their \nservice. For many of them, they are going to begin their service now \nbecause they are going to be in school-based programs. Teach America, \nfor example--which we all love--if this is not in there, 1,000 Teach \nAmerica kids will not be in classrooms; and Jump Start, which works \nwith Head Start and organizes and leverages other volunteers. When we \nlook at what we are doing here, we need to know that if AmeriCorps does \nnot get this funding now they will not be able to sign up volunteers \nright this minute for these programs.\n  This is to get AmeriCorps over the troubled waters. The President has \nannounced a new CEO. Senator Bond has led the effort for a new chief \nfinancial officer. He has been the leader of the reform effort, and has \nhad my utmost support.\n  We can't wait until next year. If we do, we are going to squander \nvolunteer opportunities. The President has called for a new spirit of \nvoluntarism. Young people have responded. We need to respond to the \ncall to meet our responsibility and not punish these communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alabama yield time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield such time as is remaining to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n\n[[Page S9271]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Alabama \nfor raising an important issue. I hope our colleagues will vote in \nfavor of his amendment for a lot of different reasons.\n  First, this shouldn't be in the urgent supplemental. There is nothing \nemergency about it. Frankly, we gave AmeriCorps $64 million just last \nApril.\n  Second, it wasn't requested by the administration. You would think if \nit was urgent it would have been requested. It was not.\n  Third, when you look at this, it is really funding for 2004. We only \nhave 2\\1/2\\ months left in 2003. The Congressional Budget Office says \nzero money will be spent in 2003. Not one dime of it will be spent in \n2003.\n  As a matter of fact, if you look at language in the bill, it says \n$100 million in funds and grants will remain available until September \n30, 2004, and funds for educational awards will remain available until \nexpended. So the net essence of this is we are helping out 2004 \nappropriations bills. This should be done in 2004.\n\n  If we want to have a wrestling match over mismanagement of \nAmeriCorps--and I don't doubt they have had mismanagement--this is a \nprogram that purports to be all volunteer, but we find out it costs \n$20,000 per year per volunteer. Actually, I think it has come down to \n$18,000 per year per volunteer. Congratulations.\n  It has been fraught with mismanagement from the get-go, and now we \nfind out we are going to be basically funding a 2004 appropriations \nbill under the guise of an emergency so it will not be counted for \n2003. I am willing to go along with some emergency spending, but I \nthink this is an abuse of the process.\n  I compliment my colleague from Alabama. I do not think it should be \nincluded in the supplemental. I urge my colleagues to support his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the provision \nsponsored by my colleague, Senator Mikulski, the chairman, Senator \nStevens, and others in the Appropriations Committee, and I urge that we \ntable the amendment.\n  This $100 million is something that is needed now to continue the \nPresident's strong commitment to assuring that we have a robust \nvolunteer program in the United States. The President has spoken very \neloquently about the need for volunteers, and I think all of us know \nhow important volunteers are in our communities.\n  AmeriCorps is a means of providing assistance, and we need those \nfunds now. There are some 20,000 slots ready for volunteers. In \nprevious years they have committed to them. They overcommitted, no \nquestion about it. AmeriCorps has been fraught with mistakes and \nmismanagement, but there have been young people in America who have \nanswered the call to volunteer. There are programs in America waiting \nfor these volunteers. By making these funds available now, we can allow \nAmeriCorps to commit for the programs that begin with the new school \nyear starting in September and to make sure there is not a hiatus in \nthe programs.\n  There is no question about the mistakes of AmeriCorps, but we should \nnot punish the young people of this country who want to give something \nback through community service. The volunteers are ready now, and we \nshould not disappoint them or the communities they serve. This $100 \nmillion is necessary to keep the program moving.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has so eloquently described, we have \nspent 8 years on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee trying to \nstraighten this program out. My colleague from Maryland rightly called \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service to task for the \ncontinuing problems. We have demanded the administration take \ncorrective action. They are taking that action. Thanks in large part to \nSenator Mikulski, I think we are getting a response from the \nCorporation that will fix the problems and restore the accountability. \nWe, I assure you, will continue appropriate oversight. The commitment \nof my colleague from Maryland to this program is enduring and strong, \nand we will see that it gets the leadership it needs.\n  The concerns of the House chairman that were mentioned by my \ncolleague from Alabama are being addressed by requiring the inspector \ngeneral to audit the AmeriCorps program and defund those programs that \nhave not performed. Further, I have led the congressional efforts of \noversight through the GAO and IG audits. That is how we found out about \nthe problems. And we authored the Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act, \nwhich passed Congress in 2 days and was signed by the President last \nweek, to correct the financial accounting problems.\n  I would not support these funds if I thought there were management \nproblems that were not being corrected. They are. I urge my colleagues \nto table the amendment.\n  (At the request for Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for \nAmeriCorps. The $100 million added in the Appropriations Committee for \nAmeriCorps is vital to continuing the hard work that so many young \npeople around the country are doing today. Stripping this funding out \nof the bill would leave thousands of AmeriCorps members in my State, \nand throughout the country, out in the cold. And it will leave \ncommunities without the contributions and hard work of thousands.\n  There are nearly 8,000 AmeriCorps volunteers in my State, working in \n366 program sites. They are in communities from Anaheim to Westminster, \nhelping children read, restoring our environment, and building homes \nfor the needy. Their contributions to the quality of life in our cities \nand towns are immeasurable. The additional funding in this bill is \ndesperately needed.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that bureaucratic blunders by the \nCorporation for National and Community Service, the agency that runs \nAmeriCorps, should not be rewarded by giving the program additional \nfunding. We all know, however, that the work of Senators Mikulski and \nBond has gone far to correct many of the problems at the corporation. \nAs the accounting reforms continue, AmeriCorps will flourish once \nagain. This $100 million in this bill is a step in that direction.\n  I hope my colleagues will follow the lead of the distinguished chair \nand ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee, and vote to table this \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin this effort to keep this promise of AmeriCorps and to support the \namendment to add $100 million to the supplemental.\n  It is inspiring to see the good work that volunteers do every day, \ntutoring, mentoring, providing access to health care, and building \nstronger communities in so many different ways. Over 200,000 young men \nand women have dedicated a year of their lives to AmeriCorps and these \nactivities. Their service has helped others in urgent need, expanded \ncommunity-based organizations, and strengthened whole communities. They \nhave transformed the lives of others, and transformed their own lives, \ntoo.\n  Yet, this successful program faces devastating cuts--not because of \nproblems in the services they provide, but because of financial \nmanagement problems at the Corporation for National Service. That is \nunacceptable. When mistakes are made inside the Beltway, people across \nAmerica should not have to pay for those mistakes.\n  I hope our proposal will have strong bipartisan support and pass as \nit did in the Appropriations Committee, so that we can correct this \nsituation before even more young volunteers who are ready, willing, and \nable to serve are denied the opportunity to serve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply the necessity to move to \ntable the motion of the Senator from Alabama. There has been a serious \nmistake in this program, and these young people were notified they \nwould be enrolled in August and September.\n  The statements made on both sides are absolutely correct. Both sides \nhave\n\n[[Page S9272]]\n\na point; that is, this should not have happened. But it did happen, and \nwe felt compelled to keep the commitment to those people who were told \nthey would be enrolled and to put up the money so they will be enrolled \nfor the school year that starts in September.\n  I do hope the Senate understands we will do everything possible to \nprevent this from happening again. I commend the Senator from Maryland \nand the Senator from Missouri for their diligence in finding out what \nhappened and for bringing this to our attention, but there is no other \nway than to keep the commitment we have made and to see to it that \nAmeriCorps does continue to enroll these people. The enrollment for \nnext year, as I understand it, will be at the authorized level of \n50,000. I think that is the problem, to make certain that does not \nhappen again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment. I believe \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for the yeas and nays at this time on the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for the yeas and nays on the military construction bill \nwhich will later be before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmilitary construction bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, it is \nmy intention to ask the majority leader to\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\nbring the Defense appropriations bill before the Senate on Monday. That \nwill be announced later, I hope. We hope we can have the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee bill, then the Labor appropriations bill, \nthen the Homeland Security bill considered next week by the Senate.\n  I thank the Senate for their cooperation on this bill. This is \nanother 10-minute vote; is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just very briefly add to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Once we have this last vote, there will be no more \nrollcall votes today. We will be voting on Monday. We may have several \nvotes on Monday but after 5 o'clock. We will be on Defense on Monday, \nand, again, we probably will have several votes Monday evening.\n  After this vote, we will be going back to State Department \nauthorization. We would like to finish that bill. In order to do that, \nwe would need to be considering amendments that have something to do \nwith State authorization and not nongermane amendments. The intention \nis to attempt to finish that bill. We will not have any rollcall votes \ntoday. But again I make the plea with my colleagues to stay for \namendments that are on State Department authorization as we go forward.\n  Again, this will be the last rollcall vote, this one right now, until \nafter 5 o'clock on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9279-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9279-S9283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2559, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2559) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it seems that every week we \ndiscover additional drinking water sources that have been contaminated \nwith perchlorate. More than 20 million Americans in at least 24 States \ndrink water contaminated with perchlorate, including: Alabama, Arizona, \nCalifornia, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, \nNew Mexico, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia. In California alone, \ndrinking water sources for up to 10 million people are contaminated \nwith perchlorate. Perchlorate also contaminates much of the lower \nColorado River, the main water source for 20 million people across the \nSouthwest, including much of California, Arizona, and Nevada. Millions \nmore eat produce grown with Colorado River water.\n  We know that perchlorate is the main ingredient in rocket fuel, which \naccounts for 90 percent of its use. It dissolves readily in many \nliquids, including water, and moves easily and quickly. There is \ngeneral agreement that perchlorate is highly toxic and that even at low \nconcentrations perchlorate poses a serious threat to human health, \nincluding thyroid cancer and mental and physical retardation. The \ngreatest risks are to pregnant women, newborns, and children.\n  We also know that the Department of Defense (DOD) has long been not \nonly the primary consumer of perchlorate but also intimately involved \nin its manufacturing. EPA believes that perchlorate may be present \nwherever rockets or rocket fuel was made--at least 162 sites in 36 \nStates. The California Department of Health Services has detected \nperchlorate in 292 public groundwater wells, the majority of which are \nlocated near facilities operated by the Department of Defense or its \ncontractors. Additional information provided to the Senate by DOD \nfurther confirms that perchlorate contamination is potentially \nwidespread and pervasive at military installations.\n  The Defense Department has said that it is not willing to start \ncleanup of perchlorate until there is a national drinking water \nstandard, but the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that it \nwill further delay finalizing the standard for at least another 2 \nyears. Our military has protected the American people for centuries. \nFor this, we are grateful. DOD must reaffirm that this commitment \nextends to protecting citizens within the United States from threats to \ntheir public health that may arise from critical defense activities. \nDOD must not adopt a delay strategy while private parties and local \ncommunities, such as California's Inland Empire, San Gabriel Valley, \nand the Sacramento area, adopt costly measures to assure the purity of \ndrinking water supplies.\n  DOD is legally obligated to clean up perchlorate and other hazardous \nwaste contamination at its sites under a variety of State and Federal \nlaws and regulations, including, for example, the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund), the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, and State hazardous waste \ncleanup laws. Communities have already spent millions on priority \nactions to reduce the threat to Americans--and I urge the Defense \nDepartment to do so as well.\n  Perchlorate is a clear and present danger to California's, and the \nNation's, public health. We cannot wait any longer to address this \nthreat. DOD needs to get moving and protect our drinking water sooner \nrather than later.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1357, the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending cap for 2004.\n  The pending bill provides $9.2 billion in new budget authority and \n$2.6 billion in new outlays in fiscal year 2004 for military \nconstruction, family housing, and base realignment and closure for the \nDepartment of Defense. With outlays from prior years and other \ncompleted actions, the Senate bill totals $9.2 billion in budget \nauthority and $10.3 billion in outlays.\n  All funds provided in this bill are discretionary spending. The bill \nis at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority and $24 \nmillion in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. The bill provides $39 \nmillion less budget authority and $3 million more outlays than was in \nthe President's budget request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      S. 1357, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 2004, SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                 (Fiscal year 2004, dollars in millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    General\n            Category                purpose     Mandatory       Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority...........        9,196   ...........        9,196\n    Outlays a/.................       10,273   ...........       10,273\nSenate 302(b) allocation\n    Budget authority...........        9,196   ...........        9,196\n    Outlays....................       10,297   ...........       10,297\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority...........       10,751   ...........       10,751\n    Outlays....................       10,059   ...........       10,059\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...........        9,235   ...........        9,235\n    Outlays....................       10,270   ...........       10,270\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........        9,196   ...........        9,196\n    Outlays....................       10,282   ...........       10,282\n \n                    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...........  ............  ...........  ............\n    Outlays....................

Mr. President, I pay tribute to our two floor managers \nof a very important bill that I intend to support when we have a chance \nto reach it, which I hope will be done in the not too distant future. I \ncommend our floor managers for the work they have done in bringing this \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  There were two issues I had hoped we would have an opportunity to \npresent to the Senate. One was an increase in the minimum wage. Another \nwas working with the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, on the hate crimes \nissue. We are hopeful to be able to address those during consideration \nof this legislation without taking a great deal of time.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment on the legislation now and was \nquite prepared to move ahead with a reasonable time period, up to an \nhour of time evenly divided. Then we could make a judgment with regard \nto hate crimes to enter into a similar kind of time agreement so that \nwe would not delay the underlying legislation. But the problem we have \nis the leadership has decided we would defer action on the amendment \nuntil some future time. I regret that, but I understand it. It is the \nprerogative of the leadership. We will at that time have a chance to \nagain raise this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator starts his statement, I wondered if the \nSenator would acknowledge that after the vote on the military \nconstruction appropriations bill, automatically recurring in the Senate \nis the bill that we have been working on for 1 day--1 day--the State \nDepartment authorization. The Senator understands that bill has not \npassed since 1985, principally because of being held up by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms. Does the Senator \nacknowledge that and also acknowledge the fact that we only had a few \namendments left, one of which was the minimum wage, and we could have \ncompleted this bill in a couple of days? Will the Senator also \nacknowledge because of his offering a minimum wage amendment, they \nsimply took the bill down, and we are not now able to offer the \namendments? Will the Senator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Nevada is quite correct. As our deputy \nleader, he has an understanding of the amendments on our side. He has \ncorrectly stated the position; that is, speaking for this side of the \naisle, we are prepared to move to final passage of the legislation, but \nthere are a few amendments, one of which is the minimum wage which, \nunder a short time limit, can be disposed of quite rapidly. But quite \nfrankly, we have only had 1 day of debate on the State Department \nauthorization, and we haven't had an opportunity to raise this issue \nfor 7 years.\n  I know there are those who say, let's let this issue be deferred. It \nhas been 7 long years since we have had an increase in the minimum \nwage. So those individuals who are at the lowest end of the economic \nladder, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, have been losing \npurchasing power day in and day out. We have not increased the minimum \nwage in 7 years.\n  With all due respect to other Members of this body, it is Friday at \n11 o'clock. We are prepared to debate the issue and have a vote on it. \nPeople are entitled to have an indication of what the membership wants \nto do.\n  We take this issue very seriously because of the desperate situation \naffecting those on the lower end of the economic ladder. Quite frankly, \nhistorically this has not been a Democratic issue. It has been a \nbipartisan issue.\n  The long history of increases in the minimum wage has been basically \nbipartisan. It was enacted by Franklin Roosevelt in 1938; increased by \nHarry Truman; increased by Dwight Eisenhower in 1955 by $1; increased \nby President John Kennedy in 1961 by $2.35; increased by Lyndon \nJohnson; increased by a Republican, Gerry Ford; increased by Jim \nCarter; increased by George Bush No. 1; increased by Bill Clinton.\n  Republicans and Democrats have voted for an increase in the minimum \nwage since 1938. It has not been a partisan issue. We find in recent \ntimes that our Republican friends have been unwilling to both support \nit and give us the opportunity to debate the issue.\n  This chart shows the long history of increases in the minimum wage as \nwell as the amounts. Even with those kinds of increases, if you look at \nthe purchasing power of the minimum wage, as this chart indicates, it \nis now at perhaps its lowest level of purchasing power, $4.95. There \nwas one other time when it was $4.35. It is $4.95 and continuing to \ndrop, and it will reach the lowest level in terms of purchasing power \nsince even before 1962, unless we take action.\n  With this amendment it would increase, in terms of purchasing power, \nto $6.40, which is well below what the minimum wage has been over the \nperiod of the last 40 years. So this is a very modest program. It would \nincrease to $6.65 in today's dollars.\n  I want to share with the Senate what the minimum wage is in relation \nto the issues of poverty in the United States. Look at this chart. Here \nis the poverty level. Just $14,500 is the poverty level. The blue \nindicator is what has happened to the minimum wage in relation to \npoverty.\n  Most Americans believe that if people are going to work hard 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks of the year, they should not live in poverty. They \nshould not live in poverty. In the wealthiest, most successful economy \nin the world, this is what is happening. We find that the minimum wage \nworkers are well below the poverty level.\n  As a result, every day that we delay we see minimum wage workers \nfalling further behind. All of the gains since the 1997 increase in the \nminimum wage already have been lost.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about an increase of $1.50, \n75 cents this year, 75 cents next year. What does that amount to? That \namounts to $3,000 over the course of a year. Translated, it means 15 \nmonths of groceries, 8 months of rent, 7 months of utilities, and the \nfull tuition for a child of the minimum wage worker. This is what we \nare talking about. We are talking about groceries; we are talking\n\n[[Page S9284]]\n\nabout rent; we are talking about utilities; we are talking about \neducation at this time.\n  We have had a good deal of debate in terms of the tax cuts and what \nthat will do for the wealthiest individuals. This is the kind of \ndifference that this will make over the period of 1 year.\n  Let me just put this in some perspective about what the increase in \nthe minimum wage will mean in terms of the total combined income for \nworkers over the course of the year because you will hear the argument: \nCan we do this now because of the issues of inflation? I would like to \nanticipate that argument. And then: Can we afford to do it in \nanticipation of the problems of high unemployment?\n  First on the issue of an increase of $1.50 to workers, it is vital to \nminimum wage workers; it is a drop in the bucket in the national \npayroll. All Americans combined earn $5. 4 trillion a year. At a $1.50 \nminimum wage increase this will be less than one-fifth of 1 percent of \nthe national payroll. The idea that we are contributing to inflation \njust does not carry.\n  I will take a moment of the Senate's time to look over what has \nhappened, the increase in the minimum wage as to the issues of \nemployment and unemployment. An argument will be made: Look the \nDemocrats make a good deal about the unemployment that we are facing \ntoday. If we pass this increase in the minimum wage, are we going to \nincrease unemployment? All you have to do is look at the various \nstudies which I will speak to later in the presentation. But I would \nlike to just look back over the history of the last increase in the \nminimum wage. If you look at 1996, the minimum wage was increased to \n$4.75. In 1996, we had unemployment just above 5.3 percent. So the \nincrease in the minimum wage was going up during this time while the \nunemployment was coming down.\n  Then the second phase of the increase to the minimum wage which we \npassed was September 1997. That raised it from $4.75 to $5.15. The \nchart shows unemployment continuing to decline. Study after study \nindicates that this it virtually has no effect or impact on the \nunemployment rate.\n  Let me just say, the issue in the increase of the minimum wage is a \nwomen's issue because the great majority of the people who receive the \nminimum wage are women. This increase in the minimum wage is a \nchildren's issue because a many of the women who are receiving the \nminimum wage have children. And it is about their quality of life and \nthat of their families. It is a civil rights issue because forty \npercent of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are men and \nwomen of color.\n  Finally, this increase in the minimum wage is a fairness issue. \nAmericans understand fairness. They understand if you are going to work \nhard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the the year, you should not live in \npoverty.\n  That is the case. This is a no brainer. We do not have to spend a lot \nof time in debate. We voted on this. It is as old an issue as 1938. We \ncan vote on this. It is a simple issue of whether this institution \nbelieves in fairness and decency for some of the hardest working men \nand women in our country. And it is about time that we do it.\n  From our point of view as the proponents, we are prepared to vote at \nany time that the other side will give us the opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for continuing to \nraise this issue, sadly, for 7 years. Unfortunately, we have not done \nour part to raise the minimum wage, but I would go to the point that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts raised.\n  Last week I went to a summer feeding program for children who \nordinarily get school lunches. These are struggling families in my city \nof Chicago. I sat down at a table with a young African American girl, \nsecond grader, named Sharya, and I said to her: ``What did you have for \ndinner last night?'' She said: ``Well, my mom was working late and she \ngot home after I went to sleep. I had a bowl of cereal for dinner.''\n  The point I am making to the Senator, and I ask him if he would \nreturn and tell us the impact, here is a young girl being raised by a \nmother who is probably working two jobs because we will not increase \nthe minimum wage. The point being made by the Senator from \nMassachusetts is, we are not talking about welfare recipients; we are \ntalking about working people who get up and go to work every day to \nsometimes two jobs. Sometimes they are invisible to our lives. These \nare the people who are washing the dishes in the kitchens, busing the \ntables, and cleaning our rooms.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is this not first and foremost \na family issue in terms of dignity for working families and people who \nare trying to keep their kids well fed and clothed and keep them \ntogether? I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, how in this great \nnation, when we are giving away trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the \nweathiest people in this country, can we not afford 50 cents or a \ndollar an hour for people who are struggling to try to keep their \nfamilies together?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has put his finger on one of the key factors \nand legitimate reasons for the increase in the minimum wage, because \nthis is a family issue--the number of minimum wage workers working two \njobs, some even three jobs, the testimony that we have had where the \nonly times that young parents see their children together may be for a \nfew hours on a Sunday morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time in morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me continue, if I may. So this is a family issue. It \nis about, as the Senator knows, the numbers of mothers and fathers who \nhave to look into the eyes of their children and say, ``No, you can't \nget a little birthday present,'' or, ``No, you can't go to the skating \nparty where all the other children are going.'' ``No, you can't do this \nbecause we haven't got the resources.'' That is happening every day. \nThese are hard-working men and women. It is the family issue.\n  As the Senator has mentioned, who are these minimum wage workers? \nThese minimum wage workers are teacher's aides.\n  We say we care about education. We know the challenges we are facing \non education. We know the particular stress that is taking place in the \nStates on education. These workers are teacher's aides. We say we care \nabout our senior citizens, men and women who have sacrificed. They \nought to have their golden years in peace and dignity. These are \nworkers in nursing homes. They are the recipients. They are taking care \nof the parents and the grandparents in this country.\n  These are the men and women who clean the great facilities where the \nAmerican enterprise continues to grow and strive throughout this \ncountry. As the Senator points out, these are hard-working men and \nwomen. This is a family issue. These are decent, hard-working fellow \nAmericans, and they have seen their purchasing power fall and fall.\n  If my colleagues look over at this chart, it indicates where the \ndisparity has been going in the United States over the past years. As \nwe all know, the wealthy are getting wealthier and the hard-working \nAmericans who are at the lower rung of the economic ladder are falling \nfurther behind.\n  We know we have the earned-income tax credit that assists families \nwith children, and that is important. But if one is talking about a \nsingle parent with a single child, the minimum wage makes all the \ndifference in the world.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator one other question. Is it not part \nof an interesting pattern that when we talk about the economy, jobs, \nand growth, we talk about tax breaks primarily for wealthy people, but \nwhen we talk about struggling working families, we cannot seem to find \nan increase in the minimum wage, we cannot find a child tax credit for \npeople in lower income categories? Why is it that this administration, \nthis Government, turns a blind eye to the people who are struggling \nwith the lower income jobs, the middle-income jobs, really the backbone \nof America's economy, people who need the help the most? Does not this \nminimum wage issue tell us the same story?\n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\n  There is absolutely no recognition or sensitivity by this \nadministration and the White House to these people. Here we stand, 2\\1/\n2\\ years into this administration, and I ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, has President Bush suggested at any point in those 2\\1/\n2\\ years any increase in the minimum wage to help people who are \nstruggling to survive in this tough economy?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. There has been no mention \nof this by this administration. We have had other administrations that \nat least advocated some increase, and eventually we were able to work \nout an accommodation over a period of time. This administration, as the \nSenator has pointed out, has not only not mentioned the increase in the \nminimum wage and not only has resisted the tax credit for children but \nalso put in new rules and regulations on the earned-income tax credit \nthat are going to make it more difficult for the same individuals at \nthe bottom end of the economic ladder who have children, who are \nworking hard, playing by the rules, to be able to participate in this \nprogram.\n  The Senator is quite correct that the neediest Americans, the ones \nwho are working trying to make a living for themselves, trying to bring \nup children, facing the most serious economic challenges of our time, \nare basically shunted aside and ignored by this administration.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for four questions?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. No. 1, the Senator has mentioned, and I want to ask if the \nSenator will emphasize this, that the minimum wage is a program in \nwhich 40 percent of the people who draw minimum wage are women; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sixty-three percent of those who receive the minimum \nwage are women.\n  Mr. REID. It is 20 percent more than my statistics indicate, and I am \nsure the Senator is right. For the majority of those women, that is the \nmajority of the money they get for themselves and their family. Do they \ndepend on that totally, is what I am trying to ask.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. More often than not, they not \nonly work at one minimum-wage job, they work probably at two. So they \nare working not only 40 hours a week but more often 80 hours a week.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, also, is it not true \nthat we, the Democrats, have tried for 7 years to get an increase in \nthe minimum wage? Is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. We have not been able to get a \nvote on this issue of an increase in the minimum wage over that period \nof time. I must say if it had not been for the persistence of our \nDemocratic leaders, Senator Reid and Senator Daschle, we would not have \ngotten a vote on it this time. If it had been up to the other side, \nthey would have said, no, we only want the relevant amendments and we \ncan wait for consideration of an increase in the minimum wage. These \nworkers cannot wait. They do not need to wait.\n  During this period of time, we have found the opportunity to raise \nour own salaries on five different occasions. We have not found the \ntime to raise the minimum wage, but we have raised the Senate salaries \non five different occasions.\n  I think that is something the American people can understand as well. \nWe are doing something for these Members--and I do not begrudge it, and \nI voted for those increases--but the fact is we should not leave these \npeople behind.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also acknowledge that even during the \nyears President Clinton was President, which includes part of the 7 \nyears, we were stopped by the Republicans through procedural measures \nfrom having an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage? Is that a fair \nstatement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator probably remembers, we had to file \ncloture on this in order to try to get a vote, and during that period \nof time we were able always to get a majority of the Senate, some \nRepublicans and Democrats, but we were blocked because we could not get \nthe 60 votes. We were required to get the 60 votes for the \nconsideration, and we were denied that opportunity.\n  The Senator remembers very well, as I do, that we were effectively \nblocked from taking action on the minimum wage.\n  Mr. REID. The final question I ask my friend from Massachusetts: The \nminimum wage, I am confident the Senator would acknowledge, is not some \nwild-eyed idea that someone came up with in the last 5 or 10 years. It \nis true, is it not, that the minimum wage legislation was initiated \nduring the Great Depression? We have had a minimum wage, and it has \nbeen increased, for approximately 70 years. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. Absolutely correct.\n  Mr. REID. So for approximately a tenth of that time, we have been \nblocked from giving these hard-working men and women, who are not \ndrawing welfare, they are not out being bums and in gangs, they are \npeople of all ages who want to work for a living and are doing the best \nthey can, they are working at minimum wage, and what we want to do, and \nwe are prevented from doing because of the majority, is simply have a \nvote to allow these people to have a raise in their minimum wage, their \nbasic wage that these people depend on to make it through life.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator has made the compelling case on this. \nWe have heard these arguments against it, that it adds to inflation, \nadds to unemployment, that it works to the disadvantage of minority \nyouth. We had that argument. We can show the statistics that that is \nnot true.\n  They say, well, what we really need is not an increase in minimum \nwage but we need an increase in the training wage. We have said, fine, \nwe will add an increase in the training wage. We are prepared to meet \nany legitimate argument, but we do believe that people who have been \nworking, and working hard and playing by the rules and have waited 7 \nyears and have seen the reduction in terms of the purchasing power, are \nentitled to at least an accounting in the Senate. That is what we want \nto find out.\n  This is not an issue that takes a great deal more discussion and \ndebate. Members knew about the minimum wage before they were elected to \nthe Senate. It is an old issue, older than most of us in this Chamber. \nPeople are familiar with it. They have heard the arguments. It is not a \nnew issue, but it is an issue of fairness and decency. It is an issue \nthat should be acted on.\n  To reiterate, millions of minimum wage workers are suffering because \nof the continuing weak economy. For years, they have not had any wage \nincrease at all, because Congress continues to refuse to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  Even in this troubled economy, Congress has not hesitated to raise \nits own pay. It is only fair that we raise the minimum wage, too.\n  That is why I am proposing this amendment to enact a long-overdue \nincrease in the minimum wage. My amendment will raise the current \nminimum wage of $5.15 an hour by 75 cents this year and another 75 \ncents next year, bringing it up to $6.65 an hour.\n  We know that poverty has doubled among full-time, year-round workers \nsince the late 1970s. Nearly 33 million people live in poverty today in \nthis country, and an unfairly low minimum wage is a large part of the \nproblem.\n  Congress has not acted to raise the minimum wage in 7 years. Minimum \nwage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn only \n$10,700 a year. That's $4,500 below the poverty line today for a family \nof three.\n  The current minimum wage fails to provide enough income for minimum \nwage workers to afford adequate housing in any area of this country. A \nworker earning the minimum wage in Georgia or Illinois, or many other \nareas of the country, would have to work more than 100 hours a week to \nafford a two-bedroom apartment.\n  Every day the minimum wage is not increased, it continues to lose \nvalue, and workers fall farther and farther behind. Minimum wage \nworkers have lost all of their gains since we last raised the minimum \nwage in 1997. Today, the real value of the minimum wage is $3.00 below \nwhat it was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the \nminimum wage would have to be more than $8 an hour today, not $5.15.\n  It is shameful that Members of Congress have raised their own pay by \n$21,000 in the last 7 years--almost twice what a minimum wage workers \nmakes\n\n[[Page S9286]]\n\nin a year--without giving the Nation's lowest paid workers any increase \nat all.\n  Nearly 7 million workers would directly benefit from the proposed \nminimum wage increase, and many of them are parents and the sole \nbreadwinners in their families.\n  The minimum wage is an economic issue, but it is also a woman's \nissue. Sixty-three percent of the workers who would benefit from \nminimum wage increase are women and one-third of those women are \nmothers.\n  The minimum wage is also a civil rights issue. An increase in the \nminimum wage boosts the wage levels of people of color--who are often \nsegregated into low-paying jobs. Millions of African American and \nHispanic workers will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a family issue, too. It is so low that \nmany workers must work long hours to make ends meet. The increase in \nwork hours has a damaging impact on every aspect of life: on families, \non personal time, and on employers. At least one in five workers has a \nwork week that exceeds 50 hours.\n  According to the Families and Work Institute, three out of the top \nfour things that children would most like to change about their working \nparents are these: They wish their parents were less stressed out by \nwork; they wish they were less tired because of their work; and they \nwish they could spend more time with them.\n  Employers as well pay a high price for overworked employees. \nProductivity suffers, and so does turnover. Overworked employees are \nmore susceptible to illness. They need more sick days, and they are \nless productive on the job.\n  Raising the minimum wage obviously will not solve all these problems. \nBut a higher minimum wage may mean that employees can work a little \nless, and have a few more hours a week of family time and personal \ntime.\n  Minimum wage earners are forced to make impossible choices--between \npaying the rent and buying groceries or between paying the heating bill \nand buying new clothes.\n  It has been too long since Congress last acted. History clearly shows \nthat raising the minimum wage has not had a negative impact on jobs, \nemployment, or inflation. In the four years after the last minimum wage \nincrease, the economy had its strongest growth in three decades. Nearly \n11 million new jobs were added, at a rate of more than 200,000 per \nmonth.\n  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. How can Congress \nkeep saying no, when more and more workers cannot make ends meet? Can't \nwe all at least agree on this basic principle--that no one who works \nfor a living should have to live in poverty?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9286-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9286-S9288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask the Senator, on the other issue he raised, to put a \nbipartisan cast to the conversation, is it not true that the Senator \nand I are the cosponsors----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have 30 more seconds on this. I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague, Senator Smith, who \nhopefully will address another issue of hate crimes legislation, for \nwhich we have had support and we are also very hopeful of getting a \nvote on as well.\n  I see my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, and \nmy friend and colleague from Louisiana, as well. I understand my time \non morning business has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will not be long. I was mindful Senator Kennedy was \nspeaking to the issue of hate crimes. I was going to ask him the \nquestion that I think he would agree with. We acknowledge at a surface \nlevel the argument could be made that hate crimes do not belong on a \nState Department authorization bill. That is the case at a surface \nlevel, but it is also true that our foreign policy should reflect the \nvalues of the American people. The values of the American people say \nthe war on terrorism is waged not just abroad but here at home.\n  Our country is plagued with hate crimes. Some people will say all \ncrimes are hateful, but what Senator Kennedy and I are focusing on are \nthose crimes which target a community of vulnerable people--whether \nrace, religion, gender, disabled, and additionally those whose sexual \norientation is different from the majority.\n  It is an incredible tragedy that the Federal Government has not been \nallowed to participate in the hate crimes prosecution in places where \nsometimes local police departments are overwhelmed by national media, \nor places where the prosecutions do not occur as they ought to.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are proposing as part of this bill we take up \nthe issue of hate crimes. This institution has passed this issue before \nby large majorities. We ought to do so again.\n  Many in this country have strong feelings on the issue of gay and \nlesbian rights--some for, some against--but it is my position that we \nall ought to be opposed to hate crimes and be prepared to do something \nabout it. I will never forget the enormous tragedy of the murder of \nMatthew Shepherd and the impact that had on me when I considered the \nFederal Government was not permitted to help the Laramie police \ndepartment that was overwhelmed by national media; the Federal \nGovernment had to be silent because we had no statutory authority--not \nto take over State or local effort--to help them in this effort. As a \nmoral principle the Federal Government ought to show up in the \nprosecution and pursuit of those who commit hate crimes. These are \nhappening far too often.\n  Sometimes those on my side will say: This is not consistent with a \nfamily value. There is nothing about hate crimes that represents a \nlegitimate family value. Some of the things that are held up as family \nvalues are phony values. Marriage is one of those that is a very real \nfamily value. We ought to have a debate on that, too. But when it comes \nto hate crimes, public protection for all of our citizens, we need to \nact.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have both said to the managers of this bill we \nwould rather not bring it up on this bill. It is a fact this \nauthorization is probably one of the few that will make it through in \nthe balance of this session of Congress. We do not think this should \nwait any longer. We think terrorism abroad, our foreign policy opposing \nterrorism, ought to be reflected by the values of the American people \nwho oppose terrorism at home. Hate crimes are a very real form of \nterrorism. We ought to do something about it. The Federal Government \nought to show up to work and we ought to come together around a real \nfamily value which is the opposition to hate crimes.\n  I have said before, if you want to talk to me about sin, come with me \nto church. If you want to talk with me about public policy for all of \nus sinners, let's go to the Senate and make sure we provide protection \nfor all of America's children. Hate crimes is the vehicle.\n  The majority leader is working with Senator Kennedy and I to get us \nthe opportunity before the August recess to have a period of debate--it \nneed not be long--and a straight up-or-down vote so we can get this \nmoving in the process, consistent with America's values abroad so we \nare consistent at home fighting terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Oregon who has \nbeen steadfast in his support on the hate crimes legislation and has \nreally provided extraordinary leadership both in the Senate and \nnationally in helping us to get to the point where we will have a real \nopportunity to take action. His involvement and work has been \nenormously important and added a very significant dimension to the \nmovement of the legislation.\n  Senator Smith has just stated very eloquently the fundamental reasons \nfor this legislation and has also talked about why this is related to \nthe current measure before the Senate, the State Department \nauthorization.\n  The challenge we are facing around the world in terms of terrorism \nand violence is rooted in hatred and bigotry.\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\nThe same kind of hatred and bigotry are rooted in these crimes of hate. \nYou do not go very far between potential terrorists and potential \nperpetrators of hate crimes. They are brothers and sisters--maybe in \ndifferent locations physically, but they are very much against \neverything this Nation stands for and believes in.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, hate crimes are so particularly \nobjectionable and heinous because they focus on a particular class of \npeople. The reason and the motivation for that is bigotry and hate. The \nidea that the Federal Government is not putting the full force of its \nsupport in rooting out and assaulting these crimes has been a great \nfailure.\n  The good Senator from Oregon and I believe very deeply that we as a \nsociety and as a nation ought to be using the full resources of the \nFederal Government to attack heinous crimes.\n  Briefly, this chart shows the FBI hate crime statistics, showing the \never-increasing total incidence of hate crimes taking place in the \nUnited States. My next chart demonstrates the FBI hate crimes based on \nsexual orientation, showing the dramatic escalation and increase in \nhate crimes based on sexual orientation. The terrible tragedy of Mr. \nShepherd in Wyoming still resonates in the minds of all Americans, as \nwell as the other hate crimes that have taken place in our Nation.\n  We have seen since September 11 the dramatic increase in hate crimes \nagainst Muslims; hate crimes against American Arabs have escalated \ndramatically.\n  We believe, not unlike the outcome we saw when we brought to bear the \nfull resources of the Federal Government in fighting the church \nburnings primarily in the South 8 to 10 years ago, once we pass \nlegislation in the House and in the Senate to bring the FBI into these \ninvestigations, they virtually halt. People in these local communities \nwho were involved in these church burnings knew this country was \nserious about church burnings. That had a dramatic impact.\n  Senator Smith and I believe we should bring the full resources of the \nFederal Government to focus on these hate crimes--whether it is on the \nbasis of sexual orientation, gender, religiously motivated, anti-\nSemitic, the whole range of different activities resulting in hatred \nagainst groups in our society.\n  Even Attorney General Ashcroft has said criminal acts of hate run \ncounter to what is best in America, our belief in the quality of \nfreedom.\n  This is not a Democratic issue; it is not a Republican issue; it is \nan American issue. I am very hopeful we can get an opportunity to take \naction. I think it is completely consistent with the overall \nobjectives, in the highest form and sense, of the State Department \nauthorization and is something that needs to be done.\n  I again thank my friend from Oregon for all of good work and \nleadership.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Senator Kennedy has heard opponents of this legislation \nsuggest all crime is hateful and this is unnecessary. But isn't it a \nfact that for 30 years America has had a hate crimes law, most States \nhave hate crime laws? These have been vetted constitutionally, and even \nWilliam Rehnquist, the Chief Justice, one of the great conservatives \nwho ever served on the Court, was the author of the opinion that said \nhate crime laws are constitutional because crime always consists of \nelements, and hatred is one of the motives of determining whether this \nfits in the category of a hate crime. Aren't they constitutional? And \nisn't it a great moral principle for America to say, in terms of new \ncategories of Americans who are demonstrably more vulnerable, that they \nshould now be included in these very old statutes of the United States?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct in reminding the Senate \nabout the holding of the Supreme Court, the holding 6 to 3, a very \npowerful statement by the Supreme Court in terms of the support for \nthis legislation.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, we have had hate crimes but we have \nhad limitations and restrictions, particularly with regard to Federal \nhate crimes, which has limited the ability of the Federal Government to \ninvolve itself unless the actual hate crime occurred on Federal \nproperty. Therefore, the Federal Government has been unable, really, to \nbecome involved the way it should.\n  But, on the broader point about aren't all crimes basically hate \ncrimes, the Senator has stated very clearly that every crime is tragic \nand harmful in its consequences but not all crime is based on hate. \nHate crimes are based on bigotry and prejudice, and hate crimes occur \nwhen a perpetrator selects a victim because of who the victim is. Like \nacts of terrorism, the hate crimes have an impact far greater than the \nimpact on individuals and their families. They are crimes against \nentire communities, the entire Nation, against the fundamental ideals \nof liberty and justice for all, on which this country was founded.\n  That is why it is so important we take action.\n  Mr. President, although there was a significant overall reduction in \nviolent crimes during the 1990's, the number of hate crimes continued \nto grow. As this chart shows, according to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, 9,730 hate crimes were reported in the United States in \n2001. That's over 26 hate crimes a day, every day.\n  More than 83,000 hate crimes have been reported since 1991. According \nto the F.B.I., even though overall crime increased by only 2.1 percent \nfrom 2000 to 2001, the number of reported hate crimes increased \ndramatically--by more than 20 percent.\n  Sadly, these F.B.I. statistics only show part of the problem. A \nrecent Justice Department report confirmed that many hate crimes go \nunreported. Another report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a \nnonprofit organization that monitors hate groups and extremist \nactivity, estimated that the real number of hate crimes committed in \nthe United States each year is closer to 50,000.\n  Hate crimes based on sexual orientation continue to be a serious \ndanger, constituting 14 percent of all hate crimes reported. As you can \nsee on this next chart, hate crimes based on sexual orientation are \nincreasing at an alarming rate. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation \nincreased by 7.2 percent from 2000 to 2001, with nearly 1,400 reported \nfor the year.\n  Each person's life is valuable, and even one life lost is too many. \nIt is not the frequency of hate crimes alone that makes these acts of \nviolence so serious. It is the terror and intimidation they inflict on \nthe victims, their families, their communities, and, in some cases, the \nentire nation.\n  The need for an effective national response to the problem of hate \ncrimes is as compelling as it has ever been. As is clearly demonstrated \nin this chart, hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose dramatically \nin 2001, after the terrorist attacks of September 11th. These hate \ncrimes included murder, beatings, arson, attacks on mosques, shootings, \nand other assaults. In 2001, anti-Islamic incidents were the second \nhighest-reported type of hate crimes based on religion--second only to \nanti-Jewish hate crimes. Los Angeles and Chicago reported a massive \nincrease in the number of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim crimes after 9/11.\n  Over 550 hate crimes were committed against Muslims in 2001--that is \nfifteen times more than in 2000, and almost six times more than 1998, \n1999, and 2000 combined. Almost 900 hate crimes against Arab-Americans, \nor those perceived to be Arab-American, took place in 2001--eight times \nthe number in 2000.\n  The backlash following the September 11th attacks has been shameful. \nCongress cannot sit silent while this hatred spreads. It is long past \ntime for us to do more to end hate motivated-violence.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act will strengthen the ability \nof Federal, State, and local governments to investigate and prosecute \nthese vicious and senseless crimes. Our legislation is supported by \nover 175 law enforcement, civil rights, civic, and religious \norganizations.\n  The current Federal law on hate crimes was passed soon after the \nassassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, however, it is as \ngeneration out of date. It has two significant deficiencies. It does \nnot cover hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\ndisability. And even in cases of hate crimes based on race, religion, \nor ethnic background, it contains excessive restrictions requiring \nproof that the victims were attacked because they were engaged in \ncertain ``federally protected activities.''\n\n  This ``federally protected activity'' requirement is outdated, \nunwise, and unnecessary. There is no reason why the Justice Department \nshould have to prove that someone was engaging in a ``federally \nprotected activity'' before a case can be brought. This requirement \nseverely limits the ability of the Justice Department to respond to \nhate crimes against Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and other religious \ngroups. And it hamstrings the Department in its effort to respond to \nhate crimes motivated by the victim's race or ethnic background.\n  Our bill is designed to close these substantial loopholes. It has six \nprincipal provisions:\n  No. 1, it removes the federally protected activity'' barrier.\n  No. 2, it adds sexual orientation, gender and disability to the \nexisting categories of race, color, religion, and national origin.\n  No. 3, it protects State interests with a strict certification \nprocedure that requires the Federal Government to consult with local \nofficials before bringing a Federal case.\n  No. 4, it offers Federal assistance to State and local law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute hate crimes in any \nof the Federal categories.\n  No. 5, it offers training grants for local law enforcement.\n  No. 6, it amends the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act to add gender \nto the existing categories of race, religion, ethnic background, sexual \norientation, and disability.\n  These much needed changes in current law will help ensure that the \nDepartment of Justice has what it needs to combat the growing problem \nof hate-motivated violence more effectively.\n  Nothing in the bill protects or punishes speech, expression, or \nassociation in any way--even ``hate speech.'' It addresses only violent \nactions that result in death or injury. The Supreme Court has ruled \nrepeatedly--and as recently as this year, in the cross-burning decision \nVirginia v. Black--that a hate crimes statute that considers bias \nmotivation directly connected to a defendant's criminal conduct does \nnot violate the First Amendment. No one has a First Amendment right to \ncommit a crime.\n  A strong Federal role in prosecuting hate crimes is essential, \nbecause crimes have an impact far greater than their impact on \nindividual victims. Nevertheless, our bill fully respects the primary \nrole of State and local law enforcement in responding to violent crime. \nThe vast majority of hate crimes will continue to be prosecuted at the \nState and local level. The bill authorizes the Justice Department to \nassist State and local authorities in hate crimes cases, but it \nauthorizes Federal prosecutions only when a State does not have \njurisdiction, or when it asks the Federal Government to take \njurisdiction, or when it fails to act against hate-motivated violence. \nIn other words, the bill establishes an appropriate back-up for State \nand local law enforcement, to deal with hate crimes where states \nrequest assistance, or cases that would not otherwise be effectively \ninvestigated and prosecuted.\n  Working cooperatively, State, local and Federal law enforcement \nofficials have the best chance to bring the perpetrators of hate crimes \nto justice. Federal resources and expertise in the identification and \nproof of hate crimes can provide invaluable assistance to State and \nlocal authorities without undermining the traditional rule of States in \nprosecuting crimes. As Attorney General Ashcroft has said of current \nlaw, ``Cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement \nofficers and between Justice Department prosecutors and local \nprosecutors has been outstanding.'' And it will continue to be so, and \nbe even more effective, when this legislation is enacted into law.\n  Now is the time for Congress to speak with one voice and insist that \nall Americans will be guaranteed the equal protection of the laws. Now \nis the time to make combating hate crimes a high national priority. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a needed response to a serious \nproblem that continues to plague the nation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9288-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9288-S9290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Kennedy on the \nstatement he made regarding the minimum wage. I wanted to engage in a \ncolloquy about that, but I was called off the floor on other matters.\n  I think Senator Kennedy has made it quite clear that, rather than \nthis being one of the throwaway issues that maybe we will address as we \ngo through the year, increasing the minimum wage for the people of this \ncountry ought to be No. 1 on our agenda. We ought to be doing this \nright now.\n  We had the medical malpractice bill up earlier this week. We spent a \ncouple of days on it. Everyone knew it was not going to go anywhere. \nEven by their own admission, some Republicans, in the newspapers at \nleast, said it was a political exercise--according to some, in the \nnewspapers. Whether it was or not, everyone knew it wasn't going to go \nanywhere. Yet here so many Americans are making the minimum wage which, \nI am sure was pointed out, is now less than the poverty level. It is \nabout $4,000-some less--I think $4,500 below the poverty level for a \nfamily of three.\n  It is unconscionable that over the last 7 years, the Congress--the \nSenate and the House together--has raised its own salaries, our \nsalaries, by $21,000 a year. We have done that in the last 7 years. Yet \na minimum wage in this country today is $10,500 a year, less than half \nof what we just increased our own salaries by over the last 7 years. \nThat is what is unconscionable.\n  These are working people; they are not on welfare. They are working. \nThey are getting the minimum wage. Yet they are earning less than \npoverty level in this country. If nothing else, at least the minimum \nwage ought to get you above the poverty level. That is what we ought to \nbe about.\n  So I compliment Senator Kennedy for bringing this to the floor. I \nhope we can have this amendment on a bill here very soon, so we can \nexpress ourselves in a realistic way.\n  Another myth on the minimum wage I hear all the time is that so many \nof the people making minimum wage are just part-time earners; they are \nyoung kids just starting out, on and on. I hear that all the time.\n  The fact is that 70 percent of those affected by the minimum wage are \nadults, working adults; 35 percent--one out of three--are their \nfamily's sole earner. As Senator Kennedy pointed out, almost two-thirds \nof the time these are women. These are single mothers; they are \nworking; they are making the minimum wage; and they are the sole \nsupporter of their family. So these are not just young kids getting a \nminimum-wage job to supplement the family income. As I said, more than \n60 percent are women, one-third are mothers of children.\n  So I thank Senator Kennedy for bringing this issue to our attention. \nI just find it unexplainable. How do you explain to people of this \ncountry we took all this time this year, we had this big tax break for \nthe most wealthy in our country, yet we cannot even take a half a day, \n2 hours to debate and pass an increase in the minimum wage?\n  President Bush has spent a lot of time talking about tax breaks, \ngetting his tax break bill through--which helps mostly the most wealthy \nin this country, yet not one peep from this President in almost 3 years \nabout increasing the minimum wage, not even one peep from this \nPresident on it.\n\n  So I am hopeful sometime before we break in August we can bring this \nup and pass it and get it to the President's desk. I know that is \nprobably wishful thinking but hope springs eternal. I think that is \nwhat we ought to be doing here in the month of July.\n  One other thing: I said earlier we had the medical malpractice bill \nup. Really, what we ought to be talking about is the economic \nmalpractice of this administration. That is what I call it--President \nBush's economic malpractice. The victims of this malpractice are \nworking Americans.\n  I just talked about the minimum wage and the need to increase that.\n\n[[Page S9289]]\n\nLook at the unemployment rate. It is now 6.4 percent, the highest level \nsince April of 1994. That amounts to 9.4 million people looking for \nwork who cannot find any. Under President Bush's leadership, we have \nlost 3.1 million private sector jobs.\n  This week the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, offered an \namendment to extend emergency unemployment assistance to the 1.1 \nmillion long-term unemployed. These are people who have been laid off \nsince the recession began--early last year. They made futile searches \nfor jobs that were not there, and then, unfortunately, we lost the job \nassistance amendment Senator Murray offered.\n  We are still losing jobs every month; 33,000 last month.\n  The economy is limping along. Now we are going to have a $400 billion \ndeficit facing us this year.\n  I read in the paper this morning that we now have some estimates on \nwhat it is costing us in Iraq--$4 billion a month; $4 billion a month. \nI have to tell you, if history shows us anything, those figures are \nlowballed. If this administration--I say it about any administration--\ncomes up with figures this, you know they are lowballing it. I bet you \nwhen the facts are in and when all the costs are in, by the end of the \nyear when we look back at the cost of our being in Iraq, it will \napproach $5 billion a month. That is somewhere between $50 billion and \n$60 billion this year. That is not counting Afghanistan. Afghanistan is \ncosting us somewhere over $1 billion a month.\n  Again, I think that is lowballing it. I think it is probably a lot \nmore than this.\n  When you take Afghanistan and Iraq and put them together, you are \ntalking about somewhere in the neighborhood of between $60 billion and \n$75 billion this year on top of a $400 billion deficit.\n  What is the administration's response? Don't increase the minimum \nwage, pass record tax cuts for the wealthiest, and then they push \nthrough a sham Medicare prescription drug bill that is going to force \nseniors to pay more out of their pockets before they can get their \nprescription drugs.\n  Right now there is a rule being written and proposed by this \nadministration that will take money out of the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans. This has to do with the issue of overtime pay.\n  This spring, the Labor Department proposed a regulation that would \nexempt perhaps up to 8 million workers from overtime pay. Overtime pay \nmeans up to 25 percent of a worker's annual income. Who are we talking \nabout? We are talking about nurses, police officers, firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, retail managers, journalists, medical \ntherapists, paralegals, managers of fast food restaurants, among others \nwho will now be put in a different category. Just by a new regulation \nthey are going to be put into a new category so they will not be paid \novertime pay.\n  Last week, 43 Senators sent a letter to the Secretary of Labor asking \nthat the administration back off of this proposal. What does this \nproposal do? It expands the overtime exemptions by making it easier for \nemployers to reclassify hourly workers and make them salaried workers, \nand then dramatically lowering the bar on which salaried workers are \nexempt from overtime pay protection. The result is millions of \nAmericans earning--get this--more than $22,100 year--we are not talking \nabout people making $100,000 $200,000 a year. We are talking about \npeople making $22,100 a year and currently eligible for overtime who \nwill be denied overtime pay under the proposed changes. What it means \nis the end of the 40-hour workweek. It means workers will spend more \ntime away from their families because they will be forced to work \nlonger hours.\n  But guess what. They won't be compensated for it. At least now, if \nsomeone is spending over 40 hours a week working and they are away from \ntheir family, they get time and a half overtime and compensated, which \nmay help make up for a little bit of time they spend away from their \nfamilies. Now they will be working more than 40 hours away from their \nfamilies, and they will not be compensated for that.\n  It is not only bad economic policy, it won't create one new job. But \nit will also harm families by keeping the breadwinner away from their \nfamily for longer periods of time without giving them adequate \ncompensation.\n\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor estimates, the proposed \nrule changes would mean between 2.1 million and 3.3 million workers \nwould face unpredictable work schedules because of an increased demand \nfor extra hours for which the employers would not have to pay time and \nhalf. It just makes sense.\n  If you are an employer and the people working for you work over 40 \nhours, they are paid time and a half. You have to think about this. \nDoes that justify keeping them on at time and a half? However, if by a \nlittle stroke of the pen you can reclassify them from hourly wage \nearners to salaried wage earners, you can get them to work 45 hours a \nweek and not have to pay them one red cent more.\n  Again, with one stroke of a pen, I can get them to do more work and \nnot have to pay them one additional penny.\n  Why wouldn't you do that? Of course, you would do that.\n  This regulation will open the floodgates for employers to help their \nbottom line by getting more work out of employees without paying them \nany more money. That is why we passed the 40-hour workweek. We are \nactually turning the clock back.\n  Senator Kennedy pointed out this morning that we passed the minimum \nwage bill in 1938. By exempting these people from overtime pay we are \nturning the clock back even pre-1938 in terms of working conditions.\n  According to the GAO study, employees exempt from overtime pay--\nunderstand this--are twice as likely to work overtime as those covered \nby overtime pay. That is a GAO study. There you go. It makes sense. You \nare covered by overtime, and maybe you won't get that overtime. But if \nyou are not covered by overtime, why not work a few hours extra every \nweek because you are not being paid for your labor?\n  Yesterday, in the House of Representatives there was an amendment by \nCongressman Obey of Wisconsin that would block the administration's \nproposal to deny millions of Americans overtime pay. Sadly, that lost \nby three votes. I was watching the vote last night. I noticed that they \nheld the vote open. Actually, the proposal by Congressman Obey won. The \nvote was held open, and I saw some switches being made. Finally, they \ngot three people either to switch or something. So the vote, if I am \nnot mistaken, was 213 to 210.\n  The proposal to block the administration from making these changes \nfailed by three votes in the House.\n  I think one of the reasons it lost was there was a lot of \nmisinformation about what the amendment would do. I have an amendment \nthat is almost a mirror image of what Congressman Obey offered in the \nHouse. I will be offering it at the first opportunity we have to do so \non the Senate floor.\n  Basically, my amendment would prohibit the administration from \nexempting more workers from overtime pay who are currently eligible \nunder the law. That is it. It is very simple and very straightforward. \nI look forward to offering this amendment to protect the 40-hour \nworkweek, and to protect hard-working Americans who sometimes are \ncaught between whether they want to spend more time with their family \nor maybe work overtime. At least if they work overtime they get \ncompensated for it. This amendment would protect them and their \nfamilies.\n  The administration's proposal will not, as I said, create one \nadditional job. It will not do anything to put money back into the \npockets of working Americans.\n  Couple that with their intransigence on raising the minimum wage, and \nwhat you have is what I call ``President Bush's economic \nmalpractice''--economic malpractice on hard-working Americans.\n\n  We need a real job growth plan in this country. We need to increase \nthe minimum wage. We need to provide a real Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. We need to provide real incentives for businesses to create \nnew jobs--not these kinds of incentives that will not create additional \njobs but will allow employers to work employees longer than the 40-hour \nworkweek without giving them just compensation. It is bad policy. It is \neconomic malpractice.\n  I look forward to offering this amendment at the earliest possible \ntime so the Senate can speak on this\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\nissue, and hopefully we will have enough votes in the Senate so the \nadministration will back off this ill-timed and ill-advised proposal.\n  I would like to know who really came up with this idea that somehow \nwe are just going to, with the stroke of a pen, exempt people from \novertime pay who are now getting it; we are just going to reclassify \nthem. Well, I would like to know who that misguided ``genius'' was \nbehind that decision. And whoever it is ought to have no place in this \nLabor Department or in this administration or anywhere in government.\n  So I hope we can take this amendment up as soon as possible, and I \nhope the Senate will approve it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of debate in \nWashington, DC, about the circumstances leading up to the invasion of \nIraq earlier this year. No one has come to the defense of Saddam \nHussein, nor should they. He was a tyrant who oppressed his people. The \nfact that he is out of power is in the best interest of not only the \npeople in Iraq but in the Middle East and the world.\n  But leading up to our invasion of Iraq were a series of statements \nand events from the administration justifying our role and our \nleadership. They were hotly debated on the floor of the Senate last \nOctober, leading to a vote on the use of force resolution--a vote which \n23 of us opposed, believing that if we were going to be engaged in \nIraq, it should be on an international basis, using the United Nations \nand other countries to join us in a coalition that would not only lead \nto a successful military invasion but also to a successful peace \nafterward, stability in Iraq for years to come.\n  The prevailing view, the majority view in the House and the Senate, \nwas otherwise, giving the President the authority to go forward with \nthis military invasion of Iraq. And so, for the months that followed \nbetween October and the ultimate invasion, the administration came \nforward with additional evidence, additional statements, and additional \nrationalization for our role and our leadership.\n  One of the key moments in the development of this case against Iraq \nand support by the American people was President Bush's State of the \nUnion Address. It is a historic gathering each year, where a joint \nsession of Congress comes together in the House Chamber, joined by the \nPresident's Cabinet, the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps, and \nscores of people in the balconies, as the President comes and speaks \nfrom his heart to the American people. It is probably the most closely \nwatched and covered Presidential speech of any year, and should be, \nbecause the President really tries to outline where America is and \nwhere it is going.\n\n  So we listened carefully to each word. And many times during the \ncourse of that speech, President Bush made his case for the United \nStates invasion of Iraq. One of the statements he made during the \ncourse of that speech has taken on quite a bit of controversy. It was a \nstatement that the President made, attributing to British intelligence \nsources, which suggested that from the African country of Niger there \nwas a sale or shipment of uranium which could be used for nuclear \nweapons in Iraq. President Bush said those words in his State of the \nUnion Address. And, of course, this was growing evidence of our concern \nabout the increased militarization of Saddam Hussein and his threat not \nonly to his people and the region but to other nations as well.\n  This was one of many elements in the President's case against Iraq, \nbut it was an important one because there was the belief that if Saddam \nHussein had moved beyond chemical and biological weapons and now could \nthreaten the world with nuclear weapons, he had to be viewed in a \ndifferent context, as a much more dangerous leader than ever before. So \npeople listened carefully to President Bush's statement.\n  But then, after that State of the Union Address--within a matter of \ndays--questions were being raised as to the truthfulness of the \nPresident's statement, whether or not it was accurate to say that \nuranium or any type of nuclear fissile material had been sent from an \nAfrican nation to Iraq. The debate ensued for many months, even as the \ninvasion started.\n  Last night, CBS issued a special report based on statements coming \nout of the Central Intelligence Agency. Those statements are very \ntroubling. Those statements indicate that America's intelligence \nagencies came to the White House before the State of the Union Address \nand told the National Security Council there was no credible evidence \nlinking Niger or any African nation with providing nuclear fissile \nmaterials to Iraq, and despite that statement from the CIA to the \nNational Security Council, and to the White House, decisions were made \nin the White House for the President to go forward with his speech \nsaying exactly the opposite, carefully wording it so that it attributed \nthat information to British intelligence sources, carefully making \ncertain that the President did not allude to the fact that American \nintelligence sources thought that was not a credible statement.\n  So where do we stand today? The President said earlier this week that \nhe apologizes, that that was an unsubstantiated remark and it was not \naccurate. And now, with this release of information from our \nintelligence agencies, reporters, who are traveling with the President \nand his group in Africa, are asking the leaders of the White House who \nmade this decision, who decided to go forward with the statement in the \nPresident's State of the Union Address which was not accurate, which \nwas misleading.\n  Condoleezza Rice, the President's National Security Adviser, insists \nthat George Tenet of the CIA approved this information that was \nincluded in the President's speech. George Tenet, in a press report, \nsaid he did not, he was not involved in making that statement to the \nWhite House. Two of the highest officials in the Bush administration \nare at odds as to who was responsible for that information. That \nquestion has to be asked and answered, and it has to be done so \nimmediately.\n\n  I can think of nothing worse than someone at the highest level of \nleadership in the White House deliberately misleading the President or \ndeliberately misleading the American people about something as \nessential as whether or not nuclear materials were being sent into Iraq \nbefore our invasion.\n  What was at stake, of course, was not just another foreign policy \ndebate. What was at stake was an invasion of military force, largely \nled by the United States, putting American lives on the line.\n  The case was being made in that State of the Union Address for the \nAmerican people to rally behind the President, rally behind the troops, \nand invade Iraq. And now we know that one of the elements--one of the \ncentral elements--in that argument was, at best, misleading--that in \nfact we knew better. We knew, based on our own investigation, based on \na visit by former Ambassador Joe Wilson, based on the evidence of \nforged documents, that uranium and other fissile materials were not in \nfact transported from Niger to Iraq. Despite that, in the State of the \nUnion Address, exactly the opposite was said.\n  Yesterday, on the State Department authorization, I offered an \namendment, a bipartisan amendment, joined in by several of my \nDemocratic colleagues and many of my Republican colleagues, calling on \nthe inspectors general in the Department of State and the CIA to get to \nthe bottom of this, and do it immediately. I believe the American \npeople deserve an answer. We need to know what White House official \ndecided to distort the intelligence information and give the President \na statement which was in fact misleading.\n  I want to make it clear that there is no evidence whatsoever that the \nPresident knew this information was inaccurate. I do not make that \naccusation, nor will I. But someone knew. Someone in the White House \nknew the National Security Council had been briefed and told that this \ninformation was not accurate, and yet it was still included in the \nState of the Union Address. It really calls into question the \nleadership of the White House and our intelligence agencies. And I can \ntell you, now, more than ever, we need to have the best intelligence \nsources in the world.\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\n  You cannot successfully wage a war on terrorism without the very best \nmilitary intelligence, without the best information about those \nthreatening the United States. It has to be credible evidence. The \npeople in the intelligence agency have to have a sound working \nrelationship with the White House and the Congress. What we saw in the \nState of the Union Address was a breakdown of that relationship. That \ndoes not make America safer. It makes us more vulnerable.\n  Secondly, this is a Nation now pledged to a policy of preemption. We \nare prepared, according to this President, to invade a nation that may \nthreaten us, even if they do not apparently pose any imminent danger to \nus at the time. How do you reach the conclusion that a nation threatens \nus? Clearly from intelligence information. Clearly, the intelligence \ncoming out of the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National \nSecurity Agency, and others has to be delivered to the National \nSecurity Council and to the President in a credible fashion. Yet we \nhave clear evidence that the chain of communication which we count on \nfor the security of our Nation broke down when it came to the \nPresident's State of the Union Address.\n  The credibility of our President is on the line. I believe he should \nmove forward as quickly as possible to call for a full investigation. \nWe should be able to point to those people responsible for putting this \nmisleading language in the State of the Union Address. They should be \nheld accountable, and they should be dismissed. That is inexcusable \nconduct by someone at that level of government to mislead the President \nor allow him to mislead the American people.\n  It is interesting to me that this issue is gaining ground and \nvelocity as the President travels overseas. I certainly wish that were \nnot the case. It would be better for him to be home because he has an \nimportant mission in Africa and a message that now will not be as clear \nbecause of this surrounding controversy. It is incumbent on us in \nCongress in our oversight role, and it is incumbent on the press corps \nin America to stand up to their responsibility to ask the hard \nquestions and, in asking those questions, find out who should be held \naccountable for this misleading statement in the President's State of \nthe Union Address. We owe it to the American people to give them the \nanswers, to tell them that in the war on terrorism our intelligence \nsources are credible, that they have a good linkage and dialog with the \nWhite House and that the linkage will make America a safer place.\n  Someone made a decision to twist and distort this information for \nreasons which have yet to be disclosed. As we led to the buildup to the \ninvasion of Iraq, that was one of the things the American people \nbelieved because they heard it from their President. The President in \nthe State of the Union Address speaks from the heart to the American \npeople. He should be believed. In that situation, he needs to have the \nvery best advisers and staff near him giving him accurate information. \nWe now know that the President has been embarrassed by information \nwhich he said and has now had to say to the American people was not \ntrue. That has to change. People have to be held accountable. That \nshould be done immediately.\n  If Congress cannot force this investigation, the President, as our \nleader, as the person responsible for the executive branch, should \ninitiate this investigation on his own, find those responsible, hold \nthem accountable, and dismiss them from the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to speak about a \nvery important subject, one we will be debating more vigorously next \nweek when we return. Hopefully, we will be back on the subject of \nenergy independence and energy policy for the Nation. The Chair and I \nserve on a subcommittee with responsibility in that regard, and we both \nwork closely with Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman on fashioning \nenergy policy. We will soon be back on that. I wanted to make a couple \nof comments regarding several important aspects of the energy \nlegislation.\n  Before I do, I would be remiss if I did not associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Illinois. He raises a very important point, \na critical point, one that deserves the full attention of the Congress \nand the administration.\n  As most Americans are well aware, we are going to be conducting war \nin a very different way than we have conducted it in the past. The \nvisions we all have growing up, and some of us even from personal \nexperience in fighting in World War I or World War II or Vietnam of \nKorea, are going to be very different than what we face in the future. \nWars are not necessarily going to be fought nation against nation, army \nagainst army, air force against air force, but they are going to be \nfought by our military and our homeland security apparatus and our \nintelligence, along with multinational intelligence against terrorist \ncells, some of which are not state-supported. Some cells are very \ndifficult to find, as we know from experience because we have yet to \nfind the leaders of two of the worst terrorist organizations in the \nworld.\n  Intelligence has always been so essential to war, having the generals \non the battlefield know more about the enemy than the enemy knows about \nus. Intelligence has been critical in winning in times past, and there \nis no substitute. No amount of manpower or womanpower, no \nsophistication of weapons systems, no strategic battle plans can take \nthe place now in the wars we are going to face, because it is a war \nagainst terror, than complete excellence through and through at every \nlevel in our intelligence apparatus.\n  It does not have to be only American intelligence. We have to have an \ninternational intelligence network with our allies that is the most \nsuperior ever in the world if we are going to protect the American \npeople and act in their best interest, to use our resources wisely and \nto win the war against terror.\n  This is not something in which I like to engage, not only as a \nSenator but as a mother. I am not engaging in a war on terrorism so \nthis is going to be a permanent situation. I engage in the war against \nterror to provide for a world where my children, who are now 11 and 6, \ndon't have to engage. We want to win the war and win it in 5 or 10 or \n15 years. It is incomprehensible to the American people that we would \nbe engaged in such a war over the next 50 or 60 years. We want to win. \nWe want to show the world a better way. To do that, we have to have the \nvery best intelligence we can. The Senator from Illinois raises a very \nimportant point. While there might not have been purposeful \nmanipulation, while no one here wants to accuse the President in any \nway, there are clearly some problems right now, based on the \ninformation we are receiving about who knew what and what reports were \nadhered to, what were pushed to the side, what information was provided \nand what was not.\n\n  For the overall credibility of our intelligence, the credibility of \nour military, the credibility of our Government, this information must \nbe investigated more fully. The truth must come to light. The \nappropriate actions must be taken so we can move on to improve the \ncurrent situation, which is extremely difficult.\n  I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Illinois \nregarding our intelligence personnel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9291-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9291-S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

There are some three \nor four major amendments that still need to be debated and discussed on \nthe Energy bill, but we are close to the end under Senator Domenici's \nleadership, with Senator Bingaman. I have been proud to be a part of \nthat effort. I look\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\nforward to closing out the debate in the Senate with a very fine bill, \na bill that is balanced, that encourages more production, encourages \nmore conservation, and sets a framework for an energy policy for this \nNation that we can be proud of, and equally important, if not more \nimportant, that can grow jobs, that can get the job growth trend moving \nback in the right direction. Not that this could do it all by itself, \nbut having a strong, clear energy policy for this Nation could be a big \nboost in terms of getting jobs recreated in America and giving business \nthe certainty they need so they can make good and wise decisions for \ntheir shareholders and stockholders and begin to increase the vibrancy \nof this economy.\n\n  I rise to talk about a very compelling presentation made by Chairman \nGreenspan yesterday on this subject. He shared a couple of his \nthoughts, and I thought it would be a good idea for me to try and \nexpress some of what he said in a way by adding my own thoughts and \ncomments, because I think what he said and what he showed was quite \ncompelling.\n  The energy situation is a hard subject for a lot of us to grasp. We \ncannot exactly see electricity. It is not like it is on every street \ncorner. We know about schools and we can deal with health care, because \nthere are hospitals and there are schools and we all have personal \nexperiences. The energy issue is a lot harder for us even to grasp as \npolicymakers and for our constituents to grasp because we cannot see \nbig pieces of it. So it is a policy that takes extra time and focus, \nwhich Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have given.\n  I thought this chart would be helpful. This was a chart that was \nshown in the energy hearing yesterday with Chairman Greenspan, and I \nthink more than any other chart it shows one of the major dilemmas \nfacing the Nation right now in terms of energy policy.\n  We can see clearly that up until about 1996, we were generating \ncapacity for electricity by fuel type in a variety of different ways: \nPetroleum in the dark purple color; hydrogen in blue; nuclear in green; \ngas in a fuschia color; and coal in black. We can see with one glance \nthat it was a pretty interesting and balanced mix of what we were using \nto produce electricity in this country.\n  Then all of a sudden something pretty extraordinary happened, and one \ndoes not need a Ph.D. or an MBA or even be on the Energy Committee to \nunderstand this chart, and that is that in 1996 the world changed. All \nof the capacity, or virtually all of it, started to be built in \nanticipation of using natural gas. People say to me, Senator, why did \nthis happen? Did the Congress mandate that everyone do this in the \ncountry? Was there major legislation?\n  The answer is, there was not one thing. It was not a Presidential \nExecutive Order. We do not order our industries in that way. It was not \none congressional act. It was a confluence of things that had to do \nwith a couple of big policy decisions the Congress made.\n  One policy was we must begin to clean up our air. Our air is too \ndirty. We need to clean it up. We have all of these coal-fired plants \nthat, prior to clean coal technologies, were polluting our air. Our \nchildren were getting asthma. People were complaining, rightfully so, \nabout some of the air pollution issues.\n\n  So Congress acted, and with the Clean Air Act of 1990, and then in \n1996 when some rules and regulations came out, the industry said, let's \nmove to a fuel source, natural gas, that meets these clean air \nstandards, that helps to reduce air pollution. They began building, in \nanticipation of this regulatory mode and public demand for cleaner air, \nnatural gas.\n  Although we do not produce a lot of coal in Louisiana, I am mindful \nof States such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania that do. Meanwhile, \nwork has gone on in research to clean up the coal and we will \nanticipate in the future having coal become more of a mix, but it will \nbe cleaner, it will be better, and it will be far less polluting than \nwhat was happening back in 1965, 1970, 1975, and 1980.\n  Great thanks goes to Senator Domenici, who almost singlehandedly can \nclaim credit--he is too modest, but I can most certainly say he can \nalmost singlehandedly claim credit for the revitalization of the \nnuclear industry. While it has its critics and while there are people \nwho still do not believe in nuclear power, it is becoming clear, based \non science and fact, not myth and fear, that as we begin to deal with \nthe waste issue of nuclear power, just like gas, nuclear power produces \nenergy in a way that does not pollute our environment and helps us to \nkeep the air as clean as possible in the United States and, for that \nmatter, in North America and the world, to clean up our Nation's air.\n  When our bill passes, nuclear will become a part of this mix. So we \nhopefully will see a little more black, a little more green, and \npetroleum will probably remain steady. We can see it is a very minor \nportion of our electricity.\n  We use petroleum to drive our cars and buses. It is used more in the \ntransportation sector. But when we are talking about electricity, which \nunderlies all of our economy, our manufacturing, our agriculture, \neverything, it is basically produced by natural gas.\n  What is the problem, then? The problem is that the prices of natural \ngas have tripled in the last 18 months. Whether one is in Oregon, \nCalifornia, or a State such as Louisiana, New York, Illinois, or New \nJersey, believe me, our businesses are suffering. They are closing, \nconsolidating, and laying off workers. Any businesses that rely in \nlarge measure on natural gas to produce their products, whether it is \npetrochemical or fertilizer or ammonia, are feeling the brunt of prices \ndoubling and tripling.\n  Why are prices doubling and tripling? Because the capacity has been \nbuilt up, but there is not an adequate supply. At the same time, we \nhave had policies promoting the use of natural gas at the very same \ntime, in the very same Congress, we have then implemented policies that \ndiscourage the production of natural gas because we put moratoria down \naround the country. We cannot drill even though we know there is a lot \nof gas. Billions and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, in the interior, in Alaska, are off limits \nfrom drilling. We are not encouraging as aggressively as we should the \nimportation of liquefied natural gas, again based on myth and \nmisinformation about the dangers or benefits of such a transfer, which \nbrings me to what Alan Greenspan said.\n  Alan Greenspan said he is not an energy expert, but he knows \nsomething about jobs, he knows something about the economy, and he says \nwe cannot sustain this imbalance. We cannot sustain the imbalance \nbetween the demand for natural gas and our lack of willingness to \nsupply it because the supply and demand is so out of kilter that these \nhigh prices will damage the recovery of our economy and we need to \nincrease the supply of natural gas.\n  He said two things. He said he would prefer to increase the supply of \nnatural gas by domestic production.\n  But he realizes, based on all sorts of concerns--political and \nenvironmental--that in a short time that is unlikely. So the chairman, \nwisely--and I agree--said we should pursue a policy of importing \nliquefied natural gas production, but not just a plant, not to take the \nplace of domestic production, but to complement it.\n  The people in Louisiana would think it is a reasonable policy. We \nfirst say let's open up areas of natural gas production. Louisiana \nalready opened up much of its land, both offshore and onshore. We say \nover and over again we are happy to host the industry. We recognize we \nhave made some environmental errors in the past. But today, these rigs \nare not your grandfather's oil rigs. They are run by computers. They \nare much more safe for the operators of the rigs--for their personal \nsafety, as well as the safety of the environment.\n  In fact, there was a front-page article--and I will submit it for the \nRecord--several weeks ago in New Orleans, where they claim--and I \nbelieve it because I have experienced this myself--some of the best \nfishing in the world is around the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Why? \nBecause the rigs themselves create artificial reefs. You cannot have \ngood fishing and the growth of marine life without good reefs. Coral \nbegins to grow on and attach to these reefs as artificial reefs are \ncreated that are really increasing the health of the marine life in the \ngulf. A lot of people\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\ndon't want to believe that because they want to believe that everything \nassociated with oil and gas is terrible and damaging, and actually the \nfacts are the opposite.\n  So while Louisiana remains a promising place, and in Texas and \nMississippi, and off the Continental Shelf, I must say there are many \nreserves in Florida and in other places in the Outer Continental Shelf \nthat need to be pursued. Now, whether we decide to drill, that would \nhave to be left up to the political establishment, the political \nframework. But we should have an inventory of where those reserves are. \nWe should at least know what our reserves are, which is part of what is \nin the bill.\n  Chairman Greenspan agreed that we cannot sustain--if we want new jobs \nfor the Nation, we cannot sustain this out of balance. How do we fix \nthat?\n  Let me show another chart that is pretty startling. One of the ways \nis to ask every State and region to just pull their own weight. It is \nnot a new concept in America. Our country was founded on a very simple \nprinciple: Those who work get to eat; those who produce should consume; \nthose who are unwilling to work or do their part, unwilling to produce, \nand if they are able, should go without. All able-bodied men and women \nshould pull their own weight. It is just a fundamental value and \nprinciple in America. Our country cannot operate on any other value. We \ndo that pretty well in some areas, but we are not doing very well in \nthe area of energy production.\n  You can see from this chart, which is colorful and easy to \nunderstand, that these States, starting with California and New York, \nand going all the way down to Louisiana and Wyoming--I should say all \nthe way up in this case, as this is positive and this is more negative. \nThese are the States that are consuming more than they are producing. \nThis is the energy deficit in the Nation.\n  We talk a lot about deficits and budget deficits. We talk about \nhealth care deficits. But the energy deficit is very important to \ndiscuss and understand.\n\n  The United States imports more energy than we consume. Why is that? \nIt is because some States and some regions are not producing nearly \nwhat they consume. We are relying on just a few States to be net \nexporters of energy. Those States are Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, \nMontana, Oklahoma, Kentucky, New Mexico, Alaska, West Virginia, \nLouisiana, and Wyoming. They are all net exporters of energy. We \nproduce a lot of energy from a variety of different sources--maybe it \nis hydro, maybe it is coal, maybe it is oil and gas, or maybe it is \nnuclear. But we don't consume as much as we use, and then we send out \nour excess to other States.\n  You can see that Wyoming gets the prize. They are the top State for \nproducing energy, consuming little and sending out 8,000 trillion Btu's \nin excess to be used by their neighbors and the rest of the Nation. One \nof the reasons is Wyoming is a relatively unpopulated State, with only \nabout 450,000 people. They have a large landmass, and they are blessed \nwith a lot of natural resources. They have a fairly pro-production \nmindset in Wyoming. So they produce all that they consume and then they \nhelp the rest of the States with their very difficult situations.\n  Louisiana, which is also a net producer, could also win first prize \nin the sense that not only do we have 4.5 million people, we produce \nenough for our own consumption, but we are also a highly industrialized \nState. Most of the petrochemicals, fertilizers, and many plastics are \nproduced in Louisiana. Not only do we produce enough energy for our \nresidents, but for the industry in our State, which sends their \nproducts into the country and the world. On top of that, we still send \nout electricity for everyone else. It is the same thing for West \nVirginia, which is more like Wyoming. They are not an industrial State, \nbut they are blessed with a lot of natural resources. And there is also \nNew Mexico, et cetera.\n  Let me talk about this part of the chart for a minute. They are big \nStates. California is blessed with natural resources, and New York, \nOhio, and Florida consume a tremendous amount of energy. Yet because of \npolicies that their States have enacted, and maybe because of a lack of \nunderstanding about how much they actually are consuming, they \nbasically refuse to produce any energy--or enough energy. Year after \nyear, decade after decade, they consume and consume, and they refuse to \nproduce. What happens, then, is because of that, the Nation has an \nenergy deficit and we have to import oil or import liquefied natural \ngas from other places--sometimes places that are not friendly, \nsometimes places that are quite dangerous, sometimes countries that we \nwould prefer not to be dealing with, except for the fact that they have \nthe resources we need.\n  This has to change. Senators from these States would come to me and \nsay: Senator, just because you want to drill for oil and gas in \nLouisiana doesn't mean we have to.\n  Well, they are right. If they don't want to do it, that is fine. But \nI say you have to produce it in some way. They can put up a nuclear \npowerplant, or two, or three, or four, or five, or dam some of their \nrivers to generate hydro power, or they can find some coal reserves and \ndig for some of their coal, or they can come up with alternatives, such \nas putting up windmills.\n  Interestingly enough, in one of the States--Massachusetts--which \nconsumes more than it produces--there are some communities that are \nopposing the putting up of windmills offshore because people don't want \nto look at them. They don't like the way they look. They don't like the \nway oil rigs look or the way windmills look.\n  While they have a right to that opinion, I am not sure it is good \npolicy for us just to completely eliminate sources of energy because \nsome people might not like the way these structures look. They think \n``not in my backyard.'' But everybody wants to walk into a room and \nturn on the lights; everybody wants not one cell phone but several; \neverybody wants a laptop; they may want to own a business where they \ncan use the energy sources and pay a little bit of money for that use, \nbut they don't want to produce. It cannot sustain itself. We will \neither become more vulnerable to outside sources or we will drive \nbusinesses away from the United States and the North American Continent \nto other places where they can get an adequate supply of energy for \ncheaper prices. It will cost jobs in your State, in my State, or in New \nYork or California.\n\n  When we lose jobs, we lose income from taxes. When we lose taxes for \nlocal government, the police force gets cut, the fire departments get \ncut, schools close. We have communities, perhaps in the State of the \nPresiding Officer, with 4-day school weeks. Who ever heard of such a \nthing? Four days of school? My children would like that, but I don't \nthink for a nation trying to develop a skilled workforce we can afford \nto go to 3- and 4-day school weeks.\n  When we lose jobs, we lose income, the economy gets sluggish, we lose \ntax revenues, schools close, hospitals close, and it is a ferocious \ncycle.\n  Will fixing this fix everything? No. But fixing the energy deficit in \nthis Nation will go a long way. It can be done if we come to grips with \nthe facts.\n  Let me be clear because I don't want anyone saying the Senator's \nanswer is for everyone to start drilling for oil and gas in their \nState. If some States or some regions do not want to drill for oil and \ngas, although they might have a lot of it, they need to think about \nwhat they will do. Will they dig for coal? Will they put up windmills? \nWill they construct nuclear powerplants? Will they use more hydro? Will \nthey allow the damming of some rivers--not all rivers--to create the \nkind of energy they need?\n  What is not fair is to put these States in the position of having to \nproduce all the energy for all the rest of the States and for these \nStates to jeopardize the security of this Nation both from a national \nsecurity aspect and an economic aspect because their policies will not \nbe in line.\n  If any one of these States thinks they could enact within their \nStates enough conservation to take up this slack, more power to them. \nIf these States--whether it is Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, or \nFlorida--think, fine, we decided we do not want to produce anything, we \ndo not like the idea of producing, we do not want to produce any \nenergy, we will conserve, then fine. They can go to all their \nbusinesses and tell them you can only use electricity between the hours \nof 8 in\n\n[[Page S9294]]\n\nthe morning and 12 noon and close your business and come back the next \nday. If they think they could politically get away with that, that is a \nsolution they also have--or coming up with alternative sources.\n  I am not trying to be unreasonable; I think the American people \nunderstand it. I don't know about the policymakers, but I promise \npeople in Louisiana, people in Florida, people in California understand \nthey have to produce energy if they are going to consume it. They can \neither produce more or conserve more. But to just put your head in the \nsand and say, A, we do not have a problem, or, B, we can get ourselves \nout of it by conservation only, that is the wrong way to lead.\n  Sometimes I am accused of wanting to bend or modify environmental \nlaws or regulations. The reason I feel so strongly is I believe in \nclean air standards. I want to keep the air clean. If we can produce \nmore natural gas, if we can produce more nuclear, if we can continue, \nas this bill proposes, to invest in clean coal technology, we could \nincrease the supply of energy and clean up our environment. I want to \nmove in that direction. I don't want to have to back up from those \nenvironmental standards we have set for ourselves. I hope we can do \nthis.\n\n  We have an energy deficit. It is a national natural gas crisis. \nChairman Greenspan has said he believes one of the solutions is to \nincrease the supply of natural gas domestically and to try to create a \nframework in this bill to at least make it optional to import liquefied \nnatural gas not only from other nations but Alaska, which is a rich \nsource of natural gas. However, we must do something not only as a \nnation but as regions.\n  This chart shows the U.S. census regions and divisions. The Pacific \nWest is represented, and then the Mountain States, the West North \nCentral, the Texas and Louisiana region, and then the Northeast. This \nis not in the bill as drafted at this moment, but I will work on \nlanguage that would begin to help these regions focus on energy \nindependence.\n  I am not pulling this concept out of the sky because I met with some \nleaders from Canada. Much to my amazement, Canada has developed quite a \ndifferent way than the United States. Each of our States has acted, of \ncourse, independently. We are the United States of 50 States acting \nindependently. Canada has developed its electricity and energy system \non a regional basis. They have six distinct regions and each region is \nself-sufficient. They each generate enough energy in their region--\nwhich makes a lot of sense--based on the natural resources in the \nregion. One region has a lot of nuclear power because that is what \ntheir region decided. Another region produces a lot from hydro because \nthey have the ability to do that. Other regions have gas.\n  And then they have the mix of supply. When, say, there is a drought \nin an area with the hydro and they do not have enough water, the other \nregions are able to meet the demand of that region because they have \nnuclear or they have gas. Say the price of natural gas goes up. That \nregion, then, says no, we will not buy your gas; it is too expensive. \nAnd they get inexpensive hydro or less expensive nuclear. That \ncompetition is good. It helps everybody keep the price low and stable, \nwhich is the point. Canada operates in a very model way.\n  We are far from that model. We need to get closer to that model and \neventually get Mexico in that model. Then we will have quite a robust \nNorth American model.\n  What we have now are individual States, and we are trying to break \nour States down a little bit, recognizing State rights and trying to \nwork with the States but encouraging them to break up into regions and \nthink about regional independence so Florida and Georgia and South \nCarolina can no longer say, we just want to consume, we want to get all \nof our power from Louisiana, or we want to get all of our power from \nMississippi. This region should think, how are we going to sustain our \nregion and come up with regional plans.\n  It will not be simple. It will not happen overnight. But this is a \nview of what potentially could be done.\n  Another chart demonstrates RTO, regional transmission organizations, \nwhich is happening now. This is not something in the far distance. This \nis underway now through regulation and through congressional bills and \namendments we are passing, encouraging the development of these \nregional transmission organizations for the purpose of transmitting \nelectricity.\n  On the same concept, we should be producing regionally a balance, so \nthat no State should be allowed to simply consume and not produce. No \nregion should be allowed to simply consume and not produce.\n  Different people say to me: Senator, some States produce wheat; your \nState does not produce wheat. But some States produce all the wheat and \nship it to you and not every State has to produce wheat. That would be \na pretty good argument except that people do not object to having \nwheatfields in their backyards. People want to grow crops; they want \nagriculture to be there. So we manage, as a nation. I grow a lot of \nwonderful cotton and sugar and soybean. We ship it up to the Midwest. \nThey produce wheat and ship it down to us. That system is working fine \nbecause there are no environmental efforts to undermine the growing of \nour crops. But there are misguided environmental efforts to undermine \nthe production of energy and electricity in this country, forcing some \nStates to basically say: Not in my backyard, not today, not tomorrow, \nnot anything--not oil, not gas, not coal, not nuclear, not windmills, \nnot anything. And, by the way, we are not going to conserve very much. \nWe conserve a little, but we still want to use all that we want, 24 \nhours a day.\n\n  It is not going to work. It never has worked in the history of the \ncountry, and it is not going to work today. So we have a problem. This \nbill we are going to adopt, thanks to the leadership of many on the \nSenate floor, will begin to solve some of these problems. For Louisiana \nand for the Gulf Coast States I think it will be quite a victory \nbecause we have done more than our share of production. We are happy to \ndo it. We want to be more fully and equally compensated for that \nproduction. We want to share in the taxes that are generated from the \nproduction so we can invest in our infrastructure, in our environment, \nin saving our wetlands that are somewhat damaged by the drilling.\n  But it is not the primary culprit. The primary culprit in our case, \nwhich you cannot see here--Louisiana through the Mississippi River \ndrains more than 40 percent of the continental United States. It also \nserves as a river for commerce for the whole Nation. Where we dam this \nriver, the Mississippi River, and as we have tried to tame it, which is \nan ongoing process over the last 200 years, so this country could grow \nand expand, we now do not allow the river to overflow and to replenish \nthe marsh. So we are losing a lot of this extraordinary wetland in the \nsouthern part of the State. It is not due primarily to oil and gas \ndrilling. It is due to the commercialization and the leveeing and \ndredging of the greatest river system in the world.\n  So the country has an obligation to help us. We have a plan, and with \ngood help, in this Energy bill we will begin to solve our wetlands \nproblems, maintain good commercial navigation for the international \ntrade that benefits not only our State but the whole Nation, and \nhopefully begin to get this country on a more commonsense approach to \nenergy production and electricity use.\n  A national energy policy must address the regional challenges that \nconfront our country. It must call for each region to use wisely the \nresources it can access in order to supply its particular demand for \nenergy. For too long, individual States have prevented regions of our \ncountry from producing the energy needed, creating an energy deficit, \nall the while continuing to consume the majority of that region's \nenergy. This bill must address the national gas crisis and the emerging \nenergy crisis in America.\n  I need to make this one final point. It is the subject of a whole \nother speech, but I don't want to finish without saying this about \nanother consequence of relying on outside sources of energy. California \nsays we don't want to drill, not on our State, offshore, Outer \nContinental Shelf. Florida says we don't want to drill; we don't want \nto produce. Illinois and others say the same. What\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\nhappens is, because we refuse to regulate our consumption or reduce it \nsubstantially--because, frankly, we can reduce some through technology \nand through alternatives, but we just can't restrict consumption \nbecause we will restrict economic growth, which we do not want to do.\n  But what happens, then, is we begin importing from other countries, \ncountries that have lower environmental standards than we do, countries \nthat have less capacity to enforce the meager regulations they have on \nthe books, countries that are more desperate for jobs. Although we want \nthem, there are countries desperate for them. So, inadvertently, we end \nup increasing pollution, damaging the world environment because we \nrefuse to adopt commonsense principles, which are to extract national \nresources and develop energy on our own soil, off our own continental \nshelf, and minimize the degradation internationally.\n  If anybody wants to come to the Senate floor and debate that with me, \nI will be more than happy to debate it because I am scrambling for \ninformation. Perhaps I have gotten information incorrectly.\n  I am very concerned because America consumes so much oil and so much \ngas. I know a lot of that production comes from the Mideast. But now we \nare asking it of Venezuela and now we are asking countries in Africa. \nThey want to, of course, because if they ship oil to us, their \ncountries make money. They put their people to work. I understand that. \nWe produce a lot of oil and gas.\n  But I am also well aware, as a producer, of the environmental \ndegradation that can occur if we do not have strong rules and \nregulations, strong court systems, and a mature political system that \ncan monitor it.\n  I say to the leaders in our country, when we force production off of \nour shore, we damage the international environment. It is not right. If \nsome environmental organizations want to challenge that comment, then \nplease do it. I urge them to send mail to me or send e-mails to me and \ntell me why I am wrong; that we can easily and clearly and without \ndamage drill in other places of the world.\n  I don't believe it because I know what we went through in the \nLouisiana Legislature over 20 years ago, led by a group of very great \nlegislators, to try to bring good rules and regulations to the \nindustry. Now the industry is doing much better. But 30 and 40 years \nago, people were not too interested in environmental rules and \nregulations. So I know what can occur when the rules and regulations \nare not there.\n  I wonder how the people of California or Florida might feel about the \nfact that, because they refuse to produce, somebody is producing \nsomewhere for them, in places that do not have rules and regulations \nlike they do, in places they cannot be enforced.\n\n  What about the children who live in those areas? What about the \nfamilies who are struggling with meager incomes? What environmental \nlegacies are we leaving in Third World countries around the globe?\n  For all the reasons--for independence, for national security, for \njobs, for the economy, and for making this world a more beautiful place \nthan we found it when we got here--I urge this Senate to take seriously \nthe bill that is being put forward by both Senators from New Mexico, \nthe chairman, and the ranking member, to pass an Energy bill before we \nleave for the August break. I will stand with them. The people of \nLouisiana support this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9295-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in San Jose, \nCA.

Mr. President, in 1994 I supported legislation which \nPresident Clinton signed into law a banning of the production of \ncertain semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines. The 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons as well as \na number of other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics \nsuch as pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash \nsuppressors. The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the manufacture of \nsemiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two of these military \nfeatures and accept a detachable magazine. Pre-existing military-style \nsemiautomatic weapons were not banned. This law is scheduled to sunset \non September 13, 2004.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Feinstein introduced the Assault Weapons \nBan Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize this important piece \nof gun safety legislation. I am a cosponsor of this bill because I \nbelieve it is critical that we keep these weapons off the streets and \nout of our communities. Senator Feinstein's bill also includes a \nprovision that would ban the importation of large capacity ammunition \nfeeding devices. This provision passed the Senate 59 to 39, as an \namendment to the 1999 Juvenile Justice bill, and passed the House by \nunanimous consent. However, the 106th Congress never passed the \nJuvenile Justice bill because it got stuck in conference, and thus the \nimport ban never became law.\n  Studies have shown that the assault weapons ban legislation works. \nAccording to National Institute of Justice statistics reported by the \nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, gun trace requests for assault \nweapons declined 20 percent in the first calendar year after the ban \ntook effect, dropping from 4,077 in 1994 to 3,268 in 1995. This \nindicates that fewer of these weapons were making it onto the streets.\n  If the law is not reauthorized, the production of assault weapons can \nlegally resume. Restarting production of these weapons will increase \ntheir number and availability and inevitably lead to a rise in gun \ncrimes committed with assault weapons. The Congress should act this \nyear to reauthorize the ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9295-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9295-S9298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the recently \npassed Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, S.1. I \nam pleased to support this bipartisan effort both in the Senate Finance \nCommittee and here on the floor. I believe this bill represents a \npositive compromise and a good start for America's senior citizens and \nindividuals with disabilities who have relied on the Medicare Program \nfor generations. I hope that the conferees act deliberately and fairly \nin the coming weeks to embrace what is good about this bill and to \nretain its bipartisan spirit. This process has been a long road for \nmany of us who have worked on this issue for years but it has been an \neven longer road for America's seniors, who have watched drug prices \nescalate while Washington failed to act. Like all legislative products, \nthis bill is not perfect. I have worked to improve this bill for \nArkansas seniors in many ways, and I am committed to correcting any \nproblems with it as it is implemented.\n  Despite its shortcomings, which I will detail later, S. 1 is much \nbetter for Arkansans than the plan President Bush proposed earlier this \nyear. First and foremost, S. 1 gives all Medicare beneficiaries access \nto a prescription drug benefit. Under President Bush's\n\n[[Page S9296]]\n\nproposal, Arkansas seniors who wanted a drug benefit would have been \nforced to drop out of traditional Medicare and enroll in a private HMO \ninstead, even though such a plan may not have been available in their \narea. Under the President's plan, seniors who remained in traditional \nMedicare would have received nominal discounts on prescriptions and a \nlimited catastrophic benefit if they had extremely high drug expenses. \nI have said all along that it is simply unfair to deny a prescription \ndrug benefit to beneficiaries in traditional Medicare. All 442,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries in Arkansas are currently enrolled in \ntraditional Medicare with no access to Medicare + Choice because \nprivate insurance companies found the profit margin of health care \ninsurance in rural areas to be too small. That is why Medicare needs to \nbe there as a safety net. That is why prescription drug coverage must \nbe a part of traditional Medicare. That is why the guarantee in S. 1 \nthat traditional Medicare will pick up the slack where private insurers \ndecline to operate needs to remain in the final version of this new \npolicy.\n  Second, I helped ensure that S. 1 provides special assistance to our \nState's most vulnerable seniors--those with low incomes. Over 40 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries in Arkansas have incomes below 160 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Level--in 2003, $14,368 for a single and \n$19,392 for a couple--and simply cannot afford to fill their \nprescriptions. These are the seniors who struggle to pay for food, \nheat, and other necessities in order to afford their lifesaving drugs, \nand I hear from them often. I fought in the Senate Finance Committee to \nensure that seniors under 160 percent of poverty would get special \nassistance with their premiums, deductibles, and cost-sharing. Those \nwith very low incomes who also qualify for an assets test would receive \nmore generous help. I helped improve the low-income provisions even \nmore on the Senate floor by working with Senators Bingaman and Domenici \nto increase the asset test levels from $4,000 to $10,000, adjust these \nlevels yearly for inflation, and reduce the paperwork burden for \neligible seniors. Because this amendment passed, many more seniors in \nArkansas will receive help with the cost-sharing imposed under this \nbill. Today, lower income seniors only fill about 20 prescriptions per \nyear, compared to an average of 32 for those with prescription drug \ninsurance. These provisions will help ensure that lower-income \nbeneficiaries will be able to afford to fill their prescriptions, \nkeeping them healthier and helping them live longer.\n  I succeeded in including in S. 1 a number of other provisions that \nwill improve the Medicare Program for Arkansans for many years to come. \nTwo such provisions are based on legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear, the Geriatric Care Act, S. 387. My first provision would provide \nfor a 3-year demonstration project in Arkansas and five other sites on \ncomplex, chronic care management. Once this demonstration project is \ncompleted, S. 1 allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nto use its findings to add this service as a part of traditional \nMedicare from 2009 to 2013 as long as it costs no more than $6 billion.\n  More than 80 percent of Medicare dollars are spent on Medicare \nbeneficiaries with three or more chronic conditions like Alzheimer's \ndisease, cancer, or diabetes. Better care management for these seniors \nshould improve patients' overall quality of life and reduce the need \nfor expensive hospitalizations for chronic conditions. It is my hope \nthat this further, more extensive study of chronic care management \nprovided by geriatricians and their health care teams will prove this. \nWe in Arkansas are blessed to have the Donald W. Reynolds Department of \nGeriatrics and the Center on Aging at the University of Arkansas for \nMedical Sciences, whose geriatric specialists have vastly improved the \ncare for seniors across our State. These provisions will make it easier \nfor our medical school and others across the country to better care for \npatients with chronic conditions while also training more physicians in \ngeriatrics. The other provision included in S. 1 provides the Secretary \nof HHS with the authority to clarify that geriatric training programs \nare eligible for 2 years of fellowship support under Medicare. This \nchange would help maintain incentives for fellows to continue into \nsecond-year training, a critical pathway to careers in academics and \ngeriatric research.\n  S. 1 also allows the Secretary of HHS to cover preventive benefits \nthat aren't currently covered under traditional Medicare between the \nyears 2009 to 2013. I have long fought to add new preventive services \nto Medicare, such as cholesterol screening, medical nutrition therapy \nservices for beneficiaries with cardiovascular disease, counseling for \ncessation of tobacco use, and diabetes screening. These benefits are \nespecially important for women, who are the majority of Medicare \nrecipients and who make up 71 percent of the Medicare population over \n85 years of age. By encouraging women to get screened for diseases like \nheart disease, osteoporosis, and breast cancer, we can save and improve \nlives.\n\n  I also succeeded in including my legislation, S. 1114, to provide \nMedicare coverage for kidney disease education services. Each year, \nsome 80,000 people are diagnosed with chronic kidney failure--also \nknown as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with ESRD require \nregular kidney dialysis treatments or a transplant to survive, and most \nare entitled to have this care paid for by the Medicare Program. \nUnfortunately, many of these renal patients are never informed that, \nprior to kidney failure, there are a number of steps they can take to \nimprove their chances of having better outcomes with dialysis. Medicare \ncurrently requires that ESRD patients receive education on treatment \noptions--but not until after the patient is already under the care of a \ndialysis clinic. Unfortunately, by then it is essentially too late to \ntake advantage of much of the information. My provision makes \ncounseling available to patients before dialysis is initiated to help \npatients understand all the therapies available for the treatment of \nESRD. My amendment will save money and improve patient care.\n  I also succeeded in including an important amendment to ensure \nMedicare coverage for insulin syringes. Before my amendment, S. 1 \nprovided no coverage for insulin syringes although it did provide \ncoverage for insulin. Roughly 40 percent of the senior population with \ndiabetes, or 1.8 million seniors, use syringes to inject insulin into \ntheir bodies to control their diabetes every day. Without coverage, \nsyringe purchases--which can be especially expensive for seniors on \nfixed incomes--would not count towards cost-sharing and yearly maximum \nout-of-pocket expenses. My amendment changed that. Now, the bill \nensures coverage for syringes and other necessary medical supplies \nassociated with administering insulin as determined by HHS. Providing \ncoverage for insulin syringes will help diabetic seniors who take \ninsulin keep their disease under control. Syringe coverage will help \nseniors manage or prevent long-term complications of diabetes like \nkidney failure, blindness, and amputations by helping to keep blood \nglucose levels in a normal range.\n  I was also able to include a 3-year, 5-site demonstration project to \ndetermine the merits of allowing Medicare beneficiaries direct access \nto physical therapists' services within the Medicare Program, as \nauthorized by State law. Currently, some 37 States, including Arkansas, \nallow direct access to physical therapist services. While non-Medicare \npatients can directly access such services in these States, Medicare \nbeneficiaries are restricted from such access by the requirement that \nthey obtain a referral from another practitioner. Requiring a referral \nis unnecessary and limits access to timely and medically necessary \nphysical therapist services. This demonstration, which is designed to \nbe budget neutral, will determine if direct access does in fact improve \npatient care and save Medicare money.\n  I also worked with Senator Craig Thomas to include a bill we \nsponsored together, S. 310, to provide Medicare coverage of licensed \nprofessional counselors and marriage and family therapist services. \nAlthough the rate of suicide among seniors is higher than for any other \nage group, fewer than 3 percent of seniors report seeing mental health \nprofessionals for treatment. Lack of access to mental health providers \nis one of the primary reasons why older Americans don't get the\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\nmental health treatment they need. Not surprisingly, this problem is \nexacerbated in rural areas. Licensed professional counselors are often \nthe only mental health specialists available in rural communities. This \nis true in Arkansas, where 91 percent of Arkansans reside in a mental \nhealth professional shortage area. This provision will significantly \nincrease the number of Medicare-eligible mental health providers in \nArkansas, providing better access for patients.\n  I was successful in working with Senator Cantwell on an amendment \nthat will restrict pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and require the \nDepartment of Justice and the Health and Human Services Inspector \nGeneral to review PBM financial practices for any potential collusion \nbetween PBMs and drug manufacturers on drug pricing and availability. I \nalso supported an amendment with Senator Enzi to ensure that \npharmacists have the option of offering 90-day prescriptions when they \nare also offered by mail order.\n  I sponsored an amendment with Senator John Ensign to repeal the \n$1,590 cap on outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and \nspeech-language pathology. The current therapy cap discriminates \nagainst the most vulnerable of Medicare beneficiaries. While the \nmajority of enrollees will not exceed an annual $1,590 limitation on \nrehabilitation services, approximately 13 percent of seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities covered by Medicare will be forced to pay \nfor medically necessary services out of pocket. This is a particularly \nburdensome situation for beneficiaries living in rural communities. \nMost likely to be harmed are beneficiaries who have experienced a \nstroke or hip fracture or who have Parkinson's disease or other \nconditions that require extensive rehabilitation following injury or \nillness. Before Senator Ensign and I withdrew our amendment to repeal \nthis cap, we discussed the amendment on the floor with the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who promised to work in the \nconference committee to enact a moratorium on the therapy cap.\n  I also succeeded in including a number of my amendments during debate \nof the bill in the Senate Finance Committee. The committee adopted my \namendment to waive temporarily the late enrollment penalty for military \nretirees and their spouses who sign up for Medicare Part B and to \npermit year-round enrollment so that retirees can access the new \nbenefits immediately. Currently, military retirees and their spouses \nwho do not join Medicare Part B when initially eligible can only do so \nduring the annual open enrollment season. This amendment was needed \nbecause many retired beneficiaries previously saw no value in enrolling \nin Medicare Part B because they believed they were promised lifetime \nhealth care in military treatment facilities, many of which were \nsubsequently closed due to base realignment and closure.\n  The committee also adopted my amendment to establish an adult day \nservices demonstration project for home health beneficiaries. A bill I \nintroduced earlier this year, S. 1238, would give Medicare \nbeneficiaries the option to receive their Medicare home health services \nin an adult day setting. This would be a substitution, not an \nexpansion, of services and is designed to be budget neutral. The option \nof Medicare home health services in an adult day location has a number \nof important advantages for beneficiaries and their families, \nincluding: increased social interaction, therapeutic activities, \nnutrition, health monitoring, medication management, and enabling \nfamily caregivers to continue working, since care would be provided all \nday. More than 22 million families nationwide, or nearly one in four \nfamilies, serve as caregivers for aging seniors, providing close to 80 \npercent of the care to individuals requiring long-term care. Nearly 75 \npercent of people providing care for aging family members are women who \nalso maintain other responsibilities, such as working outside of the \nhome and raising young children. The average loss of income to these \ncaregivers has been shown to be over $650,000 in wages, pension, and \nSocial Security benefits. The loss of productivity in U.S. businesses \nranges from $11 to $29 billion a year. The services offered in adult \nday care facilities provide continuity of care and an important sense \nof community for both the senior and the caregiver. This important \ndemonstration project will benefit women of all ages.\n\n  The bill also includes my amendment to ensure that Medicare Quality \nImprovement Organizations (QIOs), can assist providers, practitioners, \nbenefit administrators and plans to improve the quality of care under \nthe new Medicare drug benefit system. This will be consistent with the \nrole that QIOs already play in ensuring quality health care.\n  These initiatives, among others, will dramatically improve the \nMedicare Program. I am also pleased that S. 1 includes a number of \nprovisions that I have cosponsored over several years that will \nsignificantly help rural health care providers in Arkansas keep their \ndoors open to Medicare beneficiaries. By correcting a disparity in the \nway the Medicare physician fee schedule values physician work, practice \nexpenses, and professional liability insurance, Medicare will pay rural \nphysicians more fairly for treating Medicare patients. Also, the bill \ncontains several provisions contained in my bill with Senators Conrad \nand Thomas, S. 816, to correct the disparities in Medicare payments to \nrural hospitals. Rural physicians and hospitals in Arkansas will \nreceive millions of dollars of extra Medicare reimbursements under this \nbill.\n  And now that I have discussed some of the positive aspects of this \nbill, I would like to focus on some of my concerns regarding other \nprovisions.\n  I am concerned that private, drug-only plans may not provide the \nstability or predictability that seniors want and need. The insurance \ncompanies have told me they don't want to offer a prescription drug-\nonly plan. The administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices has said such a plan ``doesn't exist in nature.'' And, quite \nfrankly, I believe we have proven through the Medicare, Medicaid, and \nVeteran's program that the Government can do it in a more cost-\neffective manner.\n  That is why I am glad the bill contains a Medicare guaranteed drug \nplan--or safety net--called the fallback. However, the fallback is that \nit is available for seniors for only 1 year at a time. That means if \nprivate insurers decide to test whether they want to offer the benefit \nin a community, seniors lose access to the fallback plan, even if the \nnew plan is significantly more expensive for them or more restrictive. \nI offered an amendment to S. 1 that would have provided more stability \nfor seniors by giving the fallback a 2-year contract instead of one. \nThis would prevent seniors from having to switch plans from year to \nyear with no end in sight. Although my amendment failed on a narrow \nmargin, I will continue to try to improve the stability of the drug \nbenefit by enacting this small, but important change to the fallback \nbefore the benefit starts in 2006.\n  I am also concerned about the fact that drug plans will vary \nthroughout the country, meaning that seniors in Arkansas may have \ndifferent premiums, cost-sharing, and formularies than seniors in other \nStates. And, even worse, these plans can change their premiums, cost-\nsharing, and formularies every other year. I voted for many amendments \nto make the prescription drug benefit less volatile for seniors. For \nexample, to reduce the variance in premiums across the country, I \nsupported an amendment to limit variations in the amount seniors have \nto pay in premiums to only 10 percent above the national average, no \nmatter where they live. I felt that we should give seniors some \nassurance that their premiums will not vary or increase unreasonably. \nCurrently, all Medicare beneficiaries pay a $58.70 premium for \nphysician services no matter where they live. Seniors should have this \nsame stability in the drug benefit. I am concerned that under S.1, \nseniors in rural areas, who are often older and sicker, will pay higher \npremiums than seniors in urban areas. Unfortunately, this amendment to \nstabilize the premium was defeated. However, I succeeded in the Senate \nFinance Committee in passing an amendment with Senator Snowe to \nencourage the Secretary of Health and Human Services to geographically \nadjust payments to plans to account for differences in drug utilization \nacross service areas so that premiums wouldn't vary as much.\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\n  I voted for many other amendments to strengthen the drug benefit in \nthis bill but they failed. I voted to make the drug benefit more \nattractive to seniors by closing the ``coverage gap'' that exists in S. \n1. This gap may penalize sick seniors. Once a senior's total drug \nspending reaches $4,500 for the year, the benefit shuts down until her \ntotal drug expenditures reach at least $5,813, unless the senior \nqualifies for low-income protections. I voted to allow employer-\nsponsored retiree health plans contributions to count in this gap. I \nvoted to eliminate the coverage gap altogether. I voted to prevent \nseniors from paying premiums when they are in the coverage gap. \nUnfortunately, all these amendments were defeated. I will seek to work \nwith my colleagues to close this coverage gap before the benefit \nstarts.\n  I also voted for amendments to contain the skyrocketing costs of \nprescription drugs. One measure that I supported, which passed, seeks \nto increase access to more affordable and equally effective generic \ndrugs. I also voted for an amendment, which failed, to help consumers \nbetter compare the cost-effectiveness of prescription drugs. Finally, I \nvoted for a successful amendment to allow wholesalers and pharmacists \nto import prescription drugs from Canada, which will provide \nsubstantial savings to consumers while ensuring their safety.\n  Another concern I have about S. 1 is its $6 billion experiment that \nstarts in 2009 to test whether private insurance plans are more \nefficient and less costly than Medicare. To me and many others, the \nevidence we have already speaks to the fact that Medicare is more \nefficient. The Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting \nOffice, and outside experts all agree that private, preferred provider \norganizations and managed care plans cannot achieve the efficiencies \nMedicare can due to their need to make profits. Given these findings, I \nwonder how much of the ``savings'' this demonstration project seeks to \nachieve will come from privatization and how much will come from \nshifting more costs to seniors and health care providers? More \nimportantly, I wonder why we couldn't have used the $6 billion to \nreduce drug costs to seniors by making the benefit better?\n  Medicare provides health care for a special population of Americans--\nmillions of seniors, individuals with disabilities, and people with \nkidney failure--those who are uninsurable in the private market. \nCongress created Medicare in the first place because private insurance \nplans were failing to provide affordable health care coverage for this \nhigh-risk population. I wonder why we must turn back the clock and \ncommit billions of taxpayer dollars to again test whether the private \ninsurance market wants to insure this population.\n  In conclusion, much has been accomplished but more needs to be done. \nI look forward to the deliberations of the conference committee and \nurge my colleagues to engage with me and others in the Senate who are \neager to get a good bill signed into law. I hope my friends on the \nconference committee will retain the Senate low-income assistance \nprovisions, for they are far superior to those in the House bill. This \nlow-income assistance is of special importance to our nation's older \nwomen. Of the 19.5 million female Medicare beneficiaries over age 65, \n12.4 percent or 2.4 million enrollees live on incomes that are below \n100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Another 3.2 million, 16 \npercent, live on incomes between 100 percent and 150 percent of \npoverty. Of senior men, on the other hand, only 7 percent are below \npoverty and another 11 percent are between 100 percent and 150 percent \nof poverty. Medicare seniors are disproportionately women and \ndisproportionately poor, and will be far better served by the Senate's \nlow-income provisions.\n  Our parents and grandparents are depending on us, and we must not let \nthem down once again. I hope that partisan politics do not stand in the \nway of a drug benefit that is available to all seniors under \ntraditional Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9298-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9298-S9299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STROM THURMOND: POLITICIAN AND PATRIOT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague and \na friend, Strom Thurmond. We were all deeply moved by the recent \npassing of this gracious gentleman, and I would like to take a few \nminutes to reflect on his rich life and to honor his memory.\n  Strom Thurmond had a long and distinguished career. Over recent weeks \nwe have heard many descriptions of the achievements of this remarkable \nman. But Senator Thurmond was distinguished for much more than the \nlength of his Senate service or the number of ``firsts'' he achieved \nduring his life. Rather, Senator Thurmond is distinguished by his love \nfor America. For although Strom Thurmond was perhaps best known as a \npolitician, he was first and foremost a patriot. His military service, \nhis time as a governor, and his tenure in the U.S. Senate were all \nfueled by his deep and abiding love for America.\n  Just as deep as his love for America was his love for South Carolina \nand its residents. Senator Thurmond and his staff were well known for \ntheir accessability and outstanding constituent service. He believed in \nhard work and service, and never shied away from his convictions.\n  That same accessability and attitude of service carried over to his \ninteraction with fellow members as well. I was honored to serve with \nSenator Thurmond on the Armed Services Committee, and I still remember \nthe helpful guidance he gave me as a new member on the committee. His \npassion for our military members and his concern for their well-being \nwas evident, and I hope that I can emulate that same care.\n  I also remember how generous Senator Thurmond was with his personal \ntime. Obviously as a senior Member of the Senate and the Senate \nPresident pro tempore he had a number of responsibilities. However, he \nstill made time to serve this member. Several years ago I was honored \nwhen he graciously agreed to speak at the Capitol Conference I hold for \nColorado constituents each year. To this day I am deeply appreciative \nof the time that he spent making remarks, fielding questions, and \ntaking photos with my constituents. Many of the participants later \nremarked on his wit and vitality, remarkable for any member, but \nespecially for one of his years. Even in their short time with him they \nwere able to see the courtesy and conviction that we witnessed each \nday.\n  I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to get to know Strom \nThurmond as the person behind the military hero and political legend. \nTo see the small ways in which he expressed his interest in and \nappreciation for those around him, such as taking the Senate pages for \nice cream. He also expressed personal concern about the health and well \nbeing of his staff and Members, which was perhaps necessitated in some \npart by the candy he was always handing out. I only hope that we can \nall learn from and retain some part of his charm, confidence, depth of \nconviction, and commitment.\n  Although Strom Thurmond may no longer be here with us physically, his \nlegacy will live on. The United States Senate and America are better \nfor his strength, service, and self-sacrifice.\n  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere \ncondolences to Senator Thurmond's family and friends. He was a proud \nfather, and recently, grandfather. His love for his family was well \nknown, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. My wife Joan and I \nhope that they are able to find comfort and peace during these \ndifficult days.\n  I am proud to have called Strom Thurmond my colleague and friend, and \ntoday I join the rest of America in honoring this great service and \nmourning his passing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today as we remember the \nHonorable Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. The \naccomplishments of this man in his 100 years of life were truly \namazing. All that he did for his State and our Nation make all \nAmericans proud. He was a vigorous, positive person who unrelentingly \nworked for a better America.\n  Senator Thurmond was born on December 5, 1902 in Edgefield, SC. He \nreceived his undergraduate degree from then Clemson College, now \nClemson University, in 1923. He studied law under his father, Judge \nWilliam Thurmond and, in 1930, was admitted to the South Carolina Bar. \nFor 8 years, from 1930 to 1938, he served as the Edgefield\n\n[[Page S9299]]\n\nTown and County attorney, and during that time, from 1933 to 1938, he \nserved as South Carolina State Senator, representing Edgefield County.\n  A true patriot, Senator Thurmond joined the U.S. Army Reserve as a \n2nd lieutenant in 1924. He landed in Normandy on D-Day with the 82nd \nAirborne Division during World War II. For his military service, he \nearned 18 decorations, medals, and awards, including the Legion of \nMerit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star for Valor, and the Purple \nHeart, among others.\n  His political ambitions flourished when, in 1947, Senator Thurmond \nwas elected Governor of South Carolina. In 1948, he decided to run for \nPresident of the United States as the States Rights Democratic \ncandidate. He carried 4 States and received 39 electoral votes, the \nthird largest independent electoral vote in U.S. history. However, the \nmost memorable moment for Senator Thurmond came in 1954, when he was \nelected to the United States Senate as a write-in candidate! To be \nelected to any position as a write-in candidate, much less to the \nUnited States Senate, is a true testament to one's political prowess. \nHe was the first person to ever be elected to a major office in the \nUnited States by this method.\n  Senator Thurmond served on many committees during his service to \nAmerica in the Senate. The duty and patriotism he displayed is a fine \nindication of all that he devoted to our Nation's military. It is quite \nfitting that Senator Thurmond served on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and used his role to help enhance our military in every way \npossible. He served as chairman of this committee from January of 1995 \nto January of 1999 and was bestowed the great honor of being named \nchairman emeritus in 1999. The time I spent with Senator Thurmond on \nthis committee was a wonderful learning experience for me and the \nSenate Armed Services Committee will miss Senator Thurmond. His \nmilitary service provided him with an excellent background to \nunderstand the intricacies of our military and, without question, \nhelped in his decision making ability for the betterment of America.\n  Additionally, I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Thurmond on \nthe Judiciary Committee, where he was a member from 1967 until his \nretirement. He served as chairman of this committee from 1981 to 1987 \nand served as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, \nFederalism, and Property Rights from January to June of 2001. With a \nbackground as a judge and lawyer, Senator Thurmond cherished his role \non this committee and always sought to ensure fairness on many issues, \nincluding that of appointing qualified judges to our Federal benches. I \nparticularly remember his strong support for me when I was an \nunsuccessful judicial nominee in 1986. Senator Thurmond was a \nsupporter, friend, and advisor.\n  To list the numerous honors and awards Senator Thurmond received \nwould take hours. However, I would like to point out some of the \naccolades I find truly incredible. In addition to his undergraduate \ndegree from Clemson College, he also holds 34 honorary degrees. In \n1994, he was inducted into the U.S. Army Rangers Hall of Fame. In 1997, \nhe was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public \nService. In 1998, he was awarded the Spirit of Hope award, named after \nBob Hope, by the United Service Organizations. Last year, he was \nawarded the Washington Times Foundation American Century Award.\n  His life covered a time of monumental change in the South. His \nmovement from a champion of racial segregation to one who promoted \nequal rights reflected the change that occurred throughout the region. \nHis personal actions helped lead others to reject the impermissible \npolicies of the past.\n  One of the great memories I have of spending time with Senator \nThurmond is the time he asked me to accompany him on a trip to China in \n1997, as I began my term as Senator. On this trip, we had some time to \nclimb the Great Wall of China. As is custom, an assistant is typically \nassigned to older individuals as they make their journey along the \nwall. Senator Thurmond declined any help and, at the time, was the \noldest person to ever climb the wall unassisted. The Senator's ability \nto put things in perspective is illustrated by the fact that when, upon \nreaching the top of the wall, stated ``This is a big wall. Let's go.''\n  As the leader of our delegation and President pro tempore of the \nSenate at age 97, he handled every occasion superbly. He was \nparticularly elegant when we met with Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin. I \nremember he concluded his remarks with the words ``China and the United \nStates are friends. We want to be better friends.''\n  It is almost impossible to travel anywhere in South Carolina and not \nfind Senator Strom Thurmond's name on a street, building, lake, \nhighway, or monument. All that he did for South Carolina and for our \nNation is a true testament to the caliber of man that he was. The lives \nhe touched and the people he has positively affected are numerous. I \nknow that his service to our Nation is sorely missed. You simply cannot \nput a value on the role he played as a true public servant. Senator \nThurmond will be missed by many, many individuals in Congress, in South \nCarolina, and in America. A true southerner, a true American, and a \ntrue patriot, Senator Strom Thurmond will forever be remembered as a \nman whose beliefs, ideals, and character remained unparalleled for an \nentire century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9299-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FRANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a trusted \nmember of my staff, Frank L. Brown. Frank is my legislative counsel for \njudicial nominations, minority outreach, immigration, civil rights and \nDepartment of Justice appropriations. He joined my staff on December \n15, 1998.\n  Frank became a part of my staff after receiving his B.A. from Johnson \nC. Smith University and his J.D. from the University of South Carolina \nLaw School. During his time with me, I have seen him grow into one of \nmy most trusted advisers. He is a bright, articulate, and loyal young \nman with quite the personality. He has represented my office and the \ncitizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a most professional and \ncaring manner. Unfortunately, the time has come for him to pursue other \ncareer objectives.\n  Frank is about to become the Assistant Director/Government Relations \nSpecialist of Boys and Girls Harbor Inc. located in Harlem, NY. This \norganization is a non-profit that provides various educational services \nfor over 7,000 low-income African-American and Hispanic-American \nchildren. I am confident that Frank will be a positive role model for \nthose young people he will work with in New York City. Even though I \nregret his departure, I know that he will continue to be a part of the \nArlen Specter staff family for many years to come. I wish him nothing \nbut success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9299-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9299-S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE M. ADELA EADS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished public servant and friend, M. Adela Eads, who passed away \non July 8 at the age of 83.\n  For years, Dell Eads was an indispensable member of the Connecticut \nGeneral Assembly. She served for 4 years in the State House of \nRepresentatives, and then for 20 years in the Senate, including 2 years \nas President Pro Tempore--the first woman ever to be elected to that \noffice for a full term.\n  If a casual observer walked onto the Senate floor in Hartford while \nDell Eads was there, he might have been surprised to learn that the \ndiminutive lady in the smart-looking suit and high heels was one of the \nchamber's most influential members. But for those 20 years, Dell Eads \nwas indeed an imposing figure in Connecticut. She served her \nconstituents, and her State, with commitment, distinction, and honor.\n  Dell Eads' life was devoted to working for the public good. Nowhere \nwas that more evident than in her commitment to Connecticut's children. \nBefore becoming a legislator, she chaired the Kent Board of Education \nfor 26 years. She later served on the Connecticut Board of Education as \nwell.\n  Many of her landmark legislative achievements were also devoted to \nhelping children. Dell Eads was a chief architect of legislation which \ncreated our State's Office of the Child Advocate. Today, thanks to her \nefforts,\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\nthere's an office in Connecticut's government where people fight for \nchildren who aren't able to fight for themselves.\n  She also was integral in the passage of the Education Enhancement \nAct, which raised the pay of Connecticut's public school teachers. Dell \nEads recognized that if we want our best and brightest to commit \nthemselves to teaching our children, we need to commit ourselves to \npaying them fairly.\n  Dell Eads always seemed to find the right balance of toughness and \ntact. In the political arena, where it's often hard to figure our \nexactly what people are saying, Dell Eads wasn't one to mince words. If \nshe had something on her mind, you were going to hear it. But when she \nspoke, she did so with the courtesy, class, and congeniality that \nearned her the admiration and friendship of her colleagues.\n  Though a Republican, she was respected by both Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. She was loyal to her party--yet Dell Eads would \nnever hesitate to reach across the aisle if there was work to be done.\n  No one could question Dell Eads' commitment to the people of \nConnecticut. After all, this was a woman who, at the age of 76, slipped \nand broke her collarbone--and reported to work at the State Capitol the \nvery next day. And she continued to serve in the State Senate until she \nretired three years ago at the age of 80.\n  Dell Eads was slight in stature, but she was great in spirit. Her \nservice was an inspiration not only to her colleagues in the \nConnecticut General Assembly, but to all the people of Connecticut. Our \nstate has truly lost a great citizen, and a remarkable person.\n  I offer my most heartfelt sympathies to Dell Eads' two sons, Manuel \nand Gregory Eads, to her brother Manuel Diaz, to her five grandsons, \nand her entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9300-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRYAN JONES\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Mr. Bryan \nJones of Yazoo City, MS, for his distinguished service as president of \nDelta Council.\n  Delta Council is an area development organization representing the 18 \nDelta and part-Delta counties of Northwest Mississippi. Delta council \nwas organized in 1935 to bring together the agricultural, business, and \nprofessional leadership of the region to confront the major problems \nfacing the region at that time. Since then, the organization has \nexpanded its role, under leaders like Bryan Jones, to include \neducational policy, water resource conversation, highway development, \nagricultural research, and flood control.\n  As president of Delta Council, Bryan Jones has served very \neffectively as a Delta leader during stressful economic times. He has \nused sound judgment and contributed to meaningful improvements in the \nquality of life in the region.\n  Bryan has led the Delta Council into new fields of endeavor such as \nhealth care and adult literacy. He has supported innovative land and \nwater conservation programs. He has been a strong advocate for water \nresource developments that include improved environmental restoration. \nAnd, he has become well known throughout the region and among members \nof the Mississippi Congressional Delegation as an effective \nspokesperson on behalf of the Delta's largest industry, agriculture.\n  After graduating from the University of Mississippi, Bryan Jones \ncould have been placed in a senior executive position in almost any \ncompany located anywhere in the United States. However, because of his \nlove for the Mississippi Delta, Bryan returned to the Delta region and \nhis community to build a $1 billion statewide banking system. In \naddition to serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the Delta \nDivision of BankPlus, Bryan operates a cotton, soybean, corn, and wheat \nfarm in Holmes and Humphreys Counties.\n  Bryan is a member of the Second Presbyterian Church in Yazoo City and \nhe and his wife, Sara, have three children. He is an enthusiastic \noutdoors man and a director of Delta Wildlife, which is a leading \nadvocate for the enhancement of the Mississippi Delta's rich wildlife \nresources.\n  I am pleased to congratulate Bryan Jones for his contributions to the \nMississippi Delta and the Nation, and I look forward to working with \nhim and other Delta Council leaders in the future who share our goal of \nimproving the quality of life for the people of this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9300-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9300-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9300-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2660.

A bill to establish a demonstration project under the \nmedicaid program to encourage the provision of community-based services \nto individuals with disabilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Smith and I and others \nintroduce the Money Follows the Person Act of 2003. This legislation is \nneeded to truly bring people with disabilities and older Americans into \nthe mainstream of society and provide equal opportunity for employment \nand community activities.\n  In order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with \nDisabilities and older Americans need access to community-based \nservices and supports. Unfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid \npolicy, the deck is stacked in favor of living in an institution. The \npurpose of our bill is to level the playing field and give eligible \nindividuals equal access to community-based services and supports.\n  Under our legislation, the Medicaid money paid by States and the \nFederal Government would follow the person with a disability from an \ninstitution into the community. This legislation provides 100 percent \nFederal reimbursement for the community services that an individual \nneeds during the first year that they move out of an institution or \nnursing home. By fully reimbursing the States, it gives them some \nadditional resources to allow people with disabilities and older \nAmericans to choose to live in the community.\n  President Bush first proposed the Money Follows the Person \nRebalancing Initiative in his FY '04 budget and indicated that the \ndemonstration project would provide full Federal reimbursement for \ncommunity services for the first year that an individual moves out of \nan institution or nursing home. As of this date, the administration has \nnot suggested legislative language to Congress or provided specific \ndetails regarding the implementation of the proposal. Working with the \ndisability community, we have drafted this legislation and look forward \nto working with the administration and our colleagues to enact the \nMoney Follows the Person concept into law.\n  We have a Medicaid system in this country that is spending 70 percent \nof its dollars on institutional care and only 30 percent on community \nservices. This bill is an important step toward switching those numbers \naround.\n  It is shameful that our Federal dollars are being spent to segregate \npeople, not integrate them. It has been 13 years since we passed the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, which said no to segregation. But our \nMedicaid program says yes and we need to change it. This is the next \ncivil rights battle. If we really meant what we said in the ADA in \n1990, we should enact this legislation.\n  The civil right of a person with a disability to be integrated into \nhis or her community should not depend on his or her address. In \nOlmstead v. LC, the Supreme Court recognized that needless \ninstitutionalization is a form of discrimination under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. We in Congress have a responsibility to help \nStates meet their obligations under Olmstead. An individual should not \nbe asked to move to another state in order to avoid needless segration. \nThey also should not be moved away from family and friends because \ntheir only choice is an institution.\n  For example, I know a young man in Iowa, Ken Kendall, who is \ncurrently living in a nursing home because he cannot access home and \ncommunity based care. Ken was injured in a serious accident at the age \nof 17 and sustained a spinal chord injury. With the help of community \nbased services covered by his insurance company, Ken could live in his \nhome in Iowa City. Remaining independent made a tremendous difference \nin his life.\n  However, several years ago, Ken lost his health insurance and after a \ntime, he went onto Medicaid. As a Medicaid recipient, Ken was only \ngiven the option to live in a nursing home in Waterloo almost 2 hours \nfrom his friends and family in Iowa City. In the nursing home, Ken has \nbecome isolated. He is very far from his family and friends and does \nnot have access to transportation. He had not been to a restaurant or a \nmovie since he moved to the nursing home over 2 years ago. His life has \ndramatically changed from when he lived in his own apartment and hired \nhis own attendants to care for him.\n  Recently Ken wrote to me that he finally went to dinner and a movie \nfor his 30th birthday. He said ``I was almost in tears. I felt like I \nhad a real life again.''\n  This bill would give people like Ken a real life and not just on \ntheir birthdays. People like Ken should not have to continue waiting to \nbe able to live in the community and enjoy the opportunities that other \nAmericans take for granted.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus reached in the \nADA that Americans with Disabilities should have equal opportunity to \ncontribute to our communities and participate in our society as full \ncitizens. That means no one has to sacrifice their full participation \nin society because they need help getting out of the house in the \nmorning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service.\n  This bill will open the door to full participation by people with \ndisabilities and older Americans in our neighborhoods, our communities, \nour workplaces, and our American Dream, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport us on this issue. I want to thank Senator Smith for his \ncommitment to improving access to home and community based services for \npeople with disabilities. I would also like to thank Senators Kennedy, \nLautenberg and Kerry for joining me in this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Money Follows the Person Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In his budget for fiscal year 2004, President George W. \n     Bush proposes a ``Money Follows the Person'' rebalancing \n     initiative under the medicaid program to help States \n     rebalance their long-term services support systems more \n     evenly between institutional and community-based services.\n       (2) The President, by proposing this initiative, and \n     Congress, recognize that States have not fully developed the \n     systems needed to create a more equitable balance between \n     institutional and community-based services spending under the \n     medicaid program.\n       (3) While a few States have been successful at achieving \n     this balance, nationally, approximately 70 percent of the \n     medicaid funding spent for long-term services is devoted to \n     nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the \n     mentally retarded. Only 30 percent of such funding is spent \n     for community-based services.\n       (4) As a result, there are often long waiting lists for \n     community-based services and supports.\n       (5) In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     Congress found that individuals with disabilities continue to \n     encounter various forms of discrimination, including \n     segregation, and that discrimination persists in such \n     critical areas as institutionalization.\n       (6) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. LC (527 \n     U.S. 581 (1999)) that needless institutionalization is \n     discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, noting that institutional placement of people who can \n     be served in the community ``perpetuates unwarranted \n     assumptions that persons so isolated are unworthy of \n     participating in community life.'' (Id. at 600). The Court \n     further found that ``confinement in an institution severely \n     diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \n     including family relations, social contacts, work options, \n     economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural \n     enrichment.'' (Id. at 601).\n       (7) Additional resources would be helpful for assisting \n     States in rebalancing their long-term services support system \n     and complying with the Olmstead decision.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Technology \nAdministration of the Department of Commerce for fiscal years 2004 \nthrough 2005; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nBrownback in introducing the Technology Administration Authorization \nAct of 2003. This legislation would authorize funding for the \nDepartment of Commerce's Technology Administration, which includes the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Office of \nTechnology Policy, and the Office of Space Commercialization.\n  As we begin the 21st Century, we must recognize that technology is a \nvital key to our world leadership. In addition, technology is the \nengine that drives our economy. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, there will be 2.5 million new jobs between 2000 and 2010, \njust in the field of information technology alone. According to the \nDepartment of Commerce, the contribution of the high-tech industry to \nthe U.S. economy has doubled over the past 10 years, from 4.2 percent \nto 8.3 percent of the gross domestic product. Information technology \nhas contributed more than one-third of the real U.S. economic growth, \nor approximately $170 billion.\n  The Technology Administration has broad responsibilities including \nsupporting the development of standards for first responders, promotion \nof space commercialization, publication of technical documents, and \ndevelopment of policies regarding technology transfer. The quality of \nwork conducted at NIST labs in Gaithersburg, MD, and Boulder, CO, is \nevident by the awarding of two Nobel Prizes to NIST researchers, Dr. \nBill Phillips and Dr. Eric Cornell, within the past seven years.\n  NIST plays an important role in developing measurement methods, \nstandards, and technologies that improve U.S. competitiveness in fields \nas diverse as chemical engineering, manufacturing, electronics, \nmetallurgy, and physics. In addition, NIST is charged with the mission \nin our Constitution of setting, ``the Standard of Weights and \nMeasures'' that are the foundation of our economy. NIST also runs the \nMalcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Program that recognizes \nperformance excellence and quality. Recently, NIST has been charged \nwith a number of new missions, including cyber security research and \ndevelopment, election reform, investigating the collapse of the World \nTrade Center, and developing metrology for the promising new field of \nnanotechnology. However, these new initiatives have diverted resources \nfrom NIST's traditional missions, and forced scientists to be laid off \ndue to reduced funding. Given NIST's recognized leadership as a ``world \nclass'' science institution, it is important that we ensure that it is \nadequately funded.\n  This legislation would authorize the Technology Administration from \nFiscal Years 2004 through 2008 to ensure a steady funding stream for \nthis agency's activities. The bill is based on the President's budget \nrequest for NIST's laboratory activities, and includes funding \nincreases of six percent per year to offset the deteriorating funding \nsituation.\n  The legislation also would authorize funding for the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership, (MEP), Program. As Secretary Evans recently \nstated, ``[m]anufacturing is a key pillar of our economy and we are \ncommitted to enhancing growth opportunities for our American \nmanufacturing companies.'' I commend the Secretary for his recognition \nof the need to energize the manufacturing sector to restore robust \ngrowth to our economy. With this recognition in mind, I urge the \nAdministration to be aware of the role that MEP can play in restoring \nthe health of this sector. MEP centers aid small and medium-sized \nmanufacturers by offering expertise, needs evaluation, training and \ninformation dissemination to help these companies deal with the \nchallenges of globalization and weak economic growth.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is \nimportant that we reauthorize these programs to ensure that they \ncontinue to carry out their critical role in our Nation's economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENHANCING REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT TO ENSURE NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY AND MAINTAIN THE UNITED STATES \n                   COMMITMENT TO REFUGEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has a longstanding tradition of \n     providing refugee assistance and relief through the \n     Department of State's migration and refugee assistance \n     account for refugees throughout the world who have been \n     subjected to religious and other forms of persecution.\n       (2) A strong refugee resettlement and assistance program is \n     a critical component of the United States' strong commitment \n     to freedom.\n       (3) The United States refugee admissions program has been \n     in decline for much of the last 5 years, resulting in a \n     chronic inability of the United States to meet the ceiling on \n     refugee admissions that has been set by the President each \n     year.\n       (4) Refugee applicants have always undergone rigorous \n     security screenings. The September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks on the United States have rightfully increased the \n     awareness of the need to ensure that all aliens seeking \n     admission to the United States would not endanger the United \n     States. In order to ensure that the refugee admissions \n     program remains available in a timely way to deserving and \n     qualified refugee applicants, all personnel involved in \n     screening such applicants should closely coordinate their \n     work in order to ensure both the timely and complete \n     screening of such applicants.\n       (5) Private voluntary agencies have and continue to provide \n     valuable information to State Department officials for \n     refugee processing, and along with Embassy personnel, can be \n     utilized to assist in the preliminary screening of refugees \n     so that State Department officials can focus to a greater \n     extent on security.\n       (6) In order to meet the ceiling set by the Administration, \n     which has been 70,000 refugees in recent years, a broader \n     cross-section of the world's 15,000,000 refugees could be \n     considered for resettlement in the United States if the \n     Department of State were to expand existing refugee \n     processing priority categories in a reasonable and \n     responsible manner. Expansion of refugee selection should \n     include the expanded use of both the existing category \n     reserved for refugees of special interest to the United \n     States as well as the existing categories reserved for family \n     reunification.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to provide \n     the Department of State with tools to enable it to carry out \n     its responsibilities with greater efficiency with respect to \n     the identification and processing of refugee applicants.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Annual Admission of \n     Refugees.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) efforts of the Department of State to admit 70,000 \n     refugees, as allocated through presidential determinations, \n     for fiscal year 2003 are strongly supported and recommended; \n     and\n       (2) the Administration should seek to admit at least 90,000 \n     refugees in fiscal year 2004 and at least 100,000 in fiscal \n     year 2005.\n       (d) Refugee Security Coordinator.--\n       (1) Establishment.--In order to further enhance overseas \n     security screening of the United States Refugee Resettlement \n     Program, there shall be within the Bureau of Population, \n     Refugees, and Migration, a Refugee Security Coordinator who \n     shall report to the Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Population, Refugees, and Migration.\n       (2) Responsibilities.--The Refugee Security Coordinator \n     referred to in paragraph (1) shall be responsible for--\n       (A) ensuring that applicants for admission to the United \n     States undergo a security review;\n       (B) ensuring that, to the greatest extent practicable, such \n     security reviews are completed within 45 days of the \n     submission of the information necessary to conduct such a \n     review;\n       (C) providing appropriate officials in the Department of \n     Justice and the Department of Homeland Security pertinent \n     information for conducting security reviews for applicants;

and\n       (5) expanded access is provided to broader categories of \n     refugees seeking admission to the United States, thus \n     reducing instances of relationship-based misrepresentation by \n     persons who art bona fide refugees but who resort to such \n     misrepresentation merely as a way to be interviewed for \n     refugee status.\n       (h) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to Congress that includes information concerning the \n     following:\n       (1) Efforts of the Refugee Security Coordinator in assuming \n     the responsibilities set forth in subsection (d) that \n     includes--\n       (A) a description of the process involved in conducting \n     security reviews for refugee applicants;\n       (B) a listing of the various agencies of the Federal \n     Government that are involved in conducting security reviews \n     for refugee applicants;\n       (C) a listing for each agency described in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B) of the number of personnel involved in \n     conducting security reviews for refugee applicants;\n       (D) a listing for each agency described in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B) of the amount of funding in the previous \n     fiscal year for conducting security reviews for refugee \n     applicants;\n       (E) the average amount of time that it takes to conduct \n     security reviews for refugee applicants;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Winning the Peace Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President George W. Bush has stated that the United \n     States security strategy takes into account the fact that \n     ``America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \n     are by failing ones''.\n       (2) Failed states can provide safe haven for a diverse \n     array of transnational threats, including terrorist networks, \n     militia and warlords, global organized crime, and narcotics \n     traffickers who threaten the security of the United States \n     and the allies of the United States.\n       (3) The inability of the authorities in a failed state to \n     provide basic services can create or contribute to \n     humanitarian emergencies.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States and the \n     international community to bring conflict and humanitarian \n     emergencies stemming from failed states to a lasting and \n     sustainable close.\n       (5) Since the end of the Cold War, United States military, \n     diplomatic, and humanitarian personnel have been engaged in \n     major post-conflict reconstruction efforts in such places as \n     Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, East Timor, and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (6) Assisting failed states in emerging from violent \n     conflict is a complex and long-term task, as demonstrated by \n     the experience that 50 percent of such states emerging from \n     conditions of violent conflict slip back into violence within \n     5 years.\n       (7) In 2003, the bipartisan Commission on Post-Conflict \n     Reconstruction created by the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies and the Association of the United \n     States Army, released a report explaining that ``United \n     States security and development agencies still reflect their \n     Cold War heritage. The kinds of complex crises and the \n     challenge of failed states encountered in recent years do not \n     line up with these outdated governmental mechanisms. If \n     regional stability is to be maintained, economic development \n     advanced, lives saved, and transnational threats reduced, the \n     United States and the international community must develop a \n     strategy and enhance capacity for pursuing post-conflict \n     reconstruction.''.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

Mr. LUGAR (for Ms. Murkowski (for herself and Ms. Landrieu)) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by Mr. Lugar to the bill \nS. 925, to authorize appropriations for the Department of State and \ninternational broadcasting activities for fiscal year 2004 and for the \nPeace Corps for fiscal years 2004 through 2007, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OIL \n                   RESERVE FUND FOR IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Coalition forces have liberated the Iraqi people from \n     the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n       (2) The vast mineral resources, including oil, of Iraq \n     could contribute to the present and future generations of \n     Iraqis.\n       (3) Iraq has one of the largest known petroleum reserves in \n     the world, and those reserves could be used to foster \n     economic development and democratization in Iraq.\n       (4) Very little of the potential of the oil sector in Iraq \n     has actually been harnessed.\n       (5) Revenue estimates Iraqi oil exports indicate that \n     reconstruction costs will greatly exceed revenues in the near \n     term, however, a recapitalized Iraqi oil sector will \n     eventually serve as a vital source of national wealth.\n       (6) Under Saddam Hussein's regime, the proceeds from those \n     resources were used to build palaces, enrich the members of \n     the Republican Guard, oppress the Iraqi people, and stifle \n     their desires for a democratic government.\n       (7) As many of the nations of the Persian Gulf demonstrate, \n     possession of large petroleum reserves alone does not ensure \n     economic development or democratization.\n       (8) The development of a vibrant democracy requires a \n     strong middle class, a free press, and free and fair \n     elections.\n       (9) The future Government of Iraq will face a variety of \n     reconstruction challenges ranging from restoring \n     infrastructure to providing basic human services like \n     education and healthcare.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Energy should develop a proposal for \n     the establishment of an oil reserve fund for Iraq and submit \n     the proposal to appropriate representatives of the Iraqi \n     people, and the Coalition Provisional Authority for \n     consideration;\n       (2) the proposal should take proper account of the need of \n     Iraq for funding of reconstruction, meeting its international \n     financial obligations, and providing essential human services \n     such as education and health care;\n       (3) the fund could be called the Iraqi Freedom Fund and \n     could be based on models such as the Alaska Permanent Fund, \n     as well as other appropriate models; which are managed on a \n     for-profit basis to produce additional revenues; and allow a \n     portion of the annual earnings of the fund to be distributed\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\n     to the Iraqi people as direct payments, or through programs \n     designed to promote the establishment of a permanent middle \n     class, with the remainder of the fund to be capitalized to \n     allow the fund to grow for future generations; and\n       (4) the goal of the fund would be to encourage maximum \n     participation by the people of Iraq in the operation of their \n     government, to promote the proper use of the natural \n     resources of Iraq, and to ensure that the Iraqi people \n     benefit from the development of the natural resources of \n     Iraq.\n       (5) Control and decision making over Iraq's natural \n     resources properly belongs to the people of Iraq. This fund \n     should promote the twin policy goals of a more democratic \n     Iraq, and a more equal distribution of Iraq's wealth to all \n     of her citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/11/senate-section/article/S9310-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOTICE: REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 2003 second quarter mass mailings is Friday, July \n25, 2003.
