Mr. President, we spend a lot of time here in the \nCapitol talking about the abstract effects of policy. But when we go \nhome, we see firsthand the challenges and pain so many of our \nconstituents are facing.\n  I spent the last week in South Dakota. We have a higher percentage of \nour National Guard and Reserve units activated than almost any other \nState. South Dakotans are united in our support for all the men and \nwomen who are risking their lives to defend our freedom. We are proud \nthat America looks out for other nations.\n  But we need to look out for people here at home, too. We need \nleadership that fights for American workers and families, not against \nthem. That is what I heard, over and over again, from people in South \nDakota.\n  Last Tuesday, I held a town hall meeting in Spearfish, in the Black \nHills. Among the people who came were a couple I have known for years.\n  Donna Smith is a newspaper reporter for the Black Hills Pioneer. She \nis one of the best journalists in my State; I have tremendous respect \nfor her skill and fairness.\n  Over the years, I have seen Donna at many meetings. But this time was \ndifferent. This time she was there not as a reporter but as an American \nwho needs help.\n  Donna and Larry Smith have been married for 29 years. They have six \nchildren.\n  Larry Smith is tall and athletic. He takes good care of his health. \nUnfortunately, he inherited some bad genes; his arteries clog. He had \nhis first heart bypass surgery when he was 47 years old and his second \none a year later.\n  Everything was fine for almost 11 years. Then, about a year ago, \nLarry started feeling constant, debilitating pain in his legs and hips.\n  Larry works at a casino in the Black Hills. He was a machinist all \nhis working life, but he switched to cashier because he couldn't take \nthe walking involved in his old job; it hurt too much.\n  Last February, he had a stent placed in his heart. His doctors \ndetermined that the pain was being caused by a build-up of plaque in \nLarry's arteries. They said the only place he could find a vascular \nsurgeon skilled enough to clear the blockages was at the Mayo Clinic in \nRochester, MN.\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\n  Larry had that surgery. He was at the Mayo Clinic nearly a month. \nDonna was with him the whole time. Their insurance company paid most of \nthe hospital bills.\n  But there were lots of out-of-pocket costs insurance didn't cover:\n  The lost income from the time both Larry and Donna had to take off \nfrom their jobs; the cost of getting to and from the Mayo Clinic; the \ncost of Donna's motel; the $2,000 annual deductible the Smiths had to \npay before their insurance coverage kicked in; the $200 they spend \nevery month on the prescription drugs Larry takes to control his blood \npressure and other health conditions.\n  In addition, Donna is a diabetic and a cancer survivor. They spend \nanother $150 a month on her prescriptions.\n  Then there are the health insurance premiums: $270 a month for Larry \nand $180 a month for Donna.\n  Add it all up and, suddenly, a couple who had worked hard all their \nlives and put six children through college is drowning in a sea of \nmedical debt--$18,000 in debt.\n  Larry and Donna Smith have done everything they can to honor their \ndebts. They sold their home. They now live in a smaller, rented house. \nThey have borrowed money from friends.\n  They have even borrowed money from their children. Talking about that \nis one of the few times Donna cries. ``How demeaning,'' she says, ``to \nhave to ask your children for money. We're at a time in our lives when \nwe ought to be showering our grandchildren with gifts, but we can't. We \ncan't even pay our bills.''\n  Creditors started threatening lawsuits. Bill collectors called at \nhome and work. They garnished Donna's wages.\n  In January--less than a year after Larry's surgery at Mayo--the pain \nin his legs came back. It's worse than ever now. It hurts him to lift \nthe bags of coins at the casino. It hurts him just to walk.\n  But he still works five nights a week; he can't afford to take time \noff.\n  Two weeks ago, Donna decided there was nothing else they could do, no \none else they could borrow money from. So they filed for bankruptcy.\n  On April 6, Larry Smith is scheduled to go back to the Mayo Clinic to \nsee if there is anything else that can be done. Donna says they have no \nchoice. Without medical help, Larry is at increased risk of a heart \nattack or stroke or amputation.\n  The people at Mayo have generously offered to ``work with'' the \nSmiths to meet the $2,000 deductible.\n  Donna doesn't know where she'll stay this time. She says maybe she'll \nsleep in the car.\n  There's something else Donna Smith doesn't know. As she puts it, ``I \ndon't know how to give up. This is my husband. This is the man I've \nspent my whole life with, the man who fathered my children, and who \nworked hard all his life to support us.\n  She said, ``We know that there are hundreds of thousands of other \npeople going through this, too. You pay for health insurance and you \nalways believe that everything will be covered, but it is not. The \nsafety net is not there and suddenly you have nothing.\n  ``If people are just supposed to give up, how do you do that?'' Donna \nasks. ``How do you just give up on the life of someone you love?''\n  Larry Smith and I talked for quite a while last week. I found out \nlater that he spent 48 hours thinking about exactly what he would say \nso that I would understand how fragile economic security has become for \nso many middle-class families. All over this country, people who have \ndone everything right--people who have worked for decades, bought their \nown homes, put their children through college, saved for their \nretirements--are finding they are just one medical emergency, one pink \nslip, one bad break away from serious economic trouble. The social and \neconomic safety net that used to protect families is being shredded. \nHealth care costs that used to be manageable are bankrupting families \nand businesses.\n\n  Last Thursday, I had another townhall meeting in Aberdeen, my \nhometown. That afternoon I got a fax from a general manager of a \nfarmers' cooperative grain elevator in the nearby town of Florence. His \nname is Steve Schlenner. He said 3 years ago the health care premiums \nfor the co-op's employees went up 38 percent. The next year they went \nup another 28 percent. Last year they increased another 24 percent. \nThis year they had to lay off one of their workers so they could afford \nhealth insurance for the other workers.\n  He asks:\n\n       How are we ever going to get people back to work if the \n     insurance companies are taking more and more of our profits \n     every year? At this rate, only the rich will be able to \n     afford insurance in the future. . . . The average hard-\n     working, tax-paying, middle-class American needs to be put on \n     the endangered species list if we sit back and do not address \n     these insurance issues and high unemployment [rates].\n\n  He ends his fax by saying:\n\n       Thank you for taking my comments seriously. They represent \n     the thoughts and feelings of quite a few people in this area.\n\n  All of us, Democrats and Republicans, need to take the comments of \npeople like Donna and Larry Smith and Steve Schlenner seriously. Donna \nand Larry are luckier than many Americans. They have insurance. More \nthan 43 million Americans have no health insurance. We must work \ntogether to make health insurance affordable again and health care \naccessible to all Americans.\n  We need to fix what is wrong with the new Medicare prescription drug \nprogram. At a minimum, we need to end the prohibition that prevents the \nGovernment from negotiating better prices for seniors. We need to allow \nthe safe reimportation of drugs from Canada and other countries where \nthey are less expensive. We need new policies that create good jobs in \nAmerica.\n  There are 8.2 million Americans out of work. Two million have been \nout of work for the last 6 months or longer. It is not their fault they \ncannot find jobs. Last month, the economy created only 21,000 new \njobs--all of them Government jobs, none in the private sector. Mr. \nPresident, 21,000 jobs; that is one new job for every 389 unemployed \nworkers.\n  The administration and some of our Republican colleagues say the \neconomy is getting stronger. I guess I would ask, whose economy? Not \nthe 8.2 million Americans who want to work but cannot find jobs; not \nthe 43 million Americans without health insurance; not the millions of \nAmericans who are working harder than ever and taking on more debt than \never.\n  We need trade and tax policies that reward companies for creating \njobs in America--not for shipping American jobs overseas. We need to \nhelp workers who are hurt by outsourcing, and make sure they get access \nto health care and job training while they get back on their feet.\n\n  Unless we act to prevent it, 9 days from today, on March 31, the \nGovernment will stop paying unemployment insurance benefits to workers \nwho have already exhausted their State benefits. We cannot let that \nhappen. We need to extend Federal unemployment insurance benefits now.\n  Also, at the end of this month, the Federal Government and the \nDepartment of Labor will issue new regulations effectively ending \novertime pay for 8 million American workers. The Senate voted on a \nbipartisan basis to reject that change when the White House proposed \nit, but the House rejected it. Somehow, behind closed doors, someone \nslipped it into a conference report that had to pass or most of the \nFederal Government would have been shut down.\n  That is wrong. The Senate should reject this bad idea and the \nunderhanded way it was handled. We should vote to protect the 40-hour \nworkweek and overtime pay. Working families cannot afford a cut in pay.\n  A week ago today, Lead-Deadwood High School held its annual \nGovernment Day. Students at the school spent the day shadowing local \ngovernment officials, observing firsthand how democracy in America \nworks. In a story about the program, on the front page of the Black \nHills Pioneer, the students talked about how interesting it was to see \nGovernment work for people. That story was written by Donna Smith. \nDespite all of their struggles, she and her husband still believe \nGovernment can be a force for good. They, and millions of other \nAmericans, are looking to us for help. As we begin this next work \nperiod, let's vow not to disappoint them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2833-8", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2833-S2835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a hearing \nwe are going to have tomorrow in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the \nsubject of marriage. I know the last thing I thought I would be doing, \ncoming from Texas to Washington, DC, would be talking about traditional \nmarriage, but such are the times we live in.\n  Earlier this month I chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on the Constitution regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision last summer in Lawrence v. Texas, as well as the Goodridge \ndecision from the Massachusetts Supreme Court that resulted from it, \nand the subsequent explosion of the marriage controversy across \nAmerica. I thought we had a very thought-provoking discussion, a \nbipartisan discussion, and one that will continue at our hearing \ntomorrow where proposed constitutional language is the subject.\n  At the hearing earlier this month I was moved by the sentiments of \nPastor Daniel de Leon of the Templo Calvario Church in California and \nRev. Richard Richardson of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in \nBoston, who we were honored to have in attendance.\n  Both testified they would rather be at home than having to defend \ntraditional marriage here in Washington. But it is because of the work \nthey do in their own communities, because they see the results of the \ndecline of marriage in their communities every day, that they believe \ntraditional marriage is so important and worth defending.\n  This is a discussion we will continue to have in the coming months. I \nbelieve it is vital that we have a national discussion on the \nimportance of this institution, and a discussion based upon the facts.\n  In recent months, a lot of people have spent time talking about the \nbenefits of marriage for adults. They have talked about hospital \nvisiting rights and inheritance problems, even though many of these \nissues can be solved simply and quickly by statute or arrangements that \ncan be achieved by simply signing a few simple documents.\n  This discussion, in terms of the benefits to adults, has included \ndiscussion of Government benefits, even though with these benefits come \nburdens, and the actual financial ramifications of these benefits are a \nmatter for future debate.\n  Today it is time to turn the debate to what I believe is an even more \nimportant issue--that is, the benefits of marriage to children.\n  It is easy for some people to step back and say: The same-sex \nmarriage controversy doesn't affect me. But the facts, demonstrated by \nexperiments in other countries, show us otherwise. The facts show us \nthis issue affects everyone, but especially children. None of us can \npretend to ignore this issue, and none of us can afford to be neutral \non this subject.\n  Scandinavia has treated same-sex households as marriage for more than \na decade. This practice was instituted in Denmark in 1989, in Norway in \n1993, and in Sweden in 1994. The direct reaction was relatively small. \nVery few people were actually interested in being part of this new \narrangement, and to this day the number of participating individuals \nand households remains low.\n  The greatest effect was not on those who had sought the new \ninstitution but, in fact, on society at large. Sad to say, there has \nbeen an enormous rise in family dissolution and out-of-wedlock \nchildbirths in these countries since they embraced the institution of \nsame-sex marriage.\n  Today, about 15 years after Denmark created this new institution, a \nmajority of children in Scandinavia are born out of wedlock, including \nmore than 50 percent of children in Norway and 55 percent of children \nin Sweden. In Denmark, a full 60 percent of first-born children have \nunmarried parents. In Scandinavia as a whole, traditional marriage is \nnow an institution entirely socially separated from the idea of \nchildbearing or child-rearing. It is regarded as an incidental union, \nnot an important one.\n\n  Respected British demographer Kathleen Kiernan drew on the \nScandinavian case to form a four-stage model by which to gauge a \ncountry's movements towards Swedish levels of out-of-wedlock \nchildbirth.\n  At stage one, the vast majority of the population produces children \nwithin marriage, such as in Italy. In the second stage, cohabitation is \ntolerated as a testing period before marriage and is generally a \nchildless phase such as we currently have in America. In stage three, \ncohabitation becomes increasingly acceptable and parenting is no longer \nautomatically associated with marriage. While Norway was once at this \nstage, recent demographic and legal changes have pushed it further into \nstage four, along with Sweden and Denmark. In this fourth stage, \nmarriage and cohabitation become practically indistinguishable, with \nmany children--even most children--born and raised outside of \ntraditional marriage. According to Kiernan, once a country has reached \nthis stage, return to an earlier phase is highly unlikely.\n  As you can see, the dilution of marriage is passed on to children, to \nthe next generation, and the devaluation continues. And in America, the \nresults could be even more significant than in Scandinavia; after all, \nwe are already facing the problem of too many single-parent households, \nparticularly in inner-city communities.\n  When the ideal of traditional marriage is removed, when cohabitation \nand marriage are equally regarded, and when childbearing is no longer \nsomething that ought to ideally come within the context of traditional \nmarriage, I fear the problem of single-parent households will only \nworsen.\n  While many single parents do a very good job day in and day out \nraising children against long odds, no one considers it the best \narrangement for raising children--with good reason. Indeed, we have a \nwealth of social science research from hundreds of sources over the \ncourse of decades which consistently reflects both the positive \nramifications for children of a stable traditional marriage, and the \nnegative effects of family breakup.\n  Marriage provides the basis for the family, which remains the \nstrongest and most important social unit. Countless statistics and \nresearch attest to this fact. It is not ideal to raise children outside \nof marriage. While everyone is free to choose his or her own path, no \none wishes divorce on children but, rather, a happy and stable home.\n  In America, we have made the decision that we ought to particularly \nencourage and support those who marry and have children. This is not a \npartisan issue. As one of the most distinguished Democratic Members of \nthis body, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, observed more than a decade \nago, we must stop ``the breakup of family inevitably'' as best we can:\n\n       [T]he principal social objective of the American national \n     government at every level . . . should be to see that \n     children are born into intact families and that they remain \n     so.\n\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n\n  We don't raise our neighbor's children as our own, but we do help all \nthe children in our community every time we affirm and reinforce \nmarriage--through our speech, through our action, through our culture, \nand through our wallets. It is a position reinforced through our laws \nand our practices, and I believe it is a good one. Government cannot be \nneutral, should not be neutral, nor should it pretend it is possible to \nbe neutral when it comes to children and families.\n  Most Americans take for granted that traditional marriage as we know \nit today will always exist. But that is sadly proving to be a mistake. \nWe see in Scandinavia why that assumption is a mistake.\n  Across this country today, renegade judges and some local officials \nare attempting to radically redefine this traditional institution. \nLawsuits seeking to dismantle traditional marriage have already been \nfiled in Federal court and State courts in Massachusetts, New York, \nNebraska, Utah, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Georgia, West Virginia, \nArizona, Alaska, Hawaii, New Jersey, Connecticut, Oregon, Washington, \nCalifornia, and Vermont, as well as my home State of Texas. According \nto the New York Times, we can expect lawsuits in 46 States by residents \nwho have traveled to San Francisco in recent weeks to receive a \nmarriage license, then return and claim the validity of that marriage \nunder the laws of their home State.\n  Louis Brandeis famously described the States as ``laboratories for \ndemocracy.'' But he was, of course, referring to representative \ngovernment in the States and not to the courts. Given how this \nlitigation has spread, it appears that judicial activists bent on \nexperimenting with the institution of marriage will have every possible \nopportunity to do so.\n  The American people are not persuaded that this radical redefinition \nof marriage is needed or that it is a good thing. When given the \nopportunity in the voting booth, they have always supported traditional \nmarriage clearly and forthrightly.\n  While The New York Times recently described the law on this subject \nin California as ``murky,'' the California family code clearly defines \ntraditional marriage in an initiative enacted by voters themselves 4 \nyears ago by 61-percent majority.\n  Rather than believing this discussion is altogether a bad thing, I \nbelieve there is a lot of good to be had out of a national discussion \non the issue and importance of traditional marriage, supporting family \nlife as providing the best hope for raising children. Those of us on \nthe side of traditional marriage, though, must not flinch in the face \nof those who would try to characterize our efforts as some hateful or \nhurtful position. Indeed, I believe advocates of traditional marriage \nmust not back down. We must not allow those who will try to paint our \nmotivations as discriminatory because, in fact, they are not.\n  What we are seeking to preserve is the fundamental bedrock of our \nsociety, the wellspring of families, and an institution that is in the \nbest interest of children. That is what we are for. Those of us who \nhave the honor of serving in this body and in government have a duty to \nact to protect this positive social good and not ignore this issue \nuntil it is too late.\n  Some activists believe traditional marriage itself is about \ndiscrimination, that all traditional marriage laws are unconstitutional \nand must, therefore, be abolished by the courts. Indeed, that is what \nthe court in Massachusetts said. These activists found friends in four \njustices in Massachusetts who were legislating from the bench and who \ncontended that traditional marriage is ``rooted in persistent \nprejudices'' and represents ``invidious discrimination.'' Those are not \nmy words. Those are the words of the four justices who struck down \ntraditional marriage laws in Massachusetts.\n  Indeed, these justices even claim that traditional marriage is not in \nthe best interest of children. They accuse others of wanting to write \ndiscrimination into the Constitution. Yet they are the ones writing the \nAmerican people out of our constitutional democracy.\n  In the face of similar arguments, Hawaiians and Alaskans a number of \nyears ago took preemptive action when they were faced with State \nconstitutional challenges to their traditional marriage laws. Citizens \nof Nebraska, Nevada, and other States have also taken preemptive action \nunder their State constitutions before suits were even filed.\n  Interestingly, in the hearing we had just a couple weeks ago, we \nheard from Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning, who said that while \nhis state has a Constitutional Defense of Marriage Amendment, even that \namendment has now been challenged in Federal Court by the American \nCivil Liberties Union, who claim that this state constitutional \nprovision itself violates the Federal Constitution.\n  The threat to traditional marriage is now a Federal threat, and a \nFederal constitutional amendment is the only way to preserve \ntraditional marriage laws nationwide before it is too late.\n  America needs stable marriages and stable families. The institution \nof marriage is just too important to leave to chance.\n  Unless and until the American people are persuaded otherwise, we have \na duty, as their representatives, to defend the laws they passed and to \nnot let those who would take the law into their own hands reshape \nsociety according to their whim.\n  We can be confident in the fact a constitutional amendment is the \nmost representative process we have in American law--requiring, as it \ndoes, two-thirds of the Congress to pass a constitutional resolution \nand three-quarters of the States to ratify it. It is the most \ndemocratic form of lawmaking we have in this country, bar none.\n  The burden of proof is on those who seek to experiment with \ntraditional marriage, an institution that has sustained society for \ncountless generations. The experimenters must present their case to us \nthat the radical new social unit they propose is good for the \ncommunity, good for families and, most important of all, good for \nchildren. Thus far, the lab for this experiment has already been run in \nScandinavia, and it has produced nothing but disastrous results.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2836-S2839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOARING GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, gasoline prices are soaring to the highest \nlevels ever and once again the response of the Federal Government is to \ndo nothing. I have come to the floor today because I believe the \ngasoline consumer is about to be hit by a perfect storm, a combination \nof refinery cutbacks that boost profits, the fact that oil is being \nmoved into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with no plan to protect the \nconsumer from resulting shortages, and the prospect of even higher OPEC \nprices when OPEC cuts production possibly in June, just at the start of \nthe high travel season. I want to discuss this today because inaction \nin the face of spiraling gas prices is the worst possible response \nCongress and the administration could have at this time.\n  Higher oil and gasoline prices act like attacks on our consumers, \ncausing them to defer spending in order to pay for gasoline. Right now, \nconsumer spending is the principal ingredient driving our economy. If \nconsumer spending declines, economic recovery is going to be delayed \nand there is the chance of the economy sliding further into a \nrecession.\n  I know gasoline prices are already as high as they have ever been, \nand the perfect storm I see coming in the days ahead is going to soak \nconsumers for even more money at the pump with the prices already \nstaggering.\n  According to the American Automobile Association, the national \naverage price of gasoline is $1.72 per gallon. That is just 2 cents \nshort of the alltime high set last August and, of course, it is not \neven the peak driving season. California prices are consistently way \nover $2 per gallon. The prices in my State are consistently in the \nballpark of $1.80. I will outline this afternoon\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nwhy I believe it is likely to get even worse.\n  One major oil company, Shell, has announced it is deliberately \nshutting a 70,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Bakersfield, CA. This \nrefinery is critical to the entire West Coast market. The fact is, when \nShell permanently constricts gasoline supplies and drives up prices \nalong the West Coast, our area, which already has staggeringly high \nunemployment, is going to be hit very hard.\n  Earlier this month, at a Senate Energy Committee hearing, I asked the \nAdministrator of the Energy Information Administration whether the \nclosing of Shell's Bakersfield refinery could boost West Coast prices \neven higher. That day he agreed that could be the result of that \nrefinery shutting down. Yet, in the face of these kinds of problems, \nthe response of the Federal Government is simply to sit on the \nsidelines.\n  Shell's announcement of its decision to close the Bakersfield \nrefinery claimed in a statement that there is simply not enough crude \nsupply to ensure the viability of the refinery in the long term. Recent \nnews articles have reported that both Chevron/Texaco and State of \nCalifornia officials estimate that in that valley where the Bakersfield \nrefinery is located, there is a 20- to 25-year supply of crude oil \nremaining. In fact, Bakersfield, CA, reported on January 8 of this year \nthat Chevron/Texaco plans on drilling more than 800,000 new wells in \nthe valley, which is 300 more new wells than last year. The fact that \nTexaco, Shell's former partner in the Bakersfield refinery, is \nincreasing drilling in the area calls into question this claim by Shell \nthat a lack of available oil supply is the real reason for closing the \nBakersfield refinery.\n\n  Shell also claimed that its decision was not made to drive up \nprofits, but the company admitted to the Wall Street Journal that there \nwill be an impact on the market. Of course, the impact is going to be \nto drive up prices even higher. The question for the Senate, and why it \nis so important for us to act now, is, How much are these prices going \nto go up and when is the Senate going to finally stand with those who \nhave to make these gasoline purchases?\n  In 2001, I revealed internal oil company documents that showed major \noil companies pursued efforts to curtail refinery capacity as a \nstrategy for stifling competition and boosting their profits. These \ndocuments raised significant questions about whether American oil \ncompanies are trying to pull off a financial triple play: Boosting \nprofits by reducing refinery capacity, tagging consumers with higher \npump prices, and then going out and arguing for environmental rollbacks \nand additional financial incentives.\n  I say, and I want to use this to make clear why I think it is \nimportant the Senate should act, that I believe these practices I \ndescribed in 2001 are still ongoing today as gasoline prices rise even \nhigher and consumers suffer even more. In memos detailed in a report I \nissued then, oil companies articulated a desire to reduce oil and gas \nsupply.\n  One document from Texaco reads:\n\n       Significant events need to occur to assist in reducing \n     supplies and/or increasing the demand for gasoline in order \n     to increase prices and grow profit margins. Oil company \n     competitors also discussed--\n\n  Discussed with each other, Mr. President--\n\n     mutual opportunities to control oil and gas supply, thus \n     keeping markets tight.\n\n  In one case, they were trying specifically to prevent the restart of \na closed refinery in southern California. One company document revealed \nif the refinery in question, Powerine, was restarted, the additional \ngasoline supply on the market could bring down gas prices and refinery \nprices by 2 cents to 3 cents per gallon and it called for a ``full \ncourt press'' to keep the refinery down. The Powerine refinery's \ncapacity was 20,000 barrels per day. The Bakersfield company Shell \nwants to shut down has a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day. If oil \ncompanies in the mid-1990s thought a much smaller shutdown would raise \nthe price of gas by 2 cents to 3 cents, you can't tell me the shutdown \nof a refinery with 3\\1/2\\ times the capacity will not have an even \nlarger impact on prices at the pump.\n  What makes Shell's decision to close its Bakersfield refinery \nespecially curious is it seems the company has done virtually nothing \nproactively to find a buyer. But, to date, in spite of my requests and \nthe requests of others, the Federal Trade Commission has made no effort \nto stop or even slow plans for Shell's refinery closure. The Federal \nTrade Commission has been arguing they can only prosecute if they find \nout-and-out blatant collusion, setting out a standard that is virtually \nimpossible to prove against these very savvy oil interests. But in this \ncase the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to act because the \nAgency allowed two megamergers to go through that directly affect the \nrefinery Shell now plans to shut down. The Federal Trade Commission had \na chance to act when it allowed Shell to acquire full ownership of the \nBakersfield refinery in 2001 from a Shell-Texaco partnership.\n  The Federal Trade Commission had another chance to act when it \nallowed Shell to acquire Pennzoil-Quaker State in 2002. Then last \nNovember, when Shell announced it was closing the Bakersfield refinery, \nthe Federal Trade Commission had a third chance to act, using its \ncontinuing authority to reexamine these earlier mergers.\n  I say it is time to get the Federal Trade Commission off the \nsidelines and onto the side of the consumer who is getting shellacked \nat gasoline pumps all across America. Today I am calling on the Federal \nTrade Commission to exercise its continuing authority over these past \nmergers and to either block the shutdown of Shell's Bakersfield \nrefinery or to otherwise keep refineries in that area viable. That set \nof decisions will affect the entire west coast gasoline market. At a \ntime when our economy is being hit so hard, it is absolutely critical \nto the public interest.\n  The Energy Department ought to be doing more to address the problem \nof high gasoline prices, but at a minimum the Energy Department should \nnot be making the problem worse. When Secretary Abraham was asked \nrecently about the problem of rising gasoline prices, he told reporters \nhe was extremely concerned but did not specify the Department would do \nanything. One thing that could be done by the Department that would \nhelp address the problem is the Energy Department could stop making the \ncurrent supply situation worse by taking oil from the tight U.S. market \nto fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve without any protections for the \nconsumer.\n  On February 12, as crude and gasoline prices were spiking up, the \nBush administration awarded five new long-term contracts to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. These new contracts will run from April \nthrough the summer, the very time period where prices typically shoot \nupward. If the Bush administration were concerned about high gasoline \nprices, the Energy Department could have either delayed awarding these \nlong-term contracts or arranged to defer the delivery of oil to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, as was done last winter, to minimize the \nimpact on the market and on the consumer. But now the administration is \ntaking oil off the market and moving it into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve with no concrete plan to protect consumers from the higher \nprices this action will cause.\n\n  Earlier this month, Guy Caruso of the Energy Information Agency told \nme OPEC would be making up the difference in supply for oil that is \nbeing moved into America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So you have a \nsituation where the administration, through the Energy Information \nAgency, is telling people to not really sweat these OPEC decisions. But \nnow OPEC is telling us they are going to cut production by 1 million \nbarrels a day. This morning we hear they might hold off until June \ninstead of making cuts in April. But even if they do that, the OPEC \nproduction cuts would come at the beginning of the summer travel \nseason. So certainly OPEC is engaged in some doubletalk. For some time \nthey have not kept their promise to hold oil prices within their own \ntarget price range. In fact, some members of OPEC just want the price \nrange increased.\n  Some in OPEC say they are concerned prices are too high. Yet this \ncartel is taking oil off the market. Others are saying they see a glut \nof oil on the market, justifying the production cut. These are mixed \nsignals, but the message for our consumers is clear: OPEC is certainly \ngoing to do what is\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nbest for OPEC, not what is best for the American consumer.\n  My bottom line is the Federal Government certainly is challenged, in \nterms of stopping OPEC from cutting production. But certainly the \nFederal Government can take steps and take steps immediately to make \nsure there is competition in our gasoline markets so consumers are not \ngetting ripped off at the pump.\n  Today I am calling for Congress to take action on a specific, \nconcrete package of procompetition initiatives to help consumers at the \nNation's gas pumps. First, Congress needs to direct the Government \nregulators to act to eliminate anticompetitive practices that currently \nsiphon competition out of gasoline markets. Scores of communities, \nincluding those in my home State, have few if any choices for the \nconsumer. Nationwide, the gasoline markets in Oregon and in at least 27 \nother States are now considered to be tight oligopolies, with 4 \ncompanies controlling more than 60 percent of the gas supply. In \nCalifornia, where Shell's Bakersfield refinery is located, 4 oil \ncompanies control 70 percent of the market. In these tightly \nconcentrated markets, numerous studies have found oil company practices \nhave driven independent wholesalers and dealers out of the market. One \npractice they employ, called redlining, limits where independent \ndistributors can sell gas. As a result, independent stations have to \nbuy their gas directly from the oil company, usually at a higher price \nthan the company's own brand-name stations are paying. With these \nhigher costs the independent stations can't compete.\n  Last year I sponsored legislation, S. 1732, that would give the \nFederal Trade Commission additional tools to promote competition in \nthese areas that are essentially small monopolies. Under my bill, in \nthese very highly concentrated markets you would have consumer watch \nzones. In these zones there would be greater monitoring of \nanticompetitive practices by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal \nTrade Commission would also be empowered to issue cease-and-desist \norders to prevent the companies from gouging the consumer, and Congress \nwould stipulate certain anticompetitive practices like redlining and \nzone pricing are, per se, anticompetitive and oil companies engaging in \nthese anticompetitive practices that manipulate supply or limit \ncompetition would have the burden of proof to show these \nanticompetitive practices are not harming consumers.\n  There is a vehicle right now. Right today there is a vehicle, S. \n1737, Congress could use to address the problem of skyrocketing \ngasoline prices, because the companies admit the market is not going to \nsolve the problem on its own.\n  Last August, a report by the RAND Corporation revealed even oil \nindustry officials are predicting more price volatility in the future. \nThis means consumers can expect more frequent and larger price spikes \nin the next few years.\n  Last November, the Energy Information Agency also issued a report on \nthe causes of last summer's record high gas prices. The Energy \nInformation Agency found, ``There is continuing vulnerability to future \ngasoline price hikes.'' The industry and the Bush administration both \nagree gasoline price spikes are going to be a continuing and \nsignificant problem. But neither, as of today, is willing to step in \nand work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to do anything about \nthe problem. I am here to say the Congress needs to act now. This is \nlegislation to act now before gasoline shoots up to $3 per gallon, as \nsome oil industry analysts are predicting.\n  The reasons Congress ought to act are twofold. Aside from the obvious \ncost to the consumer at the pump, there are hidden costs to the price \nmanipulation. There is a huge economic impact that will only worsen as \nprices rise. When gasoline costs more, the costs for our businesses in \nthe transportation area go up. Our businesses see their profits go \ndown. So we have one of two things--either the prices of the goods they \nsell to consumers have to go up or the number of people they employ is \ngoing to plummet. Higher gasoline prices either means bigger costs for \nconsumer goods or fewer jobs in our economy. And certainly in our home \nState, we cannot afford to see that. This isn't high economic theory. \nThis is basic math.\n  Just this month, the New York Times quoted a truck driver from \nWisconsin saying eventually the added cost of transporting household \ngoods and snacks and other items will once again come back and clobber \nthe consumer. You have a double whammy. Consumers get socked at the \npump in person, and then get hit again with higher prices for the goods \nthey buy. That is not acceptable to me, and I don't believe it is \nacceptable to the American people.\n  The challenge now is for the Congress to stand up to the status quo \nin the oil industry. I understand--and certainly nobody would minimize \nthis--this will be a hard row to hoe in terms of taking on these very \npowerful interests.\n  When I first introduced legislation that now can be used to protect \nthe consumer from gasoline prices going up to $3 per gallon, various \noil interests and Bush administration officials voiced great \nconsternation and argued vociferously that the legislation I believed \nwill protect the consumer was unacceptable to the oil industry and the \nadministration.\n  I still believe the proposals which I have put forward in legislation \nand on which the Congress could move now would protect competition and \nfree markets. My legislation doesn't involve big expenditures from \nGovernment. It doesn't involve setting up new agencies. It involves \nbringing some competition and free market forces back to this country \nand to the gasoline business--particularly in those States where we \nhave these quasi-monopolies.\n  But for those who disagree with my legislation, S. 1737, which I \nbelieve would protect the consumer who is getting clobbered at the \ngasoline pumps, I issue a challenge. If they think they have a better \napproach than my legislation for bringing competition and free market \nforces back to the gasoline market, they have an obligation to come \nforward at a time when our consumers are being hit so hard at the pump. \nUnless people who are opposing my legislation are prepared to say the \nrecord high gasoline prices aren't a problem, they have an obligation \nto come forward with their proposals to promote competition. Put an \nalternative on the table and stand up for the consumer.\n\n  I also think Congress needs to address the growing gap between \nconsumer demand for gas and what the oil companies can produce. When \nsupplies are tight and there is no spare gasoline in inventories, \nconsumers are especially vulnerable to supply shortages and price \nspikes. That frequently causes severe price spikes when refineries shut \ndown unexpectedly or a pipeline breaks, as happened last summer. \nCongress should ensure consumers are not left stalled by the side of \nthe road or being pounded at the pump by taking steps to keep supplies \navailable in an emergency. One option would be to require major oil \ncompanies to maintain minimum inventories to address unexpected supply \ncrunches.\n  Alternatively, the Federal Government can create a strategic gasoline \nreserve to provide supplies during refinery or pipeline shutdowns. This \nproposal would build on the strategic reserves that already exist for \npetroleum and heating oil supplies.\n  It seems to me what it all comes down to is the American people \ndeserve better, and they deserve better than the Federal Government \nbeing AWOL when our consumers are facing skyrocketing gasoline prices \nacross the country. With a new energy bill expected to come before the \nSenate in the next several weeks, this is an opportunity to put the \nGovernment on the side of the American consumer when they are filling \ntheir tanks at the pumps across the land.\n  I conclude by again commenting on the role of the Federal Trade \nCommission. This is the agency that is charged by Congress with \npromoting competition and free markets. Again and again in the energy \nfield they have either sat on the sidelines or simply looked the other \nway in the face of increasing concentration in this critical sector of \nour economy. With gasoline prices already soaring at the highest level \nat this particular time, it seems to me it is absolutely critical for \nthe Federal Trade Commission to reverse its present\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\ncourse, get on the side of the consumer, and promote marketplace forces \nand competition in the gasoline business.\n  I intend to use my seat on the Senate Commerce Committee at every \npossible opportunity to force the Federal Trade Commission to do the \njob it has been charged by the Congress to do. It ought to start with \nlooking seriously into the shutdown in Bakersfield, which is going to, \nin my view, have calamitous consequences for the entire west coast \ngasoline market. But it also should include a broader look at the \nimplication of concentration in the gasoline business.\n  I am hopeful that ultimately the Federal Trade Commission will \nsupport my legislation, S. 1737, which would promote more competition \nin the gasoline business. And if they disagree with it, the head of \nthat agency, Mr. Timothy Muris, ought to propose his own alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before I make comments on a different \nsubject matter, I commend my friend and colleague for addressing the \nissue of energy--energy production and energy costs--while he is still \non the floor. We have probably close to 200,000 American troops in the \ngulf area to protect and preserve the countries in those regions. It \nseems to me it would not be asking too much of our President to jawbone \nthose leaders to increase production. We can see what an increase of \nproduction of 1 million barrels per day and 2 million barrels a day \nwould mean. It would have a dramatic impact and effect on consumers in \nthis country. It is difficult for me to understand why we should not \nexpect that kind of leadership from the President of the United States \nwhen every day we learn young Americans are losing their lives in that \nregion, and tens of thousands of troops have been serving over in that \nregion for years in order to protect the security of those nations.\n  Now we come to an issue of enormous need in our country--an important \npart of that because of our responsibilities in meeting the defense \nneeds and security needs for our forces overseas. We have silence by \nthe administration when they are asked why they aren't jawboning these \ncountries in the Middle East.\n  I don't know whether the Senator could make some comment on that, \njust briefly. I listened with great interest to his other comments. I \nhope the Senate as a whole will take him to heart.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts coming to the floor because he has done so \nmuch to help the consumer in this area. My concern--and I would be \ninterested in the Senator's reaction--is I think the consumer is about \nto get hit by a perfect storm with the combination of failure to push \nOPEC, as the Senator has said, to try to help on the production issue, \nplus the refinery cutbacks that apparently are primarily to boost \nprofits, plus filling the strategic petroleum reserve. With these \nfactors coming together, it seems to me a perfect storm is going to \npush the consumers' gasoline price at the pump to $3 a gallon.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's reaction, and I am anxious to \nwork with him in this effort to push the administration to go after \nOPEC.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is sounding the alarm. I think his \npredictions are self-evident. Thankfully, he is providing the \nleadership before the full impact of these different events, the \nconfluence of these different events taking place. Clearly, they will \ntake place over the course of late spring or early summer.\n\n  I commend the Senator for bringing this to our attention. It is an \nenormous service, not only to the people of his State but the people of \nmy State and the people all over this country. As we are coming into \nthe late spring and summer, constituents will be wondering where we \nhave been as representatives in dealing with this issue. The Senator \nfrom Oregon has outlined a very critical problem and made splendid \nrecommendations. I look forward to working with the Senator to achieve \nthese recommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2839-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2839-S2840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the chance to address the \nSenate briefly this afternoon on the underlying legislation. We are in \nmorning business now, and we will lay down the bill shortly. I am \ninformed my friend and colleague from Iowa intends to offer an \namendment to address the proposal being developed, that has been \ndeveloped, and continues to be developed by the administration to \nrestrict overtime pay for some 8 million Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed beyond the 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before the Senate is the legislation \ncalled Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act, or the JOBS Act. The \nproposal of the Senator from Iowa is entirely appropriate to address \nthis issue. He will be addressing key aspects of employment in this \ncountry; that is, the question of adequate pay for those working long \nhours in this country, and the proposal of the administration to cut \nback on their pay by eliminating the overtime for some 8 million \nworkers.\n  For those who have been traveling not only in their own States but \naround the country--as I and other Members have--we know we are facing \na serious challenge in creating good jobs with good benefits in the \nUnited States. This is affecting the quality of life of millions of \nAmerican families.\n  The fact is, the Senate has refused to increase the minimum wage for \na period of 7 years. We have 7 million Americans, our fellow citizens, \nhard-working Americans, men and women who take a sense of pride even in \nworking at minimum-wage jobs. They are the men and women who clean the \nbuildings where American commerce takes place. They work in our nursing \nhomes to take care of our elderly people. They work as teachers' aides \nin many of our schools. These are men and women of dignity. They have \nworked long and hard over the period of the last 7 years, and we have \nfailed to provide an increase in the minimum wage because our \nRepublican leadership and this administration refuse to support an \nincrease in the minimum wage. That is fact No. 1.\n  Fact No. 2. Even though we have seen the total loss of some 3 million \nprivate sector jobs and now an overall loss of about 2.2 million jobs, \nthis administration refuses to extend the unemployment compensation. \nThe unemployment compensation fund is $15 billion in surplus. It was \npaid by people who have worked hard for this very eventuality that we \nare now facing--this heavy, prolonged unemployment. Those who have \nextended unemployment, who have worked hard, should be entitled to \nunemployment compensation. It is in surplus.\n  The proposal of the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, will cost \n$5.6 billion to extend unemployment compensation for 13 weeks. There \nare 90,000 Americans a week losing their unemployment compensation. How \ndo these families pay for their mortgage, put food on the table? How do \nthey feed their children? How do they look forward to the future with \nany kind of sense of hope?\n  Where are we in responding to them in their crisis of need? Our \nRepublican colleagues, the Republican administration, refuses to extend \nunemployment compensation.\n\n  If that is not bad enough, what is the administration proposing to do \nnow? They are proposing to eliminate overtime pay for some 8 million of \nour fellow Americans who otherwise are receiving overtime.\n  Who is receiving overtime? Police officers, nurses, firefighters. Do \nthose three categories have a ring to Members in the Senate and across \nthis country? Who is in those categories? Whom do they represent? They \nrepresent homeland security.\n  On the one hand, we hear a good many statements in the Senate about \ntrying to deal with the problems of homeland security. On the other \nhand, the administration is out to take away overtime for those \nindividuals who are the backbone of homeland security.\n  These are the categories: Police officers, nursing, firefighters. The \nlist also includes primarily women workers in our society. The overtime \npay affects all workers but it particularly affects women.\n  What has been the state of our economy now in terms of new workers?\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nSome say: Senator, you do not understand. Workers are doing well in the \ncountry at this time.\n  I don't believe it. Those who say this do not understand it. They may \nbe reading the clippings of Wall Street, but they do not understand \nMain Street. If they have been reading the clippings of Main Street \nover the past week or so, they see there has not been great news.\n  The new jobs being created in the United States do not pay as much as \njobs lost. This chart indicates the average wage in 2001 was $44,570 a \nyear. Jobs gained do not pay as much as jobs lost. The average wage \ntoday from the jobs gained, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, is $35,410. That is a 21-percent reduction for the new jobs \nbeing created; a 21-percent reduction in pay over the jobs they have \nreplaced.\n  At the same time, this administration is trying to eliminate overtime \neven for this group. What in the world is the reason for this?\n  Against this backdrop, we look at the chart demonstrating that \nAmericans work more hours than workers in other industrialized nations \nof the world. This red bar represents the United States. The other \ncountries on this chart include Denmark, France, Ireland, Netherlands, \nUK, Italy, and Germany. In the United States, far more than any other \ncountry, workers are working harder, working longer, trying to make \nends meet. What do we do? We in the Senate refuse to increase the \nminimum wage. If these workers lose their jobs, there is no federal \nunemployment compensation. Even though they are working longer and \nharder, we will take away their overtime.\n  This administration is attempting to take away overtime protection. \nThis chart demonstrates what happens to workers with overtime \nprotection and those without overtime protection. Those without \novertime protection are twice as likely to be required by their bosses \nto work overtime hours as those with overtime protection. We know what \nthis is all about--requiring workers to work longer, harder, for less \npay over a period of time. Overtime has been in the law since the \n1930s. Now we have this administration trying to take away from the \nworkers? For those who do not have overtime protection, they are twice \nas likely to work more than 40 hours a week. And those without overtime \nprotections are three times as likely to work more than 50 hours a \nweek. Take away the overtime protections and we are going to see the \nexploitation of working families in the middle class in this country \ngreater than ever. That is basically greed. It is wrong.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa is focused on making sure we \ncontinue to pay the overtime.\n  I make two final points. First of all, in the proposal by the \nadministration to eliminate overtime, they are looking not only at the \ncategories I just illustrated, but they are also saying if you have \nserved in the Armed Forces and have received that training, that when \nyou get out of the Armed Forces you are not going to be eligible for \novertime. For the first time in the history of this country, they are \nsaying, military training--training that you receive in the military--\nis going to exclude you from coverage for overtime. Tell that to the \nservicemen who are over in Iraq. Tell it to the National Guard, who are \nmaking up 40 percent of those under combat arms. When you get some \ntraining in order to protect members of your particular unit, and then \nyou come back and are out there in the civilian market, you are told by \nyour boss: You got training in the military. You are not eligible for \novertime.\n\n  I see my friend in the Chamber. I will take a few more minutes \nbecause I know he wants to address the Senate. This is a letter to \nSecretary Chao from Thomas Corey, the National President of the Vietnam \nVeterans of America:\n\n     . . . [W]e would like to make you aware that the proposed \n     modification to the rules would give employers the ability to \n     prohibit veterans from receiving overtime pay based on the \n     training they received in the military. This legitimizes the \n     already extensive problems of ``vetism'' or discrimination \n     against veterans.\n\n  There you are. What in the world is this administration thinking?\n  I will read a letter, and then I will conclude. I think it \nillustrates very powerfully what the debate is about and the strong \nreasons we all ought to be behind the Harkin amendment:\n\n       My name is Randy Fleming. I live in Haysville, Kansas--\n     outside Wichita--and I work as an Engineering Technician in \n     Boeing's Metrology Lab.\n       I'm also proud to say that I'm a military veteran. I served \n     in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until February 1979.\n       I've worked for Boeing for 23 years. During that time I've \n     been able to build a good, solid life for my family and I've \n     raised a son who now has a good career and children of his \n     own. There are two things that helped make that possible.\n       First, the training I received in the Air Force made me \n     qualified for a good civilian job. That was one of the main \n     attractions when I enlisted as a young man back in Iowa. I \n     think it's still one of the main reasons young people today \n     decide to enlist. Military training opens up better job \n     opportunities--and if you don't believe me, just look at the \n     recruiting ads on TV.\n       The second thing is overtime pay. That's how I was able to \n     give my son the college education that has opened doors for \n     him. Some years, when the company was busy and I had those \n     college bills to pay, overtime pay was probably 10% or more \n     of my income. My daughter is next. Danielle is only 8, but \n     we'll be counting on my overtime to help her get her college \n     degree, too, when that time comes. For my family, overtime \n     pay has made all the difference.\n       That's where I'm coming from. Why did I come to Washington? \n     I came to talk about an issue that is very important back \n     home and to me personally as a working man, a family man, and \n     a veteran. That issue is overtime rights.\n       The changes that this administration is trying to make in \n     the overtime regulations would break the government's bargain \n     with the men and women in the military and would close down \n     opportunities that working vets and their families thought \n     they could count on.\n       When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a \n     deal that I thought was fair. They got a chunk of my time and \n     I got training to help me build the rest of my life. There \n     was no part of that deal that said I would have to give up my \n     right to overtime pay. You've heard of the marriage penalty? \n     Well I think that what these new rules do is to create a \n     military penalty. If you got your training in the military, \n     no matter what your white collar profession is, your employer \n     can make you work as many hours as they want and not pay you \n     a dime extra.\n       If that's not a bait and switch, I don't know what is.\n       And I don't have any doubt that employers will take \n     advantage of this new opportunity to cut our overtime pay. \n     They'll tell us they have to in order to compete. They'll say \n     if they can't take our overtime pay, they'll have to \n     eliminate our jobs.\n       It won't be just the bad employers, either--because these \n     rules will make it very hard for companies to do the right \n     thing. If they can get as many overtime hours as they want \n     for free instead of paying us time-and-a-half, they'll say \n     they owe it to the stockholders. And the veterans and other \n     working people will be stuck with less time, less money, and \n     a broken deal.\n       I'm luckier than some other veterans because I have a union \n     contract that will protect my rights for a while anyway. But \n     we know the pressure will be on, because my employer is one \n     that pushed for these new rules and they've been trying hard \n     to get rid of our union.\n       And for all those who want to let these military penalty \n     rules go through, I have a deal I'd like to propose. If you \n     think it's okay for the government to renege on its deals, I \n     think it should be your job to tell our military men and \n     women in Iraq that when they come home, their service to \n     their country will be used as a way to cut their overtime \n     pay.\n\n  That is from Randy Fleming. It could not be said any clearer. That is \nthe issue. Tom Harkin and I will offer the amendment. I hope the Senate \nwill at least permit us a chance to vote on that amendment in the next \nday or two.\n  I thank the Senator for his patience and for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2840-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2840-S2842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC POLICY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, for those estimated 2.3 million Americans \nwho have lost their jobs over the past 3 years, and for those worried \nabout keeping their jobs, economic policy is not about abstract \ndiscussions or theoretical debates. It is about finding and keeping \nsteady work at a decent wage. It is about affordable health care, \nbuying a home, and sending their children to college.\n  We live in a time of dramatic historical change, a transformational \nperiod. The byproducts of such change are uncertainty, complications, \ninstability, and danger, as well as vast opportunities.\n  America today, as at the end of World War II, is in a position to \nlead and shape the direction of this 21st century change.\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n  America's economic security and prosperity cannot be separated from \nour leadership of the global economy. During periods of uncertainty and \nchange, some Americans seek refuge in an insular political tradition \nthat, in the past, has contributed to isolationism at home and \ninstability abroad.\n  After World War I, America pursued an isolationist foreign and trade \npolicy that resulted in a weakened international order that led to \nWorld War II.\n  In contrast, after World War II, America's leaders laid the \nfoundation for the World Trade Organization and a new global political \nand economic order. As a result, America and much of the world have \nenjoyed historic peace and prosperity for more than 50 years.\n  The recent job losses in the United States must be analyzed and \nunderstood in the context of historic increases in American worker \nproductivity, a global decline in manufacturing employment, and the \nchanges occurring in the global economy.\n  Michael Porter, in his classic work, ``The Comparative Advantage of \nNations,'' wrote that:\n\n       A nation's standard of living in the long term depends on \n     its ability to attain a high and rising level of productivity \n     in the industries in which its firms compete.\n\n  Between 1997 and 2002, U.S. manufacturing productivity grew by 109 \npercent. This remarkable increase in productivity has cost jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. Advances in technology lead to increases in \nproductivity which requires fewer workers.\n  Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich recently wrote that despite \nthese trends in the manufacturing sector ``this doesn't mean that we \nare left with fewer jobs.'' As a matter of fact, the trend, over time, \nis just the opposite. Advances in technology and gains in productivity \nmean more jobs in high-growth, high-tech, high-paying sectors.\n  Robert Samuelson makes the case well when he said:\n\n       Manufacturing employment peaked in mid-1979 at 19.5 \n     million; now it's 14.5 million. But over that period, total \n     U.S. employment grew about 40 million, and manufacturing \n     output rose more than 80%. American companies became more \n     productive and shifted to more valuable products.\n\n  The decline in employment in the manufacturing sector is a global \nphenomenon. The same technologies that have enhanced productivity in \nAmerica's manufacturing sector are employed in the manufacturing \nsectors of other countries. For example, while the United States lost \n22 million factory jobs between 1995 and 2002--an 11-percent decline--\nJapan lost 16 percent; Brazil, 20 percent; and China, 15 percent.\n  The trend we see in manufacturing is the same trend we had seen over \nthe past century in agriculture. One hundred years ago, 35 percent of \nAmericans worked on a farm or in the agricultural industry. Today, \nbecause of dramatic increases in productivity due to improving \nagricultural technologies, science, and research, that number is 3 \npercent.\n  The globalization of technology and productivity has contributed to \nanother related issue. Many politicians and the media have recently \nfocused on the impact on U.S. employment of U.S. companies outsourcing \nmanufacturing and service jobs overseas. Since March 2001, it is \nestimated that more than 1 million jobs in the manufacturing and \nservice sectors have been outsourced. The U.S. economy currently has \n139 million jobs and showed an increase of 97,000 jobs in January and \n21,000 jobs last month.\n  But outsourcing is not a zero sum loss for America. There are \nbenefits for the United States. Outsourcing of some manufacturing \noperations has resulted in lower cost goods for U.S. businesses and \nconsumers. The globalization of the information technology sector has \nresulted in a reduction of 10 to 30 percent in the price of computers \nand IT-related products. These reduced costs have contributed to \nincreases of 2.5 to 2.8 percent in productivity growth in the United \nStates and added at least $230 billion to the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Outsourcing cannot be understood as simply the number of jobs shipped \noverseas. It is more complicated. As American companies outsource jobs, \nthere are also potential benefits to American businesses and workers. \nCompanies can save in profit through the reduced costs gained by \noutsourcing some jobs. With expansion and additional revenues, more \nU.S. goods, services, and equipment are purchased to support those \noutsourced industries. This also contributes to innovation, growth, \nand, over time, better and more jobs for America's most competitive \nindustries and technologies.\n  Economic growth from outsourcing is not a zero sum gain or loss. Both \nsides gain. Economic growth in other nations creates markets, markets \ncapable of purchasing more and more American goods and services.\n  For example, Tom Friedman in a recent New York Times op-ed wrote \nabout his visit to the 24/7 customer call center in Bangalore, India. \nThere he observed that the computers were Compaq; the software, \nMicrosoft; the air-conditioning, Carrier; and the drinking water \ndistributor, Coca-Cola. And 90 percent of the company's shares were \nowned by U.S. investors.\n  As attention is focused on the negative implications of outsourcing \nto India, often overlooked are the advantages to America's economy. \nAmerican exports to India have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.1 \nbillion in 2002.\n  The larger picture is instructive because it guides our policy \nchoices. Meeting the demands of a global economy requires maintaining \nAmerica's leadership in free trade, expanding programs to retrain those \nworkers who lose their jobs, and educating the next generation of \nAmericans about what it will take to compete in a more competitive \nglobal economy.\n\n  As Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently remarked to \nthe Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       The loss of jobs over the past three years is attributable \n     largely to rapid declines in the demand for industrial goods \n     and to outsized gains in productivity that have caused \n     effective supply to outstrip demand. Protectionism will do \n     little to create jobs; and if foreigners retaliate, we will \n     surely lose more jobs. We need instead to discover the means \n     to enhance the skills of our workforce to further open \n     markets here and abroad to allow our workers to compete \n     effectively in the global marketplace.\n\n  The expansion of free and fair trade will continue to be the most \nassured path for prosperity and job creation. Trade does not cost \nAmerican jobs. Free trade has been an engine of economic growth, \ninnovation, wealth, and job creation for the United States since World \nWar II.\n  The value of American exports grew substantially between 1994 and \n2003, from $703 billion to more than $1 trillion. More than 18 million \nnew jobs were added to the economy because of trade. U.S. exports \nduring the 1990s accounted for 25 percent of the growth in America's \neconomy. Exports today support more than 12 million directly related \njobs that pay as much as 18 percent more than the average national \nwage.\n  In 2003, U.S. exports of advanced technology totaled $180 billion. \nMeanwhile, in America's high tech electronics sector, exports exceeded \n$100 billion annually between 1997 and 2003, showing that America \ncontinues to maintain its leadership in cutting edge technologies, a \nsource of more and better paying jobs for Americans in the United \nStates.\n  American consumers and businesses also gain from trade through lower \npriced imports. Lower import prices mean increased purchasing power for \nconsumers. As U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick noted last year \nin testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance:\n\n       By lowering prices through imports and increasing incomes \n     through trade, America's newest trade agreements will build \n     on the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement and \n     the Uruguay Round, which together already provide the average \n     American family of four with benefits amounting to $1,300 to \n     $2,000 each and every year.\n\n  If consumers have more money, American businesses benefit from \ngreater consumer demand, consumer demand for their businesses, their \nproducts, and their services. Businesses and entrepreneurs, therefore, \nhave more resources to invest and spend and expand on plants, creating \nmore jobs in the United States. Expanding free trade and fair trade \nalso encourages foreign companies to invest and set up operations in \nthe United States. Foreign-owned firms currently provide 6.4\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nmillion jobs throughout the United States.\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement is testimony to the impact of \nexpanded free trade for American jobs, growth, and prosperity. Since \nNAFTA's implementation, total trade among the United States, Mexico, \nand Canada has more than doubled from $306 billion in 1993 to $621 \nbillion last year. That is $1.7 billion in trade every day between our \ntrading partners to the north and south.\n\n  U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico have grown from $142 billion to \n$263 billion over these 10 years. U.S. exports to Mexico of cars and \ntrucks totaled about $3.3 billion in 2003. That is an increase from \nexports of approximately $165 million in 1993.\n  My State of Nebraska has directly benefited from increased trade and \nspecifically from NAFTA. Nebraska's worldwide exports in 2003 were in \nexcess of $2.7 billion. Mexico and Canada are Nebraska's largest export \nmarkets. Nebraska's exports to Mexico and Canada in 2003 were valued at \nover $1.2 billion. From 1999 to 2003, Nebraska's trade with Mexico \nincreased by 87 percent and trade with Canada by 28 percent.\n  Americans know that changes in the global economy lead to \ndislocations in domestic workforces. Dislocations are painful. They are \ndifficult. No one wants to lose a job. Americans need retraining \nprograms and education programs that address these global economic \nadjustments.\n  Former Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin has written in his recent \nbook ``In An Uncertain World''\n\n     . . . trade must be accompanied by effective programs to help \n     dislocated workers find new places in our economy. This is \n     not only fair, but will contribute both to productivity and \n     to political acceptance of trade liberalization.\n\n  Many Americans who lose their jobs, especially jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector, require assistance and retraining to find new \nwork. In 2002, Congress spent $12 billion on 44 Federal programs, which \nhelped 30 million Americans with job search assistance, employment \ncounseling, and vocational training.\n  These Federal programs include those authorized through the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act, the Workforce Investment Act, National \nEmergency Grants, and State-run worker training programs.\n  These programs have helped and are helping displaced workers all over \nthe country. In fiscal year 2004, approximately $1.3 billion will be \nspent on these benefits and programs of the TAA program alone.\n  TAA programs have provided job training, as much as 130 weeks of \nunemployment compensation, monetary allowances for job searches and job \nrelocation, tax credits for health insurance, and wage insurance.\n  The greater longer view challenge for America is to ensure our \nstudents have prepared for the competitive global economy of the 21st \ncentury. America's universities are the best in the world.\n  The global demand for what Secretary Reich has called the ``symbolic \nanalytic'' sector professionals--research and development, design \nengineering, law, finance, medicine, and other fields--should and must \nremain high. It is in America's interest to maintain our leadership in \nthese areas. As Secretary Reich puts it:\n\n       America's long-term problem isn't too few jobs. It's the \n     widening gap between personal-service workers and symbolic \n     analysts.\n       The long-term solution is to help spur upward mobility for \n     all workers by getting more Americans a good education, \n     including access to college.\n\n  The trends in this area should be monitored carefully. For example, \nin 2002, 58 percent of all degrees awarded in China were in engineering \nand physical sciences. In the United States, only 17 percent of degrees \nawarded were in these fields. America's security and vitality depend on \npolicies that are based on the strengths of America, not its \ninsecurities. Adjusting to the global economy requires immigration \npolicies that consider those seeking to live and work in the United \nStates as assets and not burdens on our national economy. Daniel \nHenninger recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The global migration of human labor, on which there is \n     little organized data, is perhaps the most powerful force on \n     the globe today.\n\n  Many politicians and commentators have portrayed immigration as a \nthreat to American workers. But immigration is a vital part of \nAmerica's strength. Throughout our history, immigration has played an \nimportant role in our economy. Free trade also directly affects \nAmerican interests in promoting stability, security, and democracy in \nother nations. By pursuing free and fair trade, and by encouraging \nbusiness and investment practices that contribute to more open \nsocieties at home and abroad, we are establishing partnerships with \ndeveloped and developing nations that help make a more peaceful and \nprosperous world. That is in the interest of all nations, of all \npeople, and certainly of America.\n  Countries that trade with each other are less likely to go to war \nwith each other. We are all shareholders in this enterprise. We all \nhave a stake in its success. American leadership in free trade will \nover time reduce America's security commitments abroad, allowing a \nreduction in American peacekeeping, nation building, and force \nprotection, thus saving American lives and dollars.\n\n  The tough economic choices ahead will require leadership, vision, and \ncourage. American leadership in the global economy will depend on \nconfidence at home and abroad. Investor confidence is a catalyst for \njob creation. Excessive Federal deficits and a looming crisis in \nAmerican entitlement programs can and surely will undermine our fiscal \ncredibility and our economic leadership.\n  The Federal deficit for fiscal year 2004 is now projected to be a \nhalf trillion dollars. In 2035, 75 million Americans will be over 65 \nand entitled to Social Security and Medicare. That is double the number \nof Americans eligible today. Where will the money come from? It will \ncome from economic growth, which will be driven by world affairs and \ntrade, and American international leadership. To lead in the 21st \ncentury, America must combine fiscally responsible policies with a \ncommitment to trade. Our economic policies will influence and affect \nthe shape of America's domestic policies and programs, as well as \npolitical reform and change throughout the world.\n  Now is not the time to retreat from our commitment to free trade, \nmarket economies, and democratic reforms. Since World War II, America \nhas been the primary architect and leader of a global economic order \nthat has provided the structure for unprecedented growth and \nopportunity both at home and abroad. Our economic policies, like our \ndomestic and foreign policies, are about the limitless potential of all \nhuman beings. Trade is not a guarantee; it is an opportunity--an \nopportunity to compete and make a better world for all people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this afternoon we resume consideration of \nthe JOBS bill. The chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, is on \nhis way over. I thought I would proceed to make sure we do not have any \ndead time.\n  While the Senate went off this bill and considered the budget just a \nweek ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released new job figures for \nFebruary. Those data show 8.2 million people are still unemployed. That \nis more than 2 million more than at the beginning of the recession in \nMarch 2001. Job growth remains too slow.\n  As this chart shows, we have lost more than 3 million private sector \njobs since December 2000, and job creation has not turned around.\n  This next chart shows jobs lost--2.2 million jobs lost; overall total \nemployment, 3 million jobs lost from January 2001 to February 2004; 3 \nmillion lost in the private sector during that same period. It was \nalmost 3 million, 2.8 million lost in the manufacturing sector.\n  The economy created just 20,000 new jobs in February. The private \nsector created no new jobs last month. All the net new jobs came from \nthe Government. Let me repeat that. There were no new private sector \njobs created last month. Yet there were 20,000 new jobs overall, and \nall those jobs were Government jobs. That is not something I think we \nwant to do.\n  This next chart shows manufacturing jobs. It is very interesting to \nsee that in the years 1950, 1960, 1970, all the way up to the year \n2000, this dotted line shows that today, 2004, we have the fewest jobs \nin America in half a century. That is the fewest jobs in half a \ncentury. Stated another way, the number of jobs we have now is as low \nas it was a half century ago.\n  Manufacturing jobs declined for the 43rd straight month. Mr. \nPresident, 3,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared in February. \nManufacturing employment is at its lowest point in more than a half \ncentury, since March of 1950. Again, that is what this chart shows. The \njob level now is as low as it was a half century ago.\n  Part of the story is that the American manufacturing worker has \nbecome more productive. The average manufacturing worker has turned out \nmore product than before. But it goes deeper than that. Manufacturing \nproduction--that is the output of manufacturing jobs--remains below the \nlevels of the beginning of 2001.\n  There is reason for continued concern about the future. A week ago, \nGoldman Sachs reviewed the latest manufacturing data and concluded:\n\n       [W]e interpret Monday's decline in the New York Fed's \n     Empire Survey for March as one more piece of evidence that \n     the manufacturing sector is transitioning to somewhat slower \n     growth. . . .\n\n  This next chart shows the share of population with jobs. That is, we \nreached our peak in about the year 2000 of the percentage of American \npopulation that had jobs, and we can tell by the chart that whereas it \nhas been steadily rising in percentage of Americans who have jobs from \n1994, steadily rising up to the beginning of the recession in March \n2001, we have declined precipitously since that date.\n  In sum, the jobs picture remains sluggish. Even the normally taciturn \nFederal Reserve noted the weak job market in saying in a recent \nstatement last Tuesday that ``hiring has lagged.''\n  The latest Labor Department numbers show total unemployment fell in \nFebruary to 138.3 million. The share of the population age 16 and older \nwith jobs declined to 62.2 percent. This employment population ratio is \nlower than it was at any time between March 1994 and June 2003. Again, \nthat is in the chart as I just indicated.\n  The slow job market spans the Nation. As of January 2004, nearly 3 \nyears after the recession began, almost every region of the country \ncontinues to have higher unemployment than in March 2001. Forty-five \nStates have higher unemployment rates than when the recession began.\n  In terms of unemployment, my State of Montana has fared better than \nsome, but unemployment remains markedly higher than pre-recession \nlevels throughout much of the country. Colorado unemployment is up 2.8 \npercent. Again, if we look at the chart, every State has higher \nunemployment, as indicated by red, but for three States. One is the \nState of Montana, where it is level. In two States, Nevada and South \nDakota, unemployment has actually declined. In every other State, \nunemployment has increased at a very marked rate.\n  Again, as I said, Colorado is up 2.8 percent; Ohio is up 2.6 percent; \nMassachusetts up 2.6 percent; Oregon up 2.4 percent; New York up 2.3 \npercent; Texas is up 2.1 percent; and New Jersey is also up 2 percent. \nThe list goes on.\n  In terms of the absolute number of jobs, 36 States have failed to get \nback to the pre-recession employment levels. In 49 States, job creation \nhas not kept up with natural growth in the number of potential workers. \nOnly in Alaska has job growth exceeded the growth of working age \npopulation.\n  The news of the Nation's slow job growth has cycled back to lessened \nconsumer demand, and thus economic growth. This chart shows consumer \nconfidence. As we can see beginning in 1994, consumer confidence in \nAmerica remained at about the 95 percent level. This is the consumer \nconfidence index, based in the hundreds, so it was a little lower in \n1994 to 1996. It steadily rose from 1997 to 1998. Those are the boom \nyears. It reached its peak roughly at the beginning of the recession in \nMarch of 2001, and then just plummeted to its low levels.\n  Why is that important? It is important because, as I have mentioned, \nthe Nation's slow job growth has cycled back. It has cycled back to \nlessened consumer demand. When consumer demand is down, economic growth \nalso falls off as well.\n  In the latest consumer confidence survey, confidence fell for the \nsecond straight month in part because of consumer concern over the weak \njob market. Nearly 3 years after the start of the recession, consumer \nconfidence remains below its January 2001 levels.\n  These numbers of people without jobs are not just statistics; they \nare real lives. These are real lives we are talking about. This weak \njob picture causes real pain. It causes disruption in many families.\n  For example, there is a fellow named John in East Helena, MT, who has \nworked 22 years at the ASARCO smelter plant that has recently closed. \nJohn suffers permanent health problems from working with chemicals at \nthe plant. He has been unable to get full-time employment so he works \npart time. John cannot get health insurance because he has preexisting \nhealth conditions.\n  Then there is Bruce. Bruce is 50 years old. He worked 28 years at \nthat same East Helena smelter. He did what they say to do; that is, use \nretraining benefits and train as a computer technician. Unable to get \nwork in that field, he works now full time in a grocery store.\n  Often when a person loses a job, a family loses a job. Evelyn from \nwestern Montana wrote:\n\n       I am concerned about the economy of Western Montana. . . . \n     I see that industry . . . is [waning]. What do we have to \n     offer our children and grandchildren in the way of stability \n     within Montana? . . . What do you propose . . . [to give us] \n     a hope of being able to support our families?\n\n  Kim wrote about her husband's job:\n\n       The second paper mill my spouse has worked at in three \n     years is threatened with closure in the next six to twelve \n     months. In a letter to the employees . . . in Missoula, \n     Montana[,] the company president blamed the endless drain of \n     manufacturing America to overseas as the cause for possible \n     shut-down. [The company] makes liner-board, the cardboard \n     boxes products are shipped in. [I]f products are not made in \n     the United States, boxes are not needed. . . . [T]he liner-\n     board market is a direct reflection of the state of the \n     economy[,] because the more liner-board boxes sold[,] the \n     more products being manufactured within the United States . . \n     .\n\n  Real people like John, Bruce, Evelyn, and Kim are the reason we need \nto move this bill. We need to fight to create and keep good \nmanufacturing jobs in America.\n  The bill before us provides a 9-percent deduction for manufacturing, \neffectively reducing the tax rate for domestic manufacturers by 3 \npercentage points. The JOBS Act will thus help all manufacturers \nproduce goods in the United States. Cutting taxes for domestic \nmanufacturers will help prevent layoffs and will help preserve jobs. It \nis the right thing to do.\n  We got a good start in this bill the week before the budget \nresolution. The Senate agreed to the managers' amendment that among \nother things ended some outrageous leasing tax shelters,\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nand the Senate unanimously extended the R tax credit. We expanded \nthat credit for universities and labs.\n  We also conducted a good and spirited debate on an amendment by \nSenator Dodd. That amendment addressed the performance of Government \ncontracts by American workers. After working collaboratively on \nmodifications proposed by Senator McConnell and Senator McCain, the \nSenate agreed to that amendment by a vote of 70 to 26.\n  The Senate then began debate on an amendment proposed by Senators \nBunning and Stabenow to accelerate the phase-in of the manufacturing \ntax cuts. The Senate also began considering an amendment by Senator \nBayh providing for an extension of expiring tax provisions. These last \ntwo important amendments are now pending.\n  Under a previous order, the next first-degree amendment in order will \nbe that offered by the minority leader or his designee. We understand \nthe amendment will be proposed by Senator Harkin regarding the \nDepartment of Labor's overtime regulations. I know there are strong \nfeelings on this amendment, but Senators are all now aware that we must \naddress that issue in order to move this bill along. I hope we can come \nup to a vote on that amendment in a reasonably short period of time and \nmove to other amendments.\n  In the end--and I will keep returning to this theme--this bill is \nabout jobs, good jobs, about jobs in America. We are trying to help \npreserve American manufacturing. The task ahead of us is large, the \nchallenge great, but Americans do not shrink from that challenge.\n  Renee, the bookkeeping manager for a small manufacturer in Bozeman, \nMT, said it well when she wrote:\n\n       The United States is a nation built on steely determination \n     in the face of overwhelming odds. We must act now to reverse \n     the loss of our high-skill, high wage manufacturing jobs.\n\n  That is our job, and we need to do that. We need to get this bill \ndone for John, Bruce, Kim, and Evelyn and all the hardworking Americans \nwho depend on a strong manufacturing sector in America. We cannot let \nthem down. Let us move on to the bill, let us move on to amendments and \nlet's address them. Let's move this bill and let us do what we can to \nstrengthen American manufacturing.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to reiterate the words of my \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Montana, on the \nimportance of getting this bill passed. This bill is about jobs because \nit is about keeping American manufacturing competitive, particularly \nmanufacturing that is exported. Export-related jobs in America are very \ngood jobs because they pay 15 percent above the national average.\n  This bill, that we call by the acronym FSC/ETI, foreign sales \ncorporation extraterritorial income, reduces the income tax on goods \nmanufactured in the United States and sold overseas. Whether it is done \nby American manufacturers or foreign companies that have come to \nAmerica to establish a manufacturing plant and hire Americans, it \napplies to both. It does not apply to American companies that \nmanufacture overseas.\n  The World Trade Organization is the reason we are debating this bill, \nbecause the World Trade Organization has ruled that our FSC/ETI \nlegislation, that has been on the books for more than a couple of \ndecades, is an illegal export subsidy and has authorized up to $4 \nbillion a year of sanctions against U.S. exports. This is something the \nWorld Trade Organization said to the European Community that they could \ndo on U.S. exports, because until we change this law, they see us not \nliving up to our international trade obligations.\n  Why would the United States respond to the World Trade Organization \nthis way? In the very same way we expect Europe or any other country to \nrespond when the United States wins cases before the World Trade \nOrganization. Let me say, we win many more than we lose. In fact, \nanybody reading commerce newspapers over the last week would find out \nthat the United States has recently won two decisions before the World \nTrade Organization on other issues.\n  In regard to Europe, as one specific example, we expect Europe to \nabide by the decision that the U.S. cattle producers won in the World \nTrade Organization because Europe was not taking in our red meat, our \nbeef products, because they were treated with a growth stimulant. \nEurope has decided not to abide by the World Trade Organization \ndecision, so the United States, over the last 2 years, has imposed \nsanctions against Europe.\n  Would it be surprising to you if the U.S. Government does not respond \npositively to the World Trade Organization ruling and then Europe \nwould, in fact, put sanctions against American products? They have \nalready done that. Starting March 1, there has been a 5-percent \nincrease in sanctions. We are going to have a 1-percent increase each \nmonth that we do not repeal this legislation. By November that would be \nin effect a 12-percent sales tax on American products going overseas to \nEurope.\n  It is very difficult for the United States to compete when we have a \nlevel playing field, but when we have a 12-percent add-on you can see \nthat eventually some companies are going to become uncompetitive and, \nas a result, workers will be laid off.\n  What we want this legislation to do is not only avoid these \nsanctions, but we want to put American manufacturing in more of a \ncompetitive environment than it is in presently by reducing the \ncorporate tax rate on companies that export if the manufacturing is \ndone within the United States of America.\n  We have, potentially, by November, sanctions of 12 percent on \nAmerican products. This is a very serious threat to all Members because \nsanctions are going to hit agricultural products, timber products, and \neven manufacturing products. We need to get this issue behind us before \nMemorial Day or sooner or we will never be able to get this bill to the \nPresident for signature.\n  I wanted to act on this bill last year because I was fearful politics \nwould get in the way of the Senate's ability to do the job. Obviously, \nthe closer you get to the election, the more there is an opportunity \nfor politics to interfere.\n  The opening debate and shenanigans we had 2 weeks ago when we first \ntook up this bill confirmed my worst fears. Some on the other side want \nto play politics with this bipartisan bill. Senator Baucus and I had an \nagreed order of amendments that would have improved the bill and \nbrought up important, relevant issues. That agreement was undermined by \nthe other side, particularly the leadership on the other side. The \nleadership does not really want to debate the substance of this bill. \nYet they would say it is very important to get this bill passed.\n  We hear a lot about not creating enough jobs in the economy in this \nrecovery. This is our opportunity to create jobs. I would think \neverybody would want to get this bill passed. Instead, it seems this \nbipartisan bill is being turned into a political football.\n  I am hopeful everybody on the other side of the aisle will see the \nbest policy is also very good politics. That is what we have with this \nbill. We help domestic manufacturers; we help U.S. companies compete \noverseas. Putting politics ahead of good policy is exactly the wrong \napproach.\n  In effect, this political game does not help those who face \nsanctions. In other words, jobs in the industries and the products that \nhave already been identified by Europe for sanctions are going to be in \njeopardy. Particularly where we have so much problem competing with the \nglobal competition we have, it doesn't help our domestic manufacturers \nand workers, in manufacturing as well as other segments of the economy.\n  As I said before, I hope the Democratic leadership will focus on the \ntask at hand and not play politics with this very important bipartisan \npiece of legislation.\n  With that procedural point I wanted to make behind us, I wish to \nspeak specifically as a reminder to my colleagues of some of the \nimportant features of this legislation. Repealing FSC/ETI, as the World \nTrade Organization has ruled against the United States and implied that \nwe need to get our laws in tune with our international obligations, the \nrepeal raises around $55 billion over 10 years, and 89 percent of that \n$55 billion comes from manufacturing industries. If that money is not \nsent back to the manufacturing sector,\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nit will be a $50 billion tax increase on manufacturing. You know one of \nthe simple rules of economics 101--you tax something more, you get less \nof it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office then says we have lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs since the manufacturing decline started in the last \nyear of the Clinton administration--in other words, since the middle of \nJuly. A $50 billion tax increase now on that manufacturing obviously is \nnot going to stimulate manufacturing jobs.\n  The bill before us uses all the money that is raised from the FSC/ETI \nrepeal to put back into manufacturing, giving manufacturing \ncorporations and self-proprietorships and other business entities a 3-\npercentage point tax rate reduction on all income derived from \nmanufacturing in the United States.\n  This is not meant to help--and will not help--because our bill is not \nwritten this way to help manufacturing done offshore. We start phasing \nin these tax cuts this year. The cuts apply to different business \nentities, sole proprietors, partnerships, farmers, individuals, family \nbusinesses, multinational corporations, or foreign corporations that \nset up manufacturing plants in the United States but only if they set \nup their manufacturing plants in the United States. We are not doing \nanything in this bill to export jobs overseas; just the opposite. What \nwe are doing is meant to create jobs and preserve jobs in manufacturing \nin the United States, and to give the benefit to American-based \ncompanies or foreign corporations based in America that are creating \njobs here.\n  Our bill also includes the Homeland Reinvestment Act, which has broad \nsupport in the House and Senate. The finance bill is also revenue \nneutral. That is very important because it seems to be an unwritten \nrule in the Senate--maybe not one that I entirely agree with, but if we \nare going to get anything done in a bipartisan way when it deals with \ntax reform, it has to be revenue neutral.\n  This bill, as amended, provides over $130 billion in business tax \nrelief, but it is paid for by extending customs user fees and, most \nimportantly, by shutting down corporate tax shelters and abusive \nloopholes.\n  It is an unwritten rule in the Senate, as I said, for revenue \nneutrality. So we have gone beyond the $50 billion to $130 billion of \ntax changes but offsetting it totally with money raised from FSC/ETI, \nfrom customs user fees, and, most importantly, doing something that \nought to be done with or without this bill--shutting down these tax \nshelters and abusive loopholes.\n  As all bills, there is never complete agreement on an approach. Our \nbill contains a temporary haircut on rate reduction that some of us \nwould like to remove and others of us would like to retain. Some \nMembers prefer a reduction in the top corporate rate in place of \ninternational reforms and a rate reduction applying just to \nmanufacturing. These Members would say you ought to treat all \ncorporations the same. If all corporations were being impacted with a \nWTO ruling in the same way, whether manufacturing or not, I would \nagree. We are talking about basically manufacturing and at least 89 \npercent of the revenues coming in. We say we want to keep our \nmanufacturing competitive. We are going to pour most of the benefits of \nthis legislation back into the manufacturing sector.\n  Those on the other side say it ought to be across the board, \naffecting all corporations. There is a desire on the other side for a \nsimpler approach by just cutting taxes across the board, but a top \nlevel rate cut would only go to the biggest corporations of America. \nLocal family held S corporations or partnerships which presently get \nsome ETI benefits would get nothing from that approach. If we redirect \nthe FSC/ETI money to an across-the-board corporate cut, then the \nmanufacturing sector will be the revenue offset for the services sector \ntax cut.\n  The international tax reforms largely fix problems our domestic \ncompanies face with the complexities of the foreign tax credit. These \nreforms are necessary if we are to level the playing field for U.S. \ncompanies that compete with our trading partners.\n  The Finance Committee's bipartisan bill has been improved with an \namendment to extend the research and development tax credit through the \nend of year 2005. That is a domestic tax benefit which is an incentive \nto research and development. This translates also into good, high-\npaying jobs for workers in the United States and not overseas. Plus, it \nis an incentive for research and development which is going to keep our \nindustries competitive with the highly educated workforces of Russia, \nChina, and India where we are finding increasing competition. We need \nto keep up with these others.\n\n  America has no reason to be timid about the competitiveness of our \nworkforce--the competitiveness of our workers from the standpoint of \nour educational commitment and our educational attainment. We have \nnothing to worry about when it involves our research leading us to new \nindustries not of this decade but for the next decade. America has a \nvery flexible economy. We can compete. Anyone who says we can't compete \nis a defeatist. I am not a defeatist when it comes to America's ability \nto be ahead of the rest of the world as we have been for the last 100 \nyears in almost every aspect of our economy. The research and \ndevelopment part of this bill is surely something that is going to help \nus continue to do that.\n  In addition to the previously agreed upon research and development \namendment, there are several additional amendments pending which will \nsubstantially improve this bill. First is an amendment offered by \nSenators Bunning and Stabenow to accelerate the manufacturing \ndeduction. This amendment assures that the tax relief and related \neconomic benefits of the bill are provided more quickly to those hurt \nby the repeal of FSC/ETI.\n  Second, I have offered an amendment with Senator Baucus to extend the \n2-year tax provisions which expired in the years 2003-2004. This \nincludes items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-\nto-work tax credit which have been merged and simplified into a single \ncredit as proposed by Senator Santorum and others in the bill, S. 1180.\n  A third pending amendment on net operating losses should also be \nincluded. This amendment allows companies that operated at losses \nduring the difficult economic conditions of last year to offset those \nlosses against their income for the previous 5 years. This provision \nwould accelerate tax relief to companies that need to continue \noperations and recover from recent difficulties.\n  I ask my colleagues: Let us get on with the business at hand. Have \nthis institution be what it traditionally has been. Yes. An institution \nwhere everything is thoroughly discussed as it ought to be because this \nis the only institution where that can be done in our American \npolitical system. But it is also an institution that moves along and \ndoesn't stymie legislation. We know our responsibilities are to the \ntaxpayers of this country to produce a good product and produce it \nquickly. If we think of the best policy, we will in fact have the best \npolitics. Let's put good economic policy ahead of shortsighted \npolitics.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I take a couple of moments to discuss the \npending second-degree amendment, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Bayh. It is an excellent amendment. It is \nsomewhat broad in scope. I commend Senator Bayh for suggesting this. My \nguess is it will be adopted without too much difficulty.\n  I have been pushing for a long time, and I know the chairman of the \ncommittee has, as well, the package of extenders. We have crafted the \nunderlying JOBS bill to create jobs and to stimulate competitiveness in \nAmerican business. In addition to the new provisions in the bill, it is \ncritical we renew our past commitments in the Tax Code and not leave \nanyone behind. I am talking about the so-called package of tax \nextenders.\n  We failed last year to extend many expired or expiring tax provisions \nthat are essential. We now have another chance. That is the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Indiana, not only to extend these \nprovisions, but also to improve upon them.\n  When we were last on the bill, the Senate acted to improve one of the \nprovisions, the research and development\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\ntax credit. This was the first of many positive steps we need to take \nto fix an ailing economy. Encouraging research and development clearly \nis one of the most important forward looking actions we could take. Why \nis that so important? It is the underlying basis for improving \ninnovation and for addressing the offshoring of American jobs.\n  In addition, there are many other provisions commonly referred to as \nextenders. They all address the needs of our Nation. These are not \ncontentious. They are not partisan. Rather, they are provisions that \njust make good sense.\n  The chairman and I pushed to have these same provisions extended last \nyear. We urged our colleagues not to wait until the last minute before \nthese provisions were expired. We wanted to move right away.\n  These provisions are like a yo-yo. We enact them. We extend them for \nseveral months, sometimes a year or a year and a half, we let them \nexpire. After they have expired, sometimes we go back and reenact them \nretroactively and there is no break. Sometimes we do not reenact them \nretroactively. It is very poor policy.\n  I personally believe all these provisions should be enacted \npermanently into the Tax Code. We should not have the on-again, off-\nagain, up-and-down, yo-yo effect Congress has undertaken in addressing \nthese provisions. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are \nnot making these permanent. Nevertheless, they are not, and taxpayers \nhave suffered often from lapsed provisions. We have let them down. I \nhope we do not do that again. The time has now come to extend these \nprovisions. If we do not act now, there is no telling when our next \nopportunity will be.\n  In this package there are many good provisions that have already \nexpired. They are widely supported. The expiring provisions include a \ndiverse array of topics and all are important. One of the most \nimportant expiring provisions we must address is the one allowing for \nthe carryback of net operating losses, otherwise known as NOLs. In the \nwake of prolonged economic downturn and the recent ruling by the WTO, \nit is very important we give American businesses a chance to recover \ntheir losses. Like the underlying JOBS bill, this provision also \npromotes economic growth.\n\n  Two other important provisions are the work opportunity tax credit, \nsometimes known as WOTC, and the welfare-to-work tax credit. I have \nworked long and hard with many of my colleagues--especially Senator \nSantorum, Senator Bayh; both Senators worked very hard--for the \nprovisions to make the credits permanent. Unfortunately, we cannot \nachieve permanence at this point, but neither can we afford to let this \nopportunity pass.\n  The work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit \nare proven initiatives that help economically disadvantaged workers get \njobs. They help those receiving the welfare check to earn a paycheck. \nThat is very important. These provisions very much help get people off \nwelfare and to get jobs. Both of the credits expired in 2003 in \nDecember.\n  As we consider ways to create jobs for Americans, it is only \nappropriate to consider what these tax credits have done for both \nemployees and employers across our country. In a recent study, it is \nshown in New York State the work opportunity tax credit generates \neconomic benefits that exceed the cost of the program. These programs \nare too valuable to fall by the wayside.\n  This amendment, including the extenders, will simplify and strengthen \nthe credits to expand unemployment opportunities for disadvantaged \nindividuals and attract more employers to participate in the program.\n  Along with these are other provisions that help raise the standard of \nliving in America now and in the future. Individual credits against the \nalternative minimum tax provide for such things as lifetime learning \ncredit, the HOPE scholarship, and care for the elderly and disabled. \nThese provisions not only create incentives for education but also help \nfamilies build a stronger financial base.\n  Other benefits to be gained from this important extenders package \ninclude encouraging computer contributions to schools, economic \nrecovery provisions in the wake of September 11, deductions for school \nteachers, and energy incentives for the environment. And the list goes \non.\n  These tax incentives make America a better place, a better place for \njobs, education, health care, environment, and more. Now is the time to \nact. We must not let these essential parts of our Tax Code fall by the \nwayside.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment \noffered by the Senator from Indiana, Senator Bayh, and others. Like the \nJOBS bill itself, these provisions will help make important \ncontributions to American business and to American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will speak as in morning business and \nI will yield the floor for anyone who wants to speak on the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will deal with the issue of the \nenergy bill in the context of where we left off last November, two \nvotes short of stopping a filibuster against the legislation so it \ncould be passed. That means we had 58 votes. We needed two more. We \ncannot get two more votes. Therefore, the bill still languishes.\n  It was the first major energy policy for probably 15 years as far as \nthe Federal Government passing one is concerned, and things are a lot \nscarier now than they were last November. Now we have what are the \nhighest gasoline prices in the history of our country, just slightly \nabove where they were a year ago, and previous to that a couple times \nin the late 1990s or the early part of this century. In other words, \nover the last 4 or 5 years they have probably been almost as high three \nor four times. We also have, different than at most times, very high \nnatural gas prices.\n  The impact in the economy is very negative, as we know. The impact \nupon low-income families is very bad, as we know. It is a shame we \ncould not get that bill passed last November. I hope we can get one \npassed very shortly. In fact, I had hoped the high natural gas prices \nand gasoline prices we faced would be an impetus to any Member in this \nbody. Of the 42 who did not vote to stop debate, hopefully these \nMembers will see the need for passing this energy legislation to help \nthe economy, to help the consumers of America, to move this economy \nalong.\n  I recall over the last 4 or 5 years there have been high gasoline \nprices in the past and maybe not so high natural gas prices in the \npast, that there has been an outrage expressed on the floor of this \nSenate about those high gasoline prices--Members speaking about \ncollusion within the industry, Members asking the Department of Justice \nand the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether there was any \nanticompetitive activity, and tremendous outrage over the high prices.\n\n  Now that gasoline prices are higher, I would guess I would hear that \nsame outrage. But we are not hearing it. I wonder if we are not hearing \nit because so many Members on the other side of the aisle were part of \nthe filibuster against the energy bill last year, and they are ashamed \nwhen they had an opportunity to do something to bring an energy policy \nto America they did not do it.\n  That energy policy was one that was well balanced between tax \nincentives for the production of fossil fuel, tax incentives for the \nconservation of energy, and tax incentives for alternative and \nrenewable fuels--a very well-balanced piece of legislation, legislation \nI would say was well balanced to meet the immediate needs of our \ncountry, which are best met by the fossil fuels we have been using for \nmore than 100 years to take care of the near term but also well \nbalanced for the outyears. Obviously, since God only made so much \nfossil fuel, and it is finite, the dependence on renewable and \nalternative fuels, as well as incentives for conservation, is the \npattern for the future if we are going to have a sound energy policy.\n  This package, put together by Senator Domenici, is well balanced and \nhad the good fortune of having so many of these tax incentives involved \nthat came out of my Senate Finance Committee in a bipartisan way.\n  So why not the outrage now? We keep hearing so much debate during\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\nthe bill that is before us, and during morning business by Members, \nparticularly of the other party, about the problems we are having \ncreating jobs, the problems we are having with the Nation's economy.\n  There might be a difference of opinion whether the economy is doing \nwell, but there are a lot of statistics that show it is doing well with \nthe 8.2 percent growth for the third quarter of 2003, and the 4.1 \npercent growth for the fourth quarter of 2003, and unemployment holding \nsteady at 5.6 percent. But we are still hearing the outrage that jobs \nare not being created. And who can argue that if you are unemployed and \nwant a job you ought not have a job? You would expect to have a job \nwith an economy growing where it is now and with the fabulously low \nrate of unemployment of 5.6 percent, because seldom have we had that \nlow a rate of unemployment in the last 40 years. A national energy \npolicy would surely help us with the creation of jobs.\n  So you can ask, where are the jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs? \nOne factor affecting the manufacturing industry and, in turn, the \neconomy in general I have not heard mentioned during the debate is the \nrising cost of energy. The fact is, the rising energy costs continue to \nbe a drag on our economy.\n  In January, consumer prices jumped one-half of 1 percent, and that \nwas only because, as small as that is, of higher energy costs. In fact, \nenergy costs rose 4.7 percent, accounting for more than three-quarters \nof the overall increase in consumer prices.\n  Crude oil for April delivery is over $36 a barrel on the New York \nMercantile Exchange. Gas prices at the pump around the Nation are at \nrecord highs. Nationally, a gallon of regular gasoline averages $1.74. \nThat is 2 cents higher than at this time last year.\n\n  Why are energy prices so high? Well, global demand for crude oil is \nincreasing because of greater demand not only in the United States but \nbecause of a higher percentage of demand in Japan and China.\n  OPEC, which supplies 40 percent of the world's oil, recently \nannounced they intend to cut production by 1 million barrels a day \nstarting April 1. That is obviously going to push prices yet higher. \nThis is from OPEC, an organization that has repeatedly stated their \ngoal is to keep prices somewhere between $22 and $28 a barrel, not now \nsatisfied with $36 a barrel. Because we are so dependent upon foreign \ncountries for over 60 percent of our crude oil, I think they have \ngotten us--meaning OPEC has gotten the United States--over a barrel.\n  We have also seen a sustained increase in the demand and cost of \nnatural gas. Because natural gas is now the fuel of choice for new \nelectricity generation, the demand for natural gas is no longer \nseasonal. While our existing policies in Washington have created the \nincreased demand for natural gas, we have done very little to ensure a \ndomestic supply to meet that demand.\n  In fact, the increased exploration is not bringing in enough new \nnatural gas online to keep up with the increased needs we have in this \ncountry. Hence, as you understand economics 101, when supply is down, \nprice is up; hence, higher natural gas prices.\n  The fact is, high fuel prices remain a concern for transportation \nfirms. High energy prices hurt steel mills, manufacturers, farmers, and \neventually end up hurting all consumers. High energy prices cost \nAmerican jobs. Unless we increase supply, we are going to see record \nhigh prices again this year, and we are going to see a continued drag \non the American economy.\n  We need to help the manufacturing and agricultural industries save \nexisting jobs and go beyond that to create new jobs. We need to lower \nour Nation's energy costs.\n  What are the alternatives? We could and should apply pressure to \nmembers of OPEC to increase supplies. Some have suggested releasing \ncrude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase supply and \ndrive down prices.\n  I believe we can and must take action in the Senate to address rising \nenergy costs. As my colleagues know, we have been considering a \ncomprehensive energy bill in this Chamber for over a period of 3 years \nnow, with the most progress made last year when we had a bill pass the \nHouse, a bill pass the Senate, a bill come successfully out of \nconference committee, and overwhelmingly pass the House of \nRepresentatives, but being defeated or at least stalled here on the \nfloor of the Senate last November when we came up two votes short of \nstopping debate, to stop the filibuster, to get to finality. So it is \nquite obvious we have the votes to pass an energy bill in the Senate.\n  It is a shame we cannot get over that hurdle of 60 votes to get this \nbill there, to get us on the road to greater self-sufficiency with \nenergy as we try to do it through a combination of incentives for \nfossil fuel production, incentives for energy conservation, and for \nalternative and renewable fuels. That conference committee agreement \nwas voted on last November. Unfortunately, we had a minority of \nSenators successful in filibustering the bill.\n  I strongly support the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator \nDomenici, in his efforts, then as well as now, to move this bill \nforward or, short of moving it forward, a bill of a similar nature to \nstart over as hopefully one way of getting around a Democratic \nfilibuster.\n  I am pleased Senator Domenici has introduced a slimmed-down bill that \naddresses the major concerns that prevented the Senate from adopting \nthe conference report. This bill goes a long way toward increasing \ndomestic energy production of conventional energy such as oil, natural \ngas, and nuclear power. The bill includes provisions to improve the tax \ntreatment of natural gas gathering and distribution lines. It includes \nincentives for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska \nto markets in the lower 48. The bill seeks to improve our Nation's \nelectricity transmission capacity and reliability by creating \nenforceable and mandatory reliability standards and providing \nincentives for transmission grid improvements.\n  It also includes a number of provisions that would increase domestic \nproduction of renewable energy and create jobs at home. Through the \nrenewable fuels standard, it would double the use of domestic homegrown \nethanol, a first-time tax incentive for biodiesel to be made from \nsoybeans.\n  It would also bring new sources of energy on line. It would extend \nthe wind energy production tax credit that I first got through the \nSenate in 1992. It would have an expansion of the production tax credit \nfor biomass and a tax incentive for purchases of residential solar and \nwind energy equipment.\n  Each of these provisions will increase our production of domestic \nrenewable energy resources. They will also create thousands--some \npeople have estimated 800,000--of jobs all across our country.\n  The bill also includes incentives for energy-efficient improvements \nto existing homes and for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. \nThese initiatives will lead to an increased domestic supply of energy, \na more stable economy, and thousands of jobs for America's workers. \nMake no mistake about it, this energy bill is a jobs bill.\n  As I indicated, these provisions are in a new bill that Senator \nDomenici is trying to move along. But the ideal way to handle this \nwould be to get two more votes to bring to an end the filibuster of the \nbill that was before the Senate last November because all of these \nprovisions are included in that bill. There is no reason to start all \nover again, particularly when now, compared to last November, we have \nthe highest price for gasoline in the history of our country, and we \nstill have outrageously high prices for natural gas.\n  It is time this country has a national energy policy. There is no \nreason two Senators who are in the minority should stand in the way of \nmoving this legislation along, legislation that passed the House and \nSenate overwhelmingly last year, came out of conference after about 2 \nmonths of work on putting together a compromise that could get an \noverwhelming vote in the House of Representatives and get a vast \nmajority vote in the Senate, but two votes short of the 60, the \nextraordinary supermajority it takes to stop a filibuster. I don't \nunderstand why we have Democrats from corn States, with everything this \nbill does for the production of ethanol that would help the farmers of \ntheir States, and also help the energy needs of our Nation, how\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nany Senator who is from a big corn-producing State could dare vote not \nto end this filibuster.\n\n  There are votes out there from members of the other party, from corn-\nproducing States, who ought to explain to their constituents why they \nwon't join in this effort with other farm State Senators to bring \nmassively on line the production of ethanol that can help us be more \nenergy independent from OPEC nations, particularly in a time when \nAmericans are shedding blood in Iraq because we need some stability in \nthe Middle East to guarantee oil coming to our country. Obviously, the \nblood I am talking about is shed because of the war we are in, the war \nto defeat terrorism against Americans, against western culture, but \nalso the sort of democracy we can have in the Middle East brings \nstability that we don't have there now. And it is important to have \nthat stability for the economic needs of our country.\n  I don't know why we can't get some votes from some farm State \nDemocrats. We only need two of about half a dozen, whom we could easily \nidentify, who should be voting with us to bring finality to this issue.\n  I believe these bills on energy, because we have this pending bill \nbefore the Senate and we have the conference report that is through the \nHouse and two votes short of getting to finality in the Senate last \nNovember--whichever one you are talking about--I believe these bills \nrepresent a comprehensive energy policy consisting of conservation \nefforts, the development of renewable and alternative energy sources, \nand domestic production of traditional sources of energy. This bill \ngoes a long way to develop an energy policy that will drive down the \ncost of energy and create jobs at home so that we don't have to have \nthe outrage that we have on the Senate floor, primarily from members of \nthe other party, over 3 out of the last 5 years when energy prices have \nbeen so high. Why don't we do something about it? We have an \nopportunity. We don't seem to grasp it now when it is here.\n  This bill is too important to our economy to let it die. Therefore, I \nstrongly encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to help our \nleadership bring either the conference committee up for a vote on the \nissue of stopping debate or the new bill that Senator Domenici has \nplaced before the Senate, to bring it to the floor and consider it in a \ntimely manner, and timely is already probably 3 months late as we have \nseen the energy prices go up to the highest level, hurting our economy. \nWe can and should come to an agreement so we can consider and pass this \nJOBS bill as soon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I know we are a little stalled on the \nfloor right now. There is an underlying amendment to the bill, and then \nthere is a second degree that is now trying to be worked out having to \ndo with tax extenders. I understand there may even be yet another \nsecond degree into this package.\n  I know the leadership has said there will be no votes today. I \nunderstand that. But I ask the Presiding Officer, is there now pending \na unanimous consent agreement that after the disposition of the pending \namendment, and any amendments thereto, that Senator Daschle or his \ndesignee would then be recognized to offer an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement does authorize the leader or his \ndesignee to offer the next first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer because that was my \nunderstanding: that upon the disposition of the pending amendment, and \nany amendments thereto--any second degrees--then Senator Daschle would \nbe recognized, or his designee, in which case he is designating me to \noffer the overtime amendment.\n  Now, I was here the other day, and I was going to offer the overtime \namendment as a second degree to the underlying amendment, but then \nSenator Grassley got recognized, as is his right as the chairman of the \ncommittee, to offer a second degree, and that now is what is pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  I take the floor this afternoon to once again state how urgently \nnecessary it is that we proceed to consideration of my amendment \nregarding the administration's proposed changes of the rules on \novertime.\n  To recapture what has transpired, about a year ago, the Department of \nLabor issued proposed regulations that would fundamentally change how \nemployers pay overtime to people who work over 40 hours a week. These \nproposed regulations came forth without having one public hearing, \nperhaps the most substantial change in our overtime laws since 1938 \nwhen they were adopted under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  You would think if any administration wanted to really change how \novertime is paid, they would have gone around the country and had \npublic hearings. This is normally what you do. No. These were issued \nwithout one public hearing.\n  Now that the proposed regulations have been out there, the Department \nof Labor has heard from America. I understand tens of thousands, maybe \nas high as 70 or 80,000, comments have come in on these proposed \nregulations. Still the administration has not seen fit to have public \nhearings about it. I think they thought they could do it quietly. This \nis a fundamental alteration, the biggest alteration since 1938 when the \nFair Labor Standards Act was passed.\n  Last year I offered an amendment to an appropriations bill that would \nhave denied the right of the administration to issue the proposed \nregulations and would have forced the administration to work with \nCongress, to have hearings and come up with a reasonable approach to \nchanging overtime rules. That amendment was adopted by the Senate on a \nbipartisan vote. The House of Representatives soon after had a vote on \nwhat they call instructing their conferees, which is basically a vote \nto say we agree with the Senate and this is what we want in the final \nbill. That passed the House of Representatives.\n  So they went into conference between the House and the Senate with my \namendment intact. Somehow it never made it to the final bill. The \nadministration came into the conference and said it had to be taken \nout. It was thrown out. And, of course, the Omnibus appropriations bill \nwe vote on, as you know, cannot be amended. So, therefore, we were \nfaced with an up-or-down vote on the bill without this amendment. We \nhad to vote to keep the Government operating, to pay our troops in \nIraq, and everything else.\n  I said at the time this is too important a matter just to forget \nabout and move on. So when the Senate came back into session in January \nof this year, I immediately took to the floor and said: At the first \nopportunity, I will offer this amendment again. The American people now \nhave heard about it, and they know about it. They are beginning to \nunderstand what it means to them and their jobs to have these changes \ngo into effect. I believe the votes are here, once again, to say to the \nadministration: No, don't take away the right of people to get time-\nand-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours a week.\n  By some estimates, up to 8 million American workers would have their \nright to overtime pay taken away. So I have said I would offer this \namendment on this bill. They call this a jobs bill. Well, this \namendment is about jobs. It is about not only protecting jobs and \novertime pay, but it is about creating jobs.\n  I believe it is necessary to proceed to consideration of this \namendment so that the administration, once again, will understand that \nprior to any final regulations being issued, they need to go back to \nthe drawing board, hear from the public, work with Congress, as other \nCongresses have done. Since 1938, we have amended the Fair Labor \nStandards Act maybe a dozen times, but it has always been done in \nconjunction with Congress, Congress and the administration working \ntogether to come up with reasonable amendments to the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. There is nothing wrong with that. Times change. \nConditions change. This should be done periodically.\n\n  But this administration did not do that. They just drafted these \nunder the\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\ncover of darkness, issued them and said: We are going to take away the \nright of about 8 million Americans to overtime pay.\n  So it is appropriate that we debate and vote on my amendment on the \nFSC JOBS bill because my amendment is about one thing--jobs. These new \novertime rules will eliminate time-and-a-half overtime pay for up to 8 \nmillion American workers. But, again, it is not just about eliminating \novertime pay. These proposed rules will retard the creation of new \njobs. This is just basic logic. If employers can more easily deny \novertime pay, they will push their current employees to work longer \nhours without compensation. With 9 million Americans currently out of \nwork, why would you give an employer yet another disincentive to hire \nnew workers. Yet that is exactly why the administration is pushing \nthese new overtime rules. This is why these proposed new rules have the \nsupport of some major business groups in America but not all.\n  I always like to point out that I represent a lot of businesses in my \nState of Iowa--good, healthy, productive businesses. Not one business \nin my State of Iowa has come to me saying we need to change the \novertime rules, not one. I am wondering, where is this coming from?\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says, well, they will \nreduce labor costs. It will reduce the need to hire new workers. It \nwill have a direct destructive impact on jobs in the United States.\n  So let's be clear. My amendment on overtime is about creating jobs, \novercoming the stagnant job market. And, yes, it is about making sure \nwe protect the time-honored right to overtime pay when you work over 40 \nhours a week.\n  There was an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal which I \nthink summed it up. It says: Shortchanged. Many firms refuse to pay for \novertime. Employees complain. Others claim workers are exempt under the \nlaw or raise output targets, but the rules are confusing.\n  Here is the quote:\n\n     . . . While employees like overtime pay, a lot of employers \n     don't. That is no surprise. Violations are so common that the \n     Employer Policy Foundation, an employer supported think tank \n     in Washington, estimates that workers would get an additional \n     $19 billion a year if the rules were observed. That estimate \n     is considered conservative by many researchers.\n\n  In plain English, the Employer Policy Foundation, an employer-\nsupported think tank in Washington, is basically saying American \nworkers are being cheated out of $19 billion a year because they are \nworking overtime and they are not getting paid for it right now.\n  Well, guess what happened, Madam President. A couple of these \ncompanies got caught. They got taken to court. They appealed and the \nappeals court found for the employees. One famous case on the west \ncoast is where employees were clocking out of work after working an 8-\nhour day, and they were being forced to come right back in the door and \nwork longer hours. Well, they got caught. More and more employers were \ngetting caught.\n  So now what they want to do is change the rules. They want to work \nyou longer. They want to work you more than 40 hours a week, but they \ndon't want to pay you overtime. That is what the Wall Street Journal \nsaid.\n  So rather than being confronted with the fact that they might be \ntaken to court, they change the rules. Now there won't be any court \ncase. That is what the administration's proposal on overtime is all \nabout. It is about taking away the rights of people.\n  You know, I had a quote that I will bring up in further debate on \nthis amendment. One worker--a woman, if I am not mistaken--said \nsomething I thought was very poignant. She said:\n\n  My time with my kids and my family in the evenings and on the \nweekends is premium time to me. If I am being asked to give up my \npremium time with my kids and my family, then I think I ought to get \npremium pay. That is what overtime is about.\n  They are asking you to give up your premium time with your family, \nyour children, to work overtime. You ought to get premium pay, which is \nwhat time and a half is all about. Again, the Bush administration \nthought they could put these new rules into effect quietly, with no \nhearings, before anybody knew what was going on. They were wrong. They \ngot caught. The fact is, public outrage over the proposed new overtime \nrules has gotten stronger and stronger as Americans learn more about \nthe details. They want these proposed rules to be stopped.\n  I understand if the other side, the Republican side, can drag this \nout and prevent a vote, well, then maybe in the next month or so they \ncan issue these final rules taking away overtime pay, and then it will \nbe very hard to undo that later on. They know that. That is why they \ndon't want a vote on this amendment. That is why the other side is \ndoing everything they can to keep me from getting a vote.\n  Madam President, we are not going to be quiet about it. This is the \neditorial from the New York Times: ``The Quiet Shift In Overtime.''\n  It says:\n\n       The Bush administration is engineering bread and butter \n     changes in the Federal regulation of overtime pay. . . .\n       The proposed Labor Department regulations have stirred \n     justifiable concerns.\n       They are being presented by the Labor Department as overdue \n     improvements.\n\n  But as they are doing it, as they said, they are doing it quietly, \nbehind the scenes.\n\n       More problematical is the possibility that more workers--\n     millions, according to pro-labor analysts--could be forced \n     into unpaid overtime under the regulations, which do not \n     affect blue collar workers. By some estimates, veterans, \n     police detectives, or senior nurses might lose overtime \n     compensation that now accounts for as much as 25 percent of \n     their salaries.\n\n  They thought they could do it quietly, but the more we learned about \nit, we found that the American people were not going to sit by and let \npremium time with their families be taken away, being forced to work \nlonger hours for regular pay.\n  With so many people unemployed, you would think you would want to \ncreate jobs. These proposed rules on overtime will be a disincentive to \ncreating any new jobs.\n  Madam President, I hope we can get to my amendment. I will have more \nto say about it. I have more data and details I wish to bring out. For \nexample, one thing I brought out before, since 1938, there has been a \nclassification of learned professions, such as lawyers, doctors, \narchitects, things like that--the learned professions, which were \nexempt from overtime. In all of the regulations since that time, there \nhas never been any inclusion in the learned professions of what an \nindividual learned while serving in the U.S. military. It wasn't until \ngoing through these proposed regulations with a fine-tooth comb that we \ndiscovered there were inserted into these proposed regulations four or \nfive words about what these learned professions--as it goes through \nthem all--learned while in the military, military training.\n  That had never been in the regulations before--never. Why were those \nin there? Here it is right on this chart. These are the changes, the \nnew part of the regulations that had never been there before:\n\n       However, the word customarily means that the exemption is \n     also available to employees in such professions and \n     substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed \n     employees, but who attain such knowledge through a \n     combination of work experience, training in the Armed Forces, \n     attending a technical school, attending a community college, \n     or other intellectual instruction.\n\n  What is different? ``Training in the Armed Forces'' has never been in \nthese rules before. So when we see all these ads saying ``join the Army \nand be all you can be,'' they talk about all the nice technical \ntraining you can get while you are in the military. What they are not \ntelling you now is, if you do that, after you get out of the military, \nyou will be exempt from overtime pay because of what you learned while \nyou were in the military.\n  So we could have a situation where we have two individuals: one goes \nto the military and gets training and the other doesn't. They come out \nand they could have substantially the same kind of jobs. One could have \nhad on-the-job training and one learned in the military. Both are \nbasically equal. The person who served in the military gets cheated out \nof overtime, but the person who wasn't in the military would be able to \nget overtime. What kind of sense does that make? But it is in there.\n  ``Training in the Armed Forces'' has never been in the rules since \n1938. We\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nfought World War II, the Korean war, the cold war, Vietnam war, and \nevery other war and we have never said to the men and women in uniform \nwhen they learn something in the military, we are going to take away \ntheir right to overtime. Why are we doing that now? Why are we doing \nthat?\n  Again, these are some of the hidden little things in this proposed \nregulation that need to be brought out, with scrutiny in the sunshine. \nLet people know about it. Again, I hope we can get to my amendment. It \nhas the overwhelming support of the American public. As more and more \nof them know about this, they don't want their right to be taken away. \nI have talked with workers who received no overtime last year, no \novertime pay. They were expressing to me how much they were opposed to \nthis proposed change in the rules.\n  I said: If you are not working overtime, why are you opposed?\n  They said: It is a right we have. We may not have gotten overtime, \nbut if I do work it, I want my right protected. That just about sums it \nup. It is a right that should not be taken away.\n\n  Again, it is urgent that we proceed to the overtime amendment. Let's \ngo to my amendment. Let's have a good debate. I am willing to have a \ntime agreement, if the other side would like to have a time agreement. \nLet's have the debate. I want to hear from the other side why we should \nlet these proposed regulations go into effect. Let's have the debate so \nthe American people can understand what is at stake, and let's have an \nup-or-down vote on my amendment. Let's have an up-or-down vote on \nwhether the Senate would agree with the administration that these \nproposed rules, these changes in the Fair Labor Standards Act, should \ngo into effect or whether the administration should go back to the \ndrawing board, work with Congress, do it in an open, aboveboard manner.\n  There are some changes that do need to be made in the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. There is one part of the proposed rules of which I am \nsupportive, and that is raising the base from about $8,000 a year to \n$22,000 a year. That should have been done a long time ago.\n  My amendment does not affect that. My amendment leaves that in place. \nBut in giving with one hand--that is, raising the base up to $22,000 a \nyear--the administration is taking away the right to overtime pay from \nabout 8 million Americans with the other hand. That is a bad deal.\n  I hope we can get to my amendment. I hope we can have a good debate \nand an up-or-down vote on it. I am prepared to do so whenever the \nleadership dispenses with these pending amendments.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            War on Terrorism\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, last night I observed, as I am sure \nmany Americans did, Richard Clarke's statement on the program ``60 \nMinutes'' where he made some very strong allegations concerning \nPresident Bush and his lack of effort on the war on terrorism. I was \nstruck by his tone, by his statements, and also by the lack of \nquestions concerning what he had done the previous years.\n  I believe Mr. Clarke was appointed in May of 1998 by President \nClinton as the first National Coordinator for Security Infrastructure \nProtection and Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. That \nis a very long title, but many people say ``counterterrorism czar.'' He \nwas the person to combat terrorism. That is a very prestigious \nposition, a very important position.\n  Looking at the events that occurred in 1998 and also in 2000, I \nwonder what we were doing. I kept waiting for the questioner to ask \nhim: Why didn't we do more?\n  On August 7, 1998, terrorists bombed the American embassies in \nNairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Madam President, 212 \npeople were killed on August 7, 1998, and over 4,000 people were \ninjured in Nairobi. Eleven people were killed and 72 people were \nwounded in Tanzania. It was a very deadly day.\n  Two U.S. embassies--that happens to be U.S. soil--a lot of people are \nnot aware of that but our embassies are U.S. soil. Those are U.S. \nbuildings, those were U.S. employees, some U.S. citizens--almost all \nU.S. employees. Africans were killed.\n  What was our response? The Clinton administration, with Mr. Clarke as \nthe head of counterterrorism, lobbed a few cruise missiles, supposedly \nto get Mr. bin Laden. We missed, but I compliment them for trying.\n  What else did we do? Did we try again? The answer is no. Did we send \nspecial forces over there? The answer is no. They killed 212 people in \nNairobi, 11 people in Tanzania, over 4,000 people injured, some of them \ncritically, very seriously injured, and what did we do? We lobbed a few \ncruise missiles and hit the desert. This was in August of 1998.\n  I kept waiting for the questioner to say: Why didn't we do more in \n1998? I heard him say: We were on a wartime footing; we had a lot of \nmeetings; I had a lot of face time with President Clinton; I talked \nwith him about it; we urged him to do more. Why didn't we do more?\n  I have only served with a few Presidents but I could not help but \nthink Ronald Reagan would have done more. We had American soldiers who \nwere killed as a result of a terrorist bombing in Germany, and Ronald \nReagan sent planes to Libya and sent a heck of a signal to Mr. Qadhafi \nand, frankly, I think he changed his terrorist ways to some extent.\n  I can't help but think President Bush 1 would have done more, and I \nknow President Bush 2, the current President, would have done a lot \nmore.\n  President Clinton was President for 8 years, and Mr. Clarke was head \nof his counterterrorism division for about 3 of those years. He worked \nin his administration in another capacity as well. But we didn't do \nhardly anything after the 1998 bombings, which was a direct assault on \nthe United States and our citizens, our people, our property, and two \npoor countries in Africa, and we did not do anything.\n  Later, the USS Cole was attacked on October 12, 2000, and 17 people \nwere killed, 39 were wounded, and it was pretty close to being a lot \nmore serious than that. We could have had hundreds killed. Again, that \nwas a direct attack on the United States. Mr. Clarke was still head of \ncounterterrorism, and what did we do then? The answer is nothing. They \nmight have had some meetings, but they did not do anything. They did \nnot do anything visible, anything we could see. They did not make \nconcerted efforts.\n  Last week, I was watching on TV a picture of bin Laden walking in \nAfghanistan where we had satellites viewing him, and we still did not \ndo anything. We did not have assets in the region. Why? We had plenty \nof time to put assets in the region to make a change and maybe prevent \n9/11/2001 from even happening, but maybe the administration and maybe \nMr. Clarke were preoccupied or they did not have it high on their \npriorities.\n  Those questions were not asked in this program. Maybe, for whatever \nreason, he has a vendetta against the current President. I don't know.\n  I also learned today from Condoleezza Rice, the President's National \nSecurity Adviser, that Mr. Clarke wanted a job in the new Department of \nHomeland Security. I don't know what caused his change. I don't know \nwhat his motivation is. I am not sure if he wants to sell books or is \nlooking for a job or what his efforts are. But I am amazed at the \nneglect or the lack of interest in the previous administration after we \nhad our embassies attacked, after we had the USS Cole attacked, and we \nhad Americans killed and hundreds of American employees killed.\n  We had thousands of people injured, and we did not do anything. For \nhim to have the gall or the nerve to start pointing a finger at \nPresident Bush saying he did not do enough in fighting the war on \nterrorism when Mr. Clarke was actually in a position to really do\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nsomething for 2 or 3 years during the Clinton administration, I find \nunbelievable. I cannot believe the press would not ask, why did he not \ndo more, why did President Clinton not do more? Why did we not respond? \nIf we would have responded in 1998, 1999, or 2000, maybe 9/11 would \nhave never happened. It is unbelievable that kind of attack would be \nmade. Maybe it is for political reasons. I do not know. It is very \nsobering and startling.\n  I hope when he is in front of the cameras or maybe when he is before \na committee in Congress people ask him why did he not do more when he \nwas in a position to do so.\n  It is also interesting to note on October 19, 2001, the Bush White \nHouse issued a press release saying Mr. Clarke was recently named \nspecial adviser to the President for cyberspace security. It is not the \nsame. The President has an excellent team and he receives counsel from \nan excellent team. With his national security adviser, Condoleezza \nRice, Vice President Dick Cheney, with Secretary of State Colin Powell, \nthe President has an excellent team in foreign policy.\n  I am very disappointed in Mr. Clarke's comments. I think he should be \nheld accountable and questions need to be asked of him.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nGrassley amendment No. 2687 be agreed to; provided further that I then \nbe immediately recognized to offer a further second degree related to \nnet operating loss. I further ask consent that the amendment then be \nagreed to, and the underlying amendment No. 2686 be agreed to, as \namended, with the motions to reconsider laid upon the table. I further \nask consent that Senator Harkin then be recognized in order to offer an \namendment relating to overtime; further, that no second degrees be in \norder to that amendment prior to a vote in relation to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I think this \nis tremendous progress. I commend the two managers of the bill. They do \nwork well together, as everyone knows. But I have heard--and I \ncertainly do not know if this is valid or not--there is going to be an \neffort made later tonight to try to invoke cloture on this bill. I want \neveryone within the sound of my voice to know we have spent time here \nthis afternoon with our manager, and we have indicated that we believe \nwe could whittle down significantly the number of amendments that are \npending on this very important piece of legislation.\n  The amendment Senator Harkin is going to offer is his amendment. We \nhave worked with the majority on other occasions to have him not offer \nthis amendment in an effort to get important legislation passed. We can \nno longer do that. It is long overdue that the Senate speaks on this \nissue. I can say, as I have indicated, to anyone listening, if there is \nan attempt to invoke cloture on this legislation without an up-or-down \nvote on the overtime amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, there \nare no guarantees, but I think it is going to be extremely difficult to \nhave cloture invoked on this bill.\n  We want an up-or-down vote on this overtime amendment. If there are \nefforts made later tonight to file a motion to invoke cloture, I think \nthe majority leader should know that I think it is extremely doubtful \nthat he would get cloture on this bill.\n  Senator Harkin has been talking about offering this amendment on \nseveral occasions, and we are going to go forward. As I said, I want \nthe majority leader to know that I think it would be extremely \ndoubtful, without an up-or-down vote on overtime, that he would be able \nto get cloture on this bill. I could be wrong, but I really kind of \ndoubt it.\n  I also want everyone to understand that the reason for taking this \nbill down is the inability of the minority to get a vote on this \novertime amendment. It seems somewhat foolish to pull down this very \nimportant bill for this amendment. I cannot imagine why the other side \nwon't let us vote. It has passed before. It will pass again. The \novertime amendment will pass.\n  So having said that, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2687) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2882 To Amendment No. 2686\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, then, according to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I send an amendment to the desk for Senators Bunning, \nLincoln, Santorum, Conrad, and Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Bunning, for \n     himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 2882 to amendment No. \n     2686.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the extension of the special net operating \n                       loss carryover provision)\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted at the end \n     of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I am happy to join with my colleagues in \noffering an amendment to address the net operating loss NOL rules in \nthe Internal Revenue Code. The NOL carryback and carryover rules are \ndesigned to allow taxpayers to ease swings in business income that \nresult from business cycle fluctuations and unexpected financial \nlosses.\n  I am certain that every Senator on the floor will admit that the last \nfew years have been difficult for many American companies. But we have \nfinally turned the corner and are headed to economic recovery. \nBusinesses are finally ready to reinvest in equipment and, more \nimportantly, create new jobs. The NOL provisions increase the cash flow \nof many struggling American companies and help them to hire and retain \nworkers and fund capital investments.\n  Under current law, companies may carry back NOL for 2 years. In the \nJob Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, however, we here in \nCongress recognized the difficult circumstances that many American \nbusinesses have found themselves in during recent years and have \ngranted them temporary relief by allowing NOL to be carried back for 5 \nyears, rather than 2. That 5-year carryback provision expired at the \nend of 2002.\n  I believe that it makes sense to extend the relief we have granted in \nthe past in the form of a 5-year NOL carryback for one additional year. \nWhile the economy started showing strong signs of economic recovery \nlast year, there were still many taxpayers who incurred unexpected \nfinancial losses in 2003. Now is not the time to roll back important \ntax provisions that are among the very reasons we are now on the road \nto economic recovery. We need to give American companies every \nopportunity to expand and invest.\n  I led the fight with my colleague, Senator Conrad, to extend the 5-\nyear carryback provision to 2003 when we passed the bill before us out \nof the Finance Committee with strong bipartisan support last fall. \nSenator Conrad and I were able to include in the Finance Committee-\napproved bill a 3-year carryback for 2003. The amendment I offer with \nmy colleagues today will expand upon what we achieved in committee by \nsimply returning the NOL carryback rule for 2003 to the 5-year period \nrather than the 3-year period currently provided for in this \nlegislation.\n  This important amendment will give much needed relief to U.S. \nemployers and provide an additional jump start to our economy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a fundamental feature of any income tax \nsystem is the ability to use losses to reduce taxable gains. If a \ncompany has gross income of $100,000 and losses of $50,000, we don't \nforce the company to pay tax on $100,000--they only pay tax on net \nincome.\n  But just as a company can have gross income and losses within the \nsame year, a company can also have income in one year and losses in the \nnext.\n  Letting companies ``carry-back'' their losses to prior years smooths \nthings out and helps companies deal with the hardships of the business \ncycle.\n  And it is important to be able to carry losses back. Carrying losses \nforward doesn't give taxpayers a boost when they need it.\n  Carrying losses forward only gives them a boost after things have \nalready turned around.\n  Many businesses have been in hard times for the last 3 or 4 years. \nGiving them a 1- or a 2-year NOL carryback doesn't help them--because \nthey don't have any profits in the last few years.\n  For many of these companies, the last year they were profitable was \n1999 or even earlier. These companies will be able to use a 5-year NOL \ncarryback to help them turn things around.\n  I urge you to support this amendment, to help get our economy going \nagain.\n  For example, the timber industry in Montana and many parts of the \nNorthwest was profitable in the late 1990s. But many of these timber \ncompanies--both large and small--have fallen on hard times in the last \nfew years. The terrorist attacks of 9/11, the economic downturn, and \nthe wildfires of last summer have taken their toll on these timber \ncompanies.\n  These companies paid large tax bills when things were going well. But \nhow that they are struggling they can't get any of those taxes back.\n  If they had a smoother, more consistent pattern of earnings, they \nwould have paid less tax over the course of the last 5 years. Instead, \nthe boom-bust cycle that has actually played out is giving them higher \ntax bills overall.\n  This NOL provision will ensure that these timber companies--and many \nother companies in cyclical industries--pay an appropriate amount of \ntax over time. It will give them a boost in those unprofitable years \nwhen they need it most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2882) was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2686\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the underlying \namendment, as amended.\n  Without objection, the amendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2686), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are laid upon the table.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2881\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2881 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2881.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify \n                  provisions relating to overtime pay)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTION OF OVERTIME PAY.\n\n       Section 13 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 213) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k)(1) The Secretary shall not promulgate any rule under \n     subsection (a)(1) that exempts from the overtime pay \n     provisions of section 7 any employee who would not be exempt \n     under regulations in effect on March 31, 2003.\n       ``(2) Any portion of a rule promulgated under subsection \n     (a)(1) after March 31, 2003, that exempts from the overtime \n     pay provisions of section 7 any employee who would not \n     otherwise be exempt if the regulations in effect on March 31, \n     2003, remained in effect, shall have no force or effect.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Iowa, the \nSenator from Montana, and also Senator Reid, our assistant leader on \nthis side, for working out this agreement. As I have said all along, \nall we want is debate and a vote on the overtime issue.\n  This is an important issue that has come to a head right now because \nthe administration shortly will be issuing final regulations on this \nissue without really having duly consulted with Congress. These \nregulations could take away the right to overtime pay for over 8 \nmillion American workers.\n  So I hope we can have a good debate on this, probably tomorrow--not \ntonight but tomorrow. Certainly I have discussed this with the Senator \nfrom Montana. We would be willing to enter into a time agreement.\n  I have heard some talk around that the other side, the Republican \nside, will now file a cloture motion. Obviously, if that cloture motion \nwins, then my amendment fails because it is ``nongermane.''\n  Now, we just saw--and I did not object to the amendments just being \nadopted which have to do with some extenders. There were some other \nthings added. Those are also nongermane to the bill. So the other side \ncannot make the argument that they are not going to allow nongermane\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\namendments to this bill. We just adopted a whole bunch of nongermane \namendments to this bill. So that is fine. We do that all the time \naround here.\n  I hope we can have a good debate on this overtime issue and have an \nup-or-down vote. I can assure the other side that if their goal is to \ncut off this amendment by filing a cloture motion, we will do all we \ncan on this side to deny cloture on this bill until we have a vote on \nthe overtime amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to the \ndebate tomorrow on overtime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the remarks \nof the Senator from Nevada. He mentioned the possibility of a cloture \nmotion. My colleague from Iowa also mentioned that possibility, and it \ncould be a possibility. But I hope that will not poison the waters as \nwe still try to reach agreement on this amendment and try to reach \nagreement on getting to finality on this bill.\n  I, along with Senator Baucus, have urged that we not have a cloture \nmotion. That, of course, is a leadership decision. I would urge my \ncolleagues to think in terms of the fact that it takes 48 hours for \nthat motion to mature so it can be voted upon. That will be time for us \nto see if we can work out agreements not only on the pending amendment \nbut also on any other amendments that may be adopted, and then, if so, \nthe cloture motion could be vitiated.\n  I hope Members will look down the road at the goal of this \nlegislation. That goal is to create jobs that are going to be very \ndifficult to create if we are stuck with sanctions put on our \nmanufacturing by the European Union. We already have 5-percent \nsanctions. It is going to go up 1 percent a month until it gets to 17 \npercent. Between now and the election, that is going to add up to at \nleast 12-percent sanctions.\n  I hope both sides of the aisle will agree that it is already very \ndifficult for U.S. manufacturing to compete in the global economy. A \n17-percent penalty after 1 year is just like a 17-percent sales tax. \nThat is going to make our manufacturing exports much more \nuncompetitive. Since everybody is concerned about creating and \npreserving jobs, keeping American manufacturing strong, competitive, \npassage of this legislation is very important.\n  We all have amendments we want to get adopted. We want the Senate to \nconsider amendments, whether germane or nongermane. There is plenty of \nopportunity between now and adjournment of this Congress to consider \nthese amendments. In the meantime, if we don't pass this legislation \nthis week, we are going to have a 6-percent penalty in April, a 7-\npercent penalty in May. I hope we can get this legislation passed very \nsoon so we can get rid of all those sanctions against our products.\n  In the meantime we have reduced the corporate tax for manufacturing \nin America by 3 percentage points, and that is going to make it \npossible for the cost of capital in America to be less expensive and \nmake American manufacturing much more competitive and, in the process, \npreserve jobs and create jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2686, which was previously agreed to, be considered to have been \nagreed to without amendment; further, I ask unanimous consent amendment \nNo. 2687, which was also previously agreed to, be considered as having \nbeen agreed to as a first-degree amendment, amended by amendment No. \n2882.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Motion To Recommit with Amendment No. 2886\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I now \nmove to recommit the pending bill to the Committee on Finance with \ninstructions to report back forthwith, with the amendment that is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Frist, \n     moves to recommit the bill, S. 1637, to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions to report back forthwith with an \n     amendment No. 2886, by Mr. McConnell, for Mr. Frist.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nstatement from the President of the United States be entered into the \nRecord today pursuant to the War Powers Resolution and P.L. 107-243 and \nP.L. 102-1, as amended.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 20, 2004.\n      Hon. Ted Stevens,\n      President pro tempore of the Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n        Dear Mr. President: In the interests of improving the \n     efficiency of the reporting process and to increase the \n     utility of reports to the Congress, consistent with the War \n     Powers Resolution, I have decided to consolidate supplemental \n     reports I provide to the Congress regarding the deployment of \n     U.S. combat-equipped armed forces in a number of locations \n     around the world. This consolidated report is part of my \n     efforts to keep the Congress informed about such deployments \n     and covers operations in support of the global war on \n     terrorism (including in Afghanistan), Kosovo, Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and Haiti. Operations in Iraq are a critical \n     part of the war on terror, and it is my intention to continue \n     to provide, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, \n     information regarding the deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq \n     in the reports to the Congress under Public Law 107-243 and \n     Public Law 102-1, as amended.\n\n\n                       THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n        Since September 24, 2001, I have reported, consistent with \n     Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, on the \n     combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qaida terrorists \n     and their Taliban supporters, which began on October 7, 2001, \n     and the deployment of various combat-equipped and combat-\n     support forces to a number of locations in the Central, \n     Pacific, and Southern Command areas of operation in support \n     of those operations and of other operations in our global war \n     on terrorism.\n        United States efforts in the campaign in Afghanistan \n     continue to meet with success, but as I have stated in my \n     previous reports, the U.S. war on terror will be lengthy. \n     United States Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous \n     coalition partners, continue to conduct the U.S. campaign to \n     eliminate the primary source of support to the\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\n     terrorists who viciously attacked our Nation on September 11, \n     2001. These operations have been successful in seriously \n     degrading al-Qaida's training capability and virtually \n     eliminating the Taliban's ability to brutalize the Afghan \n     people and to harbor and support terrorists. Pockets of Al-\n     Qaida and Taliban forces, however, remain a threat to U.S. \n     and Coalition forces and to the Afghan government and Afghan \n     people. United States, Coalition, and Afghan forces are \n     actively pursuing and engaging remnant Taliban and al-\n     Qaida fighters.\n       The United States continues to detain several hundred al-\n     Qaida and Taliban fighters who are believed to pose a \n     continuing threat to the United States and its interests. The \n     combat-equipped and combat-support forces deployed to Naval \n     Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the U.S. Southern Command area \n     of operations since January 2002, continue to conduct secure \n     detention operations for the approximately 610 enemy \n     combatants at Guantanamo Bay.\n       In furtherance of the U.S. worldwide efforts against \n     terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the \n     United States, our friends and allies, and our forces abroad, \n     the United States continues to work with friends and allies \n     in areas around the globe. For example, combat-equipped and \n     combat-support forces deployed to Georgia to assist in \n     training and equipping the Georgian government's forces will \n     be completing their task in May 2004. United States combat-\n     equipped and combat-support forces are also located in \n     Djibouti. The U.S. forces headquarters element in Djibouti \n     provides command and control support as necessary for \n     military operations against al-Qaida and other international \n     terrorists in the Horn of Africa region, including Yemen. \n     These forces also assist in enhancing counterterrorism \n     capabilities in Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eritrea, and \n     Djibouti. The United States is engaged in a continuous \n     process of assessing options for working with other nations \n     to assist them in this respect.\n       Additionally, the United States continues to conduct \n     maritime interception operations on the high seas in the U.S. \n     Central, European, and Pacific Command areas of \n     responsibility. These maritime operations have recently \n     expanded into the U.S. Southern and Northern Command areas of \n     responsibility to stop the movement, arming, or financing of \n     international terrorists.\n       It is not possible to know at this time either the duration \n     of combat operations or the scope and duration of the \n     deployment of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter the \n     terrorist threat to the United States. I will direct \n     additional measures as necessary in the exercise of the U.S. \n     right to self-defense and to protect U.S. citizens and \n     interests. Such measures may include short-notice deployments \n     of special operations and other forces for sensitive \n     operations in various locations throughout the world.\n\n\n                      nato-led kosovo force (KFOR)\n\n       As noted in previous reports regarding U.S. contributions \n     in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, most recently \n     on November 14, 2003, the U.N. Security Council authorized \n     member states to establish KFOR in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999. The mission of KFOR is to \n     provide an international security presence in order to deter \n     renewed hostilities; verify, and, if necessary, enforce the \n     terms of the Military Technical Agreement between NATO and \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (which is now Serbia and \n     Montenegro); enforce the terms of the Undertaking on \n     Demilitarization and Transformation of the former Kosovo \n     Liberation Army; provide day-to-day operational direction to \n     the Kosovo Protection Corps; and maintain a safe and secure \n     environment to facilitate the work of the U.N. Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\n       Currently, there are 18 NATO nations contributing to KFOR \n     in addition to the 18 non-NATO nations that provide forces. \n     The U.S. contribution to KFOR in Kosovo is about 1,900 U.S. \n     military personnel, or approximately 17,500 personnel. \n     Additionally, U.S. military personnel occasionally operate \n     from Macedonia, Albania, and Greece in support of KFOR \n     operations. Eighteen non-NATO contributing countries also \n     participate with NATO forces in providing military personnel \n     and other support personnel to KFOR.\n       The U.S. forces have been assigned to a sector principally \n     centered around Gnjilane in the eastern region of Kosovo. For \n     U.S. KFOR forces, as for KFOR generally, maintaining a safe \n     and secure environment remains the primary military task. The \n     KFOR operates under NATO command and control and rules of \n     engagement. The KFOR coordinates with and supports UNMIK at \n     most levels, provides a security presence in towns, villages, \n     and the countryside, and organizes checkpoints and patrols in \n     key areas to provide security, protect minorities, resolve \n     disputes, and help instill in the community a feeling of \n     confidence. By the end of 2003, UNMIK had transferred all \n     non-reserved competencies under the Constitutional Framework \n     document to the Kosovar Provisional Institutions of Self-\n     Government (PISG). The PISG includes the President, Prime \n     Minister, and Kosovo Assembly, and has been in place since \n     March 2002.\n       NATO continues formally to review KFOR's mission at 6-month \n     intervals. These reviews provide a basis for assessing \n     current force levels, future requirements, force \n     structure, force reductions, and the eventual withdrawal \n     for KFOR. NATO has adopted the Joint Operations Area plan \n     to regionalize and rationalize its force structure in the \n     Balkans. The KFOR has transferred full responsibility for \n     public safety and policing to the UNMIK international and \n     local police forces throughout Kosovo except in the area \n     of Mitrovica, where the responsibility is shared due to \n     security concerns. The UNMIK international police and \n     local police forces have also begun to assume \n     responsibility for guarding patrimonial sites and \n     established border-crossing checkpoints.\n\n\n     nato-led stabilization force in bosnia and herzegovina (sfor)\n\n       As noted in previous reports regarding U.S. contributions \n     in support of peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia, \n     most recently on January 22, 2004, the U.N. Security Council \n     authorized member states to continue SFOR for a period of 12 \n     months in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1491 of July 11, \n     2003. The mission of SFOR is to provide a focused military \n     presence in order to deter hostilities, stabilize and \n     consolidate the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, contribute \n     to a secure environment, and perform key supporting tasks \n     including support to the international civil presence in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       The U.S. force contribution to SFOR in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina is about 1,100 personnel. United States personnel \n     comprise approximately 9 percent of the approximately 12,000 \n     personnel assigned to SFOR. NATO has agreed to reduce the \n     size of the force to 7,000 personnel by June 2004. United \n     States participation is expected to be reduced \n     proportionately. Currently, 16 NATO nations and 11 others \n     provide military personnel or other support to SFOR. Most \n     U.S. forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina are assigned to \n     Multinational Brigade, North, headquartered near the city of \n     Tuzla. The U.S. forces continue to support SFOR efforts to \n     apprehend persons indicted for war crimes and to conduct \n     counterterrorism operations.\n\n\n                  multinational interim force in haiti\n\n       As I reported on February 25 and March 2, 2004, the United \n     States deployed combat-equipped and combat-support personnel \n     to Haiti in order to secure key facilities, facilitate the \n     continued repatriation of Haitian migrants, help create \n     conditions in the capital for the anticipated arrival of the \n     Multinational Interim Force authorized by U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1529, and for other purposes consistent \n     with Resolution 1529. Additional U.S. forces have since \n     been deployed to Haiti, bringing the total of U.S. combat-\n     equipped and combat-support forces in Haiti to \n     approximately 1,800. It is possible that additional U.S. \n     forces will be deployed to Haiti in the future; however, \n     it is anticipated that U.S. forces will redeploy when the \n     Multinational Interim Force has transitioned to a follow-\n     on United Nations Stabilization Force.\n       I have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in \n     all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. Officials of my Administration \n     and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other \n     members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we \n     will continue to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2854-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2854-S2855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOVERNOR JOHN CARL WEST\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday South Carolina lost a valuable \npublic servant and I lost a very dear friend. Some 66 years ago John \nCarl West and I came to the Citadel as freshmen. The attention of the \nfreshmen in those days was responding to the howling orders of the \nupperclassmen. But it wasn't long before John came to my attention. We \nboth had COL Carl Coleman in political science and Colonel Coleman \nloved those Time magazine articles on public events. He would spring \nthem on the class with a test. I would barley know half of the answers, \nbut John Carl would get 100 every time. I felt I ought to pay closer \nattention to the smartest in a class of 525. In those days, at \ndifferent heights, we were in different companies and different \nbarracks, but we got thrown together on the Roundtable in the \nInternational Relations Club. I learned quickly that John was not only \nthe academician but long on common sense.\n  Along with the other members of our class, John and I both left for \nthe war shortly after graduation, but we ended up in the same class at \nthe University of South Carolina Law School after the war. I got home \nthe day after Thanksgiving in 1945 and Dean Friersen allowed that I \ncould audit the classes and take the exams in January and if I passed \nthem then I could be considered a law school student. Many in the class \nfurnished me their notes, most notably John West. By January the 17th I \nwas through the first semester and by May already through the first \nyear. John and I and others marched on the legislature so that we \nveterans could continue in the summer and by August the\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nfollowing year I was through a 3-year course in less than 2 years. But \nI couldn't keep up with John. He was in a bigger rush, passing the bar \nexam before graduation, teaching at the university and forming a law \npartnership.\n  I used to kid him that I was catching up when in one election he was \nrunning for the State Senate and I was running for Lieutenant Governor. \nI carried Kershaw County by 1,200 votes and he became the Kershaw \nCounty Senator by three. John was more or less my lawyer when I was \nGovernor. As a young Governor I needed help. My strong suit was that I \nknew the general assembly intimately, having been the presiding officer \nin both houses, so I had a three-man committee in the house with Floyd \nSpence, Rex Carter and Bob McNair, and a three-man committee on the \nsenate side with Billy Goldberg, Marshall Parker and John West. West \nwas astute and could immediately point the conflicts in a different way \nto get things done. This house-senate group would, off the record, vet \nall of my initiatives. Working together, most all of them got done and \nnot a single veto was overridden in that 4-year period.\n  When West ran for Governor, South Carolina faced its toughest and \nmost heated political choice. The school discrimination decision had \nhit with full force and so had racial politics. The school busses were \nbeing overturned. I had already been elected twice to the U.S. Senate \nand so I could give my schoolhood friend some help. South Carolina was \nlucky that John West became the Governor. He didn't mind using his \npolitical capital to get things done. John moved immediately to set a \ncourse for racial harmony in South Carolina with the appointment of \nJames Clyburn as the head of the Human Relations Committee. The Clyburn \ndecisions on the most sensitive situations had the full force and \nsupport of Governor West. A new day and a new direction for the State \nwas set. The same was true with labor. A flood of industry had \ncommenced by 1971 and the resistance of national labor was hitting the \nwork force and communities of the State. Again, Governor West responded \nwith the appointment of Ed McGowan, backing him up 100 percent. In the \nfield of mental health, Governor West again set the tone and direction \nof mental illness treatment in South Carolina. Working with his \nbrilliant wife, Lois, the cottage system in mental health clinics was \nlaunched, which today still makes South Carolina a forerunner in mental \nillness treatment.\n  But I guess it was John's appointment as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia \nthat brought out the unique combination of personality and brilliance. \nI know the Arabs I--invaded Algeria and Tunisia in World War II and the \ntribal way of life was next to impossible. To form national policy and \nprotect the United States interests with one of these countries isn't \neasy. The Kingdom felt that not only was John West close to President \nCarter, but he was almost family. He handled the knottiest problems \nwith the greatest of ease. I used to kid him on several occasions, as \nhe handled difficult problems, that that was the Arab blood in him.\n  At the end of all these important political offices John didn't \nretire. He maintained a vital interest in everything effecting the \nState of South Carolina. Like me, many would continue to call on him to \nsee what John thought about a situation and he readily gave of his time \nand leadership.

Ferrin, U.S. Army\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, some ask what is the hardest duty that a \nSenator faces. This is that task. Today, I rise with heavy heart to pay \ntribute to another son of Utah who has made the ultimate sacrifice so \nthat others may be free. This patriot's name was SSG Clint Ferrin, he \nwas a member of the elite, the 82nd Airborne Division. To all that knew \nhim he exceeded, in every way, his division's motto: He was truly an \n``All American.''\n  We, the citizens of the State of Utah, had the privilege of knowing \nSergeant Ferrin as he grew up in Garland and Ogden. His commitment to \nservice started at a young age when he became an Eagle Scout. That \ncommitment to service, to helping others and truly making a difference \nwas reflected in his choice to become a solider. But he was not just a \nsoldier, he was a paratrooper, knowing full well that when a challenge \nfaced our Nation he would be one of the first to be called. This was \nreflected in where he served: Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia, Africa, and \nfinally Iraq.\n  These will be trying times for his wife, his son, age 7, and his \ndaughter, age 3. But they should know this: though we can do little to \nalleviate your loss, we will always honor Sergeant Ferrin, he was a \ntrue ``All-American'' and a hero when his Nation needed them most.\n  And so, another name has been added to Utah's List of Honor: SSG \nClint D. Ferrin of the Army's 82 Airborne Division. His name and the \nservice he performed is something that I shall never forget. I shall \nalways honor him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2855-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2855-S2856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RICHARD BRIAN WILSON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a departing \nstaff member who has worked with me in my Washington office for the \nlast 5 years. Richard Brian Wilson, who has served as my legislative \nassistant, is departing my staff this week to return home to \nMississippi. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank him for his \ndedicated serve and to wish him the very best as he pursues new career \nopportunities.\n  Those who know Brian know of his keen interest in State and local \npolitics. A native of Macon, MS, he has been involved in politics since \nhigh school. In fact, his fellow staff members have jokingly referred \nto him as a ``walking encyclopedia of Mississippi politics.'' I have no \ndoubt this expertise will serve him well as he returns home to \nMississippi.\n  Brian graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1998 with a \nBachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and History. Throughout \nhis tenure at Ole Miss he was involved in numerous extracurricular \nactivities where his leadership abilities became apparent. For \ninstance, he served as Vice President of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, \nStudent Body Vice President, and Student Body Senator. In recognition \nof his contributions to the university, I understand Brian was once \nnamed Student Body Senator of the Year. He also spent a great deal of \ntime during his college years volunteering on political campaigns \nthroughout the State.\n  During the fall of 1998, Brian served as an intern in the district \noffice of Congressman Chip Pickering. Immediately following his \ninternship, in January 1999, Brian came to work for me in my Washington \noffice. Throughout his service on my staff, Brian has grown in his \nability to help me service my constituents and address a wide variety \nof needs and issues for Mississippians. He has handled issues ranging \nfrom appropriations to homeland defense, as well as environment and \npublic works, agriculture, natural resources and interior, small \nbusiness, rural development, and Indian affairs. Through his work on \nappropriations bills, such as Energy and Water Development, \nAgriculture, Interior, and VA-HUD, Brian has helped me steer millions \nof dollars in Federal funding to large and small communities all across \nMississippi. In the process, we have improved infrastructure, created \nhope and opportunity in communities where none existed before, and \nprovided a better quality of life for Mississippians throughout the \nState.\n  For example, Brian has helped me secure Federal funds to improve \nwater and wastewater systems in areas of Mississippi, such as DeSoto \nCounty, Jackson County, Fayette County, the city of Gulfport, Hancock \nCounty, and Madison County. He has worked to improve the infrastructure \nat our State's ports including the Port of Pascagoula and the State \nport at Gulfport. He was instrumental in helping me secure the initial \nfunding for an environmental\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\ninfrastructure pilot program in Mississippi which has since helped fund \nnumerous environmental infrastructure projects around the State. Brian \nalso worked to help me secure the final funding necessary to complete \nconstruction of a new Federal courthouse in Gulfport. Of course, one of \nthe things of which I know he is most proud is our work to help his \nhometown, the city of Macon. Through expansion of their water and sewer \nsystems and a new multi-purpose facility to be constructed, we have \nbegun to bring hope to this poverty-stricken area of our State.\n  Brian is truly one of those unique individuals who has a thirst for \nknowledge about the issue areas he is assigned. He has spend countless \nhours over the past 5 years reading news articles, books, papers, \nacademic journals, and industry publications to keep himself apprised \nof the latest events, issues and concerns relative to his assigned \nissues. In fact, I would venture to guess that he knows as much as just \nabout anyone with regard to the many historic properties and places in \nMississippi that he has worked hard to help me protect and provide \nresources for. Properties such as the Battle of Corinth Interpretive \nCenter in northeast Mississippi, L.Q.C. Lamar's home in Oxford, and \nGeneral Pemberton's headquarters at Vicksburg are just as few of those.\n  Although Brian is leaving Washington, I have no doubt the knowledge \nhe has gained through his work here will serve him well in his new \ncapacity as Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the \nMississippi Department of Marine Resources. In this position, Brian \nwill serve as liaison for the Department with the Federal and State \nlegislatures, as well as local governments throughout Mississippi and \nparticularly along our Gulf Coast.\n  While we all certainly will miss Brian, I know he is looking forward \nto returning to our home State and particularly to the warm climate of \nthe Mississippi Gulf Coast. And although fresh seafood, the warm gulf \nclimate, and unlimited fishing opportunities certainly justify Brian's \nmove home, I know this move was compelled by his desire to be closer to \nfamily and friends, particularly his younger sister in whom he has \nexpressed enormous pride throughout his stay in Washington.\n  I wish to thank Brian for 5 years of dedicated service to me and to \nthe people of Mississippi. I wish him the absolute best in this \ntransition and in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2856-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH.

NORMAN BORLAUG\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to rise \ntoday to pay special tribute to the one of the world's foremost \nphysiologists, Dr. Norman Borlaug. Dr. Borlaug is widely credited as \nthe father of the 1960s Green Revolution, a movement that has continued \nto cure hundreds of millions of people around the globe from \nstarvation. It is very likely that Dr. Borlaug is directly responsible \nfor saving more lives than anyone else in the twentieth century.\n  Born in Cresco, IA on March 25, 1914, Dr. Borlaug was raised on \nlivestock farm before attending the University of Minnesota as a \nbiology student and a member of the University's wrestling team. After \ngraduation, in addition to being inducted to the University's Hall of \nFame for his wrestling record, Dr. Borlaug carefully balanced teaching \nwhile successfully working on the development of several new strains of \ndisease-resistant wheat. The new strand of wheat went on to be widely \nutilized in Mexico, Pakistan, and India and led to dramatic increases \nin food production, in turn earning Dr. Borlaug the Nobel Peace Prize \nin 1970. The Dallas Morning News attests his lifelong dedication to \nphysiology to growing up among the food shortages of the Great \nDepression: ``The sight of farm failures, sheriff's sales and hungry \nchildren would stay with him and influence his choices for the rest of \nhis life.'' Dr. Borlaug added in his own words, ``I saw all that \nunfold. And I think that had something to do with how things turned \nout.''\n  Dr. Borlaug has certainly earned the right to slow down after his \nmany years of hard work, but he continues, even at age 90, to a be a \nleader in the development and implementation of new technologies, in \neffect, ensuring the world's most needy adequate food supplies. He \noften travels to Asia and Africa, Europe and Latin America to help the \npublic understand the value and potential of new biotechnology, while \nrespecting and preserving the environment. In addition to his efforts \nglobally, Dr. Borlaug is helping farmers make a living by leading the \nfight against wealthy and well-fed anti-technology protectionists in \nEurope.\n  Some would rest after a Nobel Peace Prize and many others would \ncertainly take the opportunity to reward themselves and their family--\ndeservedly--by answering lucrative offers from the private sector. In a \nworld where 800 million children are hungry and even more live on less \nthan one dollar a day, Dr. Borlaug has never stopped fighting, \nteaching, inventing, or caring. It is clear that Dr. Borlaug is \ninspired by the rewards his efforts yield for others.\n  Missouri's renowned plant scientist, George Washington Carver words \nare appropriate when used to describe Dr. Borlaug: ``No individual has \nany right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving \nbehind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through \nit.'' So very few of a talented world, billions strong, have met this \ntest to the extent that Dr. Borlaug has. He has selflessly and \ntirelessly developed his gifts from God on behalf of millions and \nbillions of desperate people he does not know, and who will never know \nwhom to thank.\n  I also thank Mrs. Borlaug and the rest of the Borlaug family, on the \nbehalf of the people of the State of Missouri, America, and throughout \nthe world, for sharing Norman's attention for all these years.\n  Dr. Borlaug will soon gain status as the world's youngest 90 year \nold. I speak for all in thanking him for his lifelong dedication to \nagriculture and I sincerely wish him a happy birthday. The world owes \nDr. Borlaug endless amounts of gratitude and we will look forward to \ncelebrating his achievements again on his 100th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2856-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2856-S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in my home State of South Dakota \nand across America, hardworking men and women tirelessly contribute to \nthe production of our Nation's food supply. These men and women \nconsistently preserve the safety and wholesomeness of the commodities \nthey produce, ensuring America's food security and contributing \nsubstantially to our overall well-being. During National Agriculture \nWeek, I would like to take this opportunity to thank and celebrate our \nNation's farmers for producing plentiful and healthful harvests, and in \nthe face of so many challenges.\n  While agriculture can be a very rewarding endeavor, a farmer \nexperiences myriad challenges outside of their control which affect \ntheir bottom line. Regardless of commodity or region, today's family \nfarmer is affected by weather conditions, market concentration, \nfluctuating prices, uncertain foreign markets, and an ever-changing \nlandscape in the agricultural industry. Family farms in my home State \nof South Dakota, and across America, not only labor to produce our \nNation's food supply, but also to preserve our rural heritage. \nAgriculture is an economic\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nengine that runs our rural communities, and it is an essential \ncomponent of a stable and productive America.\n  Despite these challenges, I am hopeful for our Nation's producers and \nbelieve that several factors, including our farmers' own persistence \nand dedication, will contribute to their future successes in the \nindustry. While we continue to struggle with budgetary constraints, I \ndo believe that we will be successful in ensuring that money is \nallocated for small and medium-sized producers. We must make certain \nthat our Nation's family farms, which comprise the majority of \nproducers, have sufficient access to agriculture funds. The adoption of \nan amendment to this year's Budget Resolution, which I supported, would \nalter payment limitations and cap excessive compensation to large \nfarms. This money would instead be channeled toward worthwhile and \nessential conservation and development programs, which are beneficial \nto producers in South Dakota and across the Nation.\n  I also believe that fair trade is necessary to ensure our farmers get \na fair deal and a fair price for their product. Too often, the market \nprice a farmer receives for his or her product doesn't reflect the \nfinancial and personal investment that a producer makes during the \ngrowing season and throughout the year. I am confident that new \nopportunities, like the recently announced trade with China involving \nquality South Dakota wheat, will open new doors and foster additional \nopportunities. I also believe that increasing awareness of the negative \nimpacts of some trade agreements, including the Free Trade Agreement \nwith Australia, will aid us in developing a firm base to oppose such \nmeasures and encourage more productive trading possibilities.\n  Lastly, I am confident that Country of Origin Labeling, COOL, will \ngreatly benefit our agriculture economy, in addition to increasing \nconsumer confidence and choice. While opponents of the COOL labeling \nprovision were successful in delaying implementation of the law for 2 \nyears, American consumers and producers remain incredibly supportive of \nmandatory labeling. Every consumer public opinion survey confirms that \nconsumers would pay a modestly higher price for beef if they were \ncertain it was American beef. I contacted the United States Department \nof Agriculture, USDA, in December, requesting clarification of the \ndepartment's interpretation of the language delaying implementation of \nCOOL. While I strongly oppose this delay, I also believe the department \nneeds to clarify the rulemaking process. The USDA's response to my \ninquiries was vague and unclear, which I find unsatisfactory. I intend \nto seek clarification of the rule pertaining to the delay while also \nactively working on opportunities to speed up implementation of this \nlaw. Along with my colleague Senator Tom Daschle, I am pleased to have \nworked so extensively on this initiative, and I am confident in the \nfuture of this quality provision.\n  America's farmers produce quality products, which are recognized the \nworld-over. It is essential that we function as a united team to \npromote these products in today's ever-changing agricultural \nenvironment, and ensure that family farmers in South Dakota and across \nthe nation are recognized and adequately compensated for their \nsubstantial contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2857-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING EMILY NEUMEIER AND CHRISTINE BANKS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise here today to publicly \nhonor and recognize Donna Peterson and Sally Stoll for receiving the \n2003 Presidential Award for excellence in Mathematics and Science \nteaching, the Nation's highest commendation for work in the classroom. \nDonna Peterson won the math award for sharing her innovative teaching \napproaches with the students at Belle Fourche High School. Sally Stoll \nwon the science award for her knowledge and passion on the subject and \nthe ability to inspire her student's at Vermillion High School.\n  The National Science Foundation, NSF, administers the awards program \nfor the White House. NSF is an independent Federal agency that supports \nresearch and education across all fields of science. Since 1983, the \nWhite House and NSF have sought nominations of exemplary math and \nscience teachers from every State. In addition to honoring their \nachievement, the goal of the awards is to expand the definition of \nexcellent science and mathematics teaching exemplified by Donna \nPeterson and Sally Stoll.\n  These two teachers have provided us with excellent examples of \nquality teaching. They have a passion for their subjects and dedication \nto their students. They know how to bring out the very best in every \nstudent, in every kind of school. The national award-winning teachers \noverwhelmingly agree that students frequently respond best to lessons \nthat relate to recognizable phenomena from their own lives, or that \nallow for hands-on learning. They have observed that an engaging \nteaching style prompts students to pose their own questions, test their \nown theories, and arrive at their own solutions, with the teacher \nserving as a facilitator and guide.\n  Research indicates that nothing is so important in raising student \nachievement as a good teacher; not top notch equipment, not Internet \naccess, not family income level. Those things are helpful, we know, but \nit's the teachers themselves that are the ``make or break'' link \nbetween students and educational success.\n  United States student performance in mathematics and science has been \nlagging, and many schools are experiencing shortages of math and \nscience teachers. Donna and Sally are constantly searching for \nmeaningful ways to spark the learning process. In doing so, they will \nhave continued to inspire their students in such a way that it will \nhave enriched them for the rest of their lives. If you are lucky, \nyou'll have a chance to experience at least one such teacher in your \nlifetime.\n  I congratulate Donna Peterson and Sally Stoll on this tremendous \nhonor. Their dedication to the teaching field in South Dakota serves as \na model for all educators to emulate. It is with great honor that I \nshare their impressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2857-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2857-S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF CENTER FOR FIRESAFETY STUDIES\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the Center for Firesafety Studies at Worcester Polytechnic \nInstitute in Massachusetts as it celebrates its 25th Anniversary.\n  Worcester Polytechnic Institute was founded in 1865 to support the \nnew industrial economy that was developing in Central Massachusetts in \nthe 19th century. Its founders believed in merging theory and practice \nas part of the ongoing effort to deal with changing needs of our \nsociety. Over the years, the university has earned international \nrespect for its innovations in engineering education and its \nresponsiveness to a changing world.\n  In the 1960s, fire safety in America was a priority in Congress. The \nFire Research and Safety Act in 1968 called for a national study of the \nissue, which resulted in the landmark report known as America Burning. \nAmong its findings, America Burning emphasized that, ``Appallingly, the \nrichest and most technologically advanced nation in the world leads all \nthe major industrialized countries in per capita deaths and property \nloss from fire.''\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\n  In response to this wake-up call, Congress passed the Fire Prevention \nand Control Act of 1974, which created the United States Fire \nAdministration and its National Fire Academy. David A. Lucht of Ohio \nwas appointed by President Ford to lead the new agency in 1975.\n  True to its tradition, Worcester Polytechnic Institute took the issue \non, with Professor Robert W. Fitzgerald as the guiding intellect and \ncatalyst. In 1979, WPI created the Center for Firesafety Studies as the \nfirst graduate degree program in fire protection engineering in the \nNation. In the past quarter century with Professor Lucht as Director, \nthe WPI fire safety program has become an international leader in fire \nprotection engineering education, with graduates from 30 countries. \nThrough its outstanding faculty, students and alumni, WPI has had an \nimportant role in making the world safer from fire.\n  I commend WPI on this impressive 25th Anniversary of the Center for \nFiresafety Studies and its graduate degree program in fire protection \nengineering. We are proud of them in Massachusetts, and the Nation is \ngrateful for the difference they have made in fire safety for us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2858-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       25TH ANNIVERSARY OF C-SPAN\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a signal \nanniversary that passed on Friday, March 19, 2004, the 25th anniversary \nof the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network, C-SPAN.\n  Founded in 1979, C-SPAN has rapidly grown from its humble beginnings \ntelevising the proceedings on the floor of the House of Representatives \nto a series of networks reaching millions of viewers daily. This \nservice, which functions without any financial support of the Federal \nGovernment, provides our constituents with invaluable access to the \nday-to-day proceedings of both bodies of Congress, as well as other \nimportant mechanisms of our government. As a direct result, it is now \neasier than ever for our constituents to keep abreast of our \ndeliberations and contribute well to the debates at hand.\n  I am also pleased to point out that these tremendous networks were \nfounded by a fellow Hoosier, Brian Lamb. Through his work experiences \non Capitol Hill, Brian realized the importance of bringing the business \nof the Federal Government into the homes of Americans nationwide and \nhis indefatigable enthusiasm made this possible. In addition, he has \nshown great commitment to our home State of Indiana. Brian has also \nmaintained strong ties with his alma mater, Purdue University, in West \nLafayette, IN, where he established the C-SPAN archives. Over 80,000 \nhours of C-SPAN programming are immediately accessible through this \ndatabase.\n  I am pleased to bring this important anniversary to the attention of \nmy colleagues. I am thankful to C-SPAN for their efforts to spread the \navailability of our government, and I look forward to the continuing \nrelationship, now in its 25th year, between C-SPAN and the U.S. \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2858-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING PATRICIA SIMMONS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

She has touched the lives of many in the military service with \nher love of literature and her commitment to service.\n  I ask that an article from the Journal, a publication of the Medical \nCenter, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                   [From the Journal, Oct. 30, 2003]\n\n                            End of a Chapter\n\n                           (By Ellen Maurer)\n\n       Patricia Simmons, head librarian at the National Naval \n     Medical Center (NNMC), stamped her last book this month.\n       Retiring after 34 years of service at the hospital's \n     general library, Simmons was honored in a ceremony Oct. 15 \n     for not only her long-term commitment to the command, its \n     staff and patients, but also for her love of literature.\n       ``She loves that library and every book that makes it up,'' \n     says Cat DeBinder, an NNMC staff member who has known Simmons \n     for more than 25 years.\n       RADM Donald Arthur, MC, Commander, NNMC, presented Simmons \n     with the Meritorious Civilian Service Award during her \n     retirement ceremony. The award citation detailed Simmons' \n     significant contributions, which included an improved web \n     cataloging data-base system and an internet cafe. Ironically, \n     though, those who knew Simmons best said she wasn't really \n     dependent on new technology.\n       ``Pat never needed a computer . . . her unflappable data \n     base was between her ears and it never crashed,'' says \n     DeBinder. ``She carried out her responsibilities with great \n     love and true passion. She could tell you exactly where any \n     book was; lead you correctly, without hesitation, to any \n     subject and was a wizard with those little three-by-five \n     index cards.''\n       DeBinder admits, however, that Simmons' familiarity with \n     the books she ``guarded'' for more than three decades did \n     have its disadvantages--if only to those library patrons, \n     like DeBinder herself, who occasionally missed their ``due \n     back'' date.\n       ``Once, I had to fess up to the unspeakable. I lost a book. \n     It was an old paperback, printed in the late sixties or early \n     seventies. I think the original price was 40 cents. The pages \n     were yellowish-orange with age. The title was ``No Bad \n     Dogs.'' Pat had a very difficult time accepting the fact that \n     I lost one of her books. I begged for mercy, forgiveness and \n     I offered money. She said, `Just keep trying to find the \n     book.' ''\n       Whimsically, DeBinder adds, ``Pat . . . I'm still \n     looking.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2858-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2858-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2858-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on March 17, 2004, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1881.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na rural water supply program in the Reclamation States for the purpose \nof providing a clean, safe, affordable, and reliable water supply to \nrural residents and for other purposes, to authorize the Secretary to \nconduct appraisal and feasibility studies for rural water projects, and \nto establish the guidelines for any projects authorized under this \nprogram; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  By Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am introduing the Reclamation Rural \nWater Supply Act of 2004 as a courtesy to the administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 2220. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage a strong community-based banking system; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nCommunity Savings and Investment Act of 2004. This will create jobs, \nexpand economic activity, and help to revitalize distressed urban and \nrural communities. It will accomplish this by providing tax relief for \ncommunity-focused banks and helping to generate financial opportunities \nin low-income areas.\n  As we address the challenges many of our communities face and search \nfor ways to help those looking to improve their standard of living, we \nmust properly leverage the tax laws to encourage economic development. \nMost people and communities do not want handouts. They want the chance \nto find solutions and make it on their own. However, to do this they \nneed financial resources.\n  The lifeblood of any economic development is capital. Too often it is \ndifficult for people, especially those in distressed areas, to access \nfinancial resources and other banking services. Providing community \nbanking will lead to much-needed investments in communities, allowing \npeople to purchase homes, start new businesses, and revitalize their \nneighborhoods.\n  The Community Savings and Investment Act will improve access to \nbanking services by lowering taxes for community banks. It also \nprovides incentives for banks to serve distressed communities by \nexcluding any resulting income from taxation. By lowering the costs for \nbanks to operate in communities, we can unleash powerful new forces for \neconomic development.\n  This initiative will make a significant difference in the lives of \nthousands of families and communities across this Nation. As we seek \nways to further strengthen our economy, I urge the Senate to pass this \ncommon-sense approach.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to clarify and ensure that the authority granted to the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services under section 1115 of that Act is used \nsolely to promote the objectives of the medicaid and State children's \nhealth insurance programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicaid and \nCHIP Safety Net Preservation Act, a bill to clarify existing law and to \npreserve the core elements of Medicaid, the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, (CHIP), and our health care safety net, which \nprovide needed health services to more than sixty million Americans. \nThese programs, which are so critical to the health of our children, \nour parents and grandparents, and to our communities, have been \nthreatened in recent years by waivers that undermine the very \nfoundations of these programs. I am introducing this bill with my \ncolleague, good friend, and the Ranking Member of the Finance \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Health, Senator Rockefeller.\n  I have long been concerned about the inappropriate use of the so-\ncalled ``Section 1115'' waiver authority with respect to Medicaid and \nCHIP. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act permits the Secretary of \nHHS to waive provisions of the Medicaid and CHIP statutes at the \nrequest of a state if the waiver is determined to ``promote the \nObjectives'' of the program, and if it meets certain other criteria \nestablished in statute. The waiver authority has existed since before \nMedicaid's inception, and it is designed to allow states before \nMedicaid's inception, and it is designed to allow states to experiment \nand engage in pilot and demonstration programs in a variety of Social \nSecurity Act programs. It has long been used to allow States to try \ninnovative approaches to deliver or finance healthcare for some of our \nmost vulnerable citizens--poor children, pregnant women and parents, \nindividuals with disabilities, and the elderly, including many in \nnursing homes.\n  But in recent years, the waiver authority has been used increasingly \naggressively and, in my view, irresponsibly. I first became concerned \nabout these waivers when I learned that waiver programs, which now \naffect millions of people and tens of billions of dollars annually, \nwere being negotiated and approved in the dark. In some cases, Medicaid \nenrollees literally could not find what the operative Medicaid rules \nwere in their state, because laws and rules had been waived and the new \nprogram requirements were not published in a place accessible to the \npublic. In 2001, I and my colleague, Chairman Chuck Grassley, wrote to \nSecretary Thompson with our concerns that the waiver process was not \nadequately transparent, and that there could be no accountability \nwithout transparency.\n  After many months and much correspondence with Secretary Thompson, I \nnoticed some improvement in the posting of approved waiver \napplications. By that time, the General Accounting Office had reported \nthat there were serious problems with 1115 waivers. Waivers were being \napproved without adequate public input; waivers were being approved \nthat used funds set aside by Congress for children's health care on \nchildless adults; and waiver applications were being negotiated and \napproved with different standards applied, depending on the identity of \nthe state applicant. Finally, and most disturbing, the GAO noted that \nHHS was applying a condition to one type of waiver that imposed a hard \ncap on Federal spending for a state's elderly Medicaid enrollees over a \nfive-year period.\n\n  Most recently, I was deeply disturbed to read press reports \nindicating that HHS was inviting states to prepare new more \ncomprehensive waiver applications that would impose enforceable, global \ncaps on state Medicaid programs. One of the crucial elements of the \nMedicaid program is its unique state-federal financing structure, which \nrequires every state dollar expended on Medicaid to be matched by at \nleast one Federal dollar. This guaranteed matching structure provides \nfinancial stability and an incentive for states to maintain levels of \nhealth care spending in good and bad economic times. The matching \nstructure has, over time, allowed a swift response to economic \nrecessions, high rates of uninsurance, epidemics, disasters like 9/11, \nand innovative treatment advances, like the advent of expensive \nprotease inhibitors to threat AIDS. The law does not, and it should \nnot, allow a Secretarial waiver of such a core element of Medicaid.\n  Another press report indicated that one governor intended to seek a \nwaiver to the Medicaid entitlement in exchange for accepting a hard cap \non Federal Medicaid spending. In the absence of the individual \nentitlement, a state could turn away eligible applicants; impose \nwaiting lists; or terminate a health care benefit in the middle of \ntreatment for a serious illness or a stay in a nursing home. For the \npoor, for children, for individuals with disabilities, such as \n``innovation'' in Medicaid could be devastating.\n  I also heard reported an instance where HHS announced in court, for \nthe very first time, that the Secretary has waived the essential \n``EPSDT'' benefit for children in one state. Beneficiaries did not even \nknow that they were no longer entitled to the comprehensive benefit for \nchildren until they were in litigation with the State over inadequacies \nin the state's Medicaid program.\n  And finally, I am concerned about efforts to undermine Medicaid \nfinancing for Community Health Clinics and Rural Health Clinics through \nthe use of the 1115 waiver authority. These clinics provide desperately \nneeded care for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees as well as millions of \nuninsured Americans. Without fair payment from Medicaid, CHCs and RHCs \nhave reduced capacity to see the patients who rely on them for care.\n  There are some features of the Medicaid program that are so \nfundamental to the program that they should never be waived with the \nstroke of the pen of one person. And I am pleased to quote the new \nAdministrator of the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mark \nMcClellan, who agreed at his nomination hearing that, and I quote from \na news article citing his testimony, ``federally imposed caps on \nspending are not envisioned as part of Medicaid's structure.'' He also \nsaid that core Medicaid principles, such as the program's state and \nfederal funding partnership and citizens' entitlement to benefits, \nshould not be waived.\n  I am hopeful that, one day in the not too distant future, the \nCongress can have a meaningful debate on how to improve the Medicaid \nprogram that is now a healthcare lifeline for more than 50 million \npeople, and how to improve CHIP and expand coverage to the uninsured. \nBut in the meantime, we must ensure that efforts to innovate through \nwaivers are made publicly and openly, with an opportunity for \nstakeholder\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\ninput at every level of decision making, and with a promise that \ninnovation will ``do no harm'' to the foundational principles of these \nsafety net programs. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, which \nwill improve the integrity of Medicaid and CHIP and ensure that they \nremain available and responsive to the needs of so many Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ndistinguished ranking member from Montana, Mr. Baucus, in introducing \nthe Medicaid and CHIP Safety Net Preservation Act of 2004. Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide health insurance \ncoverage to more than 50 million vulnerable Americans, including \npregnant women, kids, people with disabilities, and seniors in nursing \nhomes. Preserving the integrity of each of these programs should be one \nof our top priorities. The bill that we are introducing today would \nensure that Section 1115 of the Social Security Act--the so-called \n``1115 waiver authority''--does not erode the core objectives of \nMedicaid and CHIP.\n  Medicaid and CHIP form the foundation of our Nation's health care \nsafety net. Without them, many more Americans would be uninsured. \nUnfortunately, the central objectives of these entitlement programs \nhave been threatened in recent years by short-sighted proposals to cap \nFederal funding, questionable administrative rules and regulations, and \ninappropriate waivers that essentially waive the requirements of \nFederal law. The Medicaid and CHIP Safety Net Preservation Act would \naddress each of these issues by reaffirming the core requirements of \nMedicaid and SCHIP.\n  Congress created Medicaid in 1965 as Federal-State partnership to \nprovide health insurance coverage to low-income families on welfare. \nOver the years, Medicaid has evolved into a multi-faceted health \ninsurance program that serves working families, the disabled, and the \nelderly. Throughout the evolution of Medicaid, two aspects of the \nprogram have remained the same: Federal guidelines for program \nadministration and shared Federal and State responsibility for \nfinancing. This structure has served the Medicaid program well. It \nmaintains the national health care safety net, while also allowing \nFederal and State policymakers to tailor the program to meet local \nneeds.\n  In 1997, I was joined by Senator Chafee in introducing the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The \npurpose of this program has always been to help the children of \nfamilies that do not qualify for Medicaid. At the time that CHIP was \nenacted, 10 million children were uninsured. Today, over 5 million \nchildren have coverage through CHIP; this includes nearly 23,000 \nchildren in the State of West Virginia. While we still have a long way \nto go in order to provide every child with health insurance, I believe \nthe families touched by the CHIP program thus far would agree it serves \nits purpose well.\n  The legislation that Senator Baucus and I are introducing today is \ndesigned to make it very clear that certain requirements under Medicaid \nand CHIP are central to the overall objectives of these programs and \nare not subject to waiver. Specifically, this legislation would ensure \nthat 1115 waivers are not used to impose global caps on Federal \npayments to Medicaid. It would protect the Federal guarantee of \nMedicaid for any eligible individual. Children would continue to have \naccess to comprehensive health benefits under the Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Money intended \nfor the care of children under CHIP would be used for that purpose. \nFinally, the process for reviewing and approving 1115 waivers would be \nmore transparent, allowing greater opportunities for public notice and \ncomment.\n  The Medicaid and CHIP Safety Net Preservation Act is a good first \nstep toward preserving these critical health insurance programs. \nHowever, in order to strengthen Medicaid and CHIP for the future, we \nmust also enact legislation that gives States the resources they need \nto cover eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, restores funding for the CHIP \nprogram, and allows states greater flexibility within the guidelines of \nthe law. I urge my colleagues to support all of these important \nmeasures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Miller, Mr. Lott, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Shelby):\n  S.J.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces have a long and honorable history as units of \n     adventuresome, hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the \n     national security of the United States and the defense of \n     freedom and peace, project the effective ground combat power \n     of the United States by Air Force air transport to the far \n     reaches of the battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of \n     the world;\n       Whereas August 16, 2004, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25,\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\n     1940, when the Army Parachute Test Platoon was first \n     authorized by the United States Department of War, and was \n     launched when 48 volunteers began training in July of 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that, since then, have served with \n     distinction and repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and \n     17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Batallions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified \n     force of parachute and air assault units that, over the \n     years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the \n     Persian Gulf Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in \n     peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the \n     Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the Army's XVIII \n     Airborne Corps when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander;\n       Whereas that modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, \n     and Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which \n     comprise the forces of the United States Special Operations \n     Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operations forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops; and\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people as the airborne community celebrates \n     August 16, 2004, as the 64th anniversary of the first \n     official jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2004, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a \nSenate resolution which designates August 16, 2004 as ``National \nAirborne Day.''\n  Our friend and former colleague, the late Senator Strom Thurmond, \nintroduced this resolution in past years. Senator Thurmond served with \nthe 82nd Airborne Division, one of the first airborne divisions to be \norganized in the U.S. Army.\n  During a 2-year period during World War II, the regiments of the 82nd \nAirborne served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy, and at the \nBattle of the Bulge.\n  As a member of the 82nd Airborne Division, Senator Strom Thurmond \nparticipated in the landings at Normandy in June 1944.\n  Later this year we will celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the D-Day \nlandings and the Battle of Bulge.\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success \nof the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War II until the present.\n  The 11th, 13th, 17th, and 101st Airborne Divisions and numerous other \nregimental and battalion size airborne units were also organized \nfollowing the success of the Parachute Test Platoon. In the last 64 \nyears, these airborne forces have performed in important military and \npeace-keeping operations all over the world, including Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, and it is only appropriate that we designate a day to salute \nthe contributions they have made to this Nation.\n  Through passage of ``National Airborne Day,'' the Senate will \nreaffirm our support for the members of the airborne community.\n  I would like to thank Airborne veterans and Airborne units for their \ntireless commitment to our Nation's defense and for the ideals of duty, \nhonor, country they embody.

Mr. President, a short while ago I filed a cloture \nmotion relative to the JOBS bill. That cloture vote will occur on \nWednesday of this week. The chairman will be back tomorrow to discuss \nthe importance of this legislation, and we hope to finish the bill this \nweek. Amendments may still be considered prior to the cloture vote, and \nwe will continue to look for an opportunity to consider amendments that \nare relevant to the underlying bill. Rollcall votes are, therefore, \npossible during tomorrow's session. Senators will be notified when the \nfirst vote is scheduled.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will allow me to make one brief \nstatement, we understand the importance of the underlying bill. That is \nthe reason we have agreed to have a list of finite amendments. It is \nnot often we have tax bills come across the floor. This is a tax bill. \nWe have been told on many occasions: do the overtime vote later. This \nbill is important. As I explained earlier today, the Senator from Iowa \nhas withheld on a number of important pieces of legislation in an \neffort to move them through the Senate. But that time has come to an \nend. He is not agreeable to doing it at a later time anymore. We are \ngoing to have a vote on this legislation.\n  If this legislation is important to the administration--which I am \nhopeful and confident it is--we should have a vote on this overtime \nissue.\n  I repeat: The reason the administration doesn't want a vote on this \novertime issue is it will pass. There is no question about it. Members \nin the majority and virtually everyone in the minority will vote for \nthis most important amendment.\n  I hope this legislation is allowed to go forward. If it isn't, it \nwill be directed back to the President of the United States for doing \nwhat he has done affecting the rights of millions of Americans, which \nis the overtime issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the risk of repeating myself, we \nhave had this vote once. I am sure there will be other opportunities in \nthe very near future for repetitious votes on the same issue. I know \nour good friends on the other side will insist on an opportunity to do \nthat. The question is whether we should move the underlying bill now \nand terminate these sanctions being imposed on American businesses \nwhich cost us jobs. Jobs is an important issue here in America. We want \nto get this bill passed because it will preserve existing jobs and \noffer the opportunity for more jobs. The overtime issue, to the extent \nour good friends on the other side of the aisle think is a good issue, \nis already out there. A move is on by spending millions of dollars of \nGeorge Soros' money running soft-money issue ads on this subject. I am \nsure those ads are not going to go away, whether or not we have this \nvote on this particular bill which, of course, would be our second vote \non this issue without further debating the issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2937-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we face a serious medical malpractice \nproblem in Illinois. I have had meetings in the area where I was born \nwith doctors and most recently with hospital administrators. The recent \nmedical malpractice insurance premium increases for this year were \nonly--I underline ``only''--7\\1/2\\ percent through the Illinois State \nMedical Society, but adjustments will follow for specialties and for \nexperience, and for some of these doctors that rate could be increased \ndramatically. I have come away from the meetings convinced now more \nthan ever that we need to do something about the medical malpractice \ncrisis that faces America.\n  I understand, and I think those who follow it understand, that in my \nState of Illinois and in other States around the Nation medical \nmalpractice premiums have gone up so dramatically that good doctors who \nhave no experience of having ever been sued successfully for medical \nmalpractice see their premiums go up by 30, 40 percent, and more. These \ndoctors, frankly, cannot continue to practice under those circumstances \nand are forced into early retirement or have to transfer their \npractices to adjoining States with different malpractice laws.\n  Hospital administrators talked to me about what it means for them. \nWhen you do not have a neurosurgeon on staff at a hospital, how can you \nopen an emergency room or give trauma care? It is a legitimate, real \nconcern. These doctors and hospitals are facing an increased cost for \nmalpractice premiums that must be addressed as quickly as possible by \neither the States where these are occurring or by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Most people point toward a solution that involves tort reform. I am \none of them. I believe tort reform has to be part of the solution to \nthe medical malpractice challenge we face. I also believe we have to \ninclude elements in this whole issue that address the number of medical \nerrors committed each year. Some 98,000 Americans, it is estimated, die \neach year from medical malpractice--not from their disease or the \nillness that brought them to the doctor but simply because they were \ntreated improperly and incorrectly.\n  It is an epidemic, according to some medical sources. Medical errors \nand medical negligence have to be reduced so the universe of bad \nresults is reduced, as well. That will lead, of course, to fewer cases \nbeing filed and less litigation.\n  When it comes to malpractice itself in the courtroom, we have to find \nways to make certain that only worthy, good, deserving suits go \nforward, to make certain those that should not be filed that may be \nfrivolous or unnecessary are stopped early in the process before they \ncost both the doctors, hospitals, and their insurance companies the \nprecious resources they are paying each year in premiums. We have to \nfigure out a reasonable way to approach this. We can. We can do it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I reject the idea of caps, which is the only proposal that has been \nbrought consistently to the Senate. To say we will sit as a jury for \nmedical malpractice cases across America is to take away the jury \nsystem, which is basic to American government. Instead of 12 people in \nyour neighborhood and community making the decision, we will make the \ndecision, and we will decide the maximum amount one can recover, \nregardless of the injury which you, as an innocent patient, suffered.\n\n  We need to address tort reform that does not include caps on \nnoneconomic losses. We can. I hope we can. I have said to the doctors \nand hospitals, I have reached out across the aisle to my friends on the \nRepublican side to find common ground. Be prepared to make concessions \non both sides, but let's address it now. We cannot allow this to \ncontinue.\n  The one thing we all agree on is even if tort reform is passed \ntomorrow, it will be years before it has any impact in reducing medical \nmalpractice premiums. Why? Because the doctors in practice today who \nperformed surgeries or dispensed medical services in years gone by are \nliable for years under statutes of limitations for what they have done \nin the past, and those years could be extended to a period when the \nactual injury is discovered which could be many years after the act was \ncommitted. Even if we change the law today, all of that past conduct \nand exposure to liability will be there, and\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nmalpractice premiums will continue to be very high.\n  What I have proposed is that we do something immediately to provide \nrelief to doctors and to hospitals. What I have suggested is that we \nconsider the establishment of a tax credit and reimbursement of medical \nmalpractice premiums for some doctors and hospitals. Senator Lindsey \nGraham, a Republican from South Carolina, has joined me in this \namendment. Our amendment allows doctors and hospitals to claim a tax \ncredit for a percentage of the malpractice premiums they are paying and \nwill pay during the years 2004 and 2005. If a doctor is in a high-risk \nspecialty with increased risk of complications, they would be eligible \nfor a tax credit equivalent to 20 percent of their total malpractice \npremium. The credit would be taken for premiums up to twice the \nstatewide average for the specialty in which the doctor practices.\n  Let me explain that. A doctor can deduct his medical malpractice \ninsurance costs now from his business costs or his business revenue. We \ncould add to that a 20-percent tax credit on top of the deduction. That \nwould help these doctors immensely in dealing with the increase in \nthese malpractice premiums. High-risk doctors include those in all \nsurgical services and subspecialties, emergency medicine, obstetrics, \nor anesthesiology, or those doctors who do interventional work that is \nreflected in their malpractice premiums.\n  Doctors who practice in lower risk specialties--general medicine, for \nexample--would be eligible for a 10-percent tax credit.\n  For-profit hospitals are eligible for a tax credit equivalent to 15 \npercent of their total malpractice premium, including nursing homes, as \nwell, if they need malpractice insurance.\n  Those that are nonprofit institutions, hospitals and nursing homes, \nare eligible for reimbursement under a 2-year grant to the Health \nResources Services Administration at the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  What we are trying to do is provide immediate relief while we work \nout the issues of reducing medical errors and tort reform, \nunderstanding if we pass legislation today, dealing with those two \nissues, tort reform and medical errors, these doctors and hospitals \nwould still see staggering premiums for years to come. This is a \nresponsible way to address the immediate need.\n\n  I say to my friends in the medical community, though you may not \nagree with me on the issue of caps, I hope you understand that even if \nyou had your way and passed the caps limiting recovery for those who \nare victims of medical malpractice, the premiums would still continue \nto increase on your medical malpractice insurance.\n  This Durbin-Graham amendment, also supported by Senator Patty Murray \nof Washington, provides immediate relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2938-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2938-S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the second issue I would like to address \nis an issue that could not be more timely. The issue is ``March \nMadness.'' Frankly, everywhere I have gone today--in the airport, while \ntraveling, as I came back to my office--everybody is abuzz about the \nbasketball games over the weekend.\n  I am happy the University of Illinois is going into Sweet 16. There \nhave been upsets and great victories, and those who love college \nbasketball cannot wait each year for the NCAA tournament. It is college \nbasketball really brought home to America in a way like no other sport. \nSixty-five teams start, and in the end one will be champion.\n  But, frankly, when we take a closer look and understand the reality \nof who the players are, it calls into question whether or not in many \ncases this is college basketball.\n  Let me tell you what I mean.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntoday's lead editorial in the Chicago Tribune of March 22.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Chicago Tribune]\n\n                         The Real March Madness\n\n       If you're a basketball fan, you know how many college teams \n     qualify each year for the NCAA men's tournament: 65. But can \n     you guess how many schools would be playing if there was a \n     requirement that they had to graduate at least half of their \n     athletes?\n       If you guessed a third, you'd be about right.\n       Commentary about college sports often focuses on programs \n     with serious shortcomings. So let it be noted that there are \n     some universities that have exemplary records combining \n     athletics and scholarships. Among the schools with teams in \n     this year's tournament, Kansas graduates 73 percent of its \n     players within six years of their original enrollment. At \n     Dayton, 82 percent get a degree, and at Lehigh, the figure is \n     90 percent. Atop them all is Stanford, with a 100 percent \n     graduation rate (and a number one seed in the tourney).\n       Three years ago, the Knight Foundation Commission on \n     Intercollegiate Athletics proposed that postseason \n     competition be limited to teams that graduate at least 50 \n     percent of their players. But the NCAA obviously has a long \n     way to go. Of the 65 teams playing this year, only 21 would \n     qualify under that rule--down from 22 last year.\n       For that matter, 10 of the teams fail to graduate even 20 \n     percent of their players. But they're not the worst. \n     Commission Chairman William C. Friday, president emeritus of \n     the University of North Carolina, noted that ``four of the \n     teams in the men's tournament failed to graduate a single \n     athlete over the period we reviewed.'' He was kind enough not \n     to identify them.\n       Basketball fans may be aghast to think what March Madness \n     would look like if the commission had its way. Only three of \n     this year's first-round games could be played if its rule \n     were in effect--Gonzaga v. Valparaiso, North Carolina vs. Air \n     Force, and Mississippi State vs. Monmouth. A tournament like \n     that would make for a short, craze-free March.\n       But if the rule were in effect, you can be sure schools \n     would be taking the steps needed to strengthen their academic \n     mission. They'd recruit kids capable of doing college-level \n     work, and they'd structure their programs to assure that \n     players devote as much time and energy to their studies as to \n     their sport. If every school that hoped to play in the \n     tournament had to graduate 50 percent of its players, just \n     about every school would graduate 50 percent of its players.\n       That's as it should be. Most college basketball players \n     will never play professionally. They need an education that \n     prepares them for life after sports.\n       The Knight Foundation Commission goal is hardly outlandish, \n     as the teams in the women's tournament regularly demonstrate. \n     Of the 63 women's teams for which the commission had \n     sufficient data to judge, only 10 failed to graduate half \n     their players.\n       And there's no apparent conflict between success in the \n     classroom and success on the court: At many of the perennial \n     powers, such as Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas and Duke, \n     upwards of 67 percent of players get degrees.\n       On the men's side, though, most schools apparently care \n     more about winning than anything else. That approach creates \n     far too many losers.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this editorial raises the following \nquestion:\n\n       [C]an you guess how many schools would be playing [in the \n     NCAA men's tournament] if there was a requirement that they \n     had to graduate at least half of their athletes [in a 6-year \n     period of time]?\n       If you guessed a third, you'd be right.\n\n  This article goes on to note that some universities involved in this \ntournament have exemplary records combining athletics and scholarship; \nand he names Kansas, with 73 percent of its players graduating within 6 \nyears of their original enrollment; Dayton, 82 percent; Lehigh, 90 \npercent; and atop the chart--which is a university which lost \nyesterday--Stanford, with 100 percent.\n  This editorial says:\n\n       Three years ago, the Knight Foundation Commission on \n     Intercollegiate Athletics proposed that postseason \n     competition be limited to teams that graduate at least 50 \n     percent of their players [within 6 years]. But the NCAA \n     obviously has a long way to go. Of the 65 teams playing [in \n     the tournament] this year, only 21 would qualify under that \n     rule--down from 22 last year.\n       For that matter, 10 of the teams [in the NCAA tournament] \n     fail to graduate even 20 percent of their players.\n\n  This is what commission Chairman William Friday, president emeritus \nof the University of North Carolina, noted:\n\n       [F]our of the teams in the men's tournament failed to \n     graduate a single athlete over the period we reviewed.\n\n  The information here talks about the general graduation rate. We call \nthis college basketball. But if we were to learn that there was a team \nheaded for the Sweet Sixteen or the Final Four that did not have a \nsingle college player graduate, we would cry fraud. This is supposed to \nbe about college athletes participating against one another. But if you \nhave schools involved in the tournament where none--absolutely none--of \nthe athletes involved in the basketball game are ever going to \ngraduate, are these truly college students, is this really college \nbasketball?\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na commentary from that same newspaper written by Derrick Z. Jackson, \nentitled ``Suppressing the bad news on NCAA graduation rates.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Suppressing the Bad News on NCAA Graduation Rates\n\n                        (By Derrick Z. Jackson)\n\n       Not to be outdone by the federal government's attempts to \n     delete key portions of reports on global warming, health \n     disparities, and racism within the Justice Department, here \n     comes the National Collegiate Athletic Association. That \n     august body is eliminating the graduation rates of basketball \n     players. What is good for the Bush administration is \n     wonderful news for the Universities of Cincinnati, Kentucky, \n     Louisville and Memphis.\n       March Madness ought to be canceled with the scandal that is \n     in the computer banks of the NCAA's 2003 Graduation Rates \n     Report. The report covers whether scholarship athletes who \n     entered school in the falls of 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996 \n     graduated within six years. The report is the best long-term \n     way to see whether a university is providing an education to \n     its athletes or pimping them in an era where CBS is paying \n     the NCAA $6 billion over 11 years to televise men's games and \n     where an additional $3.5 billion will be wagered illegally on \n     this year's tournament alone, according to The Wall Street \n     Journal. The amount of betting is half the annual budget of \n     the chronically underfunded Head Start.\n       That is March Madness enough, but now the NCAA has quietly \n     adjusted the graduation rates to satisfy ``a new \n     interpretation'' of federal laws which say that information \n     on any category containing only one or two students ``must be \n     suppressed.''\n       In basketball, which has far fewer players than football or \n     baseball teams, the new rules amount to liberation from any \n     accountability whatsoever on the part of college athletic \n     departments and their presidents.\n       Because of the new rules, 37 of the 65 men's teams in this \n     year's tournament did not publish graduation rates of their \n     African-American players. Sixteen schools published no \n     graduation rates at all.\n       Nine of the 16 schools that mysteriously had no graduation \n     rate whatsoever just happen to include last year's most \n     hideous offenders, such as:\n       Alabama (0 percent for black men and 13 percent overall in \n     the 2002 report).\n       Cincinnati (0 percent for black men, 17 percent overall).\n       Louisville (0 for black men, 10 percent overall).\n       Kentucky (13 percent and 33 percent overall).\n       Southern Illinois (14 percent for black men and 27 percent \n     overall).\n       Memphis (0 period).\n       Nevada (0 percent for black men, 20 percent overall).\n       Virginia Commonwealth (0 period).\n       Alabama State (0 period).\n       The ``new rules'' did not stop the schools with good and \n     great graduation rates from publishing them, even when the \n     numbers of players on scholarship are obviously similar to \n     the schools that withheld the information. Kansas, Air Force, \n     Manhattan, Gonzaga, Vanderbilt, Central Florida, Duke, \n     Princeton, Valparaiso, Stanford, Monmouth and Xavier all had \n     African-American player graduation rates of at least 67 \n     percent.\n       Among New England schools in the men's and women's \n     tournament, the Connecticut men's team published its general \n     and woeful graduation rate of 27 percent, but withheld its \n     black rate. The UConn women's team published its general \n     graduation rate of 67 percent but withheld the black rate. \n     Boston College's men's team published both its 46 percent \n     overall and 67 percent African-American rate. BC's women's \n     team published its 71 percent overall rate but withheld its \n     black rate.\n       Rates for Providence's men were 42 percent overall, 50 \n     percent for black men, Vermont's men were 55 percent overall \n     and the school withheld a figure for black men. Maine's women \n     were at 69 percent overall, with no black women to count.\n       In the case of most of the New England schools, the \n     withholding of the black rate actually did not affect the \n     overall rate much as the white rate was similar to the \n     overall rate. But it was very clear that many other schools \n     purposely hid disastrous rates. For instance, Georgia Tech \n     did not publish the rate of its black athletes. But with a \n     white graduation rate of 60 percent, it managed to plummet to \n     an overall rate of 27 percent. Texas Tech did not publish the \n     rates for black athletes. But with a white graduation rate of \n     60 percent, it had an overall rate of only 33 percent.\n       Last year, 13 men's schools had a 0 graduation rate for \n     black men. The average black male graduation rate for the 65-\n     team field was 35 percent. With the liberation provided by \n     the new privacy rules, only one university in this year's \n     field published a black male rate under 38 percent. That was \n     Eastern Washington, where the rate was zero.\n       That is probably because that school is not a perennial \n     NCAA powerhouse. Give it time. A couple more appearances in \n     March Madness and school officials will join Kentucky, \n     Cincinnati, and Louisville in erasing its records, too. If \n     President Bush wins re-election and needs some more \n     bureaucrats to delete the truth, he knows where he can find \n     them. At the NCAA and in our nation's athletic departments.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Jackson comes at this issue a little differently. Mr. \nJackson says, let's take a close look and see how many are graduating \nwho are minorities, African Americans. He says:\n\n       This is March Madness . . . but now NCAA has quietly \n     adjusted the graduation rates to satisfy ``a new \n     interpretation'' of federal laws which say that information \n     on any category containing only one or two students ``must be \n     suppressed.''\n\n  What it basically means is that these schools will not publish the \ngraduation rates of their athletes, and particularly will not publish \nthe graduation rates of the African-American athletes who are playing \nbasketball.\n\n       Because of the new rules [as interpreted by the NCAA], 37 \n     of the 65 men's teams in this year's tournament did not \n     publish graduation rates of their African-American players. \n     Sixteen schools published no graduation rates at all.\n       Nine of the 16 schools that mysteriously had no graduation \n     rate whatsoever just happen to include last year's most \n     hideous offenders. . . .\n\n  He lists the following universities: Alabama University, zero-percent \ngraduation rate for Black players, and 13 percent overall--this is in a \n2002 report--Cincinnati, zero percent for African-American athletes, 17 \npercent overall; Louisville, zero percent for Black men, 10 percent \noverall; Kentucky, 13 percent for African Americans, 33 percent \noverall; Southern Illinois, 14 percent for Black men, 27 percent \noverall; Memphis, zero percent in both groups, Black and White \nbasketball players not graduating; Nevada, zero percent for Black men, \n20 percent overall; Virginia Commonwealth, zero percent in both \ncategories; Alabama State, zero percent, period.\n  He goes on to list the schools that can point with pride to their \ngraduation rates. Kansas, Air Force, Manhattan, Gonzaga, Vanderbilt, \nCentral Florida, Duke, Princeton, Valparaiso, Stanford, Monmouth, and \nXavier all had African-American player graduation rates of at least 67 \npercent.\n\n       Among New England schools in the men's and women's \n     tournament, the Connecticut men's team published its general \n     and woeful graduation rate of 27 percent, but withheld [the \n     graduation rate for African Americans].\n\n  Rates for Providence's men were 42 percent overall; 50 percent for \nBlack men. Vermont's men were 55 percent on their men's basketball team \noverall, and they withheld the figure for their African-American \nathletes.\n  Mr. President, the reason I think these two items should be in the \nRecord is that all of us enjoy watching college basketball. But, \nfrankly, if these athletes we are watching are not really college \nstudents, we are not watching the best of college basketball; we are \nwatching the best of colleges and universities that are sending teams \nof so-called students who have not even a ghost of a chance of ever \ngraduating from their institution.\n  These men in the men's tournament are being used. They are being used \nas players on the court in the hope that some of them will end up in \nprofessional basketball. I am sure that is their ambition, but such a \nsmall percentage ever do.\n  So we watch and applaud and talk about our alma maters and their \ndevotion to education when, in fact, these schools know full well that \nthe people who are being put on the court to play this game are, \nfrankly, never going to graduate in most instances in many of these \nschools.\n\n  What do the universities get out of it? A lot of money. They go to \nthe NCAA tournament, and the money comes back to them in revenue, money \nthat might have been spent to help some of their players get the help \nthey need to go on to graduate. But, sadly, that never happens.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be looking at this interpretation of the \nNCAA rule which allows them to suppress and, frankly, refuse to publish \nthe graduation rate of African-American players who are at the NCAA \ntournament, and, frankly, in all other sports. I think that should be \npublic knowledge. I think the leaders at the universities have an \nobligation to not only put the best basketball teams on the court but \nto make certain those teams are made up of real students who, with the \nhelp of the university,\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nare going to end up graduating someday and have a college education on \nwhich to build their lives.\n  Unfortunately, today, that is not the case. As the Chicago Tribune \neditorial concludes, when it comes to men's basketball, though, ``most \nschools apparently care more about winning than anything else. That \napproach creates far too many losers.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/22/senate-section/article/S2940-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
