Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the Defense authorization bill. There are seven pending amendments \nat this time, with two of those being second-degree amendments.\n  As I stated Friday, I expect rollcall votes at 5:30 today on some of \nthe pending amendments, or others that may be offered over the course \nof the afternoon.\n  At this time no votes have been set, but I will be consulting with \nthe chairman and ranking member as to which amendments will be ready \nfor rollcall votes this evening. We expect at least a couple of votes \ntoday on Defense amendments. As always, we will alert Members as those \nare set.\n  This is now the fourth week of consideration of this bill. The Senate \nbegan consideration of the Defense authorization on May 17. Since that \ntime, we have had a number of challenges with respect to the schedule, \nbut I think we have had adequate time to debate and consider this very \nimportant bill.\n  I vitiated the scheduled cloture vote last week, given a good-faith \neffort to complete this bill. Now is the time to work to bring this \nbill to an end.\n  Following tonight's votes, I hope we can stack additional votes for \nTuesday morning, with a further agreement as to what remains. We will \nbe prepared to stay late tomorrow if necessary in order to finish this \nbill. I expect Members to be prepared for that event.\n  Last, I have two scheduling reminders for Senators. The official \nphotograph will be taken tomorrow at 2:15. Senators should be seated \npromptly at their desks at 2:15 for that photograph.\n  Second, there is a possibility of a Members only briefing on Iraq for \nWednesday at 3 p.m. Once again, we will alert all Senators when this is \nall confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7061-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If the distinguished majority leader will allow me to offer \na few comments, it is my understanding that the distinguished chairman \nof the committee and Senator Lautenberg worked out side-by-side votes \non his amendment and your second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I said it is my understanding for this afternoon we could \nhave a vote on the Lautenberg amendment and also the amendment you \noffered in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators should put their remarks through \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask the chairman to comment on the schedule.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I talked to Senator Lautenberg this \nmorning. He made that request to me. I say this with all due respect. I \nsecond-degreed that amendment. The second degree, of course, would be \nin order for the first vote.\n  I just wonder. I am perfectly prepared to say yes, but if we begin to \nsequentially vote every second degree and underlying, we are going to \nbe here for some period of time. Could some evaluation be made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, after the vote on the second degree, \nas to whether in fact it merits the time of the Senate to go forward \nwith the second vote?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the distinguished chairman, as \nusual, makes a lot of sense. If, in fact, the second-degree amendment \nis agreed to overwhelmingly, of course it would not make a lot of sense \nto vote on that first amendment. I am sure we can work something out on \nthat. I wanted the majority leader to know that we at least have one \nvote, perhaps two votes, lined up tonight at 5:30 or whenever the \nmajority leader decides.\n  We have a number of other issues pending. Senator Durbin has offered \nan\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\namendment. It is my understanding Senators Hatch and Harkin wish to \nsecond-degree that amendment. Senator Durbin is, of course, waiting \naround to see what that second degree would do.\n  Senator Dayton has an amendment. He is willing to offer that. It is a \n``Buy American.'' He would agree to a short time period, but the \nSenator from Arizona said he wanted to be here when that amendment was \noffered so Senator Dayton is somewhat hesitant. I am going to talk to \nSenator Dayton and tell him he should get his vote out of the way \ntoday. If Senator McCain does choose to offer a second degree, we would \nbe that much further ahead.\n  Senator Bingaman has a number of amendments but it appears maybe they \ncan be worked out. Senator Bingaman thinks so. Senator Byrd is going to \nmake a decision tonight as to whether he is going to offer his \namendment. Senator Corzine is indisposed today and is unable to offer \nhis two amendments, but they should be on short time agreements. \nSenator Kennedy has said he would be ready to offer his first thing in \nthe morning.\n  So we are moving along. We don't have too much left to do. But there \nare a few things that will take a little bit of time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could reply, first, I think the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada has been extremely helpful and is \ncontinuing to be that way. Let me point out that we are prepared to \ntake up each and every one of those amendments that he just mentioned \nright now. In the case of Senator McCain, it could be that I could \npresent on his behalf the second degree, we could engage in part of \nthat debate on Dayton, and upon the arrival of Senator McCain, I am \nsure he could move right in and conclude the debate.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dayton is here. He would be willing to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is one option.\n  I am not certain as to the time of the arrival of the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch. But there again I don't have the knowledge. It is a \nmatter unrelated to the Defense bill. As you know, it relates to \ndietary supplements. I understand my committee chairman, Senator Gregg, \nhas some views on it. I expect we could begin to engage in some debate \non that prior to the arrival of Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me interject. The Senator from Utah \nwill be here early afternoon, sometime right after 2:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we could get started on that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will allow Senators to finish. I think \nfrom the discussion we all just witnessed, we are working very hard \nwith certain limitations with people who are here and the way they want \nto express themselves.\n  From a leadership standpoint, because this is the last week before \nthe recess and we have other important legislation, I want to encourage \nthe managers to do exactly what they are doing, and the leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle, to bring this bill to closure tomorrow night. \nIf it means working very hard today and tonight and starting early \ntomorrow with votes continuing late tomorrow night, I ask them to give \nevery consideration to that so we can move on to very important \nbusiness before our recess.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Mr. President, if I heard the distinguished leader \nproperly, the word was ``closure'' tomorrow night, not ``cloture''? I \nwant to make sure of that.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, Mr. President. We want to proceed in good \nfaith as we have been doing.\n  Mr. WARNER. As we have been doing.\n  Mr. FRIST. I vitiated the last cloture vote because I recognize the \ngood faith both sides are working in, but we need to bring the bill to \ncompletion tomorrow night if it is at all humanly possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my leader.\n  With respect to the first issue raised by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada about the Lautenberg measure, I did not mean in any sense \nto be negative about his approach. Frankly, it is a bipartisan issue, \nin my judgment. There will be Senators on both sides who will perhaps \nlook at this amendment, which I believe is an important one in terms of \nthe very critical subject before us today--that is, how this Nation \nbest respects those who lose their lives in the combat operations in \nfar lands today, primarily Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a serious \namendment. There will be, I think, some support on both sides for my \nproposition and perhaps as well for the position of my distinguished \nfriend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg.\n\n  But I wish to raise the subject of sequential votes in the case of \nsecond degrees. Each one should be looked at individually rather than \njust establishing an ironclad policy that we will proceed to have \nsequential votes every time there are second-degree amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7062-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2400, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2400) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2005 for military activities for the Department of \n     Defense for military construction, and for defense activities \n     of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths \n     for such fiscal year for the Armed Services, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Brownback amendment No. 3235, to increase the penalties for \n     violations by television and radio broadcasters of the \n     prohibitions against transmission of obscene, indecent, and \n     profane language.\n       Burns amendment No. 3457 (to amendment No. 3235), to \n     provide for additional factors in indecency penalties issued \n     by the Federal Communications Commission.\n       Durbin amendment No. 3225, to require certain dietary \n     supplement manufacturers to report certain serious adverse \n     events.\n       Lautenberg amendment No. 3291, to require a protocol on \n     media coverage of the return to the United States of the \n     remains of members of the Armed Forces who are killed \n     overseas.\n       Warner amendment No. 3458 (to amendment No. 3291), to \n     propose a substitute expressing the sense of Congress on \n     media coverage of the return to the United States of the \n     remains of deceased members of the Armed Forces from \n     overseas.\n       Reed amendment No. 3353, to limit the obligation and \n     expenditure of funds for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense \n     Program pending the submission of a report on operational \n     test and evaluation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason we have considered these side by \nside on a number of occasions is the person offering the amendment \ninitially wants a vote on his amendment. The second degree usually \nwipes out that amendment, which causes that person to reoffer the \namendment, which they have a right to do. It has been discovered in the \npast that we are much better off considering them side by side right \noff the bat rather than doing the parliamentary skirmishing. Of course, \nas I said to the distinguished Chair, if there is an overwhelming vote \non the second degree, a lot of times the Senator who offers the first \ndegree doesn't want to do that. That is what we will have to see.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I concur in the observation of our \ndistinguished colleague. All I am saying is we should look at each one \nindividually rather than establishing a policy at this point--certainly \nwith regard to this bill because, as the distinguished majority leader \nsaid, the Senate has devoted extensive time to this piece of \nlegislation. It is very important. I am optimistic that we can meet the \nschedule for completion tomorrow night. I hope that optimism is shared \non the other side.\n  At this time, the bill is open to amendment. The managers await the \narrival of the first Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first Senator we have indicated to speak \non an amendment will be here at 2 o'clock. Senator Dayton will be here \non the Buy America amendment. Senator Levin has a missile defense \namendment with which the distinguished Chair is familiar. He will be \nhere also to offer that amendment shortly. We probably won't have too \nmany other amendments offered today, but we will see. We have placed \ncalls, as you know. We have lined up for today Senators Levin, Dayton, \nByrd, and Bingaman. But we now understand that Senator Bingaman may not \nwant to offer his amendment, Senator Byrd\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nmay not want to offer his, and Senator Dayton's is with the condition, \nof course, which we have talked about. Senator Levin will be here. I \nassume Senator Levin's amendment will take probably an hour between \nboth sides. He usually doesn't talk very long.\n  We are in a position to move forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope we can perhaps reach the Byrd \namendment today. It is an important amendment. I have shared many \ndebates with my good and valued friend from West Virginia, and we are \nprepared. I cannot join him in support, but we will have a good, strong \ndebate on it. It will be, I believe, a historic debate to initiate \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today with Senator Byrd. He \nsaid he would make a decision tonight as to whether he is going to \noffer the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be available tonight should the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia desire to take up that debate \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to mention in the context of the \ndiscussion which has been held between the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Nevada that I believe the second-degree amendment \nwhich I had intended to offer to Senator Brownback's second-degree \namendment will be in order. I have been working throughout the weekend. \nThe question with the Parliamentarian was whether it would be relevant. \nI believe we have now revised that amendment so it will be relevant.\n  My understanding is Senator Brownback has offered an amendment on \nindecency to this Defense authorization bill which came out of the \nCommerce Committee with respect to broadcasting. Senator Burns of \nMontana offered a second degree to Senator Brownback's amendment.\n  I would not offer an amendment that would be extraneous to the \nDefense authorization bill except that the amendment Senator Brownback \noffered came out of Commerce Committee on a matter that addressed a \nrelated issue--that is, the concentration of broadcast ownership--which \nI, Senator Lott, Senator Snowe, and others added in the Commerce \nCommittee. Senator Brownback offered an amendment on the floor of the \nSenate excluding that provision. I understand why. I am not being \ncritical of him at all. But I would want to add that back using a \nsecond-degree slot as soon as we can find a way in which Senator Burns' \nsecond-degree slot will be resolved.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia: I am here and ready any time to \noffer that amendment. It would not be my intention to hold up the \nDefense authorization bill. In fact, I wouldn't be offering this \namendment were it not for the fact that Senator Brownback's amendment \non indecency was offered to the Defense bill when it came out of the \nCommerce Committee containing the amendment on broadcast ownership \nwhich I had previously offered with Senator Lott.\n  I wanted to make the Senator from Virginia aware that the second \ndegree I will offer, along with Senator Snowe and some others, is \ncertainly available, and I would want to find an opportunity to offer \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, on this side we have been very careful about \nextraneous amendments being offered. There are a lot of things we would \nlike to talk about. There is minimum wage, just to name one and which \nwe feel is long overdue. There are a lot of amendments regarding \nMedicare we could offer on this legislation--prescription drugs. But \nbecause this is an important Defense bill, we have chosen not to offer \nany extraneous amendments. We have been very thorough in stacking \namendments that would be offered on this side.\n  Speaking personally, that is why I am somewhat disappointed that an \namendment dealing with broadcast indecency would be offered on this \nbill because there is no question it will hold up things. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has led the effort in the Senate, and that effort has \nbeen successful. A limitation on what the administration did was passed \nby a wide margin. This just opens the door.\n  Senator Dorgan would be legislatively irresponsible if he didn't \noffer his amendment sometime during the pendency of this Brownback \namendment. I am in support of the Senator from North Dakota in offering \nthis amendment.\n\n  I want to underscore and underline that it is too bad this broadcast \nindecency amendment was offered on this bill because it is going to \ntake a little bit of time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are where we are. In the mortal words \nof someone smarter than I, we have to deal with the cards which have \nbeen dealt.\n  I have a suggestion. We are trying to work out how we could protect \nthe parliamentary situation as it now exists with regard to the Burns \nsecond degree such that we could proceed now with the debate on the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and at least \nhave the debate in place in the hopes that perhaps we could resolve \nthis dilemma as the day goes on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want it made clear that the reason I said \nthis is we have worked very hard to move this bill along. This is an \nimportant bill. We started off with about 300 amendments. Those \namendments were defense oriented with rare exception. The majority \nleader has worked hard and filed a cloture motion. That was withdrawn, \nand rightfully so. But now we have this measure being offered on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I want the Record to be very clear that the extraneous matters on \nthis important Defense bill have not come from this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so note that observation.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from North Dakota: Is the parliamentary \nsituation on his amendment now clear?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in response, my amendment would be a \nsecond-degree amendment offered to Senator Brownback, but that second-\ndegree slot, I believe at this moment, is filled by an amendment \npreviously offered by Senator Burns. I don't quite know how to resolve \nthat, but at some point Senator Burns' second-degree amendment will be \nresolved, that second-degree slot will be open, and I will offer an \namendment similar to that which we did in the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. I presume the Burns matter would require a recorded vote, \nso at this point in time I don't know whether the Senator is willing to \nuse this available time to explain his amendment, although it will not \nbe a pending matter before the Senate.\n  We will try to resolve the underlying parliamentary situation with \nregard to both amendments, the underlying amendment and the Burns \nsecond-degree amendment, so the Senator will have his opportunity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take a moment to consult with some \nstaff on our side with respect to the parliamentary situation.\n  Let me say again, so the Senator from Virginia is clear, and I think \nhe is, this Defense authorization bill needs to get completed with some \ndispatch. I sympathize with the challenge he and the Senator from \nMichigan have had trying to move it along. It is not my intent in any \nway to delay that.\n  I feel obligated, as I think do others in the Senate, that when \nSenator Brownback offered an extraneous amendment, that amendment which \npreviously included broadcast ownership limitation issues dealing with \nthe FCC rules, to add that back to the indecency language.\n  I will consult with our side in a moment and perhaps I can make some \ncomments about it, and if others wish to make comments, we would find a \nway to vote as soon as the Burns second-degree amendment is disposed \nof. Let me do some consultation and perhaps I can speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a reasonable request, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, together with the Senator from Nevada,\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\nthe Senator from Virginia, in consultation with leadership, presents to \nthe Senate this UC: I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Warner amendment No. 3458 \nwhich is to be drafted as a first degree; to be followed immediately by \na vote in relation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 3291; provided that \nno second degrees be in order to the amendments prior to those votes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3291, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished chairman allow me to send a modification for Senator \nLautenberg to the desk prior to this consent being approved.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmodification will be made.\n  The amendment (No. 3291), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 364. PROTOCOL ON MEDIA COVERAGE OF RETURN TO UNITED \n                   STATES OF REMAINS OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES WHO DIE OVERSEAS.\n\n       (a) Protocol Required.--(1) Not later than 60 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop a protocol that permits media coverage \n     of the return to the United States of the coffins containing \n     the remains of members of the Armed Forces who die overseas.\n       (2) The protocol shall ensure the preservation of the \n     dignity of the occasion of the return to the United States of \n     members of the Armed Forces who die overseas.\n       (3) The protocol shall ensure the preservation of the \n     confidentiality of the identity of each member of the Armed \n     Forces whose remains are returning to the United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a copy of the protocol developed under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no objection to the consent request \nby the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the leadership is working with the \nmanagers to see what we can do to resolve the question of one of the \namendments which is pending before the Senate with regard to matters \nrelating to the Commerce Committee. We see the Senator from North \nDakota prepared to speak to his amendment. As soon as we can work out \nthe parliamentary situation, we will proceed to that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been given a consent agreement \ndrafted by the staff that is now being vetted with the majority. We \nshould be in a position to approve that shortly which would allow us to \nhandle the underlying Brownback amendment, the Burns amendment, and the \nDorgan amendment, which we will offer on a future occasion not too long \nfrom now. That should resolve this totally. In the meantime, I think it \nwould be appropriate if the Senator from North Dakota spoke about his \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. It would be a valuable use of the time if we were to do \nso. We encourage that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say again this amendment is not \nrelated to the subject of the Defense authorization. The only reason I \noffer it is because the amendment offered by Senator Brownback, which \nitself is not related to Defense authorization, was offered last \nFriday. I indicated when he offered that amendment, which I support, \nthat I would second-degree it, because we second-degreed it in the \nCommerce Committee, and we merged two issues: indecency and the issue \nof broadcast ownership rules and regulations.\n  When my colleague from Kansas offers an indecency amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill, I don't have much choice except to offer \nthe amendment we offered to it in the Commerce Committee. If this bill \nis stripped of all extraneous amendments, I will understand that and I \nwill not complain. But if this bill is going to proceed with amendments \nof the type that came from the Commerce Committee, then I insist it \nalso include the issue of broadcast ownership rules and regulations \nthat were adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Let me describe what all this is about with respect to broadcast \nownership. The Federal Communications Commission did a rulemaking on \nthe issue of broadcast ownership. They had somewhere around three-\nquarters of a million Americans, unprecedented numbers of Americans, \nwrite and e-mail and send concerns and expressions of their interest to \nthe Federal Communications Commission. Almost all of them said to the \nFCC: Don't change the rules and regulations with respect to broadcast \nownership of properties in a way that injures the public interest.\n  It didn't matter to the FCC. They went ahead and changed the rules. \nThe way the FCC constructed it, the rules say: It is all right if in \nyour community--let's say you live in one of the biggest cities in \nAmerica--one company owns three television stations, eight radio \nstations, the cable company, and the dominant newspaper. That is fine.\n  Well, it is not fine with me--it is not fine with, by far, the \nmajority of the American people--to see fewer and fewer Americans, no \nmore than a handful, who are going to have control over what the rest \nof the American people see, hear, and read.\n  Let me say again what the FCC allowed. In the biggest cities of the \ncountry, one company can come in and buy up eight radio stations, three \ntelevision stations, the cable company, and the dominant newspaper--in \nmany cases, the only newspaper. Why is this of concern? Well, it is of \nconcern to me because we license the use of the airwaves. They don't \nbelong to broadcasters or radio stations or television stations. They \nbelong to the people. The airwaves belong to the American people. We \nlicense their use to certain companies in exchange for certain \nobligations.\n  One of those obligations that has never and will never be old \nfashioned is localism. That is not an old-fashioned requirement for \nbroadcasters. So the question is, how do you develop or how do you \nmaintain or how do you have localism in broadcast properties when one \ncompany owns, in this case, 1,200 radio stations. Yes, that is the \ncase. One company owns 1,200 radio stations.\n  We did hearings about all these subjects. Let me tell you about \nsomething called voice tracking. This is antithetical to localism. \nVoice tracking is a process by which a company that owns a lot of radio \nstations will have someone in a basement in Baltimore, MD broadcasting. \nAnd he is broadcasting over, for example, a station in Salt Lake City, \nUT, saying: It is a beautiful morning here in Salt Lake City. The sun \nis shining over the mountains. What a great day to wake up in our city.\n\n  The problem is, that guy was broadcasting from Baltimore. He was \nusing the Internet to find out that the sun is shining in Salt Lake \nCity. It is called voice tracking. It is fooling the consumers into \nbelieving that announcer is there. It has nothing to do with localism \nor responsibilities of localism.\n  There is another approach used by television stations. It is called \ncentral casting. It is trying to make you believe the news team is from \nyour city when, in fact, it is not. Central casting, voice tracking, \nthese are mechanisms by which the large concentrations of broadcasters \nare trying to convince people there is localism to their broadcasts.\n  Some of us believe very strongly that this is moving in the wrong \ndirection. I am not opposed to big because something is big. Good for \nthe folks who are successful. If somebody has two radio stations and \nbuys two more, good for them. If they have eight and buy eight more, \ngood for them. If they have 50 and buy 50 more, I am not going to come \nhere and complain about that. But 1,200 radio stations in the hands of \none company? Or television broadcasting stations being gobbled up \ntogether under one big ownership group? Is that good for our country, \nespecially in an area where, in most cases, you have monopolies or near \nmonopolies and now this FCC rule says, in addition to all of that, with \nrespect to broadcasting properties, we are going to get rid of that \npernicious rule that allows cross ownership of broadcast properties \nwith the newspaper?\n  At the hearing in the Commerce Committee, I held up a letter that was \nsent out all across the country by an investment banking company. They \nsaid: Get ready, because the FCC is fixing to change its rule, and when \nthey\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\ndo, your newspapers can buy up a bunch of broadcast properties. And so \nthey are already.\n  The FCC rule, fortunately for us, has not yet gone into effect \nbecause it was stayed by a Federal court. This issue is now in the \nFederal court. So there is a stay order. It may well be lifted soon \nwhen the Federal court makes its judgment. But that begs for the \nCongress to make its own judgment to overturn and rescind the FCC \nrules.\n  Senator Lott, Senator Snowe, myself, and others brought this issue to \nthe Senate floor with something called a veto of an administrative \nrule. It is called the Congressional Accountability Act in which we \nhave the opportunity to veto a rule by a Federal Agency. It has only \nbeen used once. We offered that. And by a very significant margin, we \nwon. So the expression of the Senate already has been to say: We don't \nsupport the FCC rule. We believe it should be rescinded. And using the \nCongressional Accountability Act, the Senate, on a bipartisan vote, \nsaid: We don't want these rules to go into effect, FCC, start over and \ndo it right. Well, that Senate vote went to the House of \nRepresentatives and it is now sitting at the desk in the House of \nRepresentatives 10 votes short. They need 218 votes. They have a letter \nwith 208 signatures on it and they are 10 short and they cannot move.\n\n  The Speaker of the House and the administration very much oppose \nthis. They have stymied it in the House of Representatives. My feeling \nis that the only opportunity we have in a circumstance such as this is \nto offer an amendment on a bill, such as the Brownback bill--and, \nincidentally, we are faithful to our determination to move this. We \noffered the same amendment in the Commerce Committee when Senator \nBrownback brought up his legislation. We prevailed there.\n  I support the Brownback legislation and the second-degree amendment \nthat Senator Burns intends to offer to it as well. I hope the Senate \nwill, once again, support my second-degree amendment once the amendment \nby Senator Burns is disposed of.\n  We had testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, and I don't \nremember the fellow's name. He testified two or three times. He owns a \npretty big broadcasting company in one of the States south of here. He \nexplained the problem with the growth and concentration in \nbroadcasting. He said: I own a good television station, but I cannot \ntell the folks from Hollywood or New York what I want to show in my \nviewing area because if they are sending out a program I think is \nsomething I don't want to show, I don't have the opportunity to say we \nwill not show that. I will lose my network affiliate status if I do \nthat. I don't have the capability to make any kind of local decision \nabout this.\n  Look, I happen to think broadcasting, whether it is radio or \ntelevision, has some of the most breathtaking, wonderful, remarkable \nprogramming; some of it is extraordinary. I also think there are \nprograms that are shabby, trashy, and disgusting. You have both sides \nof it. I don't know, maybe somebody adds to their cultural interests by \ntuning in on HDTV and seeing someone eating maggots from a bowl in a \ncontest. I don't know. I would expect that very few find much interest \nin that. I guess it does achieve some ratings from time to time.\n  But when you have concentrations of broadcast properties, as has been \nthe case, dramatic increases in just the hands of a few people deciding \nwhat the rest of the American people are going to see, read, and hear, \nI think it ought to be of great concern to the Congress. The FCC rule \ncaved in almost instantly to the big economic interests here.\n  I know those who own newspapers are upset with the position I take. \nThose who own broadcast properties are upset with the position I take. \nBut the fact is, this is about the public interest, and the public \ninterest is best served when we decide localism is not old-fashioned. I \ndon't object to some big companies. But I object to circumstances when \nthe big companies are given the green light by the FCC to own almost \neverything in a community with respect to communications--radio \nstation, television stations, the cable company.\n  Whatever happened to the market system? The market system is where \nyou have robust competition, broad-based economic ownership. I don't \nsee much of that market system in broadcasting these days. All you see \nare the gobbling up by big interests.\n\n  It is interesting, we now have a 35-percent ownership cap on national \nviewing by the major television networks, in terms of the number of \nstations they can own, which has now, as a result of last year's \nomnibus bill, gone to 39 percent. It used to be 25 percent.\n  In fact, in 1996, when we had a bill on the floor called the \nTelecommunications Act, we had a prohibition on owning television \nstations beyond 25 percent of the national audience. That new bill took \n35 percent. I came to the Senate floor in 1996 and offered an amendment \nto take it back to 25 percent--the national ownership cap--with respect \nto one company. It is interesting, we debated that about 4 o'clock in \nthe afternoon and then we had a vote. It turns out I won the vote. \nSenator Dole, with a pretty substantial opposition on the floor of the \nSenate when he wanted to be, was on the other side. So we had a vote on \nbroadcast ownership limitation and I won, I think by three or four \nvotes. I thought that was extraordinary, to win a vote like that. Then \nI believe Senator D'Amato, as the vote was coming to an end, changed \nhis vote to be on my side, the prevailing side.\n  I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what until 4 hours \nlater. What had intervened 4 hours later was dinner. Apparently, there \nwas some epiphany over dinner for four or five Senators, who came back, \nand there was a motion to reconsider; these Senators who had had some \nglorious meal, which apparently infused them with a different wisdom, \nchanged their vote and it turned out I had won only for 4 hours. That \nhappens around here. You can win big and long but sometimes not \npermanently. That was the case in 1996.\n  I express that to say this is not a new issue with me. I have been \nconcerned about this concentration of broadcast ownership for a long \nwhile. What the FCC has done is compounded the problem. Not only are we \nsaying ``Katey bar the door,'' whatever you want to buy, buy it, but we \nwill add to the mix the newspapers. While you are buying each other up \nand playing these monopoly games, throw in the newspapers as well. We \ndon't care very much. That is the message from the FCC.\n  Fortunately, the Senate has sent a different message. We already \nvoted on this subject and expressed our interest that the rules crafted \nby the Federal Communications Commission are completely out of sync \nwith reality and ought to be rescinded. That was a big vote in the \nSenate. There was no reconsideration. We had to come back and lose that \none. Senator Lott and myself and others spoke in support of overturning \nthose rules. That is stuck in the House because the Speaker will not \nallow a vote on it. We are going to have to find a way, in whatever \nexpression we can, to advance this issue.\n  Because Senator Brownback brought to the floor a bill that used to \ninclude this amendment when it came out of the Commerce Committee, but \nis not what he offered on the floor, I am required to offer this \namendment to the Brownback amendment. I will offer it in the second \ndegree.\n  My understanding is, while there is already a second-degree in the \nform of Senator Burns' amendment, when I offer this at the end of my \npresentation, the second-degree I will offer will be able to be \ndisposed of when the amendment of Senator Burns is disposed.\n  I support the Brownback amendment and the Burns amendment. If anybody \ncan understand all that, they are perhaps better than I am. I say to \nthe Senator from Virginia, I would like us to finish this Defense \nauthorization bill and deal with these issues. I encourage the Senator \nto accept all three of these amendments and take them to conference.\n\n  If I might get the attention of the Senator from Nevada, Senator \nReid, I think we will need a unanimous consent request prior to my \nformally offering a second-degree amendment, since there is already a \nsecond-degree amendment in the slot. But having already spoken on this, \nI don't need to speak further. Perhaps Senators Snowe, or Lott, or \nothers wish to speak in favor of the amendment. I will rely on the \nSenator from Virginia and\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\nthe Senator from Nevada to offer my amendment at the appropriate time \nwhen the consent is agreed to, and then mine would be disposed of \nfollowing Senator Burns' second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator's understanding \ncoincides with that of myself and the distinguished Senator from \nNevada. In due course, several parties who have an active interest in \nnot only the parliamentary situation but the substance are soon to \narrive in the Senate. We have to wait a bit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are some interests, of course, outside of the \nChamber that would not want this amendment to the Brownback bill. I \nwant to make sure we have an understanding that I get the opportunity \nto do this. Otherwise, I have a much longer statement that I would be \nprepared to make. My preference would be to leave it at this and to \nsimply get this pending as soon as possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we understand. A Senator asked for a few \nminutes of morning business and then I would be prepared to engage with \nSenator Bingaman on his amendment, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Mexico is here to offer his amendment. \nThe Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, is on his way to offer his \namendment. We also have the missile defense amendment to offer, and he \nindicated he would be happy to do that today. So we have a lot to do.\n\n  I was looking at my BlackBerry, which is giving this information, \nwhich is the reason we are here today:\n  Four U.S. servicemembers were killed Monday, shot repeatedly in the \nhead during an ambush while they were on patrol in the Sunni Muslim \nstronghold of Ramadi. On Sunday, two servicemen were killed and 11 \ninjured in an ambush on the road to the airport.\n  That is what this is all about today.\n  We ought to move this bill along, not only as quickly as we can, but \nwith as much quality as we can. This is an important piece of \nlegislation. We certainly understand that in 2 days, six Americans were \nkilled in Iraq. We only know of 11 wounded, but I am sure a lot more \nthan that were wounded. Each person in the Senate understands the \nimportance of this legislation. We are reminded of that every day when \nwe see news such as this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing up that \npoint. I, too, am concerned, as is every Member of this body, about the \ndaily, weekly loss of life and limb by our brave men and women in the \nArmed Forces. As the Senator says, this is their bill. That is what it \nis. It is their bill, whether they are privates or generals or \nadmirals.\n  Might we accommodate the Senator from Ohio?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The distinguished Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nVirginia.\n\n\n                            Update on Darfur\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I came to the floor to \ntalk about the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, where it is estimated at least \n30,000 people have already been killed and 1 million people--maybe even \n2 million--have lost their homes, have been driven from their homes in \na government-led campaign of ethnic cleansing. To get a better idea or \nanother way of looking at this, it is estimated that in this \ngovernment-led campaign of ethnic cleansing, 341 villages have been \ncompletely destroyed, and 99 villages have been partially destroyed. It \nis also estimated these villages are, on average, made up of 4,000 or \n5,000 people to a village. I think my colleagues can understand the \ngravity of this crisis.\n  Many of these individuals are now homeless. Those who have not been \nkilled have fled, and many of them are in refugee camps. The looming \ncrisis is absolutely unbelievable. This is clearly the world's greatest \ncrisis today.\n  The Government of Sudan announced this past weekend it intends to \ndisarm the militia responsible for these atrocities and present them to \njustice. We can only hope and pray what the Government of Sudan says is \nnow correct. The Government of Sudan has made similar statements in the \npast that have turned out not to be true. The Government of Sudan has \nmade similar statements in the past. For example, it is OK for refugees \nto return to Darfur, all at the same time their very own government \nplanes were locating villages for the militias to attack. In addition, \nthere are still 1 to 2 million people still in need of humanitarian \nassistance.\n\n  We do not need promises from the Government of Sudan. What we do \nneed, though, is action. That is why I am back on the floor today to \noutline what we need to see accomplished in Darfur.\n  First, we need to see that the Government of Sudan is allowing \nunfettered access to humanitarian aid. This means granting visas and \ntravel permits in a timely manner, not just to U.S. Government \nagencies, but to all of the groups trying to help deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis that exists today in Darfur.\n  If one truck or one pallet of supplies is unreasonably delayed, the \nGovernment of Sudan must be held accountable. The Government of Sudan \nmust know the world is watching and that we will not accept anything \nshort of their full cooperation.\n  Second, the recent decision to disarm the militias needs to be \naccompanied by a plan to prosecute those guilty of ethnic cleansing and \ngenocide. The ranks of the government and military branches in Sudan \nneed to be searched, and those guilty of participating in the ethnic \ncleansing need to be prosecuted. Competent tribunals need to be \nestablished and justice served in Darfur. An unjust peace will provide \nno peace for Darfur.\n  Third, the Government of Sudan must prove they have a long-term plan \nto ensure that these atrocities simply will not continue. That is why \nit is essential we dedicate the resources necessary to ensure a robust \nAfrican Union monitoring mission in Darfur. The Darfur region is the \nsize of Texas and, therefore, a handful of monitors simply will not be \nenough to ensure that the killing and violence has stopped. We must be \ncommitted to this in the long haul and the Government of Sudan must be \nas well.\n  Until such time as the Government of Sudan accomplishes all of these \nthings, we should not relieve any of the pressure we have put on them, \nand neither should the international community. The pressure is \nbeginning to work, but it must continue. Therefore, I believe the \nUnited Nations Security Council must pass a resolution authorizing \npeacekeepers for Darfur. If the Government of Sudan is serious about \nending this conflict, then they have no reason to object to U.N. troops \nmonitoring the cease-fire and ensuring that the humanitarian aid flows. \nIf the Government of Sudan objects to peacekeepers, we will know their \npromises were not serious. This is a litmus test and the world will be \nwatching.\n  We also should expect the U.S. Department of State to move forward in \nnaming names of militia members and Sudanese Government officials \ninvolved in the killings and atrocities. We must do everything in our \npower to ensure that the guilty are punished. For the women who are \nraped and then branded, for the children who were slaughtered, and for \nthe 30,000 who were killed because of the color of their skin, we must \nensure that justice is served.\n  I closed my speech last time talking about time and about how our \nwindow of opportunity was closing. Nothing has changed. We still face \nthe worst humanitarian crisis in the world, and 2 million people are \ncounting on us. If we are serious after the horrible tragedy a decade \nago of Rwanda, if we are serious that we will never again allow \ngenocide to go unpunished, if we are serious that we will not allow \nthis to happen again, we cannot lose our focus. The Government of Sudan \nmust know we are still watching, that we will continue to watch, and \nthat nothing short of complete compliance will deter us from helping \nthe people of Darfur.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is very important to keep in focus what \nSenator DeWine spoke about. There has been much too little focus by all \nof us on this subject. The leadership of Senator DeWine in reminding us \nof what is going on is critically important, and I thank the Senator \nfor it.\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\n  For close to two decades, the nation of Sudan has been ravaged by a \ncivil war that has claimed over 2 million lives. This civil war, which \nis the longest running conflict in Africa, shows few signs of abating \nas many efforts to negotiate peace agreements or cease-fires have \nfailed. What is particularly troubling is the fact that this conflict \nhas shifted and spread to the Darfur region in Western Sudan.\n  Historically, this civil war has pitted Northern Sudan, which is \nlargely Muslim, against those in the south who are predominately \nChristian or animist. The conflict is not only religious in nature; \nwhile setting those who would force a program of Islamization upon the \nentire nation against unwitting supplicants, this conflict also draws \nupon disputes over oil, water rights, and the future shape and form \nthat Sudan will take as a nation.\n  Given the nature of this conflict, the recent announcement by the \nGovernment of Sudan that it would disarm the Janjaweed--militias \nsupported by the government of Khartoum--is a welcome sign. The ethnic \ncleansing undertaken by the Janjaweed has claimed tens of thousands of \nlives and has created over a million internally displaced persons as \nwell as hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled across the \nborder to Chad.\n  Furthermore, the United Nations has noted that the conflict in the \nDarfur has claimed over 30,00 lives. according the International Crisis \nGroup, as many as 350,000 more lives will be claimed in the next 9 \nmonths if conditions do not improve. It is imperative for the \ninternational community to take clear and decisive steps to halt the \nviolence and to provide humanitarian aid to refugees and displaced \npersons.\n  The Government of Sudan has a long history of denying aid to those in \nneed. Their tactics have been developed through decades of practice and \nhave included refusing to allow U.N. chartered planes with relief goods \nto land in Sudan as well as instituting delays for trucks carrying \nrelief items. Camps that serve as home to over a million Internally \nDisplaced Persons are in woeful condition, and only exacerbate the \nspread of disease and illness. It is imperative that medical supplies \nand foodstuffs become available immediately. Further delays only mean \nthat more lives will be lost. Just as there cannot be a delay in the \ndistribution of aid, the international community must take steps to \nprovide the needed funds for this aid. The United Nations initially \nappealed for over $170 million in aid for Darfur and Chad. Only $50 \nmillion, the bulk of which has been provided by the U.S., has been \nprovided while the amount of funds needed has increased to $250 \nmillion.\n  Food and medical aid can save lives immediately, yet steps must be \ntaken to ensure that a lasting a sustainable peace can be reached. To \nthat end, rebels must be disarmed. Given that these rebels operate with \nthe approval and support of the Sudanese Government and military, this \nis an undertaking that can occur immediately if the political will to \ndo so can be mustered. Disarming the rebels is a good step, but it is \nnot sufficient. The rebel groups cannot be subsumed into the military \nand police forces. All those involved in the perpetration and support \nof ethnic cleansing must be prosecuted so that justice can be \nadministered.\n  None of this will occur without the leadership of the international \ncommunity. Thus far, for two decades, the world had done too little to \naddress this threat. The United States and the United Nations must take \nsteps to ensure that the international community is empowered to \neffectively and efficiently ensure that a peace resolution is reached \nand that it is implemented immediately.\n  Unfortunately, the cry of ``never again'' has been used all too \nfrequently when lamenting the propagation of conscious, deliberative, \nand genocidal actions. It is imperative that decisive action is taken \nto help bring peace to Sudan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Frist and Mr. Wyden pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2551 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are awaiting, and there is diligence on \nthe other side in every respect, either the amendment of Senator Dayton \nor the amendment from Senator Bingaman. We have given them our second \ndegrees in each case, which are now being studied. Until such time as \none of the managers on the other side or these Senators appear, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2459\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3459.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require reports on the detainment of foreign nationals by \n the Department of Defense and on Department of Defense investigations \n         of allegations of violations of the Geneva Convention)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. REPORTS ON MATTERS RELATING TO DETAINMENT OF \n                   PRISONERS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Reports Required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every six months \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the population \n     of persons held by the Department of Defense for more than 30 \n     days and on the facilities in which such persons are held.\n       (b) Report Elements.--Each report under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) General information on the foreign national detainees \n     in the custody of the Department for more than 30 days during \n     the 6-month period ending on the date of such report, \n     including the following:\n       (A) The total number of such detainees in the custody of \n     the Department at any time during such period.\n       (B) The countries in which such detainees were detained, \n     and the number of detainees detained in each such country.\n       (C) The total number of detainees in the custody of the \n     Department as of the date of such report.\n       (D) The total number of detainees released from the custody \n     of the Department during such period.\n       (E) The nationalities of the detainees covered by \n     subparagraph (A), including the number of detainees of each \n     such nationality.\n       (F) The number of detainees covered by subparagraph (A) \n     that were transferred to the jurisdiction of another country \n     during such period.\n       (2) For each foreign national detained by the Department of \n     Defense during the six-month period ending on the date of \n     such report the following:\n       (A) The name.\n       (B) The nationality.\n       (C) The place at which taken into custody.\n       (D) The circumstances of being taken into custody.\n       (E) The place of detention.\n       (F) The current length of detention or, if released, the \n     duration of detention at the time of release.\n       (G) A categorization as a military detainee or civilian \n     detainee.\n       (H) The intentions of the United States Government on such \n     detainee, including whether or not the United States will--\n       (i) continue to hold such detainee with justification;\n       (ii) repatriate such detainee; or\n       (iii) charge such detainee with a crime.\n       (I) The history, if any, of transfers of such detainee \n     among detention facilities, including whether or not such \n     detainee been detained at other facilities and, if so, at \n     which facilities and in what locations.\n       (3) Information on the detention facilities and practices \n     of the Department for the six-month period ending on the date \n     of such report, including for each facility of the Department \n     at which detainees were detained by the Department during \n     such period the following:\n       (A) The name of such facility.\n       (B) The location of such facility.\n       (C) The number of detainees detained at such facility over \n     the course of such period and as of the end of such period.\n       (D) The capacity of such facility.\n       (E) The number of military personnel assigned to such \n     facility over the course of such period and as of the end of \n     such period.\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\n       (F) The number of other employees of the United States \n     Government assigned to such facility over the course of such \n     period and as of the end of such period.\n       (G) The number of contractor personnel assigned to such \n     facility over the course of such period and as of the end of \n     such period.\n       (c) Form of Report.--Each report under subsection (a) shall \n     be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment \nthat would require the Department of Defense to provide to the \nappropriate committees of the Congress--that is the Armed Services \nCommittee Senator Warner chairs here in the Senate, the Armed Services \nCommittee in the House, and the two Intelligence Committees of both the \nHouse and Senate--a report related to those prisoners they are \ndetaining and that they have had in detention for at least 30 days.\n  Some could characterize this as the anti-ghost-prisoner amendment. \nThis is an effort to be sure Congress has the basic information it \nneeds to exercise oversight of the Pentagon, of the Department of \nDefense, with regard to detainees anywhere in the world. The effect of \nthe amendment would be to require that the report advise the committees \non who these people are, what is their nationality, where are they \nbeing detained--in which facility, that is--and whether the Department \nof Defense intends to keep them, has justification for intending to \nkeep them in detention, intends to repatriate them to their home \ncountry, or intends to charge them with some crime and prosecute them. \nThose are the obvious choices. If there are others my colleagues could \nsuggest, I would be glad to add those to the language of the amendment.\n  The idea is the committees of the Congress with jurisdiction in this \narea should have some knowledge about the extent of the detentions we \nare engaged in, our Department of Defense is engaged in. The amendment \nas I have drafted it calls for this report to be made every 6 months so \nthe Congress could exercise a meaningful oversight.\n  You could say, What has prompted this kind of amendment? There are a \nlot of accounts in recent days in the news that have prompted it. I \nthink many people have probably noticed some of these news accounts. \nThere was an article in the Financial Times on Saturday. ``Guantanamo \nPrisoners Wrongly Held'' is the headline. Then the body of the article \nsays:\n\n       The U.S. released more than two dozen prisoners from \n     Guantanamo Bay earlier this year after Pentagon lawyers \n     determined that some had been detained wrongly for as long as \n     2 years.\n\n  It goes on in another paragraph of the same article:\n\n       But the Financial Times has learned that in January the \n     Pentagon sent a team of lawyers to Guantanamo to examine \n     whether there was sufficient evidence to justify some of the \n     detentions.\n\n  Then it goes on and says:\n\n       The Pentagon team's recommendation that in several cases \n     there was insufficient evidence to justify their imprisonment \n     alarmed the White House because of the need to persuade the \n     Supreme Court of the legality of the detentions.\n\n  That is one article which obviously raised concerns. Frankly, what \nraised concerns, at least for me, was the various articles recounting \nthe statements by the Secretary of Defense to the effect that he had \ndirected the appropriate information as to at least one prisoner and \nperhaps several be withheld from the Red Cross. It is required to be \ngiven to the Red Cross under the Geneva Conventions. He had ordered \nthat it not be given to the Red Cross at the request of the head of the \nCIA. This is the so-called ghost prisoner phenomenon we have been \nreading about in recent days.\n  About 10 months ago I offered an amendment here on the Senate floor \nto try to require a report from the Pentagon, and from the Department \nof Defense, on that category of prisoners whom the administration has \ndesignated as enemy combatants.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment failed. Many of my colleagues voted \nagainst it.\n  Senator Stevens made a representation on the Senate floor that the \nIntelligence Committee has access to information about enemy \ncombatants, including the names of who is being detained. It says the \nRed Cross is fully engaged in this information.\n  I tried, frankly, over a period of several weeks to find out if that \nwas the case. My first information was the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee did not have that information. I am now informed they do have \nthe information but that it is classified in such a way that only the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee have \naccess to it.\n  I believe as Members of Congress who have responsibility of oversight \nof the executive branch it is appropriate that at least the appropriate \ncommittees get the same basic information about these detainees that we \nare required under the Geneva Conventions to give to the Red Cross. I \ndon't know why information should be provided to the Red Cross that the \nCongress itself shouldn't be entitled to.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree both that we should provide the \ninformation to the Red Cross as the Geneva Conventions commit us to \nprovide since we are signatories to the Geneva Conventions, and second, \nthat Congress should be entitled to the same basic information.\n  I have asked in my amendment which I have sent to the desk for some \nadditional information--information that the Red Cross is not entitled \nto under the Geneva Conventions.\n  The main thing I have asked for, frankly, with regard to the \ndetainees is the Secretary of Defense advise the appropriate committees \nof the Congress as to what the intention of our Government is with \nregard to these individuals. Do we intend to maintain them in \ndetention? Do we have justification to do so? Do we intend to \nrepatriate them to another country? Or do we intend to charge them with \na crime?\n  It seems to me that is an appropriate request for us to be making.\n  I have been embarrassed--as I believe many in the Congress have \nbeen--at the revelations about treatment of prisoners. I have also been \nsurprised at the revelations about the extent of the detentions we are \nengaged in, particularly in Iraq but also in Afghanistan, and the \nnumber of people we seem to have in custody.\n  I think it is entirely appropriate that the Congress try to exercise \nsome type of oversight on an ongoing basis to ensure that basic human \nrights are respected, and that the standards we have committed to in \nthe Geneva Conventions are, in fact, being adhered to.\n  I think this is a very straightforward request. It does nothing but \nrequire a report every 6 months.\n  I know my colleague and former chairman, Senator Warner, has had some \nconcerns about the particular aspects of this amendment and has come up \nwith an alternative which he would like to offer and put before the \nSenate as well as a second-degree amendment.\n  I would be happy to engage in some serious discussion about the \nparticular provisions of my amendment as well as the second-degree \namendment Senator Warner has indicated he desires to offer. But, as I \nsay, I think the basic bottom-line position I am taking is there is no \nreason Congress should be denied information which we are otherwise \nproviding to the Red Cross.\n\n  There is certainly no problem if the Department of Defense believes \nthis information needs to be held confidentially in classified form. My \namendment provides for that. It is their determination. If they think \nthis has to be classified, they can classify it. They can put portions \nof this report in a classified annex. But to say Congress should not \nget the information at all I think is not an appropriate response.\n  For that reason, I hope my amendment will be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3460 to Amendment No. 3459\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3460 to amendment number 3459.\n\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. REPORTS ON MATTERS RELATING TO DETAINMENT OF \n                   PRISONERS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Reports Required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every six months \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the population \n     of detainees held by the Department of Defense and on the \n     facilities in which such detainees are held. The report may \n     be submitted in classified form.\n       (b) Report Elements.--Each report under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) General information on the foreign national detainees \n     in the custody of the Department during the six-month period \n     ending on the date of such report, including the following:\n       (A) The total number of detainees in the custody of the \n     Department as of the date of such report.\n       (B) The countries in which such detainees were detained, \n     and the number of detainees detained in each such country.\n       (C) The total number of detainees released from the custody \n     of the Department during such period.\n       (D) The nationalities of the detainees covered by \n     subparagraph (A), including the number of detainees of each \n     such nationality.\n       (E) The number of detainees covered by subparagraph (A) \n     that were transferred to the jurisdiction of another country \n     during such period, and the identity of each such country.\n       (2) Information on the detention facilities and practices \n     of the Department for the six-month period ending on the date \n     of such report, including for each facility of the Department \n     at which detainees were detained by the Department during \n     such period the following:\n       (A) The name of such facility.\n       (B) The location of such facility.\n       (C) The number of detainees detained at such facility over \n     the course of such period and as of the end of such period.\n       (D) The capacity of such facility.\n       (E) The number of military personnel assigned to such \n     facility over the course of such period and as of the end of \n     such period.\n       (F) The number of other employees of the United States \n     Government assigned to such facility over the course of such \n     period and as of the end of such period.\n       (G) The number of contractor personnel assigned to such \n     facility over the course of such period and as of the end of \n     such period.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me first say I think our colleague has \nbrought to the attention of the Senate through his amendment a very \nimportant subject. It is my hope and expectation that we can eventually \nhave a meeting of the minds. I don't take great joy in putting a \nsecond-degree amendment up on important subjects such as this, but I \nfelt it imperative so we can frame for our membership what I perceive \nas a very conscientious presentation by the Senator of a set of goals \nin which I concur with two-thirds of the Senator's objectives. But \nwhere I ask there be a reservation, those reservations are of such \nseverity that I am compelled to put in the second-degree amendment.\n  I would like to walk through the amendment which the distinguished \nSenator put forth page by page.\n  The first section says:\n\n       Reports on matters relating to detainment of prisoners by \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n  Ordinarily, a report is something we are happy to grant a colleague. \nBut in this instance, I will point out where my concerns are. First:\n\n       Reports required. Not later than 90 days after date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every six months thereafter, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the appropriate \n     committees of the Congress a report on the population of \n     detainees held by the Department of Defense and on the \n     facilities in which detainees are held.\n\n  That is, have been held more than 30 days.\n  My understanding was originally it didn't have that, and 30 days to \nme is reasonable. The Senator also added that the report can be \nsubmitted now in classified form. Again, that is a very essential \nimprovement.\n  But we then continue:\n\n       (b) Report Elements. Each report under subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) General information on the foreign national detainees \n     in the custody of the Department during the six-month period \n     ending on the date of such report, including the following:\n       (A) The total number of detainees in the custody of the \n     Department . . .\n\n  I think that is an important fact, and I simply say ``as of the date \nof such report.'' I think that should be something which would be \nacceptable to the Senator.\n  Section (B) we leave standing.\n\n       The countries in which such detainees were detained, and \n     the number of detainees detained in each country.\n\n  That is acceptable.\n  Section (C) we take out simply because we modified (A) to state as of \ndate of such report, and I think (C) is cared for by modifying (A) with \ndate of such report.\n  Then we drop down:\n\n       The total number of detainees released from the custody of \n     the Department during such period.\n\n  We accept that fully.\n\n       (D) The nationality of the detainees covered by \n     subparagraph (A), including the number of detainees of each \n     such nationality.\n\n  That, too, seems to us to be fine.\n  Then section (F)--no objection there. That says, ``The number of \ndetainees covered by subparagraph (A) that were transferred from \njurisdiction of another country,'' so you can track them.\n  The Senator modified the original amendment. I am working from the \noriginal to show to date how much we have had meeting of the minds.\n  The Senator took out section (G). I will not trouble to talk about \nit.\n  We take out subsection (2). That is subsection (2) of the first \nparagraph of the amendment, report elements under (b).\n  As drafted, we delete for each foreign national detained by the \nDepartment of Defense during the 6-month period ending on the date of \nsuch report: No. 1, the name of the individual; No. 2, his or her \nnationality; the place at which they were taken into custody; the \ncircumstances of being taken into custody; the place of detention; the \ncurrent length of detention, or at least the duration of detention at \nthe time of release. And on it goes.\n\n  Here is the problem. That bit of information, even though it were \nclassified, were it ever to leak out--and regrettably, we know things \nof this nature will happen from time to time--it would be devastating \nbecause the enemy would know a great deal about custody and what we are \ntrying to do with those individuals.\n  It seems to me there is far greater benefit to an enemy in such \nengagements as we must take prisoners than it would be of benefit to \nthe legislative body to monitor that prisoners are properly being cared \nfor. For example, the Durbin amendment we had the other day goes to \npotential abuses. That has been accepted. It is a major step forward to \ncodify prohibitions against abuse of prisoners. We are all troubled by \nthat.\n  To have in the custody of the Congress this type of information, even \nthough it is locked up in S-407, or wherever it may be, potentially \nthere is a document that could do great harm to our ability to conduct \nmilitary operations during which we obtained detainees.\n  Then there is the following paragraph:\n\n       (3) Information of the detention facilities and practices \n     of the Department for the six-month period ending the date of \n     such report, including for each facility of the Department at \n     which detainees were detained. . . .\n\n  That is fine.\n\n       (A) The name of such facility.\n       (B) The location of such facility.\n\n  We have no objection to that. In fact, the entire next page of the \namendment, we accept. We come to the conclusion of the amendment and no \nfurther objections. It simply is to the creation of a document that \nwould have such detailed information that is not essential to the \nCongress in our oversight of these detention facilities and the \npractice of detention, and if that document would ever get out, it \nwould be a devastating blow to the intelligence system, to giving the \ninformation to the enemy, who we have among their presumably lost and \nmissing persons, and the like.\n  I urge my colleagues, this is something we should scrutinize \ncarefully. I have framed it in such a way that colleagues will have to \ndecide whether it\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\nis a second-degree amendment that prevails or the underlying amendment \nthat prevails.\n  Therein, with the exception of one other mention just this morning, \nthe committee staff, the majority and the minority, were briefed on \nthis document. It roughly looks to be 30 pages of unclassified material \nentitled ``Department of Defense proposed''--just being proposed at the \nmoment--``administrative review of the detention of enemy combatants at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba.''\n  This is one of our facilities. The Secretary of Defense has \nestablished administrative review procedures to determine annually if \nenemy combatants detained by the Department of Defense at the U.S. \nNaval Base at Guantanamo Bay should be released, transferred, or \ncontinue to be detained, and so forth.\n  Much of it parallels what the Senator has in mind. I am confident \nafter this morning's briefing the Congress will make several edits. I \nencourage the distinguished ranking member to engage our colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, a former member of our committee, to look at it also \nand see how we can improve and strengthen this. So this will soon be in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the cooperative approach my colleague has \ntaken. I greatly respect his judgment on many of these matters.\n  First, on the issue of whether revealing the name and identity of \nthese people is a major security threat, we have obligated ourselves \nunder the Geneva Convention to do exactly that with regard to \ninformation we are going to turn over to the Red Cross for every \nprisoner of war we take into custody.\n  The specific language in part V of the Geneva Conventions talks with \nrespect to each prisoner of war:\n\n     . . . the information shall include, in so far as available \n     to the Information Bureau, in respect of each prisoner of \n     war, his surname, first names, rank, army, regimental, \n     personal or serial number, place and full date of birth, \n     indication of the Power on which he depends, first name of \n     the father and maiden name of the mother, name and address of \n     the person to be informed and the address to which \n     correspondence for the prisoner may be sent.\n\n  That is what the Geneva Conventions requires.\n  Could we explore the possibility of just saying that the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress should be entitled to the same information \nthat we have committed ourselves to provide to the Red Cross with \nregard to all detainees?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is a very good question. I will take \na few minutes to answer. It deserves a very considered answer.\n  I have thought this through. It is interesting, coincidentally over \nthe weekend I dealt with the Department of Defense. I did not have a \nchance to brief my distinguished ranking member yet on the question of \nthe Red Cross's participation in our situations, both in the \nAfghanistan detention facilities and the Iraqi detention facilities. I \nam speaking for myself.\n  I am very concerned about those problems over there. Our committee \nhad several hearings on it. The issue comes up, as it should. It came \nup in the Judiciary Committee the other day, about the role of the Red \nCross. I have learned a great deal about that role in a short period of \ntime.\n  I had some familiarity when I was Secretary of the Navy and during \nthe Vietnam conflict. The Secretary of Defense was at that time--I have \nserved under three of them--Secretaries Melvin Laird and Jim \nSchlesinger. They were very conscientious about working with the Red \nCross.\n  The Red Cross has done a remarkable job in this very difficult area, \ngoing into these prisons, monitoring them, and going back to the \ngovernment host of the prisons and making corrections and trying, in \nsome instances, to benefit the incarceration detainees in terms of \ntheir individual personal status.\n  The success of that program has been dependent on the absolute \nsanctity of that material and the fact that the observations of the Red \nCross have not gotten into the public domain. We are working with the \nDepartment of Defense now, such that the Senate can be given the \nbenefit of the Red Cross inspections in our facilities in Afghanistan \nand in Iraq. It will be my recommendation to the committee that we will \nhave it in a classified briefing. But we are not, hopefully, going to \nretain any of those documents in the Senate.\n  Were that material to get out in some manner, we are told by the Red \nCross, it would seriously limit their ability to do this magnificent \nwork they do all over the world. If some nations--and only in a \nclassified forum can I give those names--but some nations that now \nallow the Red Cross in to get information and to hopefully provide \ncorrections to prisoners' treatment, if that had gotten out, that is \nthe last time the Red Cross would get into that country to examine \nthose prisons.\n  So we come down to the very basic fundamental issue about those \ndetainees, whether they are in the United States or wherever they are \nin the world in these prisons, the Red Cross is helping in many \ninstances. But they say if the information they write up and send back \nto the host country of the prisons gets into the public domain, forget \nit; they will be precluded from going on. So we would face a similar \nsituation.\n  It is very difficult for me, one who has been privileged to be in \nthis body now my 26th year, to just say I am concerned that some \nmaterial in classified form in the possession of the Senate could get \nout. But, regrettably, whether it got out from under the Senate or got \nout from another source and that source would then blame the Congress \nfor leaking it--I don't know, we have all been through the leak \nscenario--it leads to a never-never land in this Government of ours.\n\n  But I urge that we consider this very detailed information which our \ncolleague is seeking. The amendment in the second degree, which I am \nperfectly willing to withdraw to the extent we can come to a resolution \nand make it your first-degree amendment and no second--I believe we \nhave to observe the practices with regard to this detailed information \nyou are seeking.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is really a question for the sponsor of the \namendment. I say to the Senator, I understand what you have just \nsuggested is that the information which we provide to the Red Cross be \nshared with Congress, not that the information which the Red Cross \ngives to us be shared with the Congress; is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in answer to the question, that is \nexactly right. It is not my suggestion that the Red Cross reports on \nconditions in prisons or anything else be provided to us. All I am \nsaying is if our Department of Defense turns over information to the \nRed Cross--as it is required to do under the Geneva Conventions--we \nought to have access to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Even in classified form, Congress ought to be able to \nknow as much as the Red Cross knows about who we are detaining in our \nfacilities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not disagree in how you frame the \nissue, but I maintain my stance. Let me parse it very carefully. I say \nto the Senator, you are saying that what we give the Red Cross--not \nwhat the Red Cross comes back and tells us we are doing right or \nwrong--what we give to the Red Cross can be shared with Congress?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the question by the Senator from New Mexico. It \nseems to me that makes good sense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Here is where I respectfully differ. If the information \nwe give to the Red Cross were to leak out, then other nations that are \nsimilarly following that practice will see this is now in the public \ndomain and say: We are stopping, Red Cross, because we see it has \ngotten into the public domain of another country. Therefore, we don't \nwant that to happen.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield--and I guess I have the floor, \nbut, in any event, this information the Senator from New Mexico is \ntalking about is information we have which the executive branch has. \nNow, I believe the fear the Senator from Virginia just expressed is not \nthat the Red Cross would leak it--because they do not----\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. They have proven they do not leak the information. They \nperform--I agree with the good chairman--a very valuable service as to \nwhat they do. But what it seems to me the chairman is saying is there \nis less confidence the legislative branch will protect the \nclassification of this material than the executive branch will protect \nit. I do not think we can accept a premise that we are more likely to \nleak classified information here in the Congress than the executive \nbranch is likely to leak it. As a matter of fact, recent history----\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I concede your \npoint. You need not deliberate further. Fault lies on both sides, both \nbranches of Government. All I am saying is--and I am informed by those \nwho have greater knowledge about the procedures of the Red Cross than \nI; and I don't know whether it comes out of the executive branch or the \nCongress--further distribution of this information beyond one branch of \nGovernment to another branch of Government does increase the likelihood \nthat somehow it gets out. And it will deal the Red Cross a very serious \nblow, I am told.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia would consider this \npossibility as we explore ways of bridging the differences; and I, like \nour good friend, Senator Bingaman, very much appreciate, as always, the \nchairman's willingness to look for common ground. It seems to me the \none sensitive area the executive branch has and that is in this \namendment has to do with the name of the person.\n  For instance, it seems to me, if there is a number which is assigned \nto every prisoner--which I understand is true for every prisoner of \nwar, every enemy combatant, or every civilian, for that matter, who is \nheld in detention--it seems to me, if the number is given rather than \nthe name, the rest of this information is very appropriate and will \nhelp in the oversight process.\n  The failure, it seems to me, to make clear to the world that we are \ngoing to abide by international conventions and that we are going to \nmake sure our people are treated properly by our treating other people \nproperly, that failure has cost us greatly. The purpose of the Bingaman \namendment is clearly to get us back on track in terms of what our \nresponsibilities are by giving Congress the ability to perform our \noversight responsibility.\n  We do not have that ability now. We do not have this information. \nWithout this information, we cannot perform the essential oversight \nwhich has been missing here, and I believe if it had been in place \nearly enough perhaps it would have persuaded the administration to get \nback on course earlier than it has been persuaded.\n  But my specific question to the chairman would be--and I have not \nconsulted with the sponsor of the amendment; I don't know whether he \nwould be in an accepting mood--but if the number of the prisoner or the \ncivilian who is being detained were substituted for the name, would \nthat have the same problem?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in other words, rather than the \nindividual's name, that his number is No. 224--whatever it is? I would \nhave to defer until I go to the heart of the experts. All I know is \nthat the name--if we are detaining certain individuals and the enemy \ndoes not know whom we have captured, and they, therefore, have to \nshelve some of their plans, knowing that the persons who are missing \nfrom their roster, if they were to talk about the plans, they would \nmake the plans less valuable to the enemy--I mean, I am just working \nthrough the obvious scenarios here.\n  Now, whether a number would suffice, I would like to go back to those \nwho are dealing with this on a daily basis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When the chairman does that I would perhaps propose that \none other consideration be looked at, and that is, I understand we are \nobligated to provide the names to the Red Cross now, and those names go \nback to the families in order that the families can find their loved \none, if that loved one is alive, or that brother, or father, or \nwhoever. Now, I may be wrong in that, but it seems to me the purpose of \nthe----\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is interesting, over the weekend I had \nthe opportunity, I say to my distinguished colleague, to visit the \nDepartment of Defense, and I was greatly impressed with an individual, \nwho was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives a decade or so \nago, who is in charge of it. I will seek to have him come over right \naway and provide both sides with the expert to propound these \nquestions. They are good questions. Let's see what we can do to work \nthis thing out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman. I believe we ought to try to work \nthis out. This is really moving in an essential direction for our \nNation and our troops. I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his \nleadership and thank the chairman. I think maybe we ought to lay this \namendment aside temporarily. I do not know if----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the two managers will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dayton is here to offer his \namendment. He is going to take about 20 minutes. It is my understanding \nSenator McCain or someone on his behalf will second degree this \namendment. Following that, Senator Harkin is here ready to offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Durbin amendment. That will be offered \non behalf of Senators Harkin and Hatch, dealing with supplements.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Mr. President, I think all that can be accommodated, \nso I join in the request at this time to lay aside the pending \namendment in the second degree and the underlying amendment by our \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico and to then let the other \nSenators seeking recognition have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3197\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and others for setting aside their amendments, and I call up \namendment No. 3197.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself and \n     Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 3197.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To strike sections 842 and 843)\n\n       Beginning on page 172, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through page 176, line 21.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, my amendment strikes two sections of the \nbill, sections 842 and 843, which relate to ``Buy America'' and the \nBerry amendment, which are features that have been in existing law for \nquite a number of years to strengthen our national defense and our \nnational economy.\n  This bill authorizes $422 billion for national defense programs for \nfiscal year 2005, a sum that doesn't even include the funding for \nongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. If you include those \nadditional amounts, our national defense spending for the next fiscal \nyear will be almost $500 billion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for the purpose of \nallowing me to put a second-degree amendment at the desk so our \ncolleagues can then begin to examine both as this very important debate \nis underway?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield to the chairman.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3461 To Amendment No. 3197\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk, on behalf of Senator \nMcCain, an amendment in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 3461 \n     to amendment No. 3197.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To perfect the matter proposed to be stricken)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\n     SEC. 842.

I thank my colleague for his courtesy. We now undertake a \nvery important debate on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, we are going to spend, in the next fiscal \nyear, some $500 billion. That is a half trillion dollars, a huge amount \nof the taxpayers' money; in fact, about one-fourth of all the money the \nFederal Government will spend for everything next year, including \nSocial Security, Medicare, health care, and education.\n  The purpose of these expenditures is to strengthen our national \nsecurity for now and the future. The six priorities that were approved \nby the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am proudly a member, \nalong with the Presiding Officer and others, reported in the bill \nbefore us unanimously by the committee, include such measures as \ncombating terrorism and winning the global war against terrorism, \nsupporting our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, to \nsustaining the readiness of our Armed Forces to conduct the full range \nof military operations against all current and anticipated threats.\n  It goes on to state: Another object is modernizing and transforming \nour Armed Forces to successfully counter future threats. So we need to \nspend this money on the immediate needs and missions of our military \nand support the phenomenal job they have been doing on our behalf \naround the globe, but we also need to try to anticipate the future. \nThat is difficult, but it is also important. It requires us to look at \nthe big picture, at the global picture, and into the years and even, if \npossible, the decades that lie ahead. It means we don't want to do \nsomething now that is expedient or briefly beneficial that will have \nnegative consequences for us in the future.\n  Ideally, we want policies that strengthen our country now and in the \nfuture. That has been the compelling reason for the so-called ``Buy \nAmerican'' requirements of the Department of Defense, the military \nbranches, and all other Federal agencies for the past 70 years.\n  ``Buy America'' came out of the depths of the Great Depression. Buy \nAmerica to strengthen America is really what it should be called. Buy \nAmerica to strengthen America--that was the reason, the purpose, and it \nhas been the result for seven decades. However, the law has always \nprovided for exceptions, exceptions that essentially give, as they \nshould, the full authority to the Secretary of Defense to waive \ndomestic purchase requirements whenever necessary to provide our Armed \nForces with equipment, weapons, clothing, food, or anything else that \nis not available in the United States, that could not be produced or \nprovided in this country when it is needed, that lacks the quality or \nfeatures or advantages, or that is not priced competitively with non-\nU.S.-made products.\n  So the law has essentially said: Try to buy American, but if you \ncan't or you shouldn't, then don't. It has worked for almost 70 years, \nthrough 11 different administrations--six Democratic, five Republican--\nuntil last year this administration and this Senate shredded that bill. \nThat shredding was reduced to a few slices by the strong opposition of \nthe House conferees, led by the House Armed Services Committee \nchairman.\n  We in this body are exceedingly fortunate to have the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services, who is unparalleled as a leader and public \nservant. Last July, I traveled to Iraq with the distinguished chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nWarner. We went through the country with 115-degree temperatures. \nI struggled to keep\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nup with him as he charged fearlessly into every perilous situation. He \nis in every respect--leading that committee, here on the floor, or out \nin the field around the world--one of the most outstanding leaders and \npubic servants I have ever met anywhere in my walk of life.\n\n  I also greatly admire my colleague and friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, whose military experience and expertise and \nwhose devotion to his country and his service to it are all remarkable.\n  However, on that occasion last year regarding ``Buy America,'' I \nthanked our Founding Fathers for the wisdom of bicameralism. And I must \nrespectfully but strongly again disagree this year with the Senate \nbill's provisions that would effectively destroy ``Buy America'' by its \nexceptions to it.\n  If we pass the legislation that is before us now with the language in \nit, the second degree to my amendment that has been put down today, we \nmight as well eliminate the entire ``Buy America'' statute as it \napplies to the Department of Defense and the armed services and others \nthat are funded by this bill because that will be the result if this \ncurrent Senate language if we pass it.\n  I challenge those in the Bush administration and those in the Senate \nand those lobbying for the big multinational corporations and for the \nforeign governments they represent, who truly believe that we will be \nbetter off without any ``Buy America'' requirements, or certainly, in \nthe case of the paid lobbyists, who know that they and their clients \nwill be better off without them, and those who believe that for \nwhatever reason, they should just say so and put the repeal before us \nin black and white and have us vote on that rather than just creating \nmore exceptions and more loopholes that give more foreign countries and \nthe corporations that operate in them more and more of the money from \nthis bill in the products that they buy and the jobs for which they \npay, because under this language that exists in the bill now, those tax \ndollars, those products, those jobs will go to people in other \ncountries but not to Americans.\n  There will be no more ``Buy America'' to strengthen America. It will \nbe buy abroad, because of what? Because it is cheaper? Because it is \nbetter? Because it doesn't matter?\n  Let's have that debate in the Senate. Is it cheaper to buy overseas? \nAfter counting all the costs of not only the product prices but also \nthe wages that are gained or lost, the taxes paid by those wage earners \nin this country or somewhere else, the unemployment costs in this \ncountry, the welfare cost, the food stamp cost, not to mention the \nhuman cost of people who lose their jobs, is it better to buy these \nproducts overseas? Better for whom? Who gains, who loses, when American \ndollars are spent abroad to buy foreign goods made by foreign workers \ninstead of American goods made by American workers? Does it matter? \nEvidently not to this President or to this Pentagon leadership. But it \nsure matters to the American people, who will lose their jobs or won't \nget new jobs or better jobs. Do they have a say in where their tax \ndollars are spent? Does it matter to this Senate that there are now \n2\\1/2\\ million fewer manufacturing jobs in this country than there were \nwhen President Bush took office? Yes, 2\\1/2\\ million manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost in this country in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, despite the \nso-called recovery and recent job gains in some other sectors of our \neconomy. There are still 2\\1/2\\ million less manufacturing jobs today \nthan there were in January 2001.\n\n  Many of those American jobs have been sent overseas and were replaced \nin other countries by low-wage jobs. Importing all those foreign-\nmanufactured products has now produced a U.S. trade deficit that last \nmonth was $48.2 billion. That is another all-time worst trade deficit--\n$48.2 billion for a single month, and it will probably be broken again \nnext month or soon thereafter. Over the next year, if that continues, \nit will produce an annual trade deficit of $578 billion--almost $100 \nbillion more than last year's record trade deficit.\n  We are told we cannot do anything about this massive bleeding of jobs \nand wages, capital investments, profits, and tax payments out of our \ncountry. We are told we should not even try; it is free trade, \nglobalization, and it is good for America. Is 2.5 million lost \nmanufacturing jobs good for America? Over $100 billion in lost wages \nand benefits every year is good for America? Over $30 billion of lost \ntax revenues each year for Federal, State, local governments, and \nschool districts is good for America? Our Federal budget deficits, our \nState and local government deficits, U.S. trade deficit, national debt \nincreasing, all of which are going higher and higher--is that all good \nfor America? Jobs and wages, production of goods and services, capital \ninvestment by businesses, allowing people--as consumers buy goods and \nservices, producing tax revenues, individual and corporate, they are \nthe lifeblood of any economy. They are its vitality. Corporate profits, \nstock prices, dividends, and capital gains are all vitally important as \nwell, but they are not enough.\n  This country's economic vitality is bleeding away. Our economic \nstrength is weakening. Our economic strength is essential to our \nmilitary strength. Our economic security is essential to our national \nsecurity. This legislation, this authorization to spend $500 billion on \nour national security, had better strengthen, not weaken, our economic \nsecurity as well.\n  I am aware of the letter to the chairman from a group calling itself \nthe National Defense Industrial Association. It claims to represent \nover 1,300 member companies and purports to be the ``voice of the \nindustrial base.'' Who are these companies? Whose industrial base are \nthey speaking for? Many are companies that have moved their production \noverseas, that are making better profits from paying low wages to \nforeigners instead of good wages to Americans. We cannot stop them from \ndoing so. But why should we reward them with American tax dollars going \nto support their foreign production? They can certainly continue that \nforeign production, and they will. But if they want these U.S. military \ncontracts, they should fill them with American workers, not with \nforeigners.\n  They should make those products or provide those services in American \ncommunities, not foreign cities. They should pay taxes from those \nprofits to our school districts and local governments, not someone \nelse's. These are American tax dollars that are paying for our national \ndefense, not from their corporate profits from foreign operations--\nprofits on which they will pay taxes to foreign governments, not our \nown.\n\n  Someone has to look out for the best interests of this country, and \nit sure is not the National Defense Industrial Association. Maybe that \nis not their responsibility. But the best interests of this country are \nour responsibility here in the Senate. So they should not tell us or \ntry to make us or the American people believe their interests are \nAmerica's interests. In their letter, they claim it would negatively \nimpact the ability of the U.S. industrial base to compete in the \ninternational marketplace and would therefore negatively impact the \nWarfighter, and the bill's amendment gutting ``Buy American'' will \nrepresent important steps in the Department of Defense's transformation \nplans and send positive signs to our allies that the United States is \nsupportive of existing trade agreements. I am deeply offended that \nAmerican companies, most of which are headed by American citizens, \nwould try to hide their financial self-interests behind pretenses like \nthese. They want defense contracts they can fulfill with their existing \nforeign operations that provide them with greater profits. They don't \nwant to have to shift that production back to the U.S. and employ \nfellow American citizens. They want only what is good for themselves, \nnot what is best for America's military strength or our Nation's \neconomic vitality.\n  In some cases, as the letter discloses, they coddle foreign \ngovernments that want to buy American military hardware and then want \nus to buy the same amount of their foreign-made military products from \ntheir countries. We signed, evidently--somebody in the Department of \nDefense signed these agreements. There are countries where our trade \ndeficits last year totalled over $120 billion for all goods and \nservices. But in this one sector of military goods and services, where \nwe run a trade surplus, we agree to give up our surplus by buying more \nforeign products, some of which, of course, are made in those countries \nby--surprise--\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\nsome of the companies in the National Defense Industrial Association. \nThose companies win both ways, but the rest of America loses.\n  These memoranda of understanding are not free trade; they are \ncertainly not fair trade. They are dumb trade. It is amazing to me that \nsomebody would sign them. It is like something out of the movie ``Dumb \nand Dumber,'' where I give you $20. You are going to give me $10 back, \nbut you say, wait a minute, I am losing my $10. You have a \nresponsibility to make up for my $10 with your $10. So we do that. We \nagree to that in this memorandum. We are going to match their $10 with \nours and even up that part of the deal and leave the $20 that goes to \nthem--leave it out and let it go. That is dumb trade.\n  We spend more on our defense products, goods, and services than the \nnext 10 countries in the world combined. They need our markets; we \ndon't need theirs. They are cutting back on their military production, \nso they want these agreements to prop up their industries and provide \njobs for their workers at our expense. They are smart enough to look \nfor it, and we are dumb enough to give it to them. It is also dangerous \ntrade. This month's Jane's Intelligence Review, a widely regarded \ninternational publication, reports that ``Europe Considers Ending \nChinese Arms Embargo.'' The Chinese premier was in some European Union \ncountries last month and he concluded, saying, ``I have great \nconfidence that there will be a solution to this problem.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. It reads:\n\n       On the European side, the attractions of tapping China's \n     defense market are significant: China is the world's largest \n     importer of defense equipment ($3.6 billion worth in 2002), \n     and . . . France and Germany in particular are pushing to \n     lift the arms embargo; France because the government is under \n     pressure from its defense industry to resume arms sales; and \n     Germany because it wants to maintain its currently good and \n     close relationship with Beijing.\n       Opponents to lifting the ban include, most vociferously, \n     the USA. . . .\n       Richard Fisher, from the Jamestown Foundation, told [Janes \n     Intelligence Review]: ``The real impact of a deep and wide \n     EU-PLA [People's Liberation Army]--\n\n  The army of China, the People's Republic of China--\n\n     military alliance will fall on the USA, in terms of \n     accelerating a military-technical arms race that will burden \n     U.S. taxpayers and place ever greater pressure on the U.S. \n     political/military alliance system in Asia.''\n\n  Who are these countries protecting or helping in this language I want \nto strike out of this bill that have these offsetting reciprocal \nagreements with the United States? They include Belgium, Denmark, \nGermany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland--all European Union \ncountries. Others that are also exempt by other features include \nFrance, Italy, and Luxembourg--all European Union countries.\n  We are going to contribute to their building up their defense \nindustries, and then they are going to turn around, most likely, soon \nand sell those products, that technology, those military advantages to \na country in opposition to our foreign policy and against our own \nmilitary interests, against our own national security interests.\n  That is just one example of how this kind of expediency and also the \ncorporate pressures that drive some of it are a danger to our national \nsecurity and to our future economic strength.\n  In conclusion, for the last 70 years, ``Buy America'' has worked for \nAmerica, and it has helped Americans work in America to build a strong \nnational defense, to build a strong national economy, and to build a \nstrong American industrial base until this administration arrived. The \nBush administration believes evidently we can have a strong national \ndefense and a strong national economy without a strong American \nindustrial base, without Americans making American products in American \ncommunities. They are so indifferent to that need that at a time when \nthe United States has lost over 2.5 million manufacturing jobs held by \n2.5 million American workers in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, they support \nthis bill and its language to send more American taxpayers' dollars to \npay for foreign products made by foreign workers.\n  Maybe those who do not care about other Americans' jobs should offer \nto give up their own job. Practice what they preach and find out for \nthemselves what unemployment is really like. But it is our \nresponsibility, exercising our collective wisdom, to act in the best \ninterests of the United States of America.\n  I know my colleagues share that desire. We may have our honest \ndifferences and disagreements, but I beseech my colleagues in this \ninstance to review this measure and this language and consider the \nconsequences of it for our military strength, for our economic \nstrength, as well as for the jobs of Americans and the quality of \nproducts and the security of products provided to the men and women \nserving courageously around the globe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From Jane's Intelligence Review, June 1, 2004]\n\n              Europe Considers Ending Chinese Arms Embargo\n\n                             (By John Hill)\n\n       Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began his first official visit \n     to Europe on 5 May with the issue of lifting the European \n     Union's (EU) ban on the sale of weapons systems to China high \n     on his agenda.\n       Beijing had hoped that a decision to end the ban would be \n     made at the meeting of EU foreign ministers on 26 April, but \n     at the annual Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) held in Dublin a \n     week earlier, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Brian Cowen, \n     said that a change in the issue was unlikely during Ireland's \n     EU presidency. Undaunted, in Brussels on 5 May, Wen said: ``I \n     have great confidence that there will be a solution to this \n     problem.''\n       For months now it has appeared that the arms embargo, which \n     was imposed following the Tiananmen Square violence in 1989, \n     would be scrapped, and Beijing certainly has many powerful \n     European friends working on its behalf. Javier Solana, the \n     EU's High Representative for Foreign Policy, as well as \n     representatives from both France and Germany have in recent \n     months assured the Chinese publicly that they think the time \n     has come to resume arms sales.\n       On the European side, the attractions of tapping China's \n     defence market are significant: China is the world's largest \n     importer of defence equipment (US$3.6bn-worth in 2002), and \n     currently Russia is the main beneficiary. According to Jean-\n     Pierre Cabestan of the French National Centre for Scientific \n     Research, France and Germany in particular are pushing to \n     lift the arms embargo: France because the government is under \n     pressure from its defence industry to resume arms sales; and \n     Germany because it wants to maintain its currently good and \n     close relationship with Beijing. Both the European Aeronautic \n     Defence and Space Company (EADS) and the French electronics \n     company Thales told JIR that although they do not currently \n     export military equipment to China, they are monitoring the \n     situation.\n       Opponents to lifting the ban include, most vociferously, \n     the USA. In January, Richard Boucher, spokeswoman for the US \n     Department of State, said: ``Our statutes and regulations \n     prohibit sales of defence items to China. We believe that \n     others should maintain their current arms embargoes as \n     well. We believe that the US and European prohibitions on \n     arms sales are complementary, were imposed for the same \n     reasons, specifically serious human rights abuses, and \n     that those reasons remain valid today.'' The UK is \n     remaining circumspect; although obviously its defence \n     industry would like to sell to the Chinese market, the \n     government is reportedly upholding the US line on the \n     issue.\n       There is debate over the consequences that lifting the ban \n     would have. Professor Shen Dingli, an expert in International \n     Relations at Shanghai's Fudan University, told JIR: ``[Ending \n     the embargo] won't be significant, as China has its own arms \n     research, development and manufacturing capability, and can \n     access Russia's military aircraft and ship technology. \n     Reportedly, soon China will acquire its own manufacturing \n     capability of more modern military aircraft, and by that \n     time, China will export its own technology.''\n       However, the USA remains worried that the end of the \n     embargo could spark an arms race. US China analyst Richard \n     Fisher, from the Jamestown Foundation, told JIR: ``The real \n     impact of a deep and wide EU-PLA [People's Liberation Army] \n     military alliance will fall on the USA, in terms of \n     accelerating a military-technical arms race that will burden \n     US taxpayers and place ever greater pressure on the US \n     political/military alliance system in Asia.'' Fisher argued \n     that if the ban was lifted, the French would be ``first out \n     of the gate'' with submarine and satellite technology. He \n     added that the competition would also spur on the Russians, \n     who ``are now openly talking about selling advanced SSK \n     [submarine] co-production rights to the PLA to trump the \n     EU''.\n\n\n                          sales under the ban\n\n       The EU embargo is somewhat vague on what is covered, and as \n     a result has been interpreted differently by EU member \n     states. The EU declaration on China, the European Council \n     document issued in the wake of the Tiananmen Square violence, \n     called only for\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\n     an `interruption' of military co-operation and an embargo on \n     trade in arms with China. The French and the UK governments \n     have in the interviewing years produced their own \n     interpretations of the extent of the embargo's reach.\n       In 1995, the British government made explicit that its \n     interpretation of what was banned included: lethal weapons \n     such as machine guns, large calibre weapons, bombs, \n     torpedoes, rockets and missiles; specially designed \n     components of the above, and ammunition; military aircraft \n     and helicopters, vessels of war, armoured fighting vehicles \n     and other such weapons platforms; any equipment which is \n     likely to be used for internal repression.\n       Under the ban, the UK has exported significant military \n     components, but not entire systems, to China. Most \n     controversially, a license was granted to Rolls-Royce for the \n     export of between 80 and 90 Spey aero-engines for the JH-7 \n     fighter-bomber in 2001, although a license would not be \n     granted (by the UK government's definition of the ban) for a \n     whole military aircraft incorporating such engines. Other \n     major UK sales have involved Racal (now part of Thales), \n     which in 1996 sold airborne early warning radars; and Surrey \n     Satellite Technology (SSTL).\n       The most recent UK government annual report on strategic \n     export controls, covering 2002, details 177 export licenses \n     for China worth K50m (US$89m), including components for \n     frigates, general military aircraft components, technology \n     for military aero-engines and technology for military \n     aircraft head-up displays. A spokesman for the UK Foreign \n     Office told JIR that there was a very rigorous process for \n     the licensing of the export of weapons components that was \n     equal to that for whole systems.\n       Other European countries have also sold equipment to the \n     PLA. In 1997, the French pronounced that co-operation with \n     the Chinese would be increased to include ``co-operation in \n     the technical, technological and infrastructure fields''. \n     They added: ``This technological and industrial co-operation \n     will be conducted within the framework of our European and \n     international commitments.'' Among the items licensed for \n     export were French diesel engines for Chinese 054-class \n     frigates and German-licensed diesel engines for Song-class \n     submarines.\n       Such `reinterpretations' have led to accusations that the \n     Europeans have been `weaselling' around their embargo. For \n     example, Fisher said London's `reinterpretation' enabled the \n     UK to sell engines, radar, military electronics and small \n     satellite technology to China. ``Now British technology is \n     helping China to shoot at US Navy ships, to find them at sea, \n     and potentially to blind the US Navy's first line of defence \n     in space,'' he wrote in the Washington Times in 2001.\n       However, the USA is not without its own gray areas in \n     controlling arms exports to China. In 2001, Senator Jon Kyl \n     told the Senate that US regulations had allowed the export to \n     China of $15bn of ``strategically sensitive'' materials \n     during the 1990s, including equipment that could be used for \n     manufacturing missile and nuclear weapons components. In \n     1998, Harold Johnson of the General Accounting Office told \n     the US Congress Joint Economic Committee that between 1990 \n     and 1996 US sources provided 6.5 per cent of the $5.3bn-worth \n     of foreign military items delivered to China, compared to the \n     EU's 2.3 per cent.\n       The embargo is unlikely to prevent China from making its \n     own technological advances and there are arguments that \n     engagement rather than isolation can better serve \n     international security. Sir Martin Sweeting, chief executive \n     of Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL), told JIR: ``China [and \n     other countries] will develop their own space capability \n     irrespective of outside assistance. Refusing to work with \n     them will not prevent them--they have access to all the \n     components we use and are capable people. Rather than relying \n     on an isolation policy that creates an illusory impression of \n     maintaining a capability lead, is it not more advantageous to \n     work with China in a carefully controlled manner so that we \n     are aware of their developments and consequential \n     implications for their capability and further development?'' \n     He added: ``[While] virtually all satellites have military \n     `implications' to whatever country, none of the satellites \n     sold by SSTL to China have significant military utility.'' He \n     thought that lifting the ban could speed up the export \n     licensing process, a development that ``would be welcomed by \n     SSTL''.\n\n\n                          lifting the embargo\n\n       The debate on lifting the arms embargo essentially revolves \n     around two issues. The first is that such an embargo is \n     extremely unusual--the only other states subject to such \n     treatment are Sudan, Myanmar and Zimbabwe. In the context of \n     the EU's developing and deepening relationship with Beijing, \n     banning arms sales to China, which is regarded as a \n     responsible and important member of the international \n     community, appears incongruous. The Chinese position is that \n     the ban is an inappropriate holdover from the Cold War.\n       However, another issue involves continuing concerns about \n     China's human rights record. The ban is of course seen as a \n     way of influencing China, but the underlying problem is more \n     likely to be US pressure to maintain the ban, ostensibly on \n     human rights grounds.\n       Nicolas Kerleroux, a spokesman for the European Council, \n     stressed that in the end, the decision to continue the \n     embargo was made by the EU. He added that the process that \n     would have to be gone through to lift the embargo is not \n     entirely clear, and would only become clearer closer to the \n     time of any possible change.\n       Any decision to lift the embargo would need the unanimous \n     agreement of all EU member states. The process itself could \n     take place at the European Council, a meeting of EU heads of \n     state or the monthly meeting of foreign ministers. The \n     statement of the Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs that no \n     change would be made during the Irish presidency of the EU \n     has no official status, but is simply a personal assessment \n     of the situation, according to Kerleroux.\n\n       He added that the question is a complex one and must be \n     addressed in an ``orderly fashion'', which means that it will \n     take time. Asked if any states were particularly against the \n     change, he told JIR: ``No one has said `never'.'' He pointed \n     out that when EU leaders tasked their ministers to re-examine \n     the issues in December 2003, ``no one opposed'' the request.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before I get into the substantive debate \nin rebuttal to my distinguished colleague--and I say distinguished. We \nare very proud of his participation on our committee. Indeed, I \nremember vividly our trip together to Iraq. That was his first trip. It \nwas helpful for all of us. I thank him for his remarks about the old \nSenator from Virginia. It is kind of nice to hear those after being on \nthis bill now our 15th day. But we are making progress.\n  First, I think inadvertently--and I say to my friend inadvertently--\nhe made reference in his opening statement that the language of the \nauthorization bill for this year changes the status of the Barry \namendment. Did the Senator make mention of that?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I meant to say that it changes the overall \nlaw and which the Barry amendment is part of this general reference to \n``Buy America.''\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if I might bring to the Senator's attention--the \nbill is at the desk--if he would look at page 175 of the bill. He will \nsee section (f), ``Laws Not Waivable'':\n\n       The Secretary of Defense may not exercise the authority \n     under subsection (a) to waive any domestic source or content \n     requirement contained in the following laws. . . .\n\n  No. 4 is the Barry amendment. We do not touch it. I assure the \nSenator, section 2533 A(a) of title X is the Barry amendment, and that \nremains untouched.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, the chairman is correct in that regard.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is doing his best, and I have lived with \nthese things for so many years.\n  The other is interesting. No. 1, we do not waive the Small Business \nAct, 15 U.S.C. 631, which sets aside 23 percent of the dollar volume of \nall defense contracts must go to small business.\n  The Javits-Wagner, No. 2, is all products manufactured by the blind \nand the handicapped. We do not touch that.\n  No. 3, section 7309, shipbuilding, we do not touch that.\n  And No. 4 is the Barry amendment, and that covers textile, food, and \nspeciality medicine.\n  I draw my colleague's attention to those points. He might wish to \nreview it himself and make amendments to his opening statement.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague again, it is fascinating in a \nsense. He goes on about what we put into this bill, which I think in a \nvery modest way strengthens America's position, in my judgment. For \nexample, his bill goes after one Department, the Department of Defense; \nam I not correct?\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, the Department of Defense is \namong the few Departments of our Government with contracts generating a \nsurplus. The area in which the Senator from Minnesota wants to go to \npreserve jobs is in other Departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment. Let me point this out.\n  We had $63 billion in defense sales in the last year--$63 billion--to \nnations all over the world. We bought only $5 billion of weapons from \nother nations. Those nations that sell us the $5 billion are basically \nthe ones that are participating largely in the $63 billion. So there is \na mutual trade there. We are selling them, by and large, far more than \nwe are buying from them, and if you were successful, you would begin to \nbring down significantly the $63 billion, and that translates into \nhundreds of thousands of jobs in America would be lost because we are \nsaying to those\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\ncountries: We are not buying anything from you anymore. And they will \nsay: If that is the case, we have had it, we are not going to buy from \nyou, and down goes our $63 billion surplus.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Does the Senator say we should apply that same principle \nto all of our trade agreements and require that the $478 billion we \nspent last year in deficits, we should require those countries buy the \nequivalent in U.S.-made products?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am not going to tread beyond the \nDepartment of Defense. Our bill goes strictly to the Department of \nDefense. If there are other areas in which my distinguished colleague \nand those who are aligned with him want to go, then other Senators who \nhave the oversight responsibilities for their respective departments \nare the ones who will have to respond. So I am going to stick to DOD.\n\n  We have the largest, as far as I know--maybe in agriculture there may \nbe some segments which are somewhat equally or larger in significance.\n  At the end of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the letters that we have received from a number of nations \nrespecting the pending matter that the distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota has put before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I start off with the Ambassador of the Netherlands:\n\n       Dear Senator, Mindful of the long-standing strong \n     relationship between the United States and the Netherlands, I \n     would like to express support for several very important \n     amendments to the Defense Authorization Bill 2005 that were \n     agreed this week . . .\n\n  And he then refers to those sections. Then we have the ambassador \nfrom the Embassy of Sweden:\n\n       As you are aware, Sweden is a significant supplier and \n     partner to the United States in several defense technology \n     areas such as anti-tank weapons systems and naval composite \n     technology. With almost 50 percent U.S. content, the Swedish \n     fighter aircraft Gripen is another example of close Swedish-\n     American cooperation. This extensive cooperation is to the \n     benefit of our respective defence industries.\n\n  I am only reading just a fraction of these letters. Another one from \nMr. David Manning, the Ambassador from the British Embassy in \nWashington:\n\n       I am writing to express the strong support of the United \n     Kingdom for three amendments to the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee mark up of the 2005 Defense Authorization Bill.\n\n  Those are the provisions, Mr. President, that my distinguished \ncolleague seeks to strike. He goes on, ``These amendments are contained \nin section,'' so and so. He then goes on:\n\n       As you know, the UK and US armed services have a \n     relationship of unparalleled closeness, as our forces fight \n     side by side in Iraq and elsewhere. . . . I therefore hope \n     you will be able to support these amendments . . .\n\n  And eventually get them into law.\n  The Canadian Embassy sent a similar letter. We have a similar letter \nfrom the Danish Ambassador. We also have a letter from the Aerospace \nIndustries Association of America. They state:\n\n       The future of U.S. aerospace is in the global marketplace. \n     Our industry exports 40 percent of the products it \n     manufactures in the United States and books the largest \n     export surplus of any sector of our economy.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Minnesota, he is facing a serious issue if \nhe prevails. We have a similar statement from the Government Electronic \nIndustries Alliance. We have the National Defense Industrial \nAssociation, Strength Through Industry & Technology:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       NDIA has had a long and productive association with you and \n     the committee. I look forward to discussing these issues . . \n     .\n\n  They support the bill, and I could go on, but this is a sample.\n  I will say in recognition of the issues that the Senator raises, in \nthe second-degree amendment we pair down the list of 21 nations to the \n7 that we believe absolutely have to be kept intact and not subjected \nto the strike that the Senator has in hand. The obvious ones are the \nUnited States, Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Canada, and \nNorway. So I think some advancement has been made in terms of limiting \nthe number of nations that have to deal with this, but at this point in \ntime I say to my colleagues that I think the second-degree amendment \nfrom the Senator from Virginia embraces the position that is the most \nimportant one that we should take versus the distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I wonder if I might put in a quorum call for a brief few minutes when \nI have to absent myself from the floor. Does the Senator from Iowa wish \nto speak to this issue?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. If the chairman would yield, it is this Senator's \nintention to call for the regular order, which would bring up the \nDurbin amendment, and I have a second degree to the Durbin amendment. \nThen I will speak on that. I assume right after I finish, Senator Hatch \nwill speak on it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, I think we can accommodate him \nbecause this important debate brought by the Senator from Minnesota, to \nwhich I have made a reply, will be laid aside because other Senators, \nhopefully, on both sides of the aisle, will come to support the \namendment in the second degree by the Senator from Virginia.\n  I am anxious to hear from the Senator from Minnesota. Did he want to \nreply to some of my comments?\n  Mr. DAYTON. If the Senator will yield for one last question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Then we can conclude this discussion so the Senator can \nleave the floor. I am glad to see the second degree would reduce the \nnumber of countries exempted to seven. I ask if the Senator and Senator \nMcCain would consider language in the amendment that would prohibit the \nconsequences that I just outlined of the sale of goods and military \nproducts to China, that there be language in this amendment that would \npreclude these countries that are getting these benefits from, then in \nturn providing those gains to countries that are outside of our own \nmilitary and foreign policy.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I would be happy to consider that \nif he wishes to bring that forth to change the documents that are \npresently before the Senate; that is, the underlying and second-degree \namendments. So perhaps at this time we could lay aside this package \nwith the understanding that we will bring it up again today for further \ndebate and in the interim we can consider the measures that the \ndistinguished Senator wishes to address.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I agree with that.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         The Ambassador, Embassy of the Kingdom of the \n           Netherlands,\n                                         Washington, May 17, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: Mindful of the long standing and strong \n     relationship between the United States and the Netherlands I \n     would like to express support for several very important \n     amendments to the Defense Authorization Bill 2005 that were \n     agreed this week in the discussions in the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       I refer specifically to the proposals in Title VIII--\n     Acquisition Policy, Acquisition Management and Related \n     Matters, Subtitle D--Industrial Base Matters (Sections 841, \n     842 and 843).\n       I consider the Section with regard to a ``Commission on the \n     Future of the National Technology and Industrial Base'' as a \n     highly constructive proposal. Specifically the balanced \n     tasking of the Committee seems to inherently guarantee \n     certain success. Taking into account the increasingly \n     important subject of interoperability, specifically relevant \n     in the present day environment, I also value the amendment \n     concerning the ``Conforming standard for waiver of domestic \n     source or content requirements'' as an important building \n     block for a fertile environment for defense trade of which \n     the warfighter of today and of tomorrow will be able to \n     benefit. Also the section that deals with the ``Consistency \n     with United States obligations under trade agreements'' is \n     seen as a positive and relevant assurance for other \n     countries.\n       Although not directly related to the above referenced \n     proposals allow me to share with you the idea that in our \n     perception, part of the discussion which is seen by some as \n     the danger posed by foreign dependency can be satisfied by \n     bilateral Security of Supply agreements which can be \n     negotiated as more detailed arrangements under a Declaration \n     of Principles or a reciprocal defense procurement MOU.\n       In conclusion I would like to assure you of my broad \n     support for the proposals which I mentioned above.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Embassy of Sweden,\n\n                                         Washington, May 27, 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you are well aware, Sweden is a \n     significant supplier and partner\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\n     to the United States in several defense technology areas such \n     as anti-tank weapon systems and naval composite technology. \n     With almost 50 percent U.S. content, the Swedish figher \n     aircraft Gripen is another example of close Swedish-American \n     cooperation. This extensive cooperation is to the benefit of \n     our respective defence industries.\n       Mindful of this long-standing and strong relationship \n     between the United States and Sweden, I would like to express \n     support for several important provisions in the 2004 Defence \n     Authorizations Bill.\n       The provisions contained in Section 841, 842, and 843 of \n     the proposals for title VIII on Acquisition Policy set a \n     common standard of waiver of domestic source and content \n     requirements. They also call for a Commission on the future \n     of the national technology and industrial base.\n       I would like to assure you of my country's strong support \n     for these provisions when they come before the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Jan Eliasson,\n\n                                       Ambassador of Sweden to the\n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              British Embassy,\n\n                                          Washington, 17 May 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to express the strong support of \n     the United Kingdom for three amendments to the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee mark up of the 2005 Defence Authorizations \n     Bill. These amendments are contained in Sections 841, 842, \n     and 843 of the proposals for Title VIII on Acquisition \n     Policy. They set a common standard of waiver of domestic \n     source and content requirements. They also call for a \n     Commission on the future of the national technology and \n     industrial base.\n       As you know, the UK and US armed services have a \n     relationship of unparalleled closeness, as our forces fight \n     side by side in Iraq and elsewhere. If approved, the measures \n     proposed under Title VIII would be an important step forward \n     towards improving interoperability across the full range of \n     our mutual defence cooperation.\n       I therefore hope you will be able to support these \n     amendments when they come before the Senate later this week.\n           Best wishes. Yours sincerely,\n     David Manning.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Canadian Embassy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2004.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Warner: I am writing to convey the views of \n     the Government of Canada with respect to the Ronald W. Reagan \n     National Defense Authorization bill (S. 2400) under \n     consideration by the United States Senate.\n       I want to draw particular attention to Amendment 3311 put \n     forward by Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) that would cause \n     the Secretary of Defense to impose a new scheme of U.S. \n     offsets on foreign suppliers. We strongly believe that \n     Senator Dodd's language would undermine existing trade \n     agreements and defense cooperation relationships, notably \n     with U.S. allies whose defense industries are often closely \n     integrated with American suppliers and partners. Furthermore, \n     such a provision would hurt manufacturers and workers in the \n     United States, since they are the overwhelming beneficiaries \n     of U.S. defense exports. These exports have grown \n     dramatically in recent years, thanks to the willingness of \n     U.S. companies to provide for local economic development \n     through offset agreements. This amendment would have the \n     effect of disrupting this export trade in which the United \n     States has come to assume a dominant place. In terms of \n     employment alone, a Department of Commerce report published \n     in July 2003 illustrates the point that offsets have a net \n     beneficial impact on U.S. jobs. Looking at offsets spanning \n     the years 1993-2000, the Department of Commerce found that \n     offsets maintained an average of 41,666 jobs per year while \n     costing only 9,688 in lower tier supplier bases, leaving a \n     net benefit of 31,978 U.S. jobs.\n       The Governor of Canada supports the Senate bill's original \n     language (sections 841, 842 and 843) with respect to \n     complying with existing trade agreements, protecting the \n     Secretary of Defense's authority to issue waivers for \n     Memorandum of Understanding countries and the proposed \n     establishment of a Commission on the Future of the National \n     Technology and Industrial Base. Regrettably, Amendment 3197 \n     offered by Senator Mark Dayton (D-MN) would, in our view, \n     send the wrong message to U.S. allies by deleting language \n     that would encourage and support international defense trade \n     cooperation that would ultimately benefit U.S. taxpayers and \n     American troops.\n       Under your leadership, the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     has adopted a constructive approach to the defense \n     authorization process characterized by openness to U.S. \n     allies, a commitment to liberalized defense trade and export \n     control reform. We encourage you to stay true to this course \n     which has been so beneficial to cooperative defense and U.S. \n     prosperity.\n       We thank you for taking our concerns into consideration.\n           Your sincerely,\n                                                      Bertin Cote,\n     Charge d' Affaires, a.i.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Danish Embassy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: Let me first express our gratitude for \n     your efforts and leadership last year to limit to a minimum \n     the ``Buy American'' language in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004.\n       I write to you again in the context of the renewed pressure \n     in Congress to restrict cooperation with foreign defense \n     industry companies, including those from countries that have \n     offset policies or related arrangements. As of now, it is \n     difficult to fully assess the scope of the proposals, \n     including if it would affect the U.S.-Danish trade, but this \n     new development is at any rate worrisome.\n       As of the strongest and most ardent allies of the U.S., it \n     would be very difficult to understand and explain if Denmark \n     were to face new restrictions in the industrial cooperation \n     with the U.S. Especially in light of our participation in \n     Iraq since the beginning of the military operations and the \n     continues presence of 500 Danish troops--one of the largest \n     contingents in both absolute numbers and certainly in \n     proportion of population.\n       I therefore strongly hope that the language will not be \n     part of the final act and would like to express my \n     government's strong support for your continued efforts to \n     secure the mutual beneficial international cooperation \n     between the U.S. and its partners in the defense area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ulrik Federspiel,\n                                     Danish ambassador to the U.S.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that this package be laid side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask that so the Senator from Iowa can proceed with the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With respect to which amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. 3225.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3462 To Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment. I send \nit to the desk on behalf of myself and Mr. Hatch. It is a second-degree \namendment to amendment No. 3225.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 3462 to amendment No. \n     3225.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning legislation \n    requiring reports of serious adverse events related to dietary \n                supplements and over-the-counter drugs)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 717. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING SERIOUS ADVERSE \n                   EVENT REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``dietary \n     supplement'' has the same meaning given the term in section \n     201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 321(ff)).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Food and Drug Administration should make it a \n     priority to fully and effectively implement the Dietary \n     Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-\n     417, 21 U.S.C. 321 note), including taking appropriate \n     enforcement action against unsafe dietary supplements;\n       (2) not more than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this section, the Department of Health and Human Services \n     should develop a plan for mandatory reporting of serious \n     adverse events occurring as the result of the ingestion of \n     any dietary supplement or over-the-counter drug and provide \n     that plan for review and consideration by Congress; and\n       (3) adequate resources should be made available for the \n     effective oversight of dietary supplements and for sound \n     scientific research on dietary supplements.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the pending amendment \nby my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and then to outline what \nthis second-degree amendment does.\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\n  I have to say I feel somewhat uneasy about this because I so rarely \nfind myself in disagreement with my friend from Illinois. He and I see \neye to eye on many issues. On this, while I believe we have some of the \nsame objectives, we disagree on the appropriate approach.\n  I wanted to set the context for my remarks in somewhat broader terms. \nFor well over a decade, I have spoken out about the need to \nfundamentally reorient health care in America, reorient it toward \nprevention and wellness and self-care.\n  When it comes to helping people stay healthy in the first place, we \nhave very little in the way of help or incentives or information. In \nfact, I have long said we do not have a health care system here in \nAmerica, we have a sick care system. It is costing us dearly both in \nterms of health care costs and premature deaths.\n  This is not to say we have not made any progress in the recent past. \nIn the last decade, we have taken some steps toward fixing this major \nflaw. We have expanded coverage of cancer screenings, we have increased \nchildhood immunization rates, we have expanded prenatal care, and we \nhave more aggressively gone after the promotion of tobacco to children.\n  Another step we took in the last decade toward keeping people healthy \nin the first place is the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act of 1994, otherwise known by its acronym DSHEA.\n  Over 158 million Americans take dietary supplements to maintain and \nimprove their health, this Senator included, from vitamin C to calcium \nto glucosamine to beta carotene to ginko biloba. There is a full range \nof health supplements that are part of the daily lives of people all \nover this country. Consumer expenditures on these products reached a \nreported $17.1 billion in 2000, double the amount spent just 6 years \nearlier.\n  According to a recent report by the Food and Drug Administration, the \nuse of dietary supplements is likely to grow, due to factors such as \nthe aging of the baby boom generation, increased interest in self-\nsufficiency, and advances in science that are uncovering new \nrelationships between diet and disease.\n  In response to efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to \ninappropriately cut off consumers' access to vitamins, minerals, and \nsupplements, in 1994 the House and Senate unanimously approved the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA. Both Senator Hatch \nand I were pleased to have played a role in crafting this important \nlegislation and getting it through the Congress. This law balanced \ncontinued consumer access to vitamins, minerals, and other dietary \nsupplements. It has also resulted in nearly $100 million in new \nrigorous scientific research on the benefits and risks of supplements.\n  DSHEA provides a number of important consumer protections. First, it \nrequires that claims made on supplement labels, packaging, and \naccompanying material be, and I quote here from the law, ``truthful, \nnonmisleading and substantiated.''\n  Let me repeat that. The law, DSHEA, requires that anything put on \nlabels, packaging, and accompanying material be ``truthful, \nnonmisleading and substantiated.''\n  In addition, the act prohibits manufacturers from making claims that \nproducts are intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.\n  DSHEA also provides for good manufacturing practice standards setting \nrequirements for potency, cleanliness, and the stability of products. \nThat is in the law.\n  The FDA was supposed to publish regulations on these good \nmanufacturing practices after the bill was passed in 1994.\n  Finally, after 10 years of pushing and prodding by Senator Hatch, \nothers, and me, the FDA has finally, this year, proposed good \nmanufacturing practices regulations. They expect to have final \nregulations out by the end of this year. It took them 10 years, but I \npoint out that the law requires it.\n  DSHEA also requires that manufacturers submit adequate information as \nto the safety of any new ingredients contained in dietary supplements \nbefore those products can be sold.\n  Again, I want to repeat that for the Record because when I listened \nto Senator Durbin last week, you would think someone could put a \ndietary supplement out there without ever having anything reviewed or \nlooked at or reported to FDA. The law requires that manufacturers \nsubmit adequate information as to the safety of any new ingredients \ncontained in dietary supplements before they can be sold.\n  I might point out that the FDA has rejected over half of the \nproposals to market new dietary ingredients using existing authority.\n  To listen to my good friend from Illinois, you would think everyone \ncould put anything they want out there. That is absolutely not true.\n  DSHEA also provided the Federal Government a number of avenues for \nthe removal of unsafe dietary supplements from the marketplace. If the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services determines that a product poses \nan unreasonable risk when taken as directed, the product can be removed \nfrom the market. The Secretary utilized this authority earlier in the \nyear to remove products containing ephedra from the market.\n  DSHEA gives the Secretary yet another tool to protect the public from \nunsafe supplements. If the Secretary determines that a product poses an \nimminent hazard to the public health, he can remove the product from \nsale.\n  Finally, in order to promote expanded scientific research on the \nbenefits and health effects of dietary supplements, DSHEA mandated the \nestablishment of the Office of Dietary Supplements within the National \nInstitutes of Health. This has resulted in roughly $100 million in new \nscientific research that is crucial to expanding reliable information \nto the American people.\n  Unfortunately, despite some recent improvements, the history of \nimplementation of DSHEA by FDA has been lax.\n  I want to point out here that I serve on the HELP Committee. That is \nthe committee that gives approval to nominees to be FDA Commissioners. \nSince DSHEA was passed, I have asked every FDA Commissioner for the \nrecord, both under the previous administration and under this \nadministration, whether DSHEA gives the FDA enough authority to remove \nfrom the shelves harmful products for public consumption. Everyone who \nhas come before us has said, yes, that DSHEA gives them all the \nauthority they need to remove harmful products from the shelf.\n\n  The problem is the FDA has failed to use all of the tools we provided \nDSHEA. They have failed to carefully review substantiation of claims. \nFor 10 years they failed to put in place good manufacturing practice \nstandards. It has failed to aggressively remove from the market the \nillegal street drug knockoffs and other products that are in clear \nviolation of DSHEA requirements.\n  I recently met with the FDA Commissioner and told him about some of \nthe things I have seen in some of the gasoline stations that have these \nstores attached to them where they have knockoff items which are \nclearly harmful to people, and yet the FDA is not removing them.\n  Part of the problem has been resources. The FDA needs adequate \nresources to implement and enforce DSHEA. Congress last responded by \nregularly providing funds over the last several years beyond those \nrequested in the Presidents' budgets--both the previous President and \nthis President--reaching $9.7 million in fiscal year 2003. This is to \nprovide oversight of dietary supplements.\n  Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment that Senator Hatch, \nSenator Durbin, and I proposed to increase funding for implementation \nand enforcement of DSHEA--to increase it by 17.5 percent. It required \nFDA to spend no less than $11.4 million for this purpose, $1 million \nmore than requested by the administration. This was a substantial and \nnecessary increase. In fact, I would like to see even more devoted to \nthis purpose.\n  In fact, S. 1538, legislation Senator Hatch and I introduced earlier \nthis session would increase FDA funding to $20 million next year, \nrising to $65 million per year within 5 years. We will continue to work \nto gain adoption of this more aggressive approach.\n  That is sort of the background. What I wanted to point out in my \nremarks is that we passed DSHEA to give people\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\naccess to vitamins, minerals, and supplements to keep them healthy in \nthe first place.\n  We provided in the law all that was necessary for the FDA to take \nharmful products off the shelf. We provided in the law that any claims \nhave to be truthful, not misleading, and substance indicated. We \nprovided that any new ingredients put into these dietary supplements \nmust be approved by FDA.\n  I did not hear Mr. Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, mention any of \nthat in his comments last week.\n  I want to point out that there are more than adequate safeguards in \nDSHEA to keep the public safe and informed about dietary supplements, \nminerals, and vitamins.\n  Turning to the direct subject of the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois, I support what I think is the basic essence of the Senator's \namendment--getting good and timely information about safety concerns \nwith anything that Americans consume or use--whether that be drugs over \nthe counter, medical devices, foods, or dietary supplements.\n  In any of that area, if there are safety concerns, yes, we need good \nand timely information.\n  In fact, as I said, Senator Hatch and I have fought to increase the \nresources that FDA dedicate to implementing an effective adverse events \nreporting system. Today, we spend about $1.5 million a year for the \nmonitoring of serious adverse events associated with ingesting dietary \nsupplements.\n  Again, I agree with the Senator from Illinois that a mandatory \nadverse events reporting system for dietary supplements and over-the-\ncounter drugs is something we should consider. However, the issue has \nto be dealt with in a more comprehensive fashion to be effective and \nefficient. We need to make sure we have a reporting system that will \nprovide timely, accurate, and useful information. Senator Durbin's \namendment in its current form is too limited and does not ensure that \nwe will have a workable system. Therefore, while I support the creation \nof a mandatory national adverse events reporting system that is broader \nin scope to protect the American people, I cannot support Senator \nDurbin's amendment.\n  First, serious adverse health events resulting from consumption of a \ndietary supplement is a national issue. Any reporting system for such \nevents needs to be national, not just pertaining to Army bases. And it \nshould apply to all supplements, not just those containing caffeine.\n  As a matter of fairness and protection of the public health, it \nshould apply to over-the-counter drugs as well.\n  My colleague from Illinois said on Friday in describing his amendment \nthat over-the-counter drugmakers are required to report serious adverse \nevents associated with their products. I am sorry, that is simply not \nthe case for the vast majority of these over-the-counter drugs. This \nleads to a number of inconsistencies. I will point out one example that \nwill result from this omission in Senator Durbin's amendment.\n\n  Under his proposed amendment, one could buy a product whose brand \nname is No-Doz or similar over-the-counter products with a substantial \namount of caffeine, yet be blocked from buying a dietary supplement \nthat contained just a fraction of that stimulant. That simply does not \nmake sense. If we are going to require reporting for dietary \nsupplements, the same should be required of over-the-counter \nmedication.\n  Under Senator Durbin's amendment, on an Army base you could buy No-\nDoz, which is packed with caffeine, but could not buy a dietary \nsupplement that might have a third, a half or a tenth as much caffeine \nin it. It makes no sense.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment also excludes drinks that contain \nstimulants. Again, you could buy Red Bull--this is another brand name \nproduct, Red Bull--chock full of caffeine. There is no reporting \nrequirement. But one could not purchase a supplement which had much \nless caffeine in it. This does not make sense.\n  Second, while I support a broader system, as I have said, the Defense \nauthorization bill is not the place to work out the details of such an \nimportant public health matter. As our experience with mandatory \nadverse events reporting for drugs and medical devices has shown, \nimplementing a mandatory system involves significant practical, \ntechnical, and legal issues that must be carefully worked out.\n  Third, there are serious shortcomings in the existing adverse event \nreporting system that need to be reformed before, or at least in tandem \nwith, a mandatory reporting scheme. One need look no further than a \nrecent report by the GAO.\n  Before we have a mandatory reporting scheme, let's look at the \nadverse event reporting system. Let's fix it. It is broken. Let's fix \nthat before we have a mandatory scheme that relies upon an adverse \nreporting system that is totally inadequate. I may have more to say \nlater regarding the GAO study.\n  These are serious shortcomings that clearly need to be addressed \nregarding a dietary supplement adverse event reporting system to \neffectively protect public health.\n  While I agree with much of what the Senator from Illinois is aiming \nto do, his approach is not something we should be approving. Therefore, \nSenator Hatch and I are offering a more comprehensive approach to Mr. \nDurbin's amendment.\n  Our amendment says three things. First, the FDA should make it a \npriority to fully and effectively implement the Dietary Supplement \nHealth and Education Act of 1994, including taking appropriate \nenforcement action against unsafe dietary supplements. They have the \nauthority to do that. It is in the law. Every FDA Commissioner has said \nthey have that authority.\n  Secondly, our amendment says within 180 days of enactment of this \nprovision, the Department of Health and Human Services should develop a \nplan for mandatory reporting of serious adverse events occurring as a \nresult of the ingestion of any dietary supplement or over-the-counter \ndrug and provide that plan for review and consideration by Congress. \nThat is the logical way to proceed.\n\n  Third, our amendment says adequate resources should be made available \nfor the effective oversight of dietary supplements and for sound \nscientific research on dietary supplements. This is a more important \nresponse. It deals with the real and broader issues at hand.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, including the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to assure that consumers continue to benefit \nfrom healthful dietary supplements and we have a strong quality \nassurance system that includes good manufacturing practice standards \nand an improved serious adverse event reporting system.\n  I hope our colleagues will join in supporting our amendment which \nwill permit people to have access to vitamins, minerals, and \nsupplements which will tighten up the adverse event reporting system \nand which will also get adequate resources to the FDA to provide the \nadequate oversight of dietary supplements.\n  I see my good friend from Utah, one of the great leaders on this \nissue. Regarding enactment of DSHEA, I am proud to be a cosponsor with \nhim, working to make sure all of our people get vitamins, minerals, and \nsupplements to keep them healthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his statement about this matter. \nWe worked very hard on the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act \nback in 1994. It has served this country very well. There are now \nalmost 150 million Americans who, daily, take dietary supplements much \nto the betterment of their health.\n  Amendment No. 3225 offered by our colleague from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, is a solution in search of a problem. It is neither wise nor \nnecessary. The Harkin-Hatch substitute should be approved in the \nalternative.\n  The Durbin amendment is yet again another attack on dietary \nsupplements and it should be rejected.\n  Instead, I ask colleagues to vote in favor of the second-degree \namendment Senator Harkin and I have drafted, an amendment which will \nput us firmly on record in favor of enforcing the law we passed--not \nonce but twice--by unanimous consent.\n  This law gives FDA all the enforcement tools it needs to act against \nproblem supplements, a fact that has been confirmed by the FDA \nCommissioner in\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\nthe Clinton administration, Dr. Jane Henney, by the first FDA \nCommissioner in the Bush administration, Dr. Mark McClellan, and by \ntoday's head of the FDA, Dr. Lester Crawford.\n  The law I reference, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, \nprovides all the tools we need to ensure consumer access to safe \ndietary supplements and information about their benefits and potential \nproblems.\n  But for that consumer protection to be a reality, the law must be \nimplemented through regulation and enforced in the courts, and Congress \nmust provide the resources for the agency to do its job.\n  There is no question that FDA has been slow to act on problem \nsupplements. But it is coming around and is doing a much more vigorous \njob, taking many more enforcement actions against illegally marketed \nproducts in recent months. By the way, they did not have this power \nbefore the DSHEA.\n  I believe this new emphasis on enforcement, albeit under our \nprodding, is due to both the leadership of Dr. McClellan, who has \ncommitted to me and Senator Harkin that he would compel the agency to \nimplement DSHEA more vigorously, and to our colleagues, Chairman Bob \nBennett, before him Chairman Cochran, and Ranking Minority Member Herb \nKohl, who have acted to put more funding in the hands of the FDA to \nenforce the dietary supplement law.\n  By and large, dietary supplements--vitamins, minerals, herbs and \namino acids--are used safely by hundreds of millions of Americans each \nyear in order to help them lead healthy lifestyles. Critics of the \nindustry point to the very few supplements that raise safety or \nlabeling concerns, concerns that I firmly believe the law is adequate \nto address.\n  I hope it comes as no surprise to Senators that Senator Harkin and I \nhave been as critical as Senator Durbin about the agency's lack of \naction in enforcing against problem supplements.\n  We have pressed FDA to remove from the market products which are \nharming young athletes, products such as androstenedione or ``andro.'' \nEarlier this year, under the leadership of Dr. McClellan and HHS \nSecretary Tommy Thompson, andro was removed from the market. I was \nthere. I was there at the announcement. I was one who backed that. It \ncan no longer masquerade as a dietary supplement.\n\n  We have also been concerned about ephedra. I have said for a number \nof years that if the agency believes this product is unsafe, it should \nremove it from the market under the abundant authority we provided in \nDSHEA, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. This includes \nseizure, fines, and injunctive relief against misbranded or adulterated \ndietary supplements. Again, although belatedly, the agency has acted \nagainst ephedra products, although there is litigation over this \nbecause there is some body of evidence that indicates properly used \nephedra can be beneficial in weight reduction and perhaps in other \nareas as well. But we backed whatever the FDA did, we, the authors of \nthe dietary supplement act.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I am one of the original authors of the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to talk about the history of DSHEA, which will shed \nsome light on why the Harkin-Hatch language is preferable to the Durbin \namendment. This may be helpful for some of our colleagues who were not \nhere when President Clinton signed DSHEA into law. It may also help \nreassure those who voted for the measure that it is working.\n  At the outset, it is important for Senators to realize the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act established a rational, regulatory \nframework that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the tools \nit needs to assure the safety of products consumed by the American \npublic, and to provide consumers with access to safe products and \ninformation about those products.\n  Indeed, the DSHEA law allows the more than 150 million Americans who \nregularly consume dietary supplements to have access to products in \norder to achieve the health benefits they desire. DSHEA enables \nAmericans to buy relatively inexpensive dietary supplements, including \nvitamins and minerals, which may achieve a wide array of health \nimprovements.\n  The passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act \nfollowed decades of Food and Drug Administration antipathy toward \ndietary supplement products. This animosity, well documented by \nhearings in the Labor and Human Resources Committee and by the \ncommittee's 1993 report, and the lack of clear regulatory structure for \nsupplements, was the basis for our Senate votes.\n  That is also why a majority of the Senate--two-thirds of our \nmembership--cosponsored the bill. That also helps explain why the bill \npassed without one dissenting vote in the Senate.\n  As I believe Senator Harkin has noted, there is a great need to set \nthe record straight. Dietary supplements are regulated by the Food and \nDrug Administration. In fact, the FDA has had this authority for a \ncentury. What we did in 1994 was to clarify and strengthen FDA's \nauthority. Thus, media reports that supplements are ``unregulated'' are \npatently false.\n  The basic structure of DSHEA allows all products marketed as dietary \nsupplements at the time the bill was enacted to continue to be marketed \nas dietary supplements unless they are determined to be unsafe or \notherwise violate prohibitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct with respect to labeling, purity, and manufacturing.\n\n  This so-called grandfather provision was enacted into law. In \naddition, for new dietary ingredients, those not marketed in the United \nStates before the law was enacted, manufacturers must provide evidence \nof safety to the FDA 75 days in advance of marketing. Again, new \ndietary ingredients must also comply with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct requirements for safety, purity, and labeling.\n  Responsible companies have followed the rules. Over 150 times they \nhave notified the FDA, as the law requires. About half of those were \nrejected because there were safety concerns or because the products \nwere not appropriately marketed as dietary supplements.\n  The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act works. The law \nspecifically prohibits supplements that present ``significant or \nunreasonable risk of illness or injury under . . . conditions of use \nrecommended or suggested in labeling.'' A supplement not meeting that \nrequirement is deemed adulterated, and, thus, illegal. This requirement \ndoes not require the agency to prove harm to anyone, rather, to make a \ndetermination that a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or \ninjury is present.\n  In addition, the law prohibits any poisonous or deleterious \nsubstances in dietary supplements. A supplement is illegal if it is \n``unfit for food,'' a very broad authority which allows the agency to \nact against a product that is not fit for human consumption, and an \nauthority that was not there before DSHEA.\n  Under DSHEA, a dietary supplement cannot claim that it will diagnose, \ncure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. Any labeling to that \neffect immediately makes the product subject to regulation as a drug \nand, thus, illegally marketed as a supplement.\n  Under DSHEA, the labeling for a product must be truthful and \ninformative. If the labeling is ``false or misleading'' in any way, the \nproduct is misbranded, and, thus, illegal.\n  Senators should be aware there are substantial sanctions for \nviolations of these requirements, sanctions that did not exist before. \nViolations subject the product to recall, seizure, condemnation, and \ndestruction. Persons committing the violations could be subject to both \ninjunction and criminal prosecution. So the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act has teeth, teeth that were not there before.\n  The hallmark of DSHEA is the balance between allowing for beneficial \ndietary supplements while at the same time maintaining regulatory \nauthority for FDA to remove any supplements that are detrimental to \nhealth. Any objective analysis of the law must conclude that it has \nproduced public health benefits of enormous dimensions.\n  The growth in the dietary supplement market since enactment of DSHEA \nis astounding. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of safe, well-\nlabeled products on the market offering consumers who want to maintain \nor\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\nimprove their health a panoply of options. Many of these products are \nmanufactured in my own home State of Utah.\n  There also is much greater information available to consumers about \nthese products as a result of DSHEA. Indeed, the provisions of the law \nclarifying what information could be provided with a supplement are \nnothing but consumer friendly. Before the law, it was FDA's official \nposition that it was illegal for a store owner to distribute a Centers \nfor Disease Control, or CDC, publication touting the benefits of folic \nacid use for pregnant mothers.\n\n  That is interesting because CDC knew that if mothers would take 400 \nmicrograms of folic acid--I think it is micrograms or milligrams of \nfolic acid--that would help to prevent neurotube defects. Even though \nthey knew that, FDA would not allow that claim to be made, and about \n1,250 children a year were born with spina bifida as a result that \ncould have been avoided. We have come a long way since then.\n  Congress wisely recognized that had to change, and public health \nauthorities believe hundreds of babies have been born without spina \nbifida because of the now wide use of folic acid--something we knew 11 \nyears before DSHEA of which the FDA was aware but would not allow \npregnant women to understand.\n  Now, are there problems with DSHEA? If there are problems, I believe \nthey lie largely in the fact it has not been enforced vigorously. We \ncertainly have given FDA the power to enforce the law. Both Senator \nHarkin and I have complained that up until recently they had not been \nenforcing the law, almost sitting aside waiting for something to occur \nthat was out of the ordinary. I have to say, since Dr. McClellan took \nover, and now Dr. Crawford, I believe the law is being enforced, and we \nhave seen some very strong evidence of that.\n  As many of our colleagues, I have been frustrated with the agency's \nslowness in implementing certain provisions. For example, the law \nauthorized FDA to develop good manufacturing practice guidelines, or \nGMPs, specific to supplements. The agency failed to act on this \nprovision until 1999--5 years later--only submitting a proposal to the \nOffice of Management and Budget in the last month of the Clinton \nadministration. Delays and rewrites occurred for 2 years. Finally, the \nproposal was published earlier this year--almost 10 years after we gave \nthem the power to do this.\n  Why are GMPs, good manufacturing practices, so important? They are \nthe standards FDA inspects against to make sure the products are \nmanufactured with purity and sanitation, to make sure they are properly \nlabeled. So these are very important rules to have on the books, and \nthis delay has been very troubling, especially to us as authors of the \nbill giving them the authority to do this.\n\n  But that has changed, as I cited earlier, noting the FDA's actions \nagainst androstenedione and ephedra, among other products. We have a \ncarefully crafted safety standard in the law, a standard that was \nagreed to by then-Chairmen Kennedy, Dingell, and Waxman. When the FDA \ntook action against ephedra-containing products earlier this year, it \nwas the first time in the 10-year history of the law that the safety \nstandard was invoked, even though we have been pushing to have it \ninvoked. It is hard to maintain a law is not working if its powers are \nnot used. I am heartened that the FDA acted to remove andro from the \nmarket earlier this year, thus helping to protect young athletes from \nits numerous adverse health effects, but it should not have taken that \nlong for the agency to act.\n  We do have tools within the law that give the FDA the authority to \nact against problem supplements, as I have outlined.\n  I might add that to assure Chairman Dingell, we also gave the FDA a \nvery broad safety authority, a tool so broad that I was reluctant to \nprovide it to the FDA given the agency's animosity against supplements. \nThat authority, the ability of the Department of Health and Human \nServices to declare a product an ``imminent hazard'' and remove it from \nthe market, no questions asked, has never been invoked either. Some \nhave alleged it has not been invoked because it is ill-defined. On the \ncontrary, it was deliberately crafted to be defined by HHS to meet any \nsafety concerns the agency may raise. So here is another powerful tool \nthe agency can use against a product if it has safety concerns.\n  Finally, with regard to the safety profile of so-called stimulants, I \nam aware this is a special concern of Senator Durbin and Senator \nKennedy. Under the law, as it currently exists, as we enacted it, a \ndietary supplement--be it what Senator Durbin considers to be a \nstimulant or any other product--must be safe. If it is not, the FDA can \nimmediately act against it under the law. It is hard to segregate one \ntype of product or define it, an inherent problem in trying to tailor \nthe law to address stimulants only. Should we include caffeine? \nEverybody knows that is a stimulant. What about colas? What about \nchocolate? Why shouldn't they be included? What about over-the-counter \nstimulant products? Generally, there are no requirements for adverse \nevents reporting for them either. Why the differentiation?\n  In 2002, estimates are that 182 persons died from taking \nacetaminophen as directed. Yet this is a broadly sold drug, over-the-\ncounter drug. Why should there not be AER requirements for such over-\nthe-counter products as well, or maybe that is where we are headed with \nthis type of an amendment.\n  Perhaps we should look at the very notion that an AER system would \nprevent death or injury. AERs tell us that 55 men died in the first few \nmonths Viagra was marketed. What was the response? The FDA did not move \nto pull the product from the market. Instead it moved to include \nwarnings for those men who may have been at risk due to cardiac \ndisease, which is what you would expect. Believe it or not, Congress \ndidn't have to take any action. It is the same situation here.\n  It is important for our colleagues to understand this background \nabout the law as it is useful for evaluating the Durbin amendment, \nwhich I hope our colleagues on the Senate floor will vote down. I hope \nit will help my colleagues understand why voting in favor of the Durbin \namendment at this time is very premature.\n  This amendment would amend the DOD reauthorization bill to prohibit \nmilitary installations from selling stimulant-containing dietary \nsupplements unless the manufacturer agrees to mandatory reporting of \nany serious adverse events to the FDA related to the use of the \nproduct. It may surprise some to know that I am not opposed to better \nreporting of adverse events connected with supplements; nor, for that \nmatter, am I opposed to better reporting of adverse events for over-\nthe-counter drugs which many erroneously believe are generally subject \nto adverse event reporting or AERs, as this debate calls them. Indeed, \nSenator Harkin and I have been working to improve adverse event \nreporting for dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Funding \nhas been included in a number of appropriations laws to give FDA \nresources for adverse event reporting for supplements. If there is a \nserious problem with an aspirin, a vitamin, an herb, or a cold remedy, \nshould not our policy be the same, that authorities are alerted to that \nserious problem?\n  But the Durbin amendment is not the way to go about this. First, it \nis an extraneous amendment to the Department of Defense bill, \nespecially at a time when our Nation is at war. This is the wrong time \nand the wrong place for this discussion. I wonder if the families of \nour service members are bewildered watching us spend so much time \ntalking about what products they can buy at the commissary, especially \nwhen the DOD already has the authority to limit any sales. If there is \nan issue with a dietary supplement or supplements--and in this case, I \ndo not believe there is--it should not be considered only in the \ncontext of military installations but, rather, as a matter of overall \nfood and drug policy. Indeed, it is inconsistent with standing food and \ndrug law to establish a policy governing a regulated product sold \nthroughout the Nation and apply that policy only to certain facilities \nsuch as military installations.\n  Surveys have shown that 70 to 90 percent of soldiers are users of \ndietary supplements. Military personnel and their families, as all \nother Americans, benefit from the protective effects of\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\nsupplements and from their positive health benefits. What is the \nrationale for singling them out for different treatment? I find this \nparticularly peculiar given that the Department of Defense has the \nability to decide what is marketed on military bases. In fact, DOD \nremoved ephedra from commissaries long before the FDA banned the \nproduct for general use.\n  If the Department of Defense perceives a problem with these \nsupplements, it can preclude their sale to the military, as the DOD has \nalready done with regard to ephedra. But beyond that, I am not aware of \nany reported problem relating to the sale of ``stimulant'' dietary \nsupplements on military bases and, thus, see no reason to place the \nrestrictions contained in the Durbin amendment.\n  Second, in a similar vein, in view of the FDA's too-long, \nridiculously long lag time in coming to grips with the regulation of \nephedra, which I can only assume gave rise to this amendment, I \nrecognize that the Durbin amendment has a certain curbside appeal. I \nurge my colleagues to look beyond that. As a matter of food and drug \nlaw, there is no basis for separating one type of dietary supplement \nfrom another. I maintain that if there are serious adverse events \nassociated with any legally sold dietary supplement, then there should \nbe a better reporting system so FDA can take appropriate action. I \nremain ready and willing to work with any or all of my colleagues to \ncreate such an adverse event reporting system.\n\n  Third, as a matter of food and drug law, it does not make sense to \nhave what amount to interparty agreements between a manufacturer and a \ndefense installation for an FDA-regulated product to be marketed. We \nhave a long history of tradition in this country, grounded in the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that policies governing FDA-\nregulated products are national in nature, applying across points of \nsale, across manufacturers, and across the various States.\n  Let us say for the sake of argument that a certain dietary supplement \nis found to cause respiratory problems. Should the FDA only become \naware of the problems when the product has been sold in a commissary? \nAs a matter of public health, wouldn't we want to know if that is the \ncase wherever the product is sold and in whatever store and in whatever \nState so appropriate public health safety measures can be considered?\n  Fourth, the timing of this amendment is premature. It has not been \nstudied by the committee of jurisdiction, nor has the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the administering agency, taken a position. Surely they \nshould have a hand in the development of any such policy, as I believe \nshould Senator Harkin and I as the prime Senate authors of the 1994 law \ngoverning regulation of supplements.\n  I am deeply troubled that the Senate HELP Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, has not \neven been able to consider this proposal. Since this is such an \nimportant matter, I believe it must be considered by the committee of \njurisdiction before it is considered by the full Senate. That is the \nway we usually operate in these very serious Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct and food supplement areas.\n  I have learned after many years in the Senate that the most \nsuccessful legislative proposals are those that are properly considered \nand debated by and within the committees of jurisdiction. I would like \nto see consultation with the HELP Committee, with the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and other scientific organizations, with appropriate \ninput from the dietary supplement industry before any proposal is voted \nupon by the full Senate. That would be the fair and reasonable way to \ngo about this, not just some off-the-cuff amendment that specializes in \na particular area--in this case the military commissaries--that has no \nreal backing to it other than that some people think it might be \nhelpful.\n  The final reason this amendment is unnecessary is the FDA is already \ninvestigating products the Senator from Illinois terms ``stimulants.'' \nThe FDA is well aware of issues associated with products Senator Durbin \nrefers to as stimulants, although there is no such category in food and \ndrug law. FDA is looking closely at products such as ephedra, which it \nrecently banned, and ephedra substitutes such as citrus aurantium or \nbitter orange. FDA and the National Institutes of Health are studying \nthe safety of citrus aurantium. The proposed amendment singles out \nsupplements that contain stimulants, including those that contain \ncaffeine.\n\n  As a point of fact, some military personnel are encouraged to use \nstimulants. Pilots use them on long flights. I submit that many service \nmembers use more caffeine through coffee, tea, and soft drinks such as \nCoca-Cola, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Dr. Pepper than they do in dietary \nsupplements. For all of the concerns of the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, I am not aware of many adverse reports that would come from \ntheir use, nor am I aware of real serious adverse reports that would \ncome through the use of basic dietary supplements. But if they do, then \nthe FDA should consider those. And they would be important. At least we \nwould have a system that works. I could see groups in this society \nginning up adverse event reports for no other reason than to damage \nsome manufacturer. We want to prevent that. That is another reason why \nwe want to look this over.\n  I got an e-mail from a service member's father this morning about his \nson who is currently serving in Baghdad. His division commanders have \nnow banned the consumption of Red Bull, the highly-caffeinated energy \ndrink, after reports of several soldiers collapsing and perhaps dying \nwhile patrolling in 120-degree heat after consuming this drink.\n  This shows the defects in the Durbin amendment--since it would not \neven address high levels of caffeine use--and the fact the system \nworks, since military leaders are taking action to preclude unwise use \nof this product or any other product, for that matter.\n  As many in this body are aware, Senator Durbin has a companion bill, \nS. 722, which proposes one way to set up an AER system for supplements. \nThe Durbin bill, as with the present Durbin amendment, is very \ntroubling.\n  One huge concern I have with this bill is it could lead to premarket \napproval of so-called ``stimulants.'' For this body to impose a \npremarket approval system on dietary supplements would be a blunder of \nvast proportions.\n  If my colleagues contemplate the matter, they will quickly realize it \nwould not be practical for manufacturers to seek marketing approval of \ndietary supplements, most of which cannot be patented. How would a \ncompany underwrite the high costs of FDA approval, costs which can run \ninto hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of pharmaceutical \nproducts?\n  The answer is simple: Companies cannot sustain this cost and \nconsumers will lose their ability to choose the dietary supplement \nproducts they will purchase. If the Members of the Senate and Congress \nwant hundreds of thousands of letters and phone calls to come from the \nusers of dietary supplements, if that is what it takes, we will \naccommodate them because the people out there know these products are \nhelpful to them. They know they are more healthy because of them. They \ndo not want the Senate telling them what to do. They would, I think, \nprefer the FDA to determine what is and what is not efficacious, only \nafter there has been serious compliance with the Dietary Supplement \nHealth and Education Act which gives FDA the authority to do some of \nthe things that can be done to protect the public.\n  A premarket approval requirement would be the death knell for the \ndietary supplement industry. That is one reason why we fought through \nthe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We fought it through \nbecause we knew it would kill this very important industry that 150 \nmillion people benefit from every day. Beyond that, there is no need \nfor preapproval of dietary supplement products.\n  Indeed, the grandfather provision in the law was suggested by House \nDemocrats, who no doubt recognized the majority of supplement products \non the market pose no safety concerns. That, coupled with strong \nenforcement authority for the FDA, gives consumers assurance that they \nare taking safe products.\n  Back to the amendment at hand.\n  It is obvious to me the target of this amendment is FDA regulation of \ncertain stimulant-containing dietary supplements, not the health and \nreadiness\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nof our Armed Forces. Let me emphasize that the DOD reauthorization bill \nis the wrong vehicle to amend the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act. This amendment will not--I repeat, will not--ensure the \nhealth and readiness of the members of the Armed Forces.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Durbin \namendment. The Hatch-Harkin amendment is a much better alternative. It \nstates the sense of the Congress that the FDA should make it a top \npriority to fully and effectively implement the Dietary Supplement \nHealth and Education Act, including taking appropriate enforcement \naction against unsafe supplements.\n  Our amendment urges the Department of Health and Human Services to \nwork with outside scientific organizations and the industry, as \nappropriate, to develop a proposal for better adverse event reporting \nboth for dietary supplements and for OTC products for the Congress to \nconsider.\n  Finally, our amendment restates the obvious: that adequate resources \nmust be made available for the effective oversight of dietary \nsupplements and sound, scientific research about their benefits and/or \nproblems.\n  On April 19, just 2 short months ago, Dr. Crawford, currently running \nFDA, outlined a science-based plan for dietary supplement enforcement. \nHe said:\n\n       FDA is absolutely committed to protecting consumers from \n     misleading claims and unsafe products.\n\n  He noted that in the past 6 months, the agency had inspected 180 \ndomestic supplement manufacturers, sent 119 warning letters to \ndistributors, refused entry to 1,171 foreign shipments of supplements, \nand seized or supervised voluntary destruction of almost $18 million \nworth of mislabeled or adulterated products.\n  ``We will continue to aggressively enforce the DSHEA against unsafe \nand mislabeled products,'' the Acting FDA Commissioner said. Congress \nshould support him in that effort, and this amendment does not \nconstitute that type of support. That is the aim of the Hatch-Harkin \namendment, and I ask our colleagues to join with us in supporting this \nmeasure.\n  Millions of Americans enjoy the daily benefits of dietary \nsupplements. Among them are military families. Let's not act \nprecipitously. Let's not upset an agency that is finally starting to do \nits job and enforce the law we gave them 8 years ago giving them the \npowers to do the job. Let us adopt the Hatch-Harkin amendment and \nguarantee American consumers have continued access to the safe, \nbeneficial products they want.\n  I am proud of DSHEA. DSHEA has given FDA the authority it never had \nbefore. There is no excuse for FDA not to do the job. Since Dr. \nMcClellan took over at FDA and now Dr. Crawford, they are doing the \njob. It took us almost 10 years to push them to do that, and now all of \na sudden, they are doing a great job in this regard, and I do not want \nto undermine what they are doing. There is plenty of authority within \nthe DSHEA law for them to do the job and do it right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3463 To Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3463 to amendment No. 3225.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require certain dietary supplement manufacturers to report \n                    certain serious adverse events)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n       (d) This section becomes effective upon enactment.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the edification of my colleagues, we \nare working on a procedural agreement on how to address these \namendments in a timely fashion. I hope we can reach that agreement, and \nI think we will soon. In the meantime, I will speak to the merits of \nthe issue. Senators Harkin and Hatch have offered an amendment relative \nto dietary supplements to the bill before us, the DOD authorization \nbill.\n  People are asking, Why would you have a debate over dietary \nsupplements on this bill? Sadly, the fact is dietary supplements have \nbeen such a danger to our Armed Forces that between 1997 and 2001, 30 \nActive-Duty personnel in the U.S. military have died after taking \nephedra, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and energy and \nwas eventually banned by all branches of the armed services, and \nultimately by the FDA.\n  In fact, the danger of ephedra-containing dietary supplements was \nfirst noted by our Armed Forces when they looked at the prevalence of \ntheir usage and the dangerous outcomes from these supplements. Before \nthe FDA took this product off the market in America, the U.S. military \ntook it off the market on all of our military bases and warned our \nsoldiers. U.S. Armed Forces Commander, COL Jerald Cross said:\n\n       The bottom line is that dietary supplements are not a safe \n     choice for soldiers or their families.\n\n  To argue that the issue of dietary supplements has no place in the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill ignores the obvious. Soldiers \nserving America have died taking dietary supplements that were sold on \nmilitary bases. As a result of those deaths and serious outcomes of \nmore than 30 soldiers, the military banned dietary supplements, and \nparticularly those containing ephedra. Now they are watchful of many \nothers.\n  Recently published in one of the military publications was an article \non performance-related supplements, it detailed the product, claim, and \nfact, so that members of the Armed Forces know the danger of dietary \nsupplements. To suggest that this issue doesn't belong on this DOD bill \nis wrong. It is an issue which may not rise to the moment of fighting a \nwar in Iraq or a war on terrorism, but it is a life-and-death issue \nwhich has claimed the lives of 30 unsuspecting, innocent, patriotic \nAmericans serving in our Armed Forces.\n  Before us today is an alternative being offered by Senators Harkin \nand Hatch. Both of them were involved in the early days in the creation \nof the bill that regulates dietary supplements in America. It is worth \na minute or 2 to describe to those following the debate what this is \nabout. The decision was made in 1994 to create a category of compounds \nbeing sold and call them dietary supplements. We originally had, of \ncourse, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and foods; and in \n1994 the decision was made to create this new category of dietary \nsupplements. Within that category falls a lot of benign and safe \nproducts that many of us take every day. I took my vitamin this \nmorning. I asked Senator Harkin, and he took his, too. That is good. \nMaybe it is good for me, maybe it is not. I think it might be good for \nme to take it and so do millions of other Americans.\n  The obvious question is, when you go beyond the multivitamins, the \nvitamin C, fish oil, flax oil--when you go beyond these into new \ncompounds called dietary supplements that are sold with the stated \npurpose of helping you to have more energy, to lose weight, then you \nhave moved beyond the simple compounds in vitamins and minerals and \ninto new combinations which, frankly, fall into the category of dietary \nsupplements.\n\n  So how are these supplements tested? There is one thing Senators \nHatch and Harkin have not mentioned, which should be on the record. \nDietary supplements, before they are sold to Americans, are not tested. \nThere is no requirement in the law for dietary supplements to be \ntested. So when these products come to the shelves of our local vitamin \nand mineral nutrition store, or the local drugstore, and you walk in \nand read the label and think you would like to have more energy, so\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\nyou will take this dietary supplement, understand this: You are a test \ncase. You are testing this product. You are going to decide from your \nphysical reaction whether this product is safe, whether, in fact, it \nshould be sold in America.\n  Secondly, what if it is not? What if the dietary supplement, created \nby some company here or overseas, is not safe? What if you take an \nephedra product, as a 16-year-old high school student did a few miles \nfrom my home--he bought it at a gas station over the counter and washed \nit down with Mountain Dew because he wanted more energy for his high \nschool football game. He took the product and started feeling poorly \nand died the next day of a heart attack--a healthy 16-year-old boy--\nfrom an ephedra product.\n  Ask yourself, if his family contacted the company that sold the \nproduct and said, what--he bought Yellow Jackets, which is the name of \nthe ephedra product. If they notify the company, what does Senator \nHatch's law require the company to do with that information? A 16-year-\nold boy died from that Yellow Jacket. The answer is, there is nothing, \nno requirement--none whatsoever--to report a death or heart attack or \nstroke from a dietary supplement. That is what DSHEA--the Dietary \nSupplement Health Education Act--is all about. There is no testing in \nadvance to make sure the supplement is safe, no testing to make sure it \nactually gives you more energy, even if it claims it does on the label, \nand no requirement of the company making the supplement to notify the \nGovernment that people are getting sick and dying from taking the \nproduct.\n  How many Americans know that? How many Americans know that when you \nwalk into that drugstore and grab that bottle of Metabolife, one of the \nbiggest sellers of dietary supplements, that this product, a stimulant \nthat could be dangerous for some people, has never ever been tested? No \nclinical testing whatsoever. How many people know that the claims that \nthis product, Metabolife, gives you more energy have never been \nverified? They just state that on the label.\n  Consumer beware. How many people knew that Metabolife, which sold \nmillions of dollars' worth to consumers all across America, caused \nsignificant adverse events when it was combined with ephedra? About 4 \nyears ago, they went to Metabolife and asked: How many people have \nreported having taken your product and had bad results?\n  Metabolife said: None, zero.\n  Then do you know what happened? Lawsuits and investigations showed \nthey lied, they deceived the Government. They had over 16,500 adverse \nevents of Metabolife with ephedra reported. They never told the \nGovernment, but because of lawsuits, they were forced to disclose them. \nSome of them were extremely serious. More than 100 people had died from \nthese ephedra-related products, and there was no requirement under \nDSHEA whatsoever for that company to report to the Government that, in \nfact, people had died as a result of taking it.\n  My amendment says, if you want to sell a dietary supplement \ncontaining a stimulant on a military base, you have to report to the \nFood and Drug Administration if there is a serious adverse health event \nfrom the product you are selling. If someone has a stroke, is \nhospitalized, faces some serious injury, or dies, you have to report \nit.\n  Now, is that too much to ask? Is that so radical that this industry \nis now flooding e-mails across America about this terrible Durbin \namendment?\n  This is what they say about it: The Durbin amendment holds dietary \nsupplements to a higher level of scrutiny than prescription drugs, \nover-the-counter drugs, and food additives. Partially true. Certainly a \nhigher level than food additives. I do not think people who sell \ncinnamon, vanilla extract, or salt and pepper should be required to \nsend in adverse event reports to the Food and Drug Administration, but \nI do believe if someone is selling Metabolife with ephedra or its \nlatest replacement drug, this citrus aurantium, bitter orange, and \npeople die as a result of it, yes, I think it ought to be reported. I \nwould think if someone is buying dietary supplements, at the very \nminimum they would want that company to report to the Government that \nsomeone is dying from their products.\n  Now we have my colleagues from Iowa and Utah tell us this is an \noutrageous request, that it goes too far, that what we are asking for \nin this amendment is entirely unnecessary. At one point, they have \ncalled for a study that the Food and Drug Administration would engage \nin to determine whether these so-called adverse event reports should \ntake place, not just for dietary supplements but for over-the-counter \ndrugs.\n  There is nothing wrong with a study. In fact, a study is such a good \nidea that it has already been done, and it was released this year. Who \nasked for this study on dietary supplements? The Food and Drug \nAdministration. Whom did they turn to ask for it? The Institute of \nMedicine.\n  I do not think this Institute has any ax to grind. These are \nprofessionals and they were asked to take a look at the dietary \nsupplement regulatory structure.\n  Do my colleagues know what they found on page 13.5? Here is the \nrecommendation from the Institute of Medicine: Congress should amend \nDSHEA to require that a manufacturer and distributor report to the FDA \nin a timely manner any serious adverse event associated with use of its \nmarketed product of which the manufacturer or distributor is aware.\n  That is exactly what my amendment calls for when it comes to sales on \nmilitary bases.\n  The Senator from Utah has said, Why are we not taking this up in a \nlarger context? Why are we not discussing this for all dietary \nsupplements for all Americans? I am for it. Let us hold the hearings.\n  I have already held three hearings in the Government Affairs \nCommittee on dietary supplements. As a result of the first hearing, we \nstarted sending letters to Secretary Tommy Thompson of Health and Human \nServices, and after over a year of deliberation the Food and Drug \nAdministration joined my State of Illinois and others, the nation of \nCanada, military bases, as well as major sports organizations, and \ncalled for the banning of ephedra. They said that dietary supplement \nwas too dangerous.\n  Well, we held our hearings. I am certainly open to holding more, but \nwe have a good starting point. It appears everybody agrees and \nunderstands the premise that if one is going to sell a product in \nAmerica, that is supposedly designed to make people healthier, then, at \nthe very minimum, when that product causes a bad health result, a \nserious adverse health result, it should be required to be reported so \nwe can gather that information. If we find that 5, 10, 15, 20, 100, or \n1,000 people are getting sick from this dietary supplement, for \ngoodness' sake, would we not want to take it off the shelf? Do we not \nowe that to the American consumers?\n  Some argue, like the industry: Leave us alone. Let us sell whatever \nwe want. Let us make whatever health claims we want. We should not have \nto test our products. We should not have to even have standards when it \ncomes to what is included in those products.\n  I say to Senator Hatch, it has been 10 years since he enacted DSHEA \nand he knows, as I do, that the Food and Drug Administration has yet to \npromulgate good manufacturing practices for that industry. Do my \ncolleagues know what that means? Ten years after Senator Hatch and \nSenator Harkin worked on this law, it means that even the things that \nare represented on the labels of these dietary supplements are not \nnecessarily true. There is no requirement to list the purity of the \ningredients. There is no requirement in terms of standards and contents \nof these ingredients. Here we are 10 years after this law was enacted \nand it is the Wild West. It is a product and an industry with, frankly, \nlittle or no regulation.\n  They put one provision in there which is supposed to give us some \ncomfort, and cold comfort it is. The Food and Drug Administration, \nwhich, in the opinion of some has lots of resources and lots of time to \nspend on this thing, can decide that a product for sale in America is \ndangerous, investigate it, and remove it. The burden is not on the \nproducer, the manufacturer; the burden is on the Government to prove it \nis dangerous.\n  So how often do my colleagues think the Food and Drug Administration \ncan comb through the shelves of these nutrition and drug stores and \ncome up\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nwith the new combinations and test them to find out that they are safe? \nThat is an impossible responsibility to shift to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. As a result of that----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been enjoying listening to the distinguished \nSenator. Let me ask this: Would the Senator be willing to resolve this \nproblem by working with Senator Harkin and me to come up with a broad-\nbased law that handles the adverse events reporting matter? Because my \nobjection is that this is a helter-skelter approach to doing it, that \nwill not solve the problems that the distinguished Senator thinks \nexist. I would be willing to work with the Senator rather than do this \nin this fashion on this particular bill, because I am not against \nadverse event reporting.\n  I am against premarket approval, which is what the Senator seems to \nbe arguing for, which would price vitamins, minerals, and other \nproducts off the charts so that the average person, the 150 million \npeople who use them for their health benefit, including, I am sure, the \ndistinguished Senator and myself, would not be able to afford them.\n  I think it is going to take some very careful workmanship, working \nwith the HELP Committee and with other Senators and Members of the \nHouse, to do an appropriate adverse events reporting enactment or \nstatute that makes sense rather than do this on an ad hoc basis without \ndefining how it is done, defining what adverse event reporting is, how \nthey report, what they report on, and what is meaningful. I would be \nmore than happy to work with my friend. I am sure I can speak for \nSenator Harkin as well. Our goal is not to allow companies that are not \ndoing appropriate dietary supplements to be in business. If the Senator \nwould withdraw his amendment, I am willing to work very carefully with \nhim in good faith and work hard to try to resolve this problem, because \nI think the Senator also would--and I would ask him if he would know \nthis as well--know that there are people in this world who do not like \nanybody and there could be a lot of phony adverse event reporting.\n  The Senator uses the term ``serious.'' I am not against having \nserious adverse event reporting but what the Senator is asking for here \nis not definitive. It would not be accurate. It could be interpreted to \nplace severe burdens on the whole dietary supplement industry, which \nhas been a very health-promoting industry over the years and which is \none of the great industries of our country.\n  Those who are the top people in the industry want the industry to be \ntotally honest in its approach toward everything that is manufactured \nas a dietary supplement. Certainly I do and certainly Senator Harkin \ndoes, and I acknowledge that the distinguished Senator from Illinois \ndoes.\n  I would be happy to work with the Senator. I do not think this is the \nway to do it. In fact, I know it is not the way to do it. All we are \ngoing to do is get in big arguments without getting anything done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. In response to his \ninquiry, the answer is a very strong affirmative. The answer is, yes, I \nwould like to work with the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then why do you not withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me make a suggestion to the Senator from Utah, if I \nmay. First, a serious adverse health event is specifically defined in \nmy amendment to include death, life-threatening conditions, inpatient \nhospitalizations, disability, and incapacity. So it is very serious.\n  Mr. HATCH. Those are broad categories.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think death is a very narrow category. You stop \nbreathing. If that occurs, I think perhaps your dietary supplement \nneeds to be looked at.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware the pharmaceutical industry is \nwilling to keep going because of the hoped-for benefits in the dietary \nsupplement industry? There are 100,000 people a year who die from \ntoxicity. Even in the cases the distinguished Senator has quoted, there \nis a real question whether the deaths occurred from dietary supplements \nor from other factors. I think it is very difficult. Naturally people \nwant to blame it on dietary supplements, but we have had 100 years or \nmore--actually centuries of dietary supplements without deaths. All of \na sudden, every time somebody dies they blame it on a dietary \nsupplement.\n  We are a far cry from defining what it means to report adverse \nevents. I would be willing to work with the Senator. I believe we could \ncome up with something that really would work, that would be accepted \nby the industry and accepted by the FDA, and would give the FDA even \nmore teeth than it has perhaps now, although we gave them plenty in \nDSHEA. I went over that in my remarks on the Senate floor, but I would \nbe happy to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Utah, let me make a \nsuggestion if I might. My bill to amend DSHEA has three component parts \nto it. One of them was to ban steroids sold as dietary supplements. I \nknow the Senator agrees with that position.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Because he and Senator Biden have introduced a bill to \naccomplish the same goal. I would like to suggest to the Senator from \nUtah that we work together to add the adverse reporting requirement \ninto that bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will withdraw his amendment, I will commit \nto do exactly that. What I do not want is a Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act adulterated with helter-skelter amendments that do \nnot apply across the board. Frankly, I think the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator is in that nature, even though I know it is well \nmeaning and sincere. But I am saying if you work together, we will do \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My good friend and colleague from Utah is an \nextraordinarily busy man with responsibility on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and responsibility of chairing that important committee. It \nwas important for me to get his attention and the attention of all \nthose in this industry, and now we are in dialog and I would like to \nsuggest to the Senator from Utah the following: If he will agree to \nwork with me and others to amend the bill he has introduced with \nSenator Biden on the steroids used as a dietary supplement to include \nadverse event reporting, which at least meets the goals we have talked \nabout here, I would be more than happy to work with him, and I will be \nprepared to withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. You will withdraw the amendment if I am willing to do \nthat?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I have your assurance that we can work on this.\n  Mr. HATCH. As long as the industry is being consulted and is not just \nbeing pushed around. If the industry is consulted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Oh, absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe responsible people in the industry--and most all \nof them are--if they are consulted, I believe they can help us in this \narea. I believe we can do the consuming public a great service in \ncoming up with an efficient, workable, well-thought-out adverse event \nreporting system that FDA would appreciate as well. Yes, I am willing \nto work with the distinguished Senator, and I am willing to work--I \ncan't speak for Senator Biden, but I believe he would be willing to \nwork to add that to the ban on steroid use.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, if I might through the Chair, I \nwould like to set as a goal doing it this year.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we could get our leadership to do that on both sides, I \nwould like nothing better than to pass that Hatch-Biden bill. I would \nlike nothing better than for us to come up with an appropriate way of \nhandling adverse event reporting that really makes sense, that helps \nthe industry and yet makes sense for the consuming public as well, and \nto FDA. But it would have to have consultation with the industry as \nwell.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator. I would tell you endorsers of \nmy amendment, the American Medical Association, American Dietetic \nAssociation, the American Osteopathic Association, the Center for \nScience and the Public Interest, the American Society for Clinical \nPharmacology--I want them to be in on this conversation, too.\n  Mr. HATCH. No problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let's bring them all together. With that understanding, I \nam\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\nprepared to withdraw our amendments which we have pending.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will withdraw ours if the Senator withdraws his.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 3463, 3462, and 3225 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my perfecting \namendment and, after the substitute is withdrawn, to withdraw my \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Under these circumstances I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my substitute amendment as part of that unanimous consent \nagreement, and you will withdraw the underlying amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the underlying amendment \nand the two amendments thereto are withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. All three amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, people wonder if debate helps. It does. This \nis a perfect example of how. This debate has helped resolve a very \ncontentious issue. I congratulate Senators Hatch and Durbin for their \nwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote with respect to the Warner amendment this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask also there be 2 minutes prior to the Lautenberg vote \nwe are going to have this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at this time the Senator from Wisconsin----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for just a minute?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to thank my colleague from Illinois for his \nwillingness to withdraw his amendments. I want to work very closely \nwith him in resolving these problems we have been discussing on the \nSenate floor. I am grateful to do that, and I think it is important.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Wisconsin has been waiting very patiently \nall afternoon. He has an important amendment. He can finish the debate \nprior to 5:30 today when our vote starts. The majority will have to \nmake a decision on what they want to do with his amendment.\n  I ask the pending amendment be set aside and the Senator from \nWisconsin be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3288, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his help making it \npossible to bring up this amendment.\n  I call up amendment No. 3288 and ask for unanimous consent to modify \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I send those modifications to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Wyden, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3288, as modified.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To rename and modify the authorities relating to the \n       Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1055.

I ask unanimous consent Senators Byrd, Leahy, Dodd, and \nWyden be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last year I offered an amendment to the \nsupplemental bill for Iraq and Afghanistan that established an \ninspector general for the Coalition Provisional Authority so that there \nwould be one auditing body completely focused on ensuring taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely and efficiently, and that this effort is free \nof waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Today the CPA, as we all know, is phasing out, but the reconstruction \neffort has only just begun. According to the Congressional Research \nService, as of May 18, only $4.2 billion of the $18.4 billion Congress \nappropriated for reconstruction in November had even been obligated. \nThis amendment would ensure that the inspector general's office can \ncontinue its important work even after June 30 rather than being \ncompelled to start wrapping up and shutting down while so much \nimportant work remains to be done.\n  It renames the Office of the CPA IG, changing it to Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction. The amendment establishes that this \ninspector general shall continue operating until the lion's share of \nthe money Congress has appropriated to date for the Iraq relief and \nreconstruction fund has been obligated.\n  American taxpayers have been asked to shoulder a tremendous burden \nwhen it comes to the reconstruction of Iraq. Over 20 billion taxpayer \ndollars have been appropriated for the Iraq relief and reconstruction \nfund. That is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations \nannual appropriation. It is more than the entire fiscal year 2004 \nForeign Operations annual appropriation. This is a tremendous sum to \ndevote to one country.\n  We all agreed last year that it required an entity on the ground, \nexclusively focused on this effort, to ensure adequate funding and \noversight. We agreed that we need a qualified, independent watchdog \nwith all the powers and the authorities that accrue to inspectors \ngeneral under the Inspector General Act of 1978. We agreed that \nbusiness as usual whereby individual agency IGs attempt to oversee this \nmammoth effort in addition to everything else the agency does is simply \nnot appropriate in this case. There is nothing ordinary about the \nnature of the U.S. taxpayer investment in Iraq. Ordinary measures will \nnot suffice.\n\n  This amendment modifies the legislation creating this IG to ensure \nthat it does not disappear along with the CPA, but instead continues to \noperate until the amount of reconstruction spending in Iraq more \nclosely resembles other large bilateral foreign assistance programs, \nwhich are overseen by existing agency inspectors general. Specifically, \nit phases out the special IG after 80 percent of the Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund appropriated to date is obligated. If that fund \ngrows substantially in the next calendar, then Congress can consider \nthe wisdom of adjusting this mandate accordingly.\n  Let there be no confusion--this inspector general is only tasked with \noverseeing how U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent. It does not have a \nmandate to oversee Iraqi resources. That is not what this is about. So \nthere is nothing at all in continuing this operation that is \ninconsistent with the transfer of sovereignty on June 30.\n  Because the Department of Defense has responsibility for what is \nhappening to some reconstruction dollars and the Department of State \nwill have responsibility going forward, it makes good sense to have a \nfocused IG on the ground who is able to see the entire picture at \nonce--not being completely required to just focus on the State \nDepartment position or just focus on the Department of Defense portion. \nThis amendment is in no way hostile to the reconstruction effort. This \namendment is about trying to get it right.\n\n  Suggesting that a special inspector general's office continues to be \nin order in Iraq is hardly revolutionary. As I have mentioned, the \nreconstruction budget for Iraq is bigger than the entire FY04 Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill. Yet five different inspectors general--\nat USAID, at the State Department, at the Defense Department, at the \nTreasury, and at the Export-Import Bank--are charged with overseeing \nportions of that account. in fact, currently some 41 Federal \nestablishments and designated Federal entities with annual budgets less \nthan $21 billion have their own, independent, statutorily mandated \ninspector general, from the Railroad Retirement Board to the \nSmithsonian Institution. We ask for focused accountability when \ntaxpayer dollars are a stake in these situations. We must demand the \nsame in Iraq.\n  Obviously, when you are talking about $20 billion just for this Iraq \nsituation, we have to do the same thing. We must demand the same in \nIraq.\n  To date, the inspector general for the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority has made important progress, and has a some 30 active \ninvestigations and 19 audits underway. A whistleblower hotline \nestablished by the inspector general has received hundreds of calls. \nThis is clearly not the time to pull the plug on his important effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This is the critical \npoint: to oppose this amendment is to vote for less oversight of the \nreconstruction effort in Iraq than we have today. It is a step backward \nif we don't. We cannot abdicate our oversight responsibility. The \nstakes are far too high for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is a Senator who has concerns about \nthe amendment now pending offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Frankly, I find a lot of appeal in this amendment. I am not able to \nindicate to the Senator how we will deal with this on this side until I \nhave had an opportunity to consult with that particular Senator.\n  I suggest this be laid aside with the full understanding that it can \nbe brought up again--maybe this evening or possibly tomorrow morning \nfor such further comments as our side may have.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's remarks and \nopenness on the amendment. I certainly understand that he needs to \nconsult with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I am eager \nto hear what possible concerns there may be.\n  I ask, once we come back to this, that the yeas and nays be ordered \nfor purposes of a vote at some point.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the Senator's prerogative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from \nWisconsin a question before the amendment is laid aside.\n  As I understand it, under the Senator's amendment, the CPA's \ninspector general which now exists will go out of existence on June 30 \nwithout the kind of careful oversight which the inspector general \nprovides unless language is provided which continues that kind of \ncareful oversight, which is the purpose of the Senator's amendment. Is \nthat my understanding?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is correct. It \nwould be very unfortunate given the important auditing work that is \nalready underway. It is essential that we act and act quickly to allow \nthose entities to continue in a renamed form.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think this is a very vital amendment.\n  As I understand it, what the Senator from Virginia is saying is there \nis opposition that he knows of, or there is not.\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I will not characterize it as opposition, but a Senator \non this side has indicated to me that he wishes to address this \namendment before I as manager can speak for the committee. Actually, \nthis is a matter now before our committee. Out of respect for him, I \njust ask it be laid aside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no problem with laying that aside.\n  I have one other additional question so that our record can be clear. \nPerhaps this has already been stated. As I understand it, under the \ncurrent state of the law, the situation that the State Department has \ndetermined is that when the CPA goes out of existence on the 30th, the \ninspector general goes out of existence with them. As I understand it, \nthe State Department would like to take the $65 million in appropriated \nfunds remaining in the CPA inspector general's account and apply it to \nsome other purpose in that kind of oversight.\n  Is that the understanding of the Senator?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am concerned. What the State Department proposes to \ndo here is, instead of continuing the independent inspector general who \nwould have the ability to report both to the Defense Department and the \nState Department--what the State Department partly wants to do is \nsimply subsume this function within its normal inspector general and \nreinventing the wheel, which is not what we should be doing at this \npoint. But I do believe the Senator has characterized correctly what we \nhave been told the State Department would prefer to do here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is also my understanding that the CPA inspector general \nhas about 40 auditors and investigators in Iraq--that the State \nDepartment apparently does not have plans to establish an inspector \ngeneral's office of any size in Iraq. Is that understanding correct as \nfar as the Senator knows?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do know that the State Department certainly doesn't \nhave people on the ground. It is definitely the case that the inspector \ngeneral for the CPA has people on the ground--substantial staff \nworking--I believe 80 people.\n  Let me check that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have provided in the supplemental bill \nwhich was enacted last year $18 billion in a special fund for the \nreconstruction of Iraq, and created an inspector general, giving that \ninspector general responsibility for auditing the expenditure of these \nfunds. We appropriated money for that inspector general's \nactivities. It seems to me the Senator from Wisconsin, as he so \nfrequently does, put his finger on a very important accountability \nissue to make sure the taxpayers' funds are properly spent.\n\n  This is a huge expenditure of American taxpayers' funds. We have to \nfind a way--and I think the Senator from Wisconsin has identified the \npath--that we can continue this function in a way to protect the \ntaxpayers' funds.\n  I congratulate the Senator for this amendment, and I ask to be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  I misspoke when I said 80 staff members. There are 60 staff members \nat this point, including 20 auditors and investigators in Iraq.\n  The point the Senator from Michigan has already made is that the \nState Department itself indicates they would have to start from ground \nzero and staff up for this. We have excellent people already conducting \na number of audits, and they are on the ground. It would not make sense \nto do it.\n  I am delighted the distinguished Senator from Michigan is a \ncosponsor. I look forward to further debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection to the amendment being laid aside for \nthe purpose the chairman has indicated. That is perfectly fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Now, after the votes now scheduled to start momentarily, it would be \nour hope--I hope we share this--that you could bring up this very \nimportant amendment you have on missile defense and that it could be \ndebated immediately following this vote. Debate might not be concluded \ntonight, but at least we can cover a significant portion of it. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment does relate to homeland security needs to \nfissile material security and to missile defense all in one amendment. \nI am happy to begin the debate tonight, but I do not want to complete \nthe debate tonight given the fact the vote is tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator made that clear. So we begin debate right \nafter that for such period of time as the Members involved debate--of \ncourse you, the presenter, I would be in opposition, and I am planning \nto have one or two others from my side in opposition--and that could \nconsume, would the Senator estimate, maybe an hour, an hour and 20 \nminutes?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Depending on how many people are on the other side of the \nissue, it could be that long.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  I am wondering, I will inquire whether or not we could go ahead and \nstart the votes and use that time productively.\n  Mr. President, I now understand that is not feasible because Members \nare travelling to the Senate from considerable distances.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition, I believe one of the sponsors of the \namendment may be on his way here and perhaps could use the few minutes \nthat have been allocated.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are now 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to have a couple of \namendments voted on very shortly. Our good friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I have had a private \ncolloquy. He has been very fair in his review of the amendment I \noriginally proposed. He has a different amendment, and he will speak to \nhis amendment.\n  I would like to amend my amendment. I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent if it is possible to make a modest amendment to the amendment I \nalready have at the desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, it is exactly 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nbefore the votes are scheduled. I have to object at this time. This \nwould be an amendment in the first degree. Under the rules, it is not \npermissible without unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I hear my colleague and respect his ability to make a \ndecision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3458\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will divide such time as I have. I \nbelieve it is 2 minutes. I will take 1 minute and give the Senator a \nminute.\n  We had a very good debate. It involves an extremely sensitive \nsubject, the handling of the remains of those who die or perish one way \nor another in these theaters of conflict as they are brought to the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment in the second degree is drawn to preserve the most \nimportant priority, and that is the privacy of the families. It is, \ntherefore, my position that the better course of action for the Senate \nis to go with the amendment in the second degree which is before all \nparties tonight and not open this matter to great scrutiny by the \npress, as does the underlying amendment in the first degree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I cannot support \neither the Warner or the Lautenberg amendment regarding the return of \nthe remains of military personnel to Dover Air Force Base.\n  The Warner amendment was an endorsement of the current policy, which \nprohibits any news coverage. The Lautenberg amendment would allow for \nnews coverage in all cases. I do not believe either approach is \ncorrect.\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\n  In terms of the Warner amendment, I do not agree with the current \npolicy. It denies the sacrifice made by the brave men and women of our \nmilitary. Anonymous photographs of flag draped coffins tell a real \nstory about honor, courage, and sacrifice. The current Defense \nDepartment policy suppresses that story.\n  However, when those coffins are individually and respectfully taken \nfrom the transport plane to the mortuary, then the families should \ndecide. At the point that caskets are being transported to the mortuary \nor when they are beginning their journey to their final resting place, \neach fallen hero is honored individually. In some cases, family members \nmay be present. In most cases, they are not. Either way, the honor \nbeing paid to their loved one is for them to share or not. Some \nfamilies may wish to honor their loved one by having the press present \nand others may find that same press coverage intrusive. It should be \ntheir decision. The families should have a clear veto authority and a \nclear ability to agree to press coverage of their loved one's transport \nat and within Dover Air Force Base. Unfortunately, the Lautenberg \namendment does not clearly provide that authority.\n  For me, it is simple. We must not turn away from honoring our war \nheroes, but we must also recognize that each sailor, soldier, airmen, \nand marine is somebody's son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, or \nsister. When they die in the service of this Nation, they have made the \nultimate sacrifice and it is the family that must bear the ultimate \nloss. The least we can do is let the family decide how much of that \nexperience they wish to share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, to inform our \ncolleagues of the need for a record vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, that is on the second-\ndegree as well as the first-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is on the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia only.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a question, Mr. President, for my colleague. \nThe question is, Was it going to be a second-degree amendment or were \nthese going to be independent, first-degree amendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's go to the unanimous consent agreement. The Chair \nadvised the Senate with regard to the unanimous consent agreement that \nwas put in early this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, am I not correct that the vote is now scheduled for \n5:30 on the second-degree amendment, and the yeas and nays have been \nordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement provided that \nthe amendment of the Senator from Virginia would be redrafted as a \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair is correct. I accept the ruling. And the yeas \nand nays have been ordered; am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3458, as modified. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Burns), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Fitzgerald), the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. \nThomas) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nTennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, I understand each Senator has 2 minutes; \nam I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have decided with the vote on the \nWarner amendment that we are going to leave it to the families to \ndecide what they want to do when the bodies arrive at their final \nresting place. That has been the policy since 1991, through the gulf \nwar and through operations of our two conflicts in Afghanistan and \nIraq. I urge that it remain that way and not open up, as the Lautenberg \namendment directs, the Secretary of Defense shall develop a protocol \nthat permits the media to attend the bodies as they arrive in the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what we have just seen is a vote on \nthe constitutionality question which ought not be the primary point. \nThe question is whether the American people can see pictures of those \nflag-draped coffins in tribute to those who gave their lives in service \nto their country.\n  President Reagan, in 1993, understood it clearly. He publicly \nreceived the bodies of 241 marines who were killed, and there were \nphotographs galore. And during the Afghanistan war, during this \nadministration, flag-draped coffins were filmed. And during the Kosovo \nconflict, President Clinton was on the tarmac to receive those dead. \nBut this requirement, this directive requiring strict censorship issued \njust as the Iraq war began prevents the American people from seeing the \ntruth about what is happening.\n  I urge my colleagues to face their constituents back home and tell \nthem it was not appropriate for the media to photograph coffins, flags \non top, in tribute in Dover, DE. It is an outrage to permit that to \ncontinue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3291, as modified.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman and \nranking member. I know we are working toward finishing this very \nimportant bill.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the focus and purpose of this amendment \nis very simple, it is easy to understand, and it is quite clear. In the \n5 minutes I have, I will try to lay out that purpose, its cost, and the \nreasons it is very important for this Senate to act affirmatively on \nthis amendment.\n  My amendment will fix and make clear that the Survivor Benefit Plan \noffered in 1972 to our men and women in uniform, of which they pay more \nthan 80 percent of this benefit for themselves, so it is modestly \nsubsidized by the taxpayer, my amendment will make it clear that the \nsurvivors of our veterans--in most cases they are women but, obviously, \nnot in every case--at the age of 62 will be able to retain what they \nthought they signed up for, which is 55 percent of the benefit, instead \nof what is occurring today, which is cutting that benefit down to 33 \npercent.\n  There are all sorts of reasons people will hold out as to why this is \nhappening, but it is clear it needs to be fixed. It is also clear there \nis plenty of money in this bill to fix it. We are going to spend over \n$400 billion this year on the Defense bill. This amendment will only \ncost about $400 million a year to fix. Somewhere in this bill of \nhundreds of billions of dollars, I am certain we can find the $400 \nmillion to live up to a promise made to our military men and women and \nto give them the benefit of which actually they are paying 80 percent. \nThis is not a taxpayer giveaway; this is honoring a commitment made \nwhen we set up a program. The men and women who serve in the military \nnot only are brave and courageous, they are also usually concerned \nabout setting up the appropriate death benefits for their spouses and \ntheir children.\n  We have a system that will allow retirees to get 55 percent of their \npay. The argument against this is that when this program was started by \nsome in the Pentagon, they say it was never publicized that service \nmembers would get 55 percent, so why are people complaining today about \ngetting 35 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document \nrelated to the Survivor Benefit Plan which I believe the chairman and \nranking member have read. It is important to the hundreds of \norganizations that support this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From Section VIII--Monthly Cost and Amount of Survivor Annuity]\n\n       Spouse only (no eligible children). Cost of coverage is \n     2\\1/2\\ percent of the first $300, plus 10 percent of any \n     designated retired pay in excess of $300. If coverage is \n     elected for a dependent child acquired subsequent to \n     retirement, cost of coverage will be increased. The increase \n     in cost is effective the first day of the month following \n     eligibility of such child. (See c below.)\n       Spouse and eligible children. The cost of coverage will be \n     2\\1/2\\ percent of the first $300 of the base amount plus 10 \n     percent of the remainder plus a slight additional charge for \n     children's coverage that will vary depending on your age, \n     your wife's age, and the age of your youngest child. The \n     additional charge should generally be about one-half of one \n     percent of the amount of retired pay designated.\n       If your spouse becomes ineligible through divorce, \n     annulment or death, no cost is due for any month in which \n     there is no beneficiary. If you remarry, the cost will be \n     reinstated the first anniversary of the date of remarriage, \n     unless child is born of that marriage prior to the first \n     anniversary date.\n       Eligible children only (no spouse). The cost of coverage \n     will very depending on your age and the age of your youngest \n     child but should generally be about 3 percent of the amount \n     of retired pay designated.\n       Cost reduction--children. When all children cease to be \n     eligible for an annuity, the additional cost for child \n     coverage shall stop. The reduction in cost is effective the \n     first day of the month following that in which the last child \n     ceases to be eligible for an annuity.\n       Natural interest person. Cost of coverage is 10 percent of \n     full retired pay, plus an additional 5 percent of full \n     retired pay for each full 5 years that your age exceeds that \n     of the natural interest person. The total cost may not exceed \n     40 percent of retired pay.\n       Annuity--Spouse and/or eligible children. Full coverage \n     provides an annuity of 55 percent of retired pay. Reduced \n     coverage provides an annuity of 55 percent of reduced amount \n     elected.\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\n       Annuity--Natural interest person. The annuity payable is 55 \n     percent of retired pay remaining after cost of coverage has \n     been subtracted.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The front page of this contract says that for the \nspouses and/or eligible children, full coverage provides an annuity of \n55 percent of retired pay.\n  This is the contract that service personnel sign, in plain English. \nFull coverage provides an annuity of 55 percent of retired pay.\n  What is happening now--after people signed up for this, paid into the \nprogram, and had some confidence their spouses would receive 55 percent \nof their retirement--is they are told they can only get 35 percent \nbecause we do not have enough money to live up to the terms of this \ncontract.\n  Right now a sergeant first class, in retirement, would be making \nabout $771 per month--not a huge sum, by any means. Compare that amount \nof money to the contribution of this American: 20 years of his life \nputting his life on the line, putting the uniform on every day, for 20 \nyears. The grand sum for him is $771 a month.\n  We have money for every tax cut and drive businesses offshore, we can \ngive tax cuts to everybody but we cannot find enough money for the \nspouse, who has moved every 2 years for 20 years. It is tough to hold \ndown a job when you are moving, no matter how smart you are, no matter \nhow high your grades were in school, or how hard you work. It is hard \nto keep up a career while moving to a different community, with \nchildren most of the time, every 2 years. We want to tell this spouse \nshe is now only entitled to $491 a month, down to $5,000 a year.\n  Families are filing for bankruptcy.\n  Let me share some stories of the hardships spouses face because of \nthe widow tax.\n  Marion Charles is age 78. Marion's husband Ed died in 2002. Her \nhusband was a Navy diver in WWII. He retired in 1966, as a crew member \non one of America's first nuclear subs. Mrs. Charles had no idea her \nfirst pension payment would be reduced to 35 percent. Her husband \njoined SBP when it began. She said:\n\n       I was so shocked, I almost fell out of the chair and \n     wondered why God hadn't taken me, too, when he took Ed.\n\n  She was left with $21,000 in bills. She said:\n\n       Neither my husband nor I realized there would be an \n     offset--no one ever told us. I find myself under a lot of \n     stress getting over his death and trying to do something with \n     the large bills facing me.\n\n  Mrs. Charles nearly lost her home and almost declared bankruptcy.\n  Miriam Joy Parker is from Huntsville, AL. Her husband served for 32 \nyears. She followed her husband across the world for those 32 years. \nMrs. Parker had to tighten her budget to live on the 55 percent pension \nshe received before she turned 62. At age 62, the widow tax cut her \nannual income by nearly $10,000. She cannot live on the 35 percent rate \nand Social Security. She has had to begin working in her sixties. She \nnever knew there was an offset.\n  Betty Wells is from Ocala, FL. The widow tax has cost Ms. Wells \n$8,400 a year. At age 67, she took a job to make ends meet.\n  Diane Worth is from Phoenix, AZ. The widow tax cut her annual income \nby $2,400. She may have to sell her home. The offset has cost her \nnearly $10,000.\n  My amendment corrects this grave injustice.\n  A spouse of a lieutenant colonel would see their pension cut from \n$1,595 a month, under our new rules, to $1,015 a month, for a grand \ntotal of $12,180 a year, after 20 years of service keeping the hearth \ngoing when their spouse was putting on that uniform and protecting us.\n  I think we can do better. That is what my amendment does, and about \n15 Senators on both sides of the aisle agree. They are joining me, \nincluding Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, and others. I am joined by \nSenator Snowe, who is the lead sponsor of this amendment on the other \nside.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece in the Washington \nTimes entitled ``Survivor Benefit Plan needs reform'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 23, 2004]\n\n                   Survivor Benefit Plan Needs Reform\n\n                            (By John Fales)\n\n       Dear Sgt. Shaft: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) is \n     urging all 66 members of the House and Senate budget \n     committees to include funding in the 2005 budget resolution \n     for legislation (S. 1916 and H.R. 3673) that eliminates the \n     drastic reduction in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuities \n     that now adversely impacts survivors of military personnel \n     who are 62 and older.\n       The current program provides 55 percent of SBP covered \n     retired pay for younger spouses--however, the amount \n     decreases to 35 percent of retired pay when survivors become \n     eligible for Social Security. Many retirees and their spouses \n     were not fully aware of this reduction when they enrolled in \n     the program in the early 1970s. As a result, many believe \n     they were betrayed by having been asked to sign an \n     irrevocable contract to pay lifetime SBP premiums.\n       Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, Louisiana Democrat, introduced the \n     Military Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2003 (S. 1916), \n     which would eliminate the SBP offset over a 10-year period. \n     Companion legislation (H.R. 3673) to do the same was \n     introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, in the \n     House.\n       The Fleet Reserve Association, the oldest and largest \n     organization dedicated to enhancing pay and benefits for \n     enlisted member of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Coast \n     Guard, was instrumental in the enactment of the military SBP \n     program in 1972, which was designed to improve the Retired \n     Servicemembers Family Protection Plan. Participants were \n     responsible for paying 60 percent of the costs, while the \n     government was to subsidize the remaining 40 percent.\n       But today's SBP program looks nothing like its FRA \n     predecessor, and its intended value has been greatly \n     diminished by the Social Security offset as well as decreased \n     contributions from the federal government.\n       Today, military retirees pay for more than 80 percent of \n     SBP costs, while the government picks up only about 19 \n     percent of the costs. By way of comparison, the federal \n     government subsidizes its civilian survivor benefit plans--\n     Federal Employees Retirement System and Civil Service \n     Retirement System--at 33 percent and 48 percent, \n     respectively.\n       Probably the greatest disparity between the two plans is \n     beneficiaries in the federal civilian programs do not \n     experience the same offset incurred by military SBP \n     beneficiaries when they reach the age of 62. It is \n     unconscionable that the men and women of our armed forces and \n     their families continue to sacrifice at a time when they are \n     in their greatest need.\n       FRA is grateful to Rep. Miller and Mrs. Landrieu for \n     their leadership in campaigning to restore equity and \n     credibility to this vital program. FRA is again \n     referencing the need for SBP reform in its testimony \n     before Congress this year.\n       We urge those who wish to help reform this unfair and \n     ebilitating law to visit the association's Action Center at \n     http://www.fra.org/action/index.html, click on ``Urge Your \n     Elected Official to Support funding for SBP Reform \n     Legislation'' and send a prewritten e-mail to their \n     congressional representatives.\n\n                                                   Joe Barnes,\n\n                                     National Executive Secretary,\n                                        Fleet Reserve Association.\n       Dear Joe: I echo your praise and support of S. 1916 and \n     H.R. 3673. I also commend Mrs. Landrieu and Mr. Miller for \n     spearheading this vital legislation.\n       Dear Sgt Shaft: I agree totally that the SBP program is a \n     huge injustice for widows of military retired persons. I had \n     10 years of active duty plus 14 years in the Reserves, \n     retiring as an O-6. It has been a long time since I have seen \n     a write-up of the actual SBP provisions, so I do not \n     understand how it affects me and my wife. Where can I find a \n     good description?\n       From the synopses I have seen so far, we would have been \n     better off to take the dollars and put them toward an annuity \n     policy instead of wasting them on the SBP program.\n                                                  Harry J. Wander,\n                                                COL, AUS, Retired.\n       Dear Henry: For starters, I suggest that you visit a few of \n     the military organization Web sites, such as the Military \n     Officers Association of America at www.moaa.org, the Non \n     Commissioned Officers Association, www.ncoausa/org, or the \n     Fleet Reserve Association at www.fra.org.\n       Dear Sgt Shaft: Isn't it funny: If Congress wants a pay \n     raise, it's processed with no problems. For those of us ``who \n     paid the price'' for our country (to keep Congress intact), \n     there's always some delay.\n                                                        Michael G.\n                                                         Virginia.\n       Dear Michael: The Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     (DFAS) has announced that computer reprogramming has \n     progressed faster than expected and they have made concurrent \n     disability payments (CDP) to about 150,000 eligible retirees \n     on Feb. 1. Those whose CDP will be delayed another month or \n     two include those who divide their retired pay with a former \n     spouse, medical disability retirees who will have their \n     offset only partially eliminated by the new law change, and a \n     few other special situations.\n       DFAS officials believe that they will be able to provide \n     payment for all these retirees no later than the April 1 \n     paycheck.\n\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\n\n  Just like concurrent receipt, the widow tax hurts veterans but not \nFederal employees. A veteran with 20 years of service to the Nation and \na disability could not collect both retirement pay and disability pay. \nHowever, Federal workers eligible for retirement and job-related \ndisability can collect both. Our Federal workforce is filled with \ntalented and dedicated people. However, it is an injustice that the men \nand women who put their lives on the line for our Nation's defense are \ntreated as second-class citizens.\n  Federal civilian spouses don't face the widow tax. They have no \noffset. Under the civil service retirement system--CSRS--which was the \npre-1984 retirement system, surviving spouses receive 55 percent of the \ndeceased spouse's retirement benefits.\n  Under the current retirement system--the Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem of FERS--surviving spouses receive 50 percent of the retirement \nbenefits.\n  Neither has an offset at any age. Widows under FERS collect 50 \npercent of their spouse's pensions and they collect Social Security. No \nSenator's spouse faces an offset. No Senate staffer's spouse faces an \noffset. I don't think our veterans deserves less, yet under SBP, \nwidowers and widows must offset their pension with Social Security.\n  Military retirees pay more than Federal civilians and receive less. \nNot only do military widows receive less than their civilian \ncounterparts, but they pay higher premiums, too. A military retiree \nwill pay an average of $41,000 in premiums. A civilian, under FERS, \nwill pay an average of $32,000 in premiums. It almost seems like a \ntwisted joke: Join the service--pay more and receive less.\n  The Landrieu-Snowe amendment, a bipartisan amendment, has also been \nendorsed by the Military Coalition, and simply aims to restore equity \nand fairness to our military retirees and spouses. It eliminates the \nwidow tax.\n  Over 950,000 million retirees are enrolled in SBP. The widow tax \nwaits for them as a ``thank you'' for 20-plus years of service. Mr. \nPresident, 250,000 widows are currently receiving SBP benefits. The \nwidow tax has been imposed on them--220,000 of them. Forty percent of \nretirees refuse to enroll in SBP because of the offset. The Landrieu-\nSnowe amendment repeals the widow tax by 2008. It gives our surviving \nspouses the benefits they deserve and parity with other Federal \nretirees.\n  As we prepare to celebrate Independence Day, it is hard to imagine \nCongress ever created the widow tax to negatively impact the families \nof those who served to guarantee our freedom. Let's join the House in \nfixing the Survivor Benefits Program. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \nwill create hundreds of thousands of new veterans, and more young men \nand women will be needed to serve. Let's remember George Washington's \nwords:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war [is] directly proportional to how they \n     perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and \n     appreciated by their nation.\n\n  Let's fix this injustice to honor our veterans and ensure we can \nrecruit to defend our Nation in the future.\n  Mr. President, I understand the chairman is going to provide us with \na vote tomorrow. But that explains the amendment and what we are \nattempting to do. I would like to lay it aside until tomorrow at a time \nto be determined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \namendment is already set aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. We shall address this amendment \ntomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the managers of the bill, in \nconsultation with the leaders on both sides, would now like to propose \na unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments in order to the \nDefense authorization bill be offered no later than 6:30 p.m. on \nTuesday, June 22; provided further that in the final 10 minutes prior \nto that time the chairman and ranking member be recognized in order to \noffer en bloc any further amendments from the filed list; further, I \nask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill on Tuesday, there be an additional 60 \nminutes of debate.\n  Perhaps the Chair would like to rule on paragraph 1 now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now to the second part. I ask unanimous consent that when \nthe Senate resumes consideration of the Defense authorization bill on \nTuesday, there be an additional 60 minutes of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form in relation to the Levin missile defense amendment. I \nfurther ask consent that following the debate, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Levin amendment, with no second degrees in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote; provided further that \nfollowing the vote the Senate resume consideration of Brownback \namendment No. 3235 and that the Burns second-degree amendment then be \nagreed to. I further ask that Senator Brownback or his designee be \nrecognized in order to offer a further second degree and that the \nSenate then proceed immediately to a vote in relation to the Brownback \namendment. I further ask consent that following that vote, Senator \nDorgan or his designee be recognized to offer a further second-degree \namendment on media ownership, and immediately on the reporting of the \namendment, the amendment be agreed to, to be followed by Senator \nHollings or his designee to offer a children's programming amendment, \nand then immediately upon the reporting of the amendment the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  Finally, I ask consent that the Brownback underlying amendment be \nagreed to as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the distinguished chairman, amend \nhis unanimous consent request to state that Senator Hollings or his \ndesignee is to offer a second-degree amendment relating to children's \nprogramming.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection. I further amend it.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask following the last word in the proposed \nunanimous consent agreement, the word ``amended,'' there be added to \nthat, ``with no intervening action or debate.''\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand Senator Levin will be recognized for \nthe purpose of laying down his amendment. Shortly after his \npresentation, the distinguished Senator from Arizona will be recognized \nto present his proposal. The Senator from Virginia will reserve his \ncomments on this very important amendment until tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3338\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will reserve most of my comments until \ntomorrow as well because I understand under the unanimous consent \nagreement we have just adopted there will be an hour equally divided.\n  Madam President, this amendment will take $515 million of the $1.7 \nbillion which is provided in this bill for interceptors, $515 million \nof the $3.2 billion which is provided in this bill for national missile \ndefense, take that $515 million and put it into some of the most \ncritically needed requirements that we have in this country, which is \nto address the threat of terrorism against this country.\n  Last week, my dear friend, the chairman, pointed out in his debate on \nthe Boxer amendment that this Congress, in a conference report last \nyear, approved 20 ground-based interceptors, and we did that for a 20-\ntest-bed site.\n  In other words, what the chairman pointed out was accurate. Last year \nwe decided there would be a test bed in Alaska and there would be 20 \ninterceptors in that test bed.\n  Lo and behold, the budget request comes in this year for 40 \ninterceptors, in a 40-silo test bed. Ten of those were removed in the \ncommittee. The issue we have to face as a Senate is whether\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nwe want to add missiles 21 through 30 at the cost of $515 million--it \nwas not identified last year for the test bed, not having been \noperationally tested, not needed for testing--or whether we are going \nto take that $515 million and address this money to desperately needed \nmeasures to go after the fissile material which is throughout this \nworld and to try to secure it; to try to come up with technologies \nwhich can address the threat of explosive devices at a distance. We \ncannot identify explosive devices at a distance. So we face car bombers \nand we face other kinds of destruction such as the USS Cole because we \ncannot identify explosive devices from a distance.\n  Most of our ports are not yet secure. Most of the containers coming \ninto this country are still not being identified, still not being \nlooked at to see whether there may be material in there, either \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear material. We still have massive \ninsecurities in this country relative to the real, immediate threats \nthat we face.\n  We have to take some resources. It seems to me the logical place to \ntake it is where we have not had operational testing of missiles that \nare part of a missile defense system, which are now being produced at \nmuch higher than initial low-rate production, despite a law which says \nyou may not go beyond initial low-rate production into full-rate \nproduction without operational testing. That is the law. Yet what we \nhave said is, so far we are going to take this $515 million, and we are \ngoing to put this in missiles 21 through 30.\n  I want to emphasize to my friends, the debate over the first 20 \nmissiles in that test bed is over in this Senate for now. The Boxer \namendment was defeated. So there are going to be 20 missiles put into \n20 silos. They are going to be deployed. They are going to be produced \ndespite the fact that we have not had independent testing, operational \ntesting, real world testing of these missiles. That debate took place \non this floor last week. That is not the subject of my amendment.\n  My amendment has nothing to do with missiles 1 through 20. It has \nnothing to do with the 20-silo test bed in Alaska. It has everything to \ndo with whether we go beyond that 20-silo test bed to missiles 21 \nthrough 30, decide to produce those missiles despite the fact that we \nhave not had independent operational testing. My amendment would say \nno. No. We know what the real, most immediate threats are to this \ncountry. There may be a North Korean missile threat. For folks who \nbelieve that cannot be deterred and whether we can produce a missile \nthat can knock down a North Korean missile, it is worth doing, fine. If \nthat is the belief of a majority of this body, fine. North Korea cannot \nbe deterred and we can produce missiles which can knock down a North \nKorean missile, so be it, if that is the decision of this body.\n  That is not my amendment. My amendment says hold off producing 21 \nthrough 30. Don't commit in this bill to produce 10 more missiles at a \ncost of $515 million. And this is just for the advanced procurement. \nDon't commit to that when you have not had the operational testing, \nwhen last year we said we were going to have a 20-silo test bed, when \nwe have such major unmet needs in terms of the real, immediate, short-\nterm threats against this country.\n  We had the CIA, not too long ago, that made an assessment as to what \nthe greatest threats were against this country.\n  I want to read the CIA assessment as to where those greatest threats \nwere.\n\n       In December 2001 . . . the CIA released an unclassified \n     document entitled ``Foreign Missile Developments and the \n     Ballistic Missile Threat Through 2005.''\n\n  This is what it said:\n\n       The Intelligence Community judges that U.S. territory is \n     more likely to be attacked with WMD using nonmissile means, \n     primarily because such means: are less expensive than \n     developing and producing ICBMs; can be covertly developed and \n     deployed; the source of the weapon could be masked in an \n     attempt to evade retaliation; probably would be more reliable \n     than ICBMs that have not completed rigorous testing and \n     validation programs; probably would be much more accurate \n     than emerging ICBMs over the next 15 years; probably would be \n     more effective for disseminating biological warfare agents \n     than a ballistic missile; [and] would avoid missile defenses.\n\n  Those are the kinds of choices we should face as a Senate.\n  We have, in the eyes of many, a potential North Korean threat.\n  We have a test bed which is going to proceed. Whether a majority of \nus decided we are going to proceed without that independent operational \ntesting, so be it. That is a done deal. That is going to happen.\n  Now the question is, Do we go into the next 10 missiles, produced in \nthis budget, paid for in the long leap for the next 10--21 through 30--\nat a cost of $515 million despite the assessment of the CIA that the \ngreatest threat we face is weapons of mass destruction using nonmissile \nmeans and all the reasons for which that is true which they laid out? \nLess expensive, covertly developed unlike missiles, source of the \nweapon can be masked in order to evade retaliation.\n  When we get hit by a terrorist, we can't always identify where that \nterrorist comes from or whether there was a state actor behind it. When \na missile is fired at us, we know from where that missile comes. Any \nstate that sends a missile our way knows it it is going to be destroyed \nin return. That is not true with a terrorist attack.\n  According to the CIA, nonmissile means are more effective for \ndisseminating biological warfare agents than a ballistic missile and \nwould avoid missile defense. Despite the fact there is much greater \nlikelihood we would be attacked with nonmissile means, here is the \nsituation we are in right now.\n  According to the head of the U.N.'s International Maritime \nOrganization, fewer than 6 percent of the world's seaports and ships \nmeet rules aimed at preventing terrorism attacks. Six percent of the \nworld's seaports and ships now meet the rules that have been adopted to \nprevent terrorist attacks.\n  We have millions of cargo containers that enter this country's ports \nuninspected. I have one of the biggest ports in my home State of \nMichigan, by the way. But we have ports on the coast. We have ports on \nthe Great Lakes with millions of containers coming in uninspected. We \ncannot identify suicide bomber strikes because we cannot identify \nexplosives at a distance. We have to put money into technology in order \nto do that.\n  These are the most current, the most imminent, the most immediate, \nthe most likely ways this Nation is going to be attacked. We have to \nput resources there.\n\n  My amendment would transfer some of those extra 10 missiles that were \nnot projected last year. Last year we were told we had a test bed with \n20 silos. This year we are asking for these 10--originally 20--extra \nmissiles to be produced. We simply have greater priorities and greater \nthreats.\n  Let me spend a couple more minutes tonight, and I will expand on this \nin the morning. Senator Feinstein, Senator Domenici, and others \nproposed that we develop at the DOE an enhanced nuclear security \nprogram to accelerate the pace of securing and eliminating nuclear \nweapons and materials all over the world.\n  This is what the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Abraham, announced at \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency at the end of May. The Secretary \nof Energy said the Department of Energy would begin such a new program \ncalled the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and that this initiative \nwould ensure that nuclear and radiological material and equipment did \nnot ``fall into the hands of those with evil intentions.'' How would we \ndo that? In his words, we would secure, relocate, and dispose of these \nmaterials and equipment.\n  This is an expansion of the idea of Nunn-Lugar. But this is based on \nthe belief, which has been stated by so many outside independent \ngroups, that fissile material in the hands of terrorists would be the \ngreatest threat that this Nation could face.\n  Senator Abraham in making this announcement said, ``It has become \nclear that an even more comprehensive and urgently focused effort is \nneeded to respond to emergency and evolving threats,'' and that the \nUnited States plans to devote $450 million to this effort.\n  We have an announcement by the Secretary of Energy that we are going \nto have an effort aimed at reducing the greatest single threat in the \neyes of most people to this Nation and to others, which is the fissile \nmaterial would fall into the hands of terrorists to produce either a \nnuclear weapon or a dirty bomb. That is the greatest single\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nthreat--$450 million the Secretary of Energy says the United States is \ngoing to devote to this effort. Yet there is nothing in this budget, no \nfunding for this President.\n  This is perhaps the greatest of all the terrorist threats. It is \nreal. The fissile material is out there. Yet this new initiative \nannounced by the administration has no funding. Instead, we have \nfunding for missiles--21 through 30--for a test bed that was only \nsupposed to have 21 missiles to begin with, and the additional 10 \nmissiles are not tested by an independent testing agency.\n  We are not even sure they would work against a threat which may or \nmay not occur. North Korea has never tested a missile which could reach \nthe United States. The last test they had was 6 years ago.\n  So we have to weigh the threat. We have to make a decision as a \nSenate as to whether we are going to put some resources into addressing \nthe most real threats, the most real terrorist threats, or whether we \nare going to put money into advanced procurement for the next 10 \nmissiles--missiles 21 through 30--for a 20-bed test site.\n  That is the kind of decision we are forced to make. We have resources \nthat have to be allocated. We can't just say, well, we are going to \nface a missile threat some day, so we are going to need an extra 10 \nmissiles even though they haven't been independently tested. So we are \ngoing to put $515 million into that advanced procurement when we have \nports that are facing huge numbers of containers which have not been \ninspected, and when we have fissile material around the world which has \nnot been secured.\n  That is the choice which this amendment will offer to the Senate \ntomorrow. I reserve the remainder of my argument for the morning.\n  I ask that the amendment which I filed at the desk, No. 3338, be \ncalled up. I failed to do that when I started. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Jack Reed, Landrieu, and Feingold be added as \ncosponsors to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Reed, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3338.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Levin's amendment will shift \nfunds from extra, untested interceptor missiles to programs that will \ndetect and stop the most urgent threat facing our country: the risk \nposed by terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.\n  Not only is that the most urgent threat, it is also a much more \nlikely threat than the possibility that a rogue state, such as North \nKorea, will lob a missile at the United States and risk being \nannihalated by us.\n  Who will send a missile with a return address and face sure \ndestruction? Not a nation-state. Terrorist groups, with no return \naddress, from no state against which the United States could retaliate, \nare not deterred by our massive nuclear arsenal.\n  Many experts believe that terrorists would be capable of creating a \nnuclear weapon if they took possession of fissile material. Even the \nsimpler gun-type design, the type of bomb exploded at Hiroshima, could \nkill up to a million people if detonated in a large city.\n  Two years ago, I asked the heads of our nuclear laboratories to show \nus how terrorists could build an atomic weapon with parts available on \nthe open market--other than the fissile material.\n  A month later, they returned to the Senate and showed us the weapon \nthey had made, minus the fissile material. I cannot go into details, \nbut all of us knew instantly that this was within the capabilities of a \nsophisticated terrorist group. You don't have to be a great power to \ncause great damage--if you have the fissile material.\n  Terrorists are also known to be interested in radiological material \nfor a so-called dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersion \ndevice. An attack with a dirty bomb would not cause many fatalities, \nbut it could render large areas uninhabitable and cause long-term \neconomic and psychological damage. These weapons could be smuggled in a \nsuitcase, or in a shipping container entering one of our ports.\n  Clearly, then, the threat of terrorist weapons of mass destruction is \nurgent.\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\n  But where is the sense of urgency in responding to this threat?\n  We have a bill before us today that proposes to spend $10 billion on \nmissile defense--against the less likely threat.\n  The amendment by my colleague, Senator Levin, redresses the balance \nby taking just 5 percent of that amount--$515 million that is \nessentially unnecessary at this time to buy 10 more untested \ninterceptors for the administration's scarecrow ground-based missile \ndefense system--and applying it instead to urgent, unfunded homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  Senator Levin's amendment will take the money saved and apply it to \ndetecting, intercepting, and stopping the use of weapons or mass \ndestruction by terrorists. It also shifts funds to programs to keep \nfissile material out of the hands of terrorists.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Senate passed amendment to this bill \nsponsored by our colleague, Senator Pete Domenici.\n  I cosponsored the amendment, which authorizes a program to accelerate \nU.S. efforts to remove, secure, store, or blend down fissile and \nradiological material.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment complements the Global Threat Reduction \nInitative that the Secretary of Energy announced on May 26, to \nrepatriate Russian and American highly enriched uranium or HEU, from \nresearch reactors around the world, to repatriate the spend fuel, and \nto convert those reactors to use low enriched uranium instead. Too \noften, HEU provided by the Soviet Union or the United States sits at \npoorly guarded research facilities that are a dangerous temptation to \nthieves or terrorists.\n  The Global Threat Reduction Initiative reportedly will cost $450 \nmillion. Senator Levin's amendment provides $211 million or it.\n  In addition, the Levin amendment will provide funds for nuclear \nweapons detectors at major seaports; technology to detect chemical, \nbiological, and radiological materials at a distance; and technology to \ndetect and stop low-flying aircraft, such as crop-dusters, that \nterrorists might use to disperse weapons of mass destruction across a \nwide area.\n  The Levin amendment will help address the most urgent threats to our \nNation, but it will not delete funds for the 20 untested interceptor \nmissiles that the administration plans to field in October.\n  It will simply prevent the Defense Department from spending more \nmoney on 10 additional missiles before we know if the first 20 even \nwork.\n  That is a sensible approach and one that is consistent with ``fly \nbefore you buy'' laws that require operational testing prior to full-\nrate production, as well as with recommendations of the General \nAccounting Office.\n  We need to set our funding priorities to respond to the most urgent \nthreats we face. The Levin amendment is a step in the right direction, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I simply ask my colleague, Is there some \nthought that he is going to amend this amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it would be easier to not modify it. That is not \nmy plan at the moment. I don't think it will be in the morning. But I \nwould not even seek to modify it in a way which changes its character, \nnor would I ask for the right to do so.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, our distinguished colleague from Arizona has waited \na very long time. Consequently, I am going to yield the manager's slot \nhere to my good friend who will do an able job.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Arizona will yield for one inquiry, I \nhave to leave the floor for a couple of moments.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that after Senator Kyl has \ncompleted there are no more speakers? After Senator Kyl has completed \nthis statement, there are no more speakers?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Before the Senator leaves, perhaps to acquaint our colleagues about \nwhat we hope to achieve tomorrow morning, I hope we could include the \nDayton amendment and address it in the morning. Could the Senator \nconsider that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The current unanimous consent provides after an hour \ndebate on my amendment we would vote on my amendment with no \nintervening first-degree or second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. A lot of those will be voice votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Where does the Senator want to include this?\n  Mr. WARNER. Right after the Brownback.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have to check. Offhand, I don't know of a reason, but I \nhave to see if there is a reason I don't know of.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I leave that as a pending request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will do my best to clear that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator McCain wishes to be active in that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't think there is an issue on this side in terms of \nvoting in the morning, but Senator McCain wanted to speak on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will allow him time tomorrow morning to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman of the committee \nyielding time for me to respond to the amendment of our colleague, the \nSenator from Michigan. I will respond directly to some of the last \npoints the Senator made as I get further into my remarks.\n  I begin by simply describing first of all the essence of this \namendment and why it must be opposed. It would cut $515.5 million from \nthe Missile Defense Program. That is over $\\1/2\\ billion. It adds that \nfunding to a variety of other programs, all of which are adequately \nfunded. We have added funding to some of them, and in some cases we \ncould not even spend the money that would be allocated. I will get into \nthose matters later.\n  Let me begin by discussing the harm that would be done to the Missile \nDefense Program--which we have all committed to pursuing under the \nClinton administration--as a result of the adoption of the Levin \namendment.\n  Specifically, as he described it, the amendment cuts funding for \nadditional ground-based interceptors. These are missiles that go into \nthe ground, primarily into the State of the Presiding Officer. This is \nthe heart of our ground-based missile defense system.\n  The missile defense opponents contend we are spending too much money \non a system that has not yet been proven to work, and they further \nclaim that deployment is premature because, as the Senator from \nMichigan argued, operationally realistic testing has not been \ncompleted, and the administration, he contends, is not complying with \nU.S. acquisition laws that require such operational testing and \nevaluation.\n  We are complying with the law. There is no question about that. It \nappears that the objective critics want to achieve in demanding the \nmissile defense system be operationally tested before deployment is \nactually to halt the program altogether. I will explain why.\n  The bottom line is we need the interceptors that would be eliminated \nas a result of eliminating this spending. We need them to do the very \ntests our critics are demanding be done. In other words, it is a Catch-\n22: You have to do operational testing, but we are not going to give \nyou the money to get the missiles to do the testing. That makes no \nsense.\n\n  Moreover, by adding these missiles to the first 20 that will be \npurchased, we have an additional capability to actually defend \nourselves. I know that is troublesome to some, that we would actually \nbe able to defend ourselves in the event that a nation accidentally \nlaunched a missile defense at us--and there are at least three or four \ncountries today that could do that--or, God forbid, a country \ndeliberately launched a missile defense at us.\n  So these missiles not only are available for testing but also would \nactually be able to defend the country for the first time since Ronald \nReagan in 1983 announced our intention to work on a missile defense \nsystem. At that time, he said it could take decades, but I don't think \nhe anticipated that we would research it to death; in other words, that \nwe would be willing to spend more and more and more money but never, as \nthey say in the military, bend metal; in other words, never actually \nproduce the product that would\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nachieve the end result--in this case, a missile to defend ourselves.\n  Now, let me get to this question about operational testing because \nthat is the essence of the amendment of the Senator from Michigan. The \nprevious Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, Phillip Coyle, \nwas quite critical of the National Missile Defense Program in the late \n1990s because the NMD tests, in his opinion, lacked realism, not \nconducted under operational testing.\n  In fact, that was true. These tests are always launched from--the \ntarget is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California toward \nthe Pacific Ocean and the interceptor from the Reagan test site in the \nPacific. I might add, I visited that test site last January. It is an \nincredible facility. They do their very best to replicate what might \nhappen in a real world war. They are very good. But, they acknowledge, \nthey are notified in advance that there is going to be an offensive \nmissile launched, and, of course, they are quite prepared to launch the \nmissile to intercept it. Naturally, they use the same geometrics. One \ncannot argue that this test range exactly replicates the exact \ncircumstances under which an attack might come. That is quite obvious.\n  These tests that have been performed, and the most recent ones have \nbeen quite successful and confirm that all of the component parts work \nand it is possible to intercept a missile with a missile. Therefore, \nthese developmental tests are very important to getting the program to \nthe point where we can operationally test. Obviously, we do not want to \ndeploy and test for the first time, so we go through this phase.\n  But there comes a time when we have to get the conditions more like \nthey would actually be. We know that the best place to place missiles \nin the ground to defend against a probable attack is in the home State \nof the Presiding Officer--Alaska--simply because of its proximity to \nthe locations where an offensive missile might come from and the \ngeometrics of how we would intercept, which direction it would come \nfrom, and how we best intercept it.\n  It is a tad cold in the State of Alaska. In fact, the snow can get \nkind of high and ice can form over the top of the silos. Obviously, one \nthing we have to know how to do in the middle of the winter is to make \nsure we can blow the top off that silo and fire the missile up so it \ncan intercept the offensive missile coming at us. That is just one \nexample, but it makes the point that you do need to test in an \noperational situation, and that, of course, is precisely why we need to \nbuy these additional missiles.\n  The Missile Defense Agency determined that we needed more realistic \ntests. It initiated an effort to develop and field an extensive missile \ndefense test bed that would allow for operationally realistic testing. \nAs the elements of test bed are put into place, they are tested. All of \nthis is sequential. It is an ongoing process. Both the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation and the Commander of STRATCOM recognize \nthe test bed will grow and mature over time as the elements of it are \ndeveloped, fielded, and tested. This is the very essence of what spiral \ndevelopment is all about.\n  I have to discuss spiral development just briefly. This is the \nconcept that we are able to evaluate and modify systems as we go along, \nas technology improves. The technology here is improving so rapidly and \nthe potential enemies' technology so rapidly that it is never possible \nto wait until we know exactly what the enemy is going to throw at us \nand then begin work on a system that we can defeat it with. You have to \nbe working right alongside what the enemy is doing and developing your \nprogram as you go along, adding the technology as it develops.\n\n  I might add, it is not the only program we do this with. The F-16 is \na great fighter plane. It is trained at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. \nI do not even recall which number of the F-16 we are on now. We started \nwith the A model, and then the B model, and then the C model, and the \nE, and on and on, and each model improves the airplane. The F-16 flown \ntoday is a totally different airplane than the one designed over 20 \nyears ago. As we develop new technology, we add that to the system.\n  Thus, the same with the missile defense system. You cannot wait until \nyou can develop the perfect system and then begin building it and \ndeploying it. By the time you did that, you would already be way behind \nthe progress your potential enemy is making. So it is very natural, \nthen, to allow this spiral development, especially in a program such as \nmissile defense.\n  Where are we now? This fall we will field an initial operational \nmissile defense capability at Fort Greeley, AK, and Vandenberg Air \nForce Base which will include just 20 interceptors. That is all. By the \ntime this system is ready for operational alert, the Missile Defense \nAgency will have tested the operational configuration of the \ninterceptor, the command, the control, the battle management and \ncommunications systems, as well as the interoperability and the \nperformance of the needed sensors. Operational Test and Evaluation \npersonnel from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation have been fully engaged in the testing, along with the \nwarfighters who will operate the system. So this is not just \ncontractors going out there and seeing if they can make the system \nwork. We are beyond that. That was done earlier. We are now at the \nstage of interoperability where Operational Test and Evaluation \npersonnel and actual combat operators will be engaged in the testing.\n  So what is the alleged problem here? What Missile Defense wanted to \ndo is stop the administration from acquiring the 20 interceptors it \nneeds to complement the first 20 that, as has been noted, have been \nfunded. Specifically, the request for fiscal year 2005 makes a \ndownpayment on additional ground-based interceptors, interceptors Nos. \n21 through 40. I would note, however, that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee-passed Defense authorization bill already cut long-lead \nprocurement funding for interceptors Nos. 31 through 40. So we have \nalready delayed the second 10 of this next 20 and made it more \nexpensive, undoubtedly, to acquire by the action we have taken here.\n  So it is not as if we have not evaluated this and tried to figure out \nif we could save some money in the acquisition of these additional \ninterceptors. We have done that. The Armed Services Committee did it, \nand it should be applauded for doing it.\n  What would this downpayment on this next 20--of which already the \nlead time has been cut by half, so we are now talking 10--what would it \nprovide?\n  The first thing it would provide is additional test articles \nnecessary, in the view of the Department of Defense, to conduct planned \nfuture integrated flight tests. So it is not as if we have already \nbought everything we need to conduct our testing.\n\n  Secondly, it would provide an expanded interceptor inventory to \naddress the estimated growth in foreign ballistic missile threats from \nadversaries, such as North Korea and, perhaps, Iran.\n  Three, it would maintain a more steady industrial-base production \nline for the interceptors and the kill vehicles in case an expanded \ninventory is determined necessary.\n  And, four, it would provide ground site preparation activities for \ninterceptors 21 through 30.\n  These things take time. It has been a couple of years since the \npeople have been at work in the State of Alaska preparing these sites \nto accept the missiles that will be put in the silos, to put the radar \nand the other equipment up that is necessary to make this whole system \nwork.\n  The additional cuts or restrictions that have been proposed here \nwould cripple the effective deployment of the initial test bed system. \nThat system, as I said, is absolutely essential if we are to conduct \nthe more realistic testing everyone is calling for.\n  What does the head of Operational Test and Evaluation today say about \nthis program? The Director, Thomas Christie, recently testified at a \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing on missile defense, as the \ndistinguished ranking member knows. Here is what he said:\n\n       . . . I think the issue we're talking about here is the \n     building of missiles that will be put into silos that are \n     part of the test bed, and we will have to have this test bed \n     in order to do some of the testing that will become more \n     realistic engagements, geometries, for example, than we've \n     been able to do before. And some of these attributes of this \n     test bed are in response to criticism that\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\n     came from my office and my predecessor in previous \n     administrations. . . .\n\n  In other words, making the point earlier that: Well, we have not \ngotten realistic enough in our testing yet. We are trying to respond to \nthat. Yet this amendment would cut the funding for the missiles that \nare precisely necessary to do that.\n  The purchase of additional ground-based interceptors, which the \ncritics of the system would like to prevent, will provide a rotatable \npool of operational and test assets, and this, in turn, will allow the \nUnited States to field the most current interceptor improvements.\n  Now, the missile defense is a capabilities-based development program. \nThe system under development is a spiral development program, as I \ndescribed. There is, at this present time, no mature operational \ncapability against which traditional or formal operational test and \nevaluation can be completed.\n  This is a key point General Kadish has made over and over. This is \nnot like building another Navy destroyer or another Air Force fighter \njet where we already have generations of previous such weapons and all \nwe are doing is now developing the most recent technology. There is no \nmissile defense. I know some Americans may not realize this, but if a \nmissile were fired at us today, we could not stop it. We do not have a \nballistic missile defense system--not one missile. So we are doing this \nfor the first time. That is why we want to do it in this spiral \ndevelopment mode I have been describing.\n  Moreover, fielding a system before operational test and evaluation is \nnot unprecedented. It has been done before in other cases where there \nwas no similar capability as I have just described and also where an \nurgent need existed.\n\n  Let me give you some examples. One that is most recent, probably, is \nthe Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System aircraft. It is \ncalled JSTARS. It played an important role in the 1991 Persian Gulf war \nby providing warning to our forces on the ground when the Iraqi \nmilitary was on the move.\n  Now, JSTARS was not an operational system. We did not have any of \nthese aircraft at the time. It was in preproduction. We were just \nbeginning to build the aircraft. We had not even begun the operational \ntest and evaluation. Yet we realized we were in a war in which we \nneeded to know where the enemy was going. I know something about this \nparticular system because parts of it actually were produced by a \ncompany in my own State. Our military said: We have a system here. It \nhas not gone through preproduction operational test and evaluation, but \nwe might be able to get it configured and put together quickly enough \nto bring it over to the gulf and do you some good. And they did, and it \ndid. It was invaluable. It had not gone through all this testing, but \nwe were in an emergency situation, and it did its job. It did very \nwell.\n  Other examples include the Predator and the Global Hawk unmanned \naerial vehicles. Both have been very valuable assets in the war on \nterrorism. Yet they were deployed--into areas that we cannot discuss--\nbefore there had been any operational test and evaluation. These were \nalmost brandnew ideas. In fact, each vehicle was, in effect, a \nprototype. Yet our commanders figured out: We need some surveillance. \nDo you have anything that can help us out here? And sure enough, the \ncontractor said: We do, but they're not ready to go. They haven't gone \nthrough all the testing.\n  The commanders in the field said: Bring them over. We need them. And \nthey have done a terrific job.\n  A third example is the Patriot missile battery. This is an anti-\naircraft missile battery. We found ourselves in the middle of the \nPersian Gulf war, and the Iraqis were firing scud missiles at us. There \nwas no defense against scud missiles. Commanders said: Is there \nanything we can do?\n  The answer came: Well, we have these Patriot missiles. They are \ndesigned to shoot down aircraft. Maybe we can configure some radar to \noperate with the system and do some other things and possibly shoot \ndown some of these scud missiles.\n  Literally, as they were bringing them across from America to Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait, they were putting in fixes in the Patriot anti-\naircraft system. You know the rest of the story. We began shooting down \nscud missiles with this system.\n  It wasn't perfect. It was not designed for this. We were constantly \nupgrading it. But I think estimates finally concluded we shot down \nmaybe about a third--I have forgotten the exact number--of the Iraqi \nScuds being fired against us. We needed it in an emergency. Nobody \ncould have predicted necessarily that we needed that system at that \ntime. You can't wait until you know that you have the threat sometimes. \nThat is the same thing with missile defense.\n  I sometimes wonder if my colleagues would allow us to use one of \nthese test missiles against--let's just say North Korea accidentally \nlaunched a missile at Alaska. Would they say, Sorry, this has not been \noperationally tested and evaluated? It hasn't gone through all the \nchecks and balances, therefore, you can't use it?\n  No, of course not. We would use it to defend ourselves. So let's \ndon't get into this argument that somehow you have to check all of \nthese boxes in some certain order before you can even put the missile \nin the ground, A, to test it, and, B--God forbid if we had to--to use \nit. There is nothing wrong, there is nothing illegal about this. It has \nbeen done before. In fact, it has been proven necessary before.\n  I said it is in accord with acquisition laws. The Director of the \nOperational Test and Evaluation Program, Mr. Christie, has already \ntestified that the program is, and this is a direct quote, ``living \nwithin the law.''\n  The Missile Defense Agency has not sought nor has it received any \nwaiver for any acquisition statutes here. The missile defense authority \nis conducting tests that are increasingly operationally realistic, \nappropriate to the maturity of a system that is still under \ndevelopment. So there is nothing wrong with what is being done. But \nwhat has been set up is a catch-22. You can't deploy until you test, \nbut the catch-22 is, you can't test without deploying.\n  Well, we are going to deploy, and hopefully we will buy enough \nmissiles so we have the capability of doing the tests the way they need \nto be done.\n  I made the point that it would be nonsensical to argue this theory of \noperational testing being required to be completed before you could \nactually deploy a system and noted that no one would deny us the right \nto use such a system in self-defense if we had to do that. It is, in \nfact, true that there are countries that have this capability today. It \nis also true that maybe this isn't today the threat that is most likely \nto occur, but we know--without getting into a lot of detail--there are \ncountries that have had systems for some time. We are not certain \nnecessarily of the safety and reliability of those systems, the ability \nfor those systems to not be accidentally launched or for somebody else \nto intentionally launch them notwithstanding the custody and the state \nin which they are located. If there were such an accident, we would \nneed to have the capability against it.\n  We face that threat today because, as I said, there are countries in \nthis world that have operational systems that can reach the United \nStates. Some of them are not friendly to the United States either. I \nrepeat, today we have no defense against a ballistic missile attack. \nThat is why President Bush, when he came into office, decided to pursue \nthis spiral development, this notion that we will try to get the best \nwe can out there as quickly as we can.\n  That will serve three purposes. First, it will enable us to defend \nourselves if we had to as quickly as possible. And he set this fall as \nthe target date for that deployment. In fact, we are going to be able \nto meet that date. I hope the Presiding Officer is able to be in her \nState because she and the other Senator from the great State of Alaska \nhave been indefatigable in their efforts to make sure the program goes \nforward. We will actually be able to defend ourselves if there were an \naccidental or, as I said, an intentional launch against us.\n\n  Secondly, it enables us to do this operational testing under \nrealistic conditions.\n  And there is a third point. This is very important. It is a \ndeterrent. We want other countries to do what Muammar Qadhafi did. We \nwant these\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nother countries to say: It is costing us a lot of money to try to \ndevelop this nuclear program. At the end of the day, the United States \nis probably going to be able to beat us. We might as well not go \nthrough the cost and the effort to try to develop it. Deterrence.\n  Let me read what very recently, just before the Reagan funeral, \nGenadi Garasimov, spokesman for the former Soviet leader Mikhail \nGorbachev, had to say:\n\n       I see President Reagan as a grave digger of the Soviet \n     Union and the spade that he used to prepare this grave was \n     SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, so-called Star Wars. \n     The trick was that the Soviet leadership believed that this \n     SDI defense is possible and then, because it is possible, \n     that also we must catch up with the Americans. And this was \n     an invitation to the arms race and the Soviet economy could \n     not really afford it. In this way Reagan really contributed \n     to the demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n  It worked. President Reagan was not bluffing. He meant to deploy this \nsystem. At Reykjavik, when Gorbachev said: We can make this arms deal \nwe have been talking about, if you will do one more thing. If you will \nstop development of your SDI program, we have a deal.\n  President Reagan thought about it overnight, came back the next \nmorning and said: I am sorry. The United States is going to proceed \nwith missile defense.\n  Gorbachev knew at that moment it was over. They could not compete \nwith us, and it wasn't obviously worth the effort to try to do so \nbecause they knew the technology of the United States could produce a \ndefense against the only real weapon that the Soviet Union had that \ncould defeat us, and that was the ballistic missile.\n  The point of telling the story is that we need to let others like \nMuammar Qadhafi understand the fact that we are not bluffing. We mean \nit. We are going to deploy the system and it is going to work and \ndefeat them and they might as well not go through all the time and \neffort and expense to develop offensive missiles to try to reach the \nUnited States because it won't work. We are going to be able to shoot \nthem down. So don't bother to do it.\n  This is a nonproliferation or antiproliferation program. By moving \nforward in a robust way with the expenditure of this money and letting \nthem know that we mean business, that we are not bluffing, I believe we \nwill deter countries from continuing the development of their programs \nor putting more money into their programs. We don't need to get into \nall of the countries that we might be talking about today. Some are \nperhaps, if not allies, at least not enemies of the United States \ntoday. Others are potential enemies.\n  The point is, we don't want to encourage anyone to believe that we \nare not serious about moving forward with this program. With all due \nrespect, this amendment would send that signal. We have cut the money \nfor the long lead funding on the third tranche of missiles. This would \nsay: Let's just totally eliminate the funding, a half a billion \ndollars, for these 10 missiles. It begins to send the message that we \nare going to research forever but build never. That is a message we \ncannot afford to send.\n  What we are doing is consistent with the 1999 Missile Defense Act \nwhich declared, and I quote, that ``it is the policy of the United \nStates to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective \nnational missile defense system capable of defending the territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack.''\n  That is the law. That is what we need to do. If we have the \ntechnology to do it, it would be more than negligent; it would be \ncriminal for our government not to do so. If you have the ability to do \nit, it is the moral thing to do as well.\n  As Ronald Reagan said many times: I would much rather be able to \ndefeat an enemy missile than to have to rely upon a nuclear deterrent \nand mutually destroy each other.\n  It is unthinkable in today's world that we would have to do that when \nwe have the technological option of missile defense. Given the nature \nof the threat posed, given our technological capability at this point \nand each year our increasing ability to improve, this is the only \nresponsible course of action.\n  We have already defeated, in effect, this same amendment before, the \nReid amendment, based on the same argument about operational testing. \nBut it only fenced the funding for these missiles. The Levin amendment \nvirtually eliminates the funding and would spend it on other things.\n  I suggest if we were willing to reject the Reid amendment, which \nmerely fenced the funding, it would logically follow that we would even \nmore likely reject the Levin amendment, which does away with all of the \nfunding. What he has done is to distinguish from the Reid amendment by \ntaking this half billion dollars and spreading it around to some other \nprograms. That is the essential difference. I will turn to that next. \nHis argument is that we need to look at priorities, and that right now \nit might be easier for some terrorists to bring a weapon of mass \ndestruction into this country than to launch it on a ballistic missile.\n  In the first place, that is wrong. There are countries today that \nhave the perfect capability of launching a ballistic missile with a \nnuclear warhead at the United States, and we have no defense against it \nwhatsoever. So the argument is incorrect.\n  Now, it is true that a terrorist organization may want to do it in a \ndifferent way. But if it could get hold of a missile, I suggest it \nwould do it. Take the case of Pakistan, which is a very great ally of \nthe U.S. today but a country with ballistic missiles. I hope that \ncountry will always have control over those missiles and have a leader \nof the quality of President Musharraf. But what would happen if it \ndidn't? Terrorists can do things in lots of different ways, that is \ntrue, and that is a point the Senator from Michigan made. My \nsubcommittee on terrorism technology held hearings on container \nsecurity, and it is true that we don't have perfect security at our \nports and we need to spend more money and we need to do better at \nlooking at the different ways in which terrorism can strike the United \nStates. That is all very true. The question is whether our priorities \nare right.\n  The Defense bill we are debating on the Senate floor tonight spends \napproximately $420 billion for next year. The Senator from Michigan \nwould almost make it seem as if the only thing we are doing is spending \nmoney on missile defense, and that we have to get off of that priority \nbecause there are other higher priorities. How much are we spending on \nthat? It is $10 billion. Out of a $420 billion Defense bill, we are \nspending $10.2 billion on missile defense, and only a half billion of \nthat is on the program we are talking about.\n  So it is hardly a matter of taking all our defense money and putting \nit on a program that we should not be spending it on. Out of $420 \nbillion, we are spending a half billion dollars on what the Senator \nfrom Michigan would strike. What are the higher priorities? The Senator \nsays homeland security. Indeed, if you add the money in this bill and \nthe other homeland security money on homeland security that is being \nauthorized for this next year, it is more than $47 billion. That is 15 \npercent over last year and 130 percent over fiscal year 2002.\n  If you want to make the argument that as a matter of priority we \nshould be spending more on homeland security than these 10 missiles, \nwell, we are. It is $47 billion-plus versus a half billion dollars. I \nwill repeat it. It is more than $47 billion versus the half \nbillion dollars that the Senator from Michigan would strike from this \nprogram.\n\n  So I don't think we need to worry about priorities. In fact, I think \nthe money that would be taken from the Missile Defense Program, and \ncould literally cripple it, is already covered; that is to say, each of \nthe programs to which the funding is added are already covered. We have \nalready increased spending on 6 of the 10 programs to which the money \nwould go. The bill has already added to the President's requested \nlevels only the following programs: cruise missile defense, $80 \nmillion; blast mitigation R, $10 million added; radiation and nuclear \ndetection, $5 million; modeling and simulation efforts to increase \ncapability of fielded chemical-biological standoff detection systems, \nadding $2 million; nonproliferation verification R, $25 million; \naircrew masks, a half-million-dollar procurement in the chem-bio \ndefense program.\n  In all of the other programs and funding areas addressed in the Levin\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\namendment, the committee provided the requested level of funding. So \nwhat the administration requested, the committee gave them. So they \nadded to the request in six, and in all of the others they are getting \nexactly what they had requested. In one area, the NORTHCOM military \nassistance to civil authorities, NORTHCOM indicates that it has no \nresponsibility in the area.\n  For two potential adds, the execution of additional funding would be \nproblematic. They probably could not spend the money. One is the Global \nThreat Reduction Initiative. It is a new NNSA nonproliferation \ninitiative that was announced in May. They expect to fund it out of \nexisting funds from the $87 million in fiscal 2005. An additional $211 \nmillion, as proposed in this amendment, would not be executable in \nfiscal 2005. They could not spend it.\n  On radiation detection and training in megaports, additional funds \ncannot be executed until agreements are negotiated with other nations. \nNNSA doesn't expect that these agreements could be in place in time to \nuse additional funds in fiscal 2005.\n  The Department of Defense already has the flexibility with the funds \nrequested within the budget to meet the high-priorities needs: \nantiterrorism/force protection training and exercises for the National \nGuard. These activities are funded through operation and maintenance, \nand the Department can already align the requested O funds to meet \ntheir needs.\n  The bottom line is that the additional funding taken away from \nmissile defense is not needed. The arguments for taking it away have \nalready been rejected by the Senate in the Reed amendment. This is just \nanother attempt to research missile defense to death and never build \nit.\n  I encourage my colleagues to follow the good instinct that they \nfollowed with respect to the Reed amendment and reject this notion that \nwe should not have more than the 20 missiles; that we don't need the \nadditional 10 we are talking about here for operational testing because \nwe do need to test against realistic conditions, and that is why we \nneed to obtain the missiles and put them in these silos, and also \nbecause they just might be needed.\n  For once, it would be nice for us to say that on our watch the \nmissile defense that was announced 20 years ago has actually become a \nreality. It is not a perfect system yet by any means, and that is the \nwhole point of this particular program--to begin the development and \ndeployment and spiral that technology as it continues to evolve. That \nis a great idea. It is a great protection for the American people. Why \nwould we not want to do it?\n\n  With respect to the prioritization argument, I have already made it \nclear what we are spending on this. I didn't calculate the fraction, \nbut it is a minor fraction of what we are spending on homeland security \nand on defense generally.\n  I urge my colleagues, as with the Reed amendment, to reject the \nargument behind this amendment; reject the Levin amendment and support \nthe committee, which worked very hard to put together a product of \nwhich I think the Senate can be proud, that the administration will \nsupport, that we can get passed in conference committee and sent to the \nPresident for his signature, so we can move forward this year and, for \nthe first time, this fall actually have the beginnings of a missile \ndefense system for the people of this country. They deserve no less. It \nis our obligation to see to it that it comes to pass.\n  That is the conclusion of my remarks. I don't know if the Senator \nfrom Michigan wants to make further remarks at this time. I am going to \nwant to proffer a unanimous consent request.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will be very brief, given the hour. \nFirst, as to our friend's comment that this amendment suggests that we \nnever build, only research, this amendment doesn't touch the 20 \nmissiles slated to go into those silos in Alaska. It is my \nunderstanding, by the way, that those missiles in the Alaskan silos are \nnot going to be launched as part of a test. I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Arizona would disagree with that. He talked about the necessity of \nthose missiles being placed in silos in Alaska in order that they be \nrealistically tested. I am wondering if the Senator from Arizona would \nagree that the DOD has determined, due to safety considerations, that \nno tests are currently planned to launch interceptors from the \noperational missile fields; is that his understanding also?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President--\n  Mr. LEVIN. To launch. There is no decision currently made.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have not checked to see what the current \nplan is with respect to the timing of the tests and with respect to the \nmissiles that are included within the program, which I think the \nSenator is talking about, which are the first 20 missiles.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. It is my understanding there are no tests \nplanned to launch interceptors from those missile fields. If there is \nany change in that, I think we will find out tomorrow morning.\n  This amendment does not touch those 20 missiles. I want to reiterate \nthat point. It does not touch the money. It does not cut the missiles. \nThose missiles will be there. They are not going to be launched from \nthere.\n  Nonetheless, they are going to be there. How that leads to realistic \ntesting beats me, but nonetheless that debate is passed.\n  What has not passed is the most unmet emergency threat to the United \nStates. This is according to the Russia task force of the Secretary of \nEnergy advisory:\n\n       The most unmet national security threat to the United \n     States today is that the danger of weapons of mass \n     destruction or weapons usable material in Russia could be \n     stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and \n     used against American troops abroad or citizens at home.\n\n  That task force was cochaired by Senator Baker, our former colleague, \nand a former White House counsel, Lloyd Cutler. The Baker-Cutler task \nforce also concluded that the limited mandate and funding falls short \nfor what is required to address adequately the threat.\n  Looking at those nonproliferation programs in the Department of \nEnergy, that task force concluded that the funding falls short of what \nis required to address adequately the threat.\n  Then we have the Department of Energy making an announcement that it \nhas become clear, the Secretary of Energy said, that even more \ncomprehensive and urgently focused effort is needed to respond to \nemerging and evolving threats, referring here to the Russian fissile \nmaterial, saying the Global Threat Reduction Initiative announced by \nSecretary Abraham at the International Atomic Energy Agency at the end \nof May would ensure that nuclear and radiological material and \nequipment did not ``fall into the hands of those with evil intentions'' \nby ``securing, relocating, or disposing of these materials or \nequipment.'' There is supposed to be $450 million that would go into \nthis effort. There is nothing, or virtually nothing, in the 2005 budget \nto address that threat.\n  The Senator from Arizona is correct that we have given the \nadministration what they asked for in their budget request. Despite the \nwords saying this is a major threat to this country, they have asked \nfor nothing. We should correct that deficiency and address the most \nserious threat we face in terms of terrorism by using some of the money \nfor these extra 10 missiles--not the first 20 but the extra 10 that are \nnow being requested--in order to address the most real, the most \ndangerous threat we face.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I do not know if that unanimous \nconsent request relates to this matter or not.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me first correct one thing I had said earlier. There \nwere two Reed amendments, both of which were based on the same \nproposition with respect to operational testing. One regarding fencing \nwe have not yet voted on, and the other one was rejected. To that \nextent I misspoke.\n  Secondly, before I propound the unanimous consent requests, let me \nmake clear to the Senator from Michigan, I am not yet aware of plans, \nas I answered my colleague. I think the Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization is working on the plans. So I do not think \nany of us are yet aware of what plans there may be with respect to \ntesting of these missiles. I do not think the plan is completed.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. In terms of launching interceptors from that test bed in \nAlaska, that would be a stunning change in\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nterms of the safety of the people of Alaska. I am sure if that plan has \nbeen made, there is a plan to launch missiles from that test site as \npart of a test, not in response to some accidental launch--and I could \nnot agree more with the Senator from Arizona, if we had missiles in the \nground and if we saw a launch come at us, we would use them in the hope \nthat they might work. I have no doubt about that. I would hope they \nwould work. It would be useful to take the time, expend the energy and \nthe money to make sure they work.\n  Nevertheless, I have no doubt if we thought they would work 1 in 10, \n1 in 1,000, or 1 in 2, we would try.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I knew if we stood here long enough, the \nSenator from Michigan and I would find something on which to agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We agree on many things, and that would surely be one of \nthem. I think we would also agree that it would be nice if we could \nexpect they would work. I think the Senator from Arizona would agree \nwith that. The greater likelihood they would work, the greater good it \nis for our Nation.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, of course that is true. I would like to \npropound some unanimous consent requests on behalf of the leader, if \nthere is no other Senator wishing to speak to this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7100-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

It is my honor to recognize the \ncontributions of this dedicated public servant.\n  Mr. Leshendok's career has spanned more than three decades and \nseveral Federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey, the \nMinerals Management Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and \nthe Bureau of Land Management. In each of these positions, he has \ncontributed tremendously to the effective and responsible management of \nour public lands and natural resources.\n  Mr. Leshendok's work as Deputy State Director of Minerals for the \nNevada BLM was particularly important to the economy and welfare of my \nState. Not only does the BLM administer almost 48 million acres of \npublic land in Nevada, it also overseas the production of 72 percent of \nour Nation's gold and silver.\n  As the leader of the BLM's largest mining law administration program, \nMr. Leshendok was responsible for the leasing and development of \ngeothermal, oil, and gas resources, the Abandoned Mine Lands program, \nand hazardous material detection and remediation. His ability to craft \neffective collaborative approaches to these important issues was a \nhallmark of his leadership at the Nevada BLM.\n  Please join me in thanking Tom Leshendok for his strong commitment to \npublic service and congratulating him on his selection for the \nDepartment of Interior's Meritorious Service Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7100-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DAVID A.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On January 25, 1999, Derek Glacken, 27, was convicted of first-degree \nmurder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the \nfatal 1996 stabbing of a man whom he believed to be gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7100-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7100-S7101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JUNETEENTH\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to bring attention to the \ncelebration of Juneteenth. Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration \ncommemorating the abolition of slavery in the United States. This day \ncelebrates African American freedom while encouraging self-development \nand respect for all cultures.\n  Throughout our history, African Americans have struggled to achieve \nequality and freedom. They have endured a legacy of slavery and \nsegregation. Through their belief in the American dream, they fought \nfor equal rights and taught the Nation to look past outward appearances \nand judge a person by their character. Their undying quest to achieve \nfreedom and equality is why I am here today: To honor the day where \nslaves in some southern States learned of their emancipation.\n  On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger went to Texas to \nproclaim emancipation to Texas slaves. This was the first time that \nslaves in Texas and other surrounding States found out about their \nemancipation. He stated, ``The people of Texas are informed that in \naccordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, \nall slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and \nrights of property between former masters and slaves, and the \nconnection heretofore existing between them becomes that between \nemployer and free laborer.''\n  Following emancipation, ex-slaves entered freedom under the most \ndifficult conditions, penniless and homeless with only the clothes on \ntheir back. They began to migrate to the north and to southern States \nlike Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma in search of better lives and a \nbetter future for their families. The descendants of these former \nslaves passed down a tradition of celebrating the emancipation \nannouncement at the end of June because of it's significance for \nAfrican Americans. The term ``Juneteenth'' reflects the inability of \nhistory to identify the exact date all slaves became free in this \ncountry. However, the importance of the event is memorialized in this \ncelebration and is often observed as a time to remember the past and \nlook to the future.\n  The first Juneteenth celebrations were political rallies used to \nteach freedmen about voting. Cakewalks,\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nbaseball games, contests and parades would come to be identified as \ntraditional parts of the celebration as well. However, from the very \nbeginning food, family and friends played central roles in these \nremembrances.\n  Many African Americans will continue this celebration through various \nactivities in their local communities. I was honored to join Arkansans \nin celebrating Juneteenth in Little Rock this past weekend, and I \nchallenge all Americans to join me in celebrating the rich history and \ncountless contributions African Americans have made in our country, to \nremember the struggles for dignity and racial equality in America and \nto commit to fighting for equality in our schools, workplaces and in \nour communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7101-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE BOSTON CELTICS--THE ``HEROES AMONG US'' AWARDS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Boston Celtics are heroes on the \nbasketball court, and they are heroes off the court as well. In 1997, \nthey established the ``Heroes Among Us'' Awards to honor outstanding \npersons in the area who have had an especially significant impact on \nthe lives of others. The award pays tribute to men and women who have \nmade a difference because of their unselfish commitment to their \ncommunity. Their extraordinary achievements take place in a wide \nvariety of fields, and are made by persons of all ages and in all walks \nof life.\n  At each home game during the basketball season, the Celtics and their \nfans pay tribute to one of the honorees in a special presentation on \nthe basketball court. So far, over 300 persons have received the \n``Heroes Among Us'' award.\n  All of us in the Kennedy family are proud that one of this year's \nawards was made to my nephew Tim Shriver. He was honored for his \nleadership of the Special Olympics, which provides training in sports \nand opportunities to participate in competitive sports for children and \nadults with mental retardation in many nations throughout the world. \nTim was honored in Boston last December during a Celtics game against \nthe Utah Jazz, and several Special Olympics athletes were part of the \nceremony on center court.\n  Massachusetts is proud of the Celtics and proud of this successful \nand inspiring awards program, which has become one of the most \nrespected such initiatives in the Nation. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record the names of the honorees for the 2003-2004 season.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Frank Kilroy (Danvers), Karen Butler and Tom Lee \n     (Brockton), Atala Esquilin (Lynn), Karen, Bob and Alex Bean \n     (Shrewsbury), Mary Soo Hoo (Boston), Caitlin Gorski \n     (Hopkinton), Chris Constantino (Plymouth), Nadine Burgeson \n     (Lakeville), Kellie Burgeson Surdis (Lakeville), Joe Lawless \n     (Lynnfield), Dr. Arnold Scheller (Milton), Jackie Jenkins-\n     Scott (Roxbury), Honorable Leslie Harris (Dorchester), Anne \n     Norton (Boston), Lieutenant Paul D.

I appreciate their \nloyalty to Kentucky and their community. The company is a shining \nexample of leadership, hard work, and compassion. They are an \ninspiration to all throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Congratulations, Kentucky Mountain Development Corporation. You are \nKentucky at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7101-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7101-S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I would like to take a \nmoment to recognize the beautiful State which I am proud to call my \nhome, West Virginia. Yesterday, June 20, was truly a day to celebrate \nour great State. One hundred and forty one years ago, West Virginia \nbecame the 35th State to join our Nation.\n  West Virginia's travel slogan ``Wild and Wonderful'' captures the \nessence of West Virginia's terrain. In reference to the spirit of our \nlandscape abundant with roaming rivers and dense forests, the early \nsettlers created the state motto: ``Mountaineers are always free.'' To \nthis day, West Virginia remains known for its breathtaking natural \nbeauty. It is a growing destination for people from around the world \ninterested in hiking, mountain biking, hunting, fishing, white water \nrafting, skiing, golf, and many other outdoor activities which take \nadvantage of the natural beauty of the West Virginia hills.\n  Visitors to the State are often impressed by our sweeping vistas, \nmountainous terrain, and undisturbed wilderness. Much of our beauty is \npreserved for the ages in several world class National and State Parks.\n  While the landscape of the Mountain State is inspiring, it is the \npeople of West Virginia who truly encapsulate the majesty and spirit of \nour State. Over the last 141 years, many different people have called \nWest Virginia home. Native Americans came here for our rich hunting \ngrounds. Civil War soldiers fought many battles on our land, diverse \nwaves of immigrants worked in our thriving industries of glass, coal, \nsteel, wood products, oil and the railroad. We have come so far over \nthe last 141 years, and yet we maintain the same sense of pride in our \nculture, people, and rolling West Virginia hills.\n  These historical influences helped to diversify our population and \ncreate the vibrant culture we enjoy today. West Virginia culture is \nfamous for its pottery, glass, history, stories, and in particular, its \nmusic. This music, including bluegrass, ballads and gospel songs, has a \nspecial tie to our culture and our people, telling of our history and \nour industry. Aside from what we produce, it is who we are that makes \nWest Virginia a place of which to be proud. We\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\nare a hard-working people, creative and sincere. The fervent, spirited \npeople of West Virginia invigorate all aspects of the greater American \nsociety and culture.\n  With the world turning to a newer high technology economy, West \nVirginia remains at the forefront with its strong contributions to \nbiometrics through its growing network of biometrics companies, \ngovernment agencies and universities. While West Virginia contributes \nin the global economy, our traditional industries of coal, steel, \ntimber, and chemicals continue proudly as the base of our economy. Some \nof our finest academic institutions offer strong programs in \nengineering, physics and medicine, which contribute to our growing \nsuccess in new fields such as biometrics technology and development. \nAlso, with the ever-expanding broadband internet, more West Virginians \nare joining the internet community. Particularly in the classroom, the \npresence of high-speed internet is keeping West Virginian students \nworldly and capable in this age of technology.\n  Now, as we stand at the gateway of the 21st Century, I am honored to \nrecognize West Virginia's 141st birthday, and I am enormously proud to \nbe a West Virginian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7102-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF ALAN MILBAUER'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I pay tribute today to Alan \nMilbauer upon his retirement as vice president of public affairs for \nAstraZeneca. His dedication has won him the respect of coworkers and \nfriends alike, along with the gratitude of many in our State. He has \nbeen, and remains, a trusted friend.\n  A native of Brooklyn, NY, Alan was born on August 30, 1943, to \nFrancis and Irving Milbauer. He received his early education in \nBrooklyn and went on to earn degrees in pharmacy and law at the \nUniversity of Connecticut in 1965 and 1968, respectively.\n  Alan has spent most of his career in the pharmaceutical industry, \nexcept for a brief experience in the field of consumer marketing \nresearch. He began his industry experience as attorney for the \nPharmaceuticals Research and Manufacturers of America, PhRMA, before \ncoming to Delaware and joining Zeneca Pharmaceuticals--then Atlas \nChemicals--in 1969. In 1976, he was appointed director of regulatory \naffairs. He became vice president of planning in 1985 and vice \npresident of marketing in 1991. Prior to the merger of Astra and \nZeneca, Alan served as vice president of external affairs for Zeneca \nPharmaceuticals.\n  As a member of the U.S. AstraZeneca leadership team, Alan's \nresponsibilities include Federal and State government affairs, \ncorporate external communications, public relations and ally \ndevelopment, corporate and community affairs, and public policy. As a \nmajor international healthcare business engaged in the research, \ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals and \nhealthcare services, Alan has provided strong leadership and served as \na role model to many. According to friends, he has been described as \nthe ``conscience'' for the company. He has long sought to ensure that \nAstraZeneca was mindful of its corporate responsibility to the \ncommunity. Alan brought the human side to the corporate world. He also \nplayed a role in helping bring AstraZeneca's United States headquarters \nto Delaware during my years as Governor.\n  Alan serves as a board director for the Delaware Theatre Company, \nDelaware Public Policy Institute, and is a trustee of the University of \nthe Sciences in Philadelphia. He is also a member of the board of \ndirectors of the Vox Medical Center for Patient Education and Health \nLiteracy, and is a member of the Connecticut Bar. Alan's leisure \ninterests include travel, theater, reading, and playing golf.\n  Alan and his wife of 37 years, Nancy, live in Wilmington, DE. They \nhave three children, Karen, Stephen and Jennifer, and two \ngrandchildren, twins Jacob and Rachel.\n  Through Alan's efforts, he has made a real difference in the lives of \nthousands of individuals and enhanced the quality of life for our \nState. Upon his retirement, he will leave behind a legacy of commitment \nto public service for both his children and grandchildren and for \nothers to follow. I thank him for the friendship that we share, and I \ncongratulate him on a remarkable and distinguished career. I wish him \nand his family only the very best in all that lies ahead for each of \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7102-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4567.

A bill to reduce and prevent childhood obesity by \nencouraging schools and school districts to develop and implement \nlocal, school-based programs designed to reduce and prevent childhood \nobesity, promote increased physical activity, and improve nutritional \nchoices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, last Thursday, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention announced that smoking among high school \nstudents has dropped to its lowest level in more than a decade. As a \nheart and lung surgeon, as one who has seen the travesty of smoking and \nthe devastation it causes in people's lungs and on their heart, this is \ngreat news. We are making great strides in this battle against smoking, \nespecially in the teenage years.\n  Fewer students now say they have never tried cigarettes. The CDC \ngives part of the credit to effective antismoking media campaigns and \nantismoking education in the classroom. I mention this demonstrated \nsuccess, because it energizes us in the battle against an issue that is \nequally important and, in fact, actually growing among young people, \nand that is childhood obesity.\n  The CDC report demonstrates that aggressive education can steer kids \naway from harmful behaviors and toward making healthier choices. While \nfood is not exactly like cigarettes, one cannot just say no. Childhood \nobesity is a serious public health threat and a threat that is growing. \nIn fact, the CDC reports that obesity is on its way to surpassing \nsmoking as the leading preventable killer in the United States of \nAmerica, and that is why Senator Wyden and I today are introducing a \nbill called the Childhood Obesity Reduction Act.\n  We believe early intervention with community and school support at \nthe grassroots level is key to preventing lifelong obesity and the \nobesity-related illnesses that result. Ten percent of American children \nare clinically obese. More than 30 percent of American children are \noverweight, and we know that overweight and obese children have a lower \nquality of life than their healthy peers. They suffer significantly \nhigher rates of type II diabetes and cardiovascular--that is, heart--\nand blood vessel disease, including heart attack, stroke, and \ncongestive heart failure. Later in life, they are more likely to suffer \nfrom lung disease or pulmonary disease complications like sleep apnea, \nmusculoskeletal problems--that is, bone and muscle problems--which \ninclude degenerative joint disease and disk disease, and also are more \nlikely to suffer psychosocial problems, including poor self-image, \ndepression, lack of self-esteem, and isolation.\n  A recent study published in Pediatrics Magazine found that obese boys \nand girls were two times more likely than normal weight children to be \nintentionally left out of social activities. After adolescence, \noverweight kids have a 70-percent chance of becoming overweight or \nobese adults.\n  The good news is that we can reverse these trends. We need to reverse \nthese trends, and we can reverse these trends. Our kids simply should \nnot have to suffer from a condition that is preventable and treatable \nbased on what we know today. The best way is to start in those earliest \nof years.\n  The bill Senator Wyden and I are introducing today encourages schools \nto promote physical activity and to teach children how to make healthy \nfood decisions. It also sets up a public-private partnership foundation \nto fund innovative projects that improve eating and exercise habits in \nschool.\n  The Childhood Obesity Reduction Act authorizes $2.2 million for a \nCongressional council on childhood obesity. The council will seek out \nmodel anti-obesity programs in both public and private schools and will \naward these schools with the Congressional Achievement Award. After 2 \nyears of selecting model programs for other schools to follow, the \ncouncil will create a public-private partnership called the National \nFoundation for the Prevention and Reduction of Childhood Obesity. The \nfoundation will give challenge awards to schools that implement those \nmodel anti-obesity programs.\n  In closing, we know that kids need to run, jump, and play. We know \nthat is good for their bodies. We know it is good for their spirits. \nThey need nutritional food that gives them energy, the type of food \nthat really does keep them sharp. They need a school environment that \nencourages healthy habits, vigor, expenditure of energy, and vitality.\n\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership in this \nimportant public health effort. I urge my colleagues to be a part of \nthe solution and am delighted to be able to join with my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, in submitting and ultimately passing this legislation, \nall of which will help Americans keep fit.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the majority leader has given an \nexcellent statement with respect to this issue, and I want to express \nmy appreciation to him for the chance to make this yet another \nbipartisan kind of effort.\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\n  If ever there were a cause that ought to bring the Senate together, \nfighting childhood obesity is exactly the kind of thing where we ought \nto be teaming up. I thank my colleague for his excellent statement and \nfor the chance to work with him.\n  The majority leader and I believe our legislation will help launch a \nnational mobilization to reduce and prevent the epidemic of childhood \nobesity and help our kids grow up healthy in America. Today, kids are \neating greater quantities of less healthy foods. They are exercising \nless and less.\n  Childhood obesity has doubled during the past 30 years. In my home \nState, it is far and away one of our most serious emerging health \nproblems. Ten percent of the 8th graders and 7 percent of the 11th \ngraders in my State are overweight. So, in my view, what we have is \nnothing short of an epidemic of kids who are not as healthy as they \ncould be and they need to be and not as healthy as children were in \nprevious generations. These kids today have a host of health problems \nthat promise to worsen if nothing is done to change them.\n  I was particularly pleased that the majority leader highlighted some \nof the concerns we want to tackle. The situation with respect to type \nII diabetes is completely unacceptable. This is an illness that used to \nbe virtually unheard of in children. Yet the increase in this disease \nis literally on a parallel with the documented track of an increase in \nchildhood obesity. One-quarter of children 5 to 10 years of age show \nearly warning signs for health problems such as elevated cholesterol \nand high blood pressure. Doctors at the Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity Obesity Clinic say that referrals of youngsters as young as \n6 are becoming virtually routine.\n  We are not going to see this change happen by osmosis. It is going to \ncome about because adults working with parents, schools, and \ncommunities provide some real leadership, and that is what this \nbipartisan legislation seeks to do. We recognize in this bill that \nthere is a fair amount of good work going on in our communities \nalready, and we recognize this is an issue that needs to be addressed \nnot from Washington, DC, with a one-size-fits-all approach, but it \nneeds to be addressed in our schools and in our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  What we seek to do is to encourage this kind of bottom-up approach, \nwhere schools and communities across the country, relying on leaders in \ntheir own hometowns, consulting with experts here from the Congress, \nwill get out state-of-the-art information with respect to making sure \nwe are using all the tools that are out there to fight obesity. We are \ngoing to be consulting and coordinating this effort with the \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness so that both sides of the \nequation, nutrition and exercise, are addressed in the fight against \nchildhood obesity.\n  We have also concluded it is absolutely critical to use state-of-the-\nart technology to get out this information. We have proposed a Web site \nbe created to link schools to community groups and leaders who are \nalready working to help kids stay healthy. With a few clicks of the \n``enter'' button, it will be possible for kids in Des Moines to find \nout what the best approaches are for kids, say, in the rural West.\n  We believe using this kind of technology is going to allow us to use \nscarce resources, at a time when we are all concerned about the \ndeficit, to better meet the health needs of children in our \ncommunities. Whether it is enlisting local organic farmers to make \ntheir produce available to schools or helping our kids become more \nphysically active, what we propose in this bipartisan legislation is a \nwide variety of options for schools and communities to work together.\n  I am very pleased that an important feature of the legislation, as \nnoted by the majority leader, is the foundation that would allow us to \ncontinue the work of our Congressional Council, which would end once \nthe foundation is established.\n  Finally, it seems to me the point of this legislation is to target \nthe area where we can make the most difference and that is our schools. \nSchools, of course, are where the children are. It is where they spend \na lot of time. It is a place where they eat, and very often several \nmeals a day. If children can learn in school how to balance their \nchoices, wherever they go and whenever they are confronted with a \nvariety of food options, they can make better choices for themselves.\n  I see the distinguished chair of the Armed Services Committee is back \non the floor. He has an extensive schedule, I know. I don't want to \nhold this up. I want to wrap this up by saying to the majority leader \nhow much I have enjoyed working with him. We have long felt that health \ncare is one of the issues that can bring the Senate together. If ever \nthere was a health cause that requires what I think is appropriately \ncalled a national mobilization in our schools and our communities, \nfighting childhood obesity is it.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Childhood Obesity Reduction \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, obesity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading \n     preventable cause of death.\n       (2) In 1999, 13 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and \n     14 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the United \n     States were overweight. This prevalence has nearly tripled \n     for adolescents in the past 2 decades.\n       (3) Risk factors for heart disease, such as high \n     cholesterol and high blood pressure, occur with increased \n     frequency in overweight children and adolescents compared to \n     children with a healthy weight.\n       (4) Type 2 diabetes, previously considered an adult \n     disease, has increased dramatically in children and \n     adolescents. Overweight and obesity are closely linked to \n     type 2 diabetes.\n       (5) Obesity in children and adolescents is generally caused \n     by a lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, or \n     a combination of the 2, with genetics and lifestyle both \n     playing important roles in determining a child's weight.\n       (6) Overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of \n     becoming overweight or obese adults.\n       (7) The 2001 report ``The Surgeon General's Call to Action \n     to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity'' suggested \n     that obesity and its complications were already costing the \n     United States $117,000,000,000 annually.\n       (8) Substantial evidence shows that public health risks can \n     be reduced through increased public awareness and community \n     involvement.\n       (9) Congress needs to challenge students, teachers, school \n     administrators, and local communities to voluntarily \n     participate in the development and implementation of \n     activities to successfully reduce and prevent childhood \n     obesity.\n\n          TITLE I--CONGRESSIONAL COUNCIL ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal \ninterests in the State of North Dakota; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am introducing the Water \nInfrastructure Revitalization Act, which authorizes $60 million through \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist communities in North Dakota \nwith water supply and treatment projects.\n  Imagine if you went to turn on your kitchen faucet one day and no \nwater came out. This scenario became true for thousands in the \ncommunities of Fort Yates, Cannonball, and Porcupine just days before \nThanksgiving last year. The loss of drinking water forced the closure \nof schools, the hospital and tribal offices for days. About 170 miles \nupstream, the community of Parshall faces similar water supply \nchallenges as the water level on Lake Sakakawea continues to drop, \nleaving its intake high and dry. These and other communities in the \nState have faced significant expenditures in extending their intakes to \nensure a continued supply of water. In addition, the city of Mandan \nfaces the prospect of constructing a new horizontal well intake because \nchanges in sediment load and flow as a result of the backwater effects \nof the Oahe Reservoir have caused significant siltation problems that \nrestrict flow into the intake. These examples barely scratch the \nsurface of the problems faced by many North Dakota communities in \nmaintaining a safe, reliable water supply.\n  Since 1999, the Corps of Engineers has been authorized to design and \nconstruct water-related infrastructure projects in several different \nStates including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Montana. The State of North \nDakota confronts water infrastructure challenges that are just as \ndifficult as those in these other States. In fact, many of these \nchallenges are caused directly by the Corps of Engineers' operations of \nthe Missouri River dams. As a result, it is only appropriate that the \nCorps be part of the solution to North Dakota's water needs.\n  The Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act would provide important \nsupplemental funding to assist North Dakota communities with water-\nrelated infrastructure repairs. Under the Act, communities could use \nthe funding for wastewater treatment, water supply facilities, \nenvironmental restoration and surface water resource protection.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\nProjects would be cost shared, with 75 percent Federal funding and 25 \npercent non-Federal in most instances. However, the bill reduces the \nfinancial burden on local communities if necessary to ensure that water \nrates do not exceed the national affordability criteria developed by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  This bill is not intended to compete with or take away funds for the \nconstruction of rural water projects under the Dakota Water Resources \nAct. Instead, it is meant to provide important supplemental funding for \ncommunities that are not able to receive funding from the Dakota Water \nResources Act. I am pleased that the North Dakota Rural Water Systems \nAssociation has recognized the need for additional water project \nfunding and endorsed this bill. It is my hope that this authorization \nwill be included as part of the Water Resources Development Act that \nwill be considered this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7111-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 385--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n         CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nDaschle, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 385\n\n       Whereas 2004 marks the 40th anniversary of congressional \n     passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et \n     seq.);\n       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the result of \n     decades of struggle and sacrifice of many Americans who \n     fought for equality and justice;\n       Whereas generations of Americans of every background \n     supported Federal legislation to eliminate discrimination \n     against African-Americans;\n       Whereas a civil rights movement developed to achieve the \n     goal of equal rights for all Americans;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy, on June 11, 1963, \n     proposed in a nationally televised address that Congress pass \n     civil rights legislation to address the problem of invidious \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas a broad coalition of civil rights, labor, and \n     religious organizations created national support for civil \n     rights legislation, culminating in a 1963 march on \n     Washington;\n       Whereas during consideration of the legislation involved, \n     Congress added a historic prohibition against discrimination \n     based on sex;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and \n     President Lyndon Johnson signed the Act into law on July 2, \n     1964;\n       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964, among other things, \n     prohibited the use of Federal funds in a discriminatory \n     fashion, barred unequal application of voter registration \n     requirements, encouraged the desegregation of public schools \n     and authorized the Attorney General to file suits to force \n     the desegregation, banned discrimination in hotels, motels, \n     restaurants, theaters, and all other places of public \n     accommodation engaged in interstate commerce, and established \n     the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;\n       Whereas title VII of the Act not only prohibited \n     discrimination by employers on the basis of race, color, \n     religion, and national origin, but sex as well, thereby \n     recognizing the national problem of sex discrimination in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas Congress has amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n     from time to time, with major changes that strengthened the \n     Act;\n       Whereas the amendments made to the Act by the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 made changes that, among \n     other things, gave the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission litigation authority, thereby giving the \n     Commission the right to sue nongovernment respondents, made \n     State and local governments subject to title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, made educational institutions subject to \n     title VII of the Act, and made the Federal Government subject \n     to title VII, thereby prohibiting Federal executive agencies \n     from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, \n     sex, and national origin;\n       Whereas the amendments made to the Act and other civil \n     rights legislation amended or added by the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1991 clarified congressional intent regarding the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (in light of several contrary Supreme \n     Court decisions rendered in the late 1980s) and allowed for \n     the recovery of fees and costs in lawsuits in which the \n     plaintiffs prevailed, for jury trials, and for the recovery \n     of compensatory and punitive damages in intentional \n     employment discrimination cases, and also expanded title VII \n     protections to include congressional and high level political \n     appointees; and\n       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the most \n     comprehensive civil rights legislation in the Nation's \n     history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 386\n\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner \n     were civil rights organizers who participated in the Freedom \n     Summer Project organized by the Council of Federated \n     Organizations to register African Americans in the Deep South \n     to vote;\n       Whereas on June 21, 1964, after leaving the scene of a \n     firebombed church in Longdale, Mississippi, Andrew Goodman, \n     James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner were murdered by members \n     of the Klu Klux Klan who opposed their efforts to establish \n     equal rights for African Americans;\n       Whereas June 21, 2004, is the 40th anniversary of the day \n     Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner \n     sacrificed their lives in the fight against racial and social \n     injustice while working to guarantee the right to vote for \n     every citizen of the United States;\n       Whereas the deaths of the 3 men brought attention to the \n     struggle to guarantee equal rights for African Americans, \n     which led to the passage of monumental civil rights \n     legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public \n     Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 241) and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n     (Public Law 89-110, 79 Stat. 437);\n       Whereas the courage and sacrifice of Andrew Goodman, James \n     Chaney, and Michael Schwerner should encourage all citizens, \n     and especially young people, of the United States to dedicate \n     themselves to the ideals of freedom, justice, and equality; \n     and\n       Whereas citizens throughout the United States will \n     commemorate the 40th anniversary of the deaths of Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner to honor the \n     contributions they made to the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of June 21, 1964, the \n     day civil rights organizers Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and \n     Michael Schwerner gave their lives; and\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to observe \n     the anniversary of the deaths of the 3 men by committing \n     themselves to the fundamental principles of freedom, \n     equality, and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/21/senate-section/article/S7111-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3459.

While many of the \ncomponent agencies could--at least temporarily--remain in their current \nlocations, there had to be new space for the Department's leadership \nand new programs. The Navy had previously been providing space at the \nNebraska Avenue complex to the President's Office of Homeland Security, \nand the administration subsequently decided that the site should be \nused as a headquarters for the new Department for the immediate future. \nDHS already has some of its headquarters operations at the site, and \nplans to move additional staff to the property once the Navy has \nfinished moving out. It is vital that DHS be able to move ahead with \nconsolidating its headquarters operations and renovating the complex to \nmeet its needs. It is also critical that the Navy be fairly compensated \nand that its displaced operations be able to move into new facilities. \nThis legislation will allow all this to take place. This legislation \nformalizes the transfer of the property and provides for a payment \nmechanism for the Navy's temporary and permanent relocation costs. GSA, \nin keeping with its traditional responsibilities, will own the property \nand manage it for DHS, which shall be a tenant there.\n  There has been a question about precisely how, under this \nlegislation, to provide payment to the Navy, and which parties should \nbear which costs. Therefore, I am pleased to submit for the Record a \nletter from Joshua Bolten, Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, that specifically clarifies this issue. DHS shall provide the \nNavy with compensation for its initial moving and interim relocation \ncosts for the first year. This amount is already budgeted for fiscal \nyear 2005. Meanwhile, OMB has agreed that GSA is the proper entity to \nsupply funds to compensate the Navy for permanent relocation expenses. \nThis legislation will allow GSA to provide those funds and, as this \nletter specifically makes clear, OMB pledges that it, on behalf of the \nAdministration, will request adequate funds in the GSA budget after the \nfirst year for GSA to do so. This responds to my concern that forcing \nDHS to pay an undue share of the Navy's relocation expenses would \ndangerously burden\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\nlimited resources for critical homeland security programs. I appreciate \nthe OMB's and the Administration's efforts in clarifying its intentions \non this matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I share the Senator's concern that the \nbill that is before us requires a nondefense agency to pay for the \npermanent relocation of the Navy. Homeland security dollars are scarce. \nThe Department of Homeland Security should not be forced to use dollars \nthat should be used for securing our ports or for securing our mass \ntransit systems to pay for a new Navy facility. With the Senator's \ncooperation, we have asked for a commitment from the administration \nthat these costs will be requested through the General Services \nAdministration, which will own the property, rather than the Department \nof Homeland Security. I am pleased that the Administration has provided \nthis assurance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter on this matter from Joshua Bolten, Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2004.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: The purpose of this letter is to \n     explain the Administration's plan to transfer administrative \n     jurisdiction of the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC) from the \n     Navy to the General Services Administration (GSA) so that the \n     facility can be used to house the consolidated headquarters \n     of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n       Once the Congress allows GSA to take control of the \n     property, the Navy will relocate its operations from the NAC \n     to other facilities. Based on long-standing Comptroller \n     General opinions, the Department of Homeland Security will \n     reimburse the Navy for its initial move to a replacement \n     facility and the first year of rent at that new location. \n     Combined, the first-year costs are estimated at $26 million. \n     This amount has been requested in the FY 2005 DHS budget and \n     is included in the appropriations bills for the Department of \n     Homeland Security currently under consideration by the House \n     and Senate.\n       After the Navy's first year of occupancy at its new \n     location, GSA will be responsible to reimburse the Navy for \n     acquisition of an subsequent moves to permanent facilities. \n     Once estimates are developed for these costs, the \n     Administration plans to request the funding in future budgets \n     through the GSA Federal Buildings Fund.\n       Consolidating the headquarters operations of DHS is \n     necessary to ensure the DHS can efficiently execute its \n     mission to protect the American people from terrorist attack. \n     To that end, the Administration has proposed legislation that \n     would authorize the Navy to transfer the NAC to GSA and \n     authorize the relocation of Navy personnel. H.R. 4322, as \n     passed by the House of Representatives, would accomplish \n     these goals, and we look forward to working with the Senate \n     to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joshua B. Bolten,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.
