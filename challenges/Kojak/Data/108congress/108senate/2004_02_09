Mr. President, I wish to comment on the recent Medicare \nbill we passed. Last year--this being February--President Bush and \nCongress made good on our promise to strengthen and expand Medicare for \ntoday's seniors and individuals with disabilities. The bill, called the \nMedicare Modernization Act of 2003, does represent the most significant \nimprovement to Medicare in two generations.\n  The reason I wish to comment on it today is that as a product of the \ndebate and passage of this legislation, we are starting to see, even \nright now, impressive results.\n  Very simply, we said the program would give seniors better health \ncare at lower out-of-pocket cost and give\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nseniors and individuals with disabilities more choices. That is exactly \nwhat the bill is doing.\n  We said the bill would strengthen the program and increase \nflexibility and choice, and, indeed, that is exactly what is happening.\n  Dozens of Medicare, managed care companies just recently announced--\nabout 10 days ago--that in 3 short weeks, they are going to increase \nbenefits, enhance benefits; that they are going to reduce or even \neliminate premiums altogether; and that they are going to expand their \nservice areas. They tell us they are doing all of this as a direct \nresult of this Medicare bill.\n  For example, Aetna plans to cut its Medicare+Choice premiums by up to \n50 percent to seniors. The action by Aetna will reduce inpatient care \nfees and physician copayments.\n  In New York City, Oxford Health Plans is boosting its annual limit on \nbrand-name drug coverage from $250 and $500 up to $1,200. That is more \ncoverage.\n  Colorado's three Medicare HMOs, meanwhile, will drop monthly \ninsurance premiums by as much as 50 percent. That is less out-of-pocket \ncosts for seniors.\n  Colorado's PacifiCare, for example, will offer prescription drug \ncoverage to seniors who didn't have it before. That is new coverage, \nbetter health care, and then they will add brand-name coverage to many \npolicies.\n  In Miami, FL, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans to double its coverage for \nbrand-name drugs. In Broward County, it will add brand-name coverage to \nits current generic-only plan, and it will drop its monthly premium \naltogether: Better coverage, lower out-of-pocket expenditures.\n  When it comes to more comprehensive coverage care, seniors in Tampa \nwith private plans can expect to get new benefits, such as free dental \ncare and reimbursement for transportation to the doctor.\n  I mention all this because it is only the beginning. Nationally, 5 \nmillion seniors with HMO coverage are expected to enjoy better \nbenefits, lower out-of-pocket costs, and expanded options. And this \nwill only grow with time. This is only the beginning.\n  Not only are these improvements on the way but also we have the \nprescription discount card that will be available in just a very few \nmonths, in June. This spring, seniors will be able to use these new \ndiscount cards to get discounts of 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, \nor 25 percent off their prescription drugs.\n  For seniors living around the poverty level or up to 135 percent of \nthe poverty level, they will get, in addition to the prescription drug \ncard, an additional $600 in coverage to help pay these drug bills. That \nis on top of the discount. This is immediate help. This is immediate \nhelp to those who need it the most.\n  Already, private companies have submitted more than 100 applications \nto be able to participate in the discount drug card process. Immediate \nrelief from high medication costs is only months away.\n  I mention this because we hear a lot of the opponents to the bill \ngrumble. Even in the various elections and campaigns going on across \nthe country, we look at what appear to be attempts of very partisan \npolitics trying to gain political points in an election year. I wanted \nto mention this real progress that is already being made because it \nshows that at least the concept of the approach of a public/private \npartnership--which is what this Medicare law is all about--is beginning \nto work, where we take the very best of the public sector and marry it \nto the very best of the private sector.\n  Older Americans who are happy with their immediate care coverage do \nnot need to do anything. They can keep exactly what they have today. In \nthe bill, those who need it the most are going to get the most help. \nLower income seniors, people at the lowest income brackets, and \nindividuals with disabilities will pay almost nothing for their \nprescription drug coverage. Seniors who have very high catastrophic \ncosts, costs that for the most part they did not expect, will no longer \nhave to go bankrupt to get those prescription drugs, the most powerful \ntool in American medicine today.\n  Millions of seniors with no current coverage will see their \nprescription drug costs reduced, on average, by about 50 percent. So we \nsee better health care and lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors who \nare listening to me at this juncture, and they will see more choices of \ncoverage that better suit their individual needs.\n  Yes, the Medicare Modernization Act is expanding these choices and \nopportunities to obtain quality health care. This bill includes \npreventive care in a substantive way for the first time in the history \nof Medicare. For the first time ever in Medicare, we are offering \ndisease management for chronic illnesses such as Parkinson's and \nAlzheimer's disease. It also takes a number of steps to improve the \noverall quality of care available to seniors.\n  We do need to continue to educate both ourselves and the American \npeople about the progress that is being made to date. We will continue \nto work with organizations such as AARP and organizations of nurses, \ndoctors, hospitals, and patients to really get the news out as this \nprogram unfolds. We will make sure that every senior who is entitled to \nthese new drug discounts I mentioned, and who have the availability of \nthat improved access, find out about it so that they indeed can take \nadvantage of these improvements.\n  From time to time, I will come to the floor to comment on the \nprogress that is being made as this program unfolds.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the current \nstatus of the highway bill and the related debate about the budgetary \nimplications of it and the budget proposal made by the administration \nover the course of the last week.\n  This is our second week of debate on the highway bill. I find myself \nexpressing the hope, as the majority leader just did, that we can \nfinish our work on the bill this week. This bill is long overdue. Many \nof us hoped we could have passed it last fall. We are told that the \nresult of not having passed it means a loss of over 90,000 jobs so far.\n  We are also told that if we pass this bill soon, we could create \nnearly a million new jobs. So the economic implications could not be \nmore consequential.\n  We also understand the difficulties our country faces with regard to \nits own infrastructure. We are told we have an infrastructure deficit \nof hundreds of billions of dollars, which is causing more congestion, \nmore pile-ups, more time en route, more commuting, than at any other \ntime in our Nation's history.\n  So with the infrastructure deficit, and with the need to create jobs, \nI cannot think of a more important bill than this one. I hope we can \ncontinue to demonstrate some real movement as we work to complete this \ndebate sometime soon.\n  The bill's managers are in the Chamber and we are prepared to \nentertain amendments. I hope we can get on with the substantive \ndiscussion and consideration of whatever amendments could be offered.\n  I am troubled by those who argue that this bill is too expensive. I \ndid not hear that debate when we were discussing how much to commit to \nIraq over the course of this fiscal year. This country has now spent \n$167 billion in Iraq, with no offsets. I did not hear one comment from \npeople on either side of the aisle about how expensive that bill was.\n  There are proposals in the President's budget to make the tax cuts \nfor those at the top of our income scales permanent. CBO estimates that \nwill double the size of our deficit over the course of the next 10 \nyears. We now expect a deficit of $600 billion and we are told we are \ngoing to be ringing up a debt of a million dollars a minute. According \nto the Budget Committee, the debt will increase at $1 million a minute. \nSo there is legitimate concern for how much we are spending and how \nmuch we are not taking in.\n  I find it amazing, this selective process of deciding which ought to \nbe pared\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nback and which ought to be provided without any offsets whatsoever. \nThere are tax cuts of $2 trillion over 10 years with no offsets. Iraq, \nas important as it is, a commitment to this country and to our efforts \nabroad, has no offsets. Highway construction, creating a million new \njobs, has to be pared back. We are told all of the discretionary \nspending in this year's budget could be eliminated, every single \ndollar, with no money for education, health care, highways, or \ninfrastructure of any kind, and we would still have a $150 billion \ndeficit in this year's budget.\n  As I look at the decisions and the choices made by this \nadministration, there is a $140 million loss in the funding for \nconservation efforts, which, in a State with fragile lands such as \nSouth Dakota, is a big deal. We lose thousands of acres every year to \nwind erosion. Conservation is vital, and to cut back $140 million in 1 \nyear alone means we are going to lose a lot more. This budget the \nPresident proposed a week ago represents a $3.9 billion cut in aid to \nsmall towns and rural communities, $3.9 billion in losses that would \notherwise go to improving the economic circumstances of small town main \nstreet. That, too, in the interest of balancing a budget that is \nlopsidedly in favor of foreign policy, tax policy, and against the \npriorities of policies at home. Even the basic programs to provide \nwater and sewer services have been cut in the President's budget.\n  About two hundred million dollars in grants, to small cities and \ntowns, that provide water and sewer assistance were cut in this budget. \nSo I simply say that the priorities represented by some during the \ndebate on the highway bill, as well as the priorities reflected in this \nbudget, are not the priorities I hear when I go home to South Dakota, \nnot the priorities I hear when I talk to those who are concerned, as I \nam, about the implications of the extraordinary deficit created over \nthe course of the last 3 years.\n  The debt, and the incredible debt service we are paying, will be \nsomething my children and grandchildren will pay. We had a projected \nsurplus of over $5.5 trillion 3 years ago. Now we have a projected debt \nof over $3.9 trillion, a shift of about $9 trillion in 3 years.\n  We are told that to pay it back requires $3 for every $1 we have \nborrowed. What is amazing is we have gone to the Social Security bank \nand we have taken all of that, we have gone to the Medicare bank and we \nhave taken all of that, so now we are going to the banks of the Chinese \nand the Japanese and the Taiwanese and South Koreans and we are \nborrowing at rates unprecedented to make up for the debt that we are \naccruing at $1 million a minute.\n  We ought to have a good debate about the budget. We ought to get this \njob done, this highway bill, so we can move on to other important \nmatters. But I must say, I can't think of anything more important than \nfinishing this bill, than committing the resources to create those \njobs, to deal with at least one of the deficits we have in this \ncountry, the infrastructure deficit. If we do that well, we can turn, \nhopefully in a bipartisan way, to address these other challenges before \nthe end of this session.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me thank all the Members who had their \nstaff come down, and some Members came down over the weekend, brought \ntheir amendments, and met with my staff and met with Senator Jeffords' \nstaff and I believe with Senator Reid's staff. We got into a good \ndiscussion on the various amendments. We discussed with them our \namendments. I am pleased with the response of those Members who \nunderstand how important it is to pass this legislation and have come \nto us in the week that this bill has been on the floor.\n  To date, I believe we have met with about 30 Member offices. We are \nall looking forward to working hard to accommodate the needs of these \noffices with as many amendments as possible. I encourage anyone out \nthere who has amendments to bring them down, talk about them, and let's \nget some of this debate started.\n  The chairman, ranking member of the full committee of the \nTransportation Subcommittee--we are all ready to work with those \nMembers.\n  I wish to take a moment to congratulate Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus for their work on the finance portion of this legislation. They \nhave done a tremendous job in meeting the financial needs of this bill \nwithout increasing taxes or deficit spending. They have also brought \nintegrity back to the highway trust fund and to the commitment we made \nto the American people.\n  The trust fund is, in essence, a user-fee-based program. You pay a \ngas tax and that money is then used for transportation purposes. \nUnfortunately, the trust fund has been used for many years for other \npurposes, including shifting the burden of tax policies from the \ngeneral revenue to the trust fund. These tax policy benefits have \nnothing to do with highway use and should not burden the trust fund.\n  I look at this, and I have said it many time before, as a moral \nissue. We tell people when they pay--and they don't mind paying new \ntaxes, even higher taxes. They are willing to pay the taxes because \nthey want to have better roads and they assume that money is going to \ngo into building roads. But it is not. They have been raiding the \nhighway trust fund now for as long as I can remember.\n  So the Finance Committee sought to fix this unfairness to the \ntaxpayer and has come up with a proposal to right this wrong.\n\n  Included in these proposals is a repeal of the partial exemption for \nethanol-blended fuels. The tax benefit for ethanol, like nearly all \nenergy production incentives, is transferred to the general fund \nthrough a tax credit. The same effect is applied to refunds for special \ncategories of users such as State and local governments. These are \nchanges that never should have been necessary. We should no more raid \nthe highway trust fund than we should raid the Social Security trust \nfund. These are commitments made to the American people.\n  However, by bringing integrity back to the trust fund, the general \nfund lost a source of revenue, albeit a source that never should have \nbeen used in the first place. So in order to avoid deficit spending, \nChairman Grassley closed a number of loopholes in the Tax Code and kept \nthe general fund whole--in other words, no deficit spending.\n  There are those who have questioned the manner in which this was \ndone, but I trust the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee and take them at their word. They should be congratulated. I \nam here to thank both of them.\n  Because of the work of the Finance Committee, we have a bill before \nus that will provide over 2 million new jobs to repair our Nation's \ninfrastructure and do so without deficit spending.\n  I think it is very important to keep talking about this. There is not \na Member in here who cannot remember at\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\none time or another raiding the trust fund, to take some of this money \nto put it in toward reducing the deficit. That was done in the 1990s.\n  This is an opportunity we have, not just to pass a very aggressive \nhighway bill and provide the jobs that go with that but also correct \nthis wrong that has been out there for a long period of time.\n  Let me emphasize, we invite Members to come down and bring their \namendments. While we cannot be introducing them and voting on them \nright now, we can still get a lot of the discussion out of the way. I \nthink it is very important we do so, now.\n  Let me defend the formula. There have been a lot of people coming \ndown and objecting to the way it was put together. I remind my \ncolleagues what happened in TEA-21. I was here for TEA-21, here in the \nSenate, here in the committee working with my good friend, Senator \nJeffords. We watched the way that formula worked.\n  In that, they had a minimum guarantee program. A minimum guarantee \nprogram is nothing but a chart; it is called section 1104. It took all \nthe States and put a percentage down. As soon as they got 60 people \nhappy, they figured: there is our 60 votes--and this is no way to do \nit.\n  Instead of that, we looked at donor status. We have several States \nsuch as my State of Oklahoma that have been in a donor status for many \nyears. We looked at States that are fast growing States. We put a \nceiling in there, so they could not get so much of the money there \nwould not be anything remaining for other States. We have a floor in \nthere. I think we have done something that is very good.\n  I guess you could say there are four goals that interest a lot of \npeople, one being the donor States, those of us who have been donor \nStates for so long we can remember when we were 70, 75 percent donors. \nISTEA came along and brought the floor up to 80. Then TEA-21 brought it \nto 90.5. This is going to bring every State, all 50 States, at the end \nof this 6-year period, or by the end of that period, up to 95 percent. \nThat is very reasonable. It is a very ambitious goal but one with which \nI think most of us, I am absolutely convinced, agree.\n  We have introduced streamlining measures in this bill that will allow \nus to use the dollars we have and use them to build more roads, to do \nmore in a shorter period of time.\n  We are concentrating on safety. We have not concentrated on safety as \nmuch as we should have in the past. I know the senior Senator from \nVirginia is one who has been concerned about safety for a long period \nof time and is very pleased with a lot of the provisions that we have \nin this bill.\n  We haven't really focused on freight movement until this bill came \nalong. So we are getting into all of these areas.\n  I just hope our colleagues understand that Senator Jeffords, Senator \nReid, Senator Bond, and I have been working on this bill for over a \nyear. That is a long time. Obviously, you will never have a formula \nthat makes everybody happy but you can certainly have one that is fair. \nAnd we have achieved for the first time in the history of this process \nwhat I consider to be a very fair formula.\n  I would like to ask if Senator Jeffords has any comments he would \nlike to make at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I do.\n  Mr. President, S. 1072 will send billions of dollars to the States. \nIt provides the resources to maintain the transportation infrastructure \nthat we use and enjoy every day. Literally hundreds of thousands of \njobs are at stake. It is imperative that we pass this bill this week.\n  Our staff has worked diligently for many months to prepare this \ncomprehensive proposal. They have addressed concerns raised by various \nMembers. It is time for us to complete this bill and send it to the \nHouse.\n  I would like to continue the discussion I began last week and speak \nfor a few minutes about some of the key provisions of the \ntransportation bill. As I have mentioned in earlier statements, our \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee conducted a very thorough \nhearing process as part of our preparations of S. 1072.\n  A consistent theme from those hearings was that the national \ntransportation program has worked well over the last 12 years, \nfollowing the principles set forth in ISTEA and enjoying the funding \nguarantees established in TEA-21.\n  We therefore sought to refine rather than revise the program. A key \nreflection of that decision is the pattern of resource allocation in \nthe bill.\n  We grew each of the core programs--interstate maintenance, national \nhighway system, bridge, surface transportation, and congestion \nmitigation and air quality improvement--in proportion to its funding in \ncurrent law. We could have played politics with these funding \nallocations, but we chose to maintain the overall balance of the \nprogram.\n  Also based on consistent testimony from our many witnesses, we \nretained the flexibility that has become a hallmark of the surface \ntransportation program.\n  Rather than make political adjustments in Washington to suit the \nneeds of an individual State or region, we yield to State and local \nofficials, working through an open planning process, to move funds \namong the core programs as best fits their unique and individual needs.\n  Further, under current law and reinforced in S. 1072, we permit money \nto be ``flexed'' among the various transport modes--highways, transit, \nbicycles, pedestrians, intermodal transfers, and rail.\n  By maintaining balance among the core programs along with flexibility \non program and modal spending at the State and local level, we seek to \nfoster a more balanced and ``right fit'' outcome on the ground.\n  The right combination of investments will vary from place to place. \nAnd a single solution--roads only or transit only--is likely to be a \npoor fit for a diverse and dynamic modern American community.\n  As I traveled our Nation over the past 2 years, I saw intermodalism \non the rise. In place after place, the solution to traffic congestion \nand the solution to freight mobility combined roadway and rail \ninvestments with improved operations.\n  The balance and flexibility in S. 1072 will be essential to support \nthese complex and ambitious solutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first let me thank the ranking member of \nthe committee for all the hard work and effort he has been put into \nthis bill.\n  I remind Members that we spent the weekend working on amendments. We \nactually had an office in the Hart Building that was open and staffed \nby both the majority and the minority. They waded through a lot of \namendments.\n  To move this bill along, I again encourage Members to bring their \namendments down. I will not mention the names of the Senators because \nit may not be appropriate. I encourage Members to come down to speak on \nthe amendments which are going to require some discussion.\n  We have an amendment to clarify the travel reimbursement for troops \nretroactive to September 25. We have an amendment on seatbelts which \nimposes sanctions on States that don't have primary seatbelt laws. We \nhave amendments such as one on sanctions relating to drunk drivers, an \namendment on changes to the Indian roads program, an amendment to \nclarify the new highway safety core program dollars which can be used \nfor additional lanes or two-lane roads, and one to grant exemptions for \n90,000 pounds on Federal aid highways--to a higher level to allow for \nlumber trucks and garbage trucks going to landfills.\n  We have a lot of amendments. I think there are about 35 amendments \nbecause staff came down and worked over the weekend on those \namendments. I think it would be appropriate for them to come down right \nnow, and not to offer their amendment but to discuss their amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will discuss a subject other than what \nis before the Senate, but before I do that I am pleased we are moving \nforward with the highway bill. I am on both committees, the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, as well as the Finance Committee, and we \nhave spent a great deal of time on this. Taking care of our \ninfrastructure and seeking to provide more jobs in a short period of \ntime is one of the most important issues we have. I certainly hope we \ncan move forward and do so quickly.\n\n\n                         Endangered Species Act\n\n  Today I will comment on an issue in which I have been very \ninterested, and as a matter of fact, I have a bill pending regarding \nthe Endangered Species Act. I suppose most everyone favors the idea of \nprotecting endangered species. That is something we all like to do. \nHowever, it has been in place now for more than 20 years, and frankly \nit has a different impact in different parts of the country.\n  I come from a State where 50 percent of the State belongs to the \nFederal Government. We have a lot of conflicting issues, both with the \nFederal Government and with the State government. It becomes quite \ndifficult from time to time. Like many programs that are in place, I \nwish, when we pass them, we would say it has to be reviewed again in \nanother 8 or 9 years to see if it is working and make necessary \nchanges. This program needs some changes. It has not worked the way we \nwould like to have seen it work. We need to review programs after there \nhas been time to try them out and see how they will work.\n  What has happened, to a large extent, the emphasis has been on \nlisting, rather than the recovery aspect. As a matter of fact, we have \nlisted nearly 1,500 various species, plant and animal. We have \nrecovered about 12. So the idea and emphasis ought to be, it seems to \nme, on the recovery of these species and not simply on the listing of \nthem and letting them go on forever being endangered and having to be \nmanaged in that way.\n\n  Part of the problem, of course, has been the idea that anytime \nsomebody is making decisions or regulations with regard to natural \nresources--in this case, endangered species--they end up in court. \nInstead of doing it on the basis of science and what is the best \ndecision to be made, we end up in court and then letting the court \nmanage it. It becomes a very difficult situation.\n  I sympathize with those people who are involved in the management of \nthese programs. In everything they do, they can think about what is \ngood for the program--in this case, what is good for endangered \nspecies--but, wait a minute: We have to take a look over here to see \nhow we are going to get by the court.\n  I might add as an appendix, one of the difficulties in our case is, \nwe are in the Tenth Circuit Court, and when things happen in Wyoming or \nYellowstone Park, or wherever, then they go to court in Washington. \nThere ought to be some sort of limitation to where the issue can go. If \nthe issue occurs in a particular circuit, that is where the judge ought \nto be, that is where the court case ought to take place. At any rate, \nthat, again, is one of the problems.\n  One of the other problems for States such as ours, where we have lots \nof public lands--and we have some unique problems that follow along the \nRocky Mountain Ridge; and there are 10 or 12 States that have a lot of \nthings in common. And I understand if you are on the east coast or even \non the west coast, you don't have much interest in what is happening in \nour area, but our issues are sometimes unique, so there needs to be a \ngood deal of local input into these kinds of issues to make them \nworkable because there are different kinds of circumstances that \nappear.\n  One of the listings we had some experience with recently is the so-\ncalled jumping mouse in part of the southern part of our State and part \nof Colorado. It turns out, after about 5 years, that they really did \nnot have the scientific basis for listing these critters at all, and \nthey were not even in the same family of mice that they thought they \nwere. Now we are in the process of going away from that whole thing \nafter this whole problem of people having to manage their lands \ndifferently. So obviously there needs to be something done differently.\n  One of the issues we are dealing with at the moment is grizzly bears. \nWhat you generally do with an endangered species listing is you try to \nfigure out how many there are, and then you put forward some goals as \nto how many you would like to achieve in the recovery. We have passed \nthe recovery numbers for almost 10 years in Yellowstone Park--and, of \ncourse, the grizzly bears do not stay in Yellowstone Park--but still we \nhave not gotten them delisted. It just seems as if it takes forever to \ndo this.\n  Actually, however, the current specie we are dealing with is the gray \nwolves. Wolves, of course, were there years ago; then they were not \nthere for a while; and they came back in the 1990s. There was a \nreintroduction of wolves from Canada into Yellowstone Park. Again, \nnobody would have guessed they were going to stay in Yellowstone Park, \nand surely they did not.\n  So now we are in a circumstance where the wolves have moved into \nIdaho, Montana, and Wyoming, as well as the park, and there finally has \ncome a time when they have exceeded the numbers substantially to where \nthere is a plan in effect, and hopefully moving into effect, where the \nthree States would set up their own management plan, and then the \nwolves would be delisted and managed by the States, with certain \nagreements in there.\n\n  What we have now is Wyoming has put together a plan--as have Idaho \nand Montana--and they have been really very tough to deal with. I think \nlast year we had 47 cattle that were proven to be killed by the wolves \nand at least that many that were suspected to have been killed by the \nwolves. But the Fish and Wildlife Service does not agree with the plan \nWyoming has, so now we are waiting to see if we can get some agreement \non that. As a matter of fact, part of the plan was passed by the \nWyoming Legislature, but it does not seem to be acceptable. We have met \nwith the Secretary and with the head of the Fish and Wildlife Service \nto see if we can find some flexibility there, and it is mostly over the \nsemantics of what is in the plan. But the fact is, we do need to get \nthem delisted so the State can have control over their management. That \nis really where we are.\n  I guess my point is, we have a program that all of us would like to \nmaintain. We like the idea, but it is not working very well, and yet it \nseems to be very difficult to do anything about it. Sometimes it seems \nto me when we pass a bill, we ought to say it ends in 5 years and has \nto be renewed so that we can take another look at it at that time. \nFirst of all, times change; secondly, sometimes it is not managed \nproperly and it could be changed. Anyway, we have not done that.\n  I have a bill introduced--introduced for several years, as a matter \nof fact which we have not been able to move. Oversimplified, it simply \nsays when you list a critter or a species, you have to have scientific \ninformation. You have to have a real basis for doing it, and the people \nwho list it have to provide some scientific data so that a jumping \nmouse is really a jumping mouse. And the second part is that at the \ntime of listing, there also has to be a plan for recovery. That really \nhas become the problem.\n  It is easy to list. People can send in recommendations for listing, \nand suddenly it happens, but there is no real plan as to how the \nrecovery is going to take place, there is no area that it is designed \nto cover, and those kinds of things, and it becomes really very \ndifficult to get this done.\n  I am going to push once again to get this done. Senator Craig and \nSenator Hagel are cosponsors of the bill. We are going to try again to \nsee if we can get this done. This is designed not to do away with the \nEndangered Species Act but indeed to strengthen the program so that it \nwill work in more places than it does now. So that is an issue in which \nI am very much involved.\n  In closing, we have a lot to do this year. It seems a little \nfrustrating sometimes that we have difficulty in moving forward. I wish \nwe could really take a look at where we are, to try to\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nset some priorities as to the kinds of issues with which we want to \nmove forward.\n  We end up with endless debate, which really keeps anything from \nhappening. We end up with unrelated amendments being put on bills that \nkeep us from moving forward. I think everyone here would say: Hey, our \njob is to accomplish some objectives. I understand there are different \nviews, and that is why we vote. But the idea of just simply resisting \nmoving forward, the idea of resisting going to conference, for example, \ncertainly is not a good way to manage here in the Chamber.\n\n  Of course, politics in this place is not a brand new idea, but we \nhave gotten so that everything we talk about is related to the 2004 \nPresidential election. Well, that is not really why we are here. We \nhave different views. We ought to reconcile those views or at least \ndecide what the majority seeks to do here and do that.\n  Also, I think most of us generally have the notion that we ought to \ntry to make the Federal Government smaller rather than having it \ngrowing. Yet that does not seem to be what we do. We resist talking \nabout competitive outsourcing, doing any of these kinds of things. We \nneed to have some rules related to our spending so we are limited in \nwhat we do. We are facing a deficit now that none of us like. I think \nit is justifiable because of all the emergency things we have been in, \nbut now is the time to do something about that.\n  We need to do something about adding issues to bills when they go to \nconference committee that have not been passed by either House. This is \nnot the way things ought to be done.\n  So I hope--and I know our leadership is working on this--we can see \nif we can move forward some more on the priorities of things we ought \nto be doing and ought to have done. We are in the midst of one now that \neveryone agrees we need to do. We need to move forward and do the \nthings that are before us that we all want to do, and that is to make \nthis a stronger country, and not have an overbearing Federal Government \nbut have an equal division of responsibility in determining what the \nrole of the Federal Government is as opposed to local and State \ngovernments.\n  So, Mr. President, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak \nas in morning business.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as Senator Inhofe has already stated, our \nstaffs worked hard over the weekend on amendments people have to this \nmost important legislation. We have gone over many amendments, but have \napproved 34 amendments we would accept. These are good amendments. They \nhave been reviewed closely by both the majority and minority. A lot of \nprogress has been made. We hope people who have problems with the \nsubstance of this legislation, who want to offer amendments, will come \nand talk to us about it today. We are arriving at a point where there \nis not going to be a lot of time. Tomorrow we hope to be in a position \nto do the managers' package--the finance, transit, and EPW aspects of \nthe legislation--and move forward, but we hope Senators who have \nconcern about the legislation will come forward so we can move more \nquickly. We are running out of time on this very important legislation.\n\n\n                    Medicare and Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1965, when Congress created Medicare to \nprovide health care security for our senior citizens, it took less than \na year for that to be considered and then put into full operation; in \nfact, 11 months. That was back before we had computers. All we had then \nwere slide rulers and some adding machines.\n  On the legislation with which we are dealing now, the new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, the new Medicare revision, we have a \ndifferent situation. We are told this legislation we passed--and that \nwas signed by the President and deals with our senior citizens--is \ngoing to have to wait for more than 2 years before it can be \nimplemented. Today our senior citizens need help with soaring drug \nprices. They deserve the security of knowing they will be able to buy \nthe medicine that can keep them healthy and happy. The American people \nwant to know that when their Government wants to get things done, it \ncan act quickly.\n  This law is a bad deal for senior citizens. That is why the main \nprovisions of this legislation won't take effect until after the \nelection. That is wrong. I suppose the administration thought our \nsenior citizens would be grateful a bill passed, no matter what was in \nit, and that they wouldn't bother to find out what was in it. But they \ndid find out. They already know. The President has underestimated our \nseniors.\n  I have met with seniors throughout the State of Nevada, and they know \nwhat is in this law. They don't like it. I read on the floor last week \na meeting that was held by people from the State of Nevada to describe \nwhat is in this bill.\n  More than a hundred people showed up and all hundred were there to \ncomplain about this legislation. They don't like the fact that this \nwill make many of them pay more for their drugs than they already have \nto pay. They don't like the fact that many who have drug coverage under \nprivate plans could lose their benefits because of this legislation. \nThey don't like the provision in the law that forbids Medicare from \nnegotiating with drug companies to get better prices. Insurance \ncompanies can do it and HMOs can do it. But Medicare--the largest \nhealth care delivery unit in the world--cannot negotiate with the drug \ncompanies to get lower prices.\n  Instead of working with Congress to address these and other concerns, \nthe President has threatened to veto any change. Then he turned to his \nreelection campaign and asked them to help polish the image of this new \nMedicare law. So a company that is part of the President's reelection \ncampaign is now doing the ads even with Medicare.\n  Fair enough, you might say. That is politics. Except the President is \nwaging this ad campaign at taxpayers' expense. Simply, that is not \nfair. I am told he is planning to raise $200 million for his campaign \nthis year. But apparently that is not enough because the administration \nis spending as much as $22 million of the taxpayers' money for this \npublicity campaign.\n  I have no doubt that senior citizens need information about this new \nMedicare law, and education and awareness about a new program is a \nlegitimate use of taxpayer dollars; but these ads they are pushing are \nmisleading. They don't tell seniors what they need to know about the \nbill. These ads don't shoot straight with the American people. They \ngive our senior citizens false assurances, not facts.\n  For example, the ads reassure seniors that they can keep their \nMedicare coverage and the right to choose their own doctor. But the \nfact is many seniors, including many in Nevada, could be forced into \ndemonstration programs that will make them pay higher premiums if they \nwant to stay in traditional Medicare, and they will not be able to \nchoose their own doctor.\n  In the same fashion, the ads don't mention that seniors will be \nprohibited from using their own money to purchase supplemental coverage \nto fill the gaps in the new law.\n  As part of this advertising campaign, the administration is also \nrunning print advertisements. I was surprised and perplexed when I saw \nan ad in the newspaper that runs on Capitol Hill, Roll Call. This \nnewspaper is aimed at Senators, House Members, and Capitol Hill staff, \nand it is also aimed at lobbyists and so-called Washington insiders. If \nthe President is trying to educate senior citizens about this new law, \nwhy would they place ads in Washington newspapers where less than 3 \npercent of the readership is over age 65? It is for obvious reasons.\n  The last straw was when I learned these ads are being produced by the \nsame company that makes President Bush's campaign commercials. But that \nmakes sense because they are simply campaign commercials--except his \ncampaign isn't paying for them; you are, the American taxpayers.\n  These ads are political and that is clear. They are not intended to \nhelp seniors understand this complicated\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nMedicare law. They are intended to offset the negative public reaction \nto this bad law.\n  The President has every right to defend this law, which he urged \nCongress to pass, but he doesn't have the right to make the taxpayers \npay for it.\n  Mr. President, again, I see my friend from North Dakota, who has an \namendment, and he has been waiting to get a vote on it. I hope the \nSenator from North Dakota will get a vote on it soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have just talked to the managers of the \nbill. My understanding is there is nobody waiting to speak on the bill. \nAs a result of that, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes, with the understanding that I will relinquish \nthe floor if the managers have Senators who wish to offer an amendment \nto the bill. I don't want to delay the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Trade Agreements And Jobs\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a moment about the \nissue of jobs. There has been an especially vibrant debate recently \nabout the number of jobs that are being created in this country and the \nnumber of jobs that are moving overseas from the U.S. to other \ncountries. I wanted to talk about jobs specifically today because there \nwas an announcement that the U.S. has finished a trade agreement with \nthe country of Australia.\n  We have already had the completion of the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, CAFTA; we have had NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement with Canada and Mexico; we have had GATT, the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade; and the WTO. We have all of these \nagreements and the fact is they are not working out well.\n  Despite that, instead of correcting the problems in previous trade \nagreements, our negotiators are continuing to move ahead to negotiate \nnew trade agreements.\n  Let's consider NAFTA. NAFTA was negotiated with Mexico and Canada. \nPrior to NAFTA being negotiated, and then approved by the Congress, the \nUnited States had a very small trade surplus with Mexico, nearly a $2 \nbillion trade surplus with Mexico. Now, 10 years later, we have a $40 \nbillion deficit with Mexico. I will say that again. In 10 years, with \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, we took a small surplus with \nMexico and turned it into a very large deficit.\n  Again, when we negotiated the trade agreement with Canada--it was \nwith Canada and Mexico--we had a $10 billion trade deficit with Canada, \nand that is now $50 billion.\n  With Mexico, we took a small surplus and turned it into a big \ndeficit. With Canada, we had a modest deficit and quintupled it, from \n$10 billion to $50 billion. We still have people walking around this \ntown thumbing their suspenders, between puffs of their cigars, and \nsaying this trade agreement was wonderful for our country, it has \nworked well.\n  I decided to check which companies certified to the Federal \nGovernment the movement of jobs, or the loss of jobs, as a result of \nNAFTA. I have just received the information from the Congressional \nResearch Service. It is the first time anybody has catalogued this job \nloss, in this level of detail, as far as I know. But here is what you \nhave.\n  Now, NAFTA allows for transitional trade adjustment assistance. That \nis a fancy way of saying, if you are going to lose your job because of \nthis trade agreement, we will give you some supplemental income to help \nyou over the tough spot. The anticipation was people would lose their \njobs, and we would try to provide some help, transitional trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  In order to get transitional trade adjustment assistance, the \nemployer has to certify that jobs are going to be lost in their company \nas a result of this trade agreement. That certification goes to the \nDepartment of Labor, which keeps track of those certifications.\n  Let me describe what we found with this Congressional Research \nService study, based on Department of Labor data. This is the first \ntime a study has been done in this level of detail.\n  It says the No. 1 company that certified jobs certified they had \n16,095 jobs that they lost either because they moved the jobs to \nMexico, in most cases, or because of additional imports from either \nMexico or Canada that displaced their workers here.\n  No. 2, Levi Strauss: 15,676 jobs over this nearly 10-year period. \nLevi Strauss, now, that is everything that is American, right? Just go \nbuy some Levis. Levis used to be made in the United States. Not \nanymore. Levis left, and the workers who used to make Levis in this \ncountry were able to get some transitional trade adjustment assistance. \nThat is a fancy way of saying: By the way, we are going to sew those \nLevis in Mexico, and we will give you a few bucks as your job leaves \nand goes to Mexico. That is what it said to American workers.\n  There is a whole series of companies, as one might imagine. Fruit of \nthe Loom is seventh on the list, 5,350 jobs. I remember when I saw the \nactual notice in the paper that Fruit of the Loom was shutting down its \nU.S. manufacturing plants. I spoke on the floor of the Senate. I said: \nIt is one thing to lose your shirt, but Fruit of the Loom is gone. They \nare making shirts and shorts and underwear in Mexico. I understand even \nnow that labor costs are too high, and now it is moving to Asia, in \nsome cases.\n  How about Fig Newton, Kraft Foods? Eat a Fig Newton and you think you \nare eating a Fig Newton cookie from the U.S. I am sorry, think again. \nIt is Mexican food; Fig Newtons made in Mexico. It left this country, \nand the resulting layoffs of U.S. workers meant they received \ntransitional trade adjustment assistance.\n  What does that mean? It means they got laid off. They made a good Fig \nNewton cookie, but they don't make it here anymore. American employees \nlost their jobs, and Fig Newtons are now made in Mexico.\n  This is a list of 100 companies from the Congressional Research \nService. This list can be derived from Labor Department data because \nthe companies had to certify job loss. This is slightly over 200,000 \nemployees who lost their jobs. In fact, if you included in the list all \nwho certified, it would be over 400,000 American workers who lost their \njobs because of NAFTA, the free trade agreement with the United States, \nCanada, and Mexico.\n  Some say other jobs were created. Maybe so. Ask yourself this: If we \ntook a small trade surplus with Mexico and turned it into a very large \ndeficit, and a modest deficit with Canada and turned it into a very \nlarge deficit, isn't it inevitably the case that we will have lost a \nlot of jobs? The answer is clearly yes. It doesn't matter what all the \nother folks say. We have lost a lot of jobs, and all of these folks--\nthese are just numbers on a chart, but of these 200,000 people, every \none of them had to come home, perhaps some evening after work, and say \nto their spouse: Honey, I lost my job. I did good work. I had good \nevaluations all of my career with this company, but they have decided \nto shut the doors in this country and move to Mexico.\n  The reason I wanted to point this out is to say there is precious \nlittle attention paid these days to the question of what is happening \nwith jobs being so-called ``outsourced.'' I recently visited with a \nfellow who is founder and CEO of a very substantial company. He said to \nme: All of my competitors have now moved offshore. All of my \ncompetitors have moved offshore, and I have not. He said: I am not \ngoing to at this point, but I want you to know it puts me at a dramatic \ncompetitive disadvantage because I am paying American wages, and they \nare in India or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or China, and they are paying \npennies on the dollar for those wages and it makes them much more \ndifficult to compete with.\n\n  I said: Good for you for keeping your jobs in this country.\n  He said: Yes, but somebody has to do something.\n  The question of this globalization is not just about whether we are \nglobalizing, whether the economy is becoming increasingly global, \nbecause it\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nis. The question is, Are there rules attached to globalization? What \nwill the rules be for globalization? Is it OK to move jobs to a country \nwhere you pay them 16 cents an hour and work them 16 hours a day and 7 \ndays a week? Is that something we should aspire to have American \nworkers and American companies compete with? Yet that is exactly the \ncase today. The answer so far has been, yes, that is fair trade.\n  It is not fair trade where I come from. This economy will not be the \neconomy that produces jobs and represents the economy of the world's \nbiggest and most vibrant economic engine if it does not retain a strong \nmanufacturing base. No country will remain the dominant economy in the \nworld without a dominant and strong manufacturing base.\n  For 42 straight months, we have had reductions in the manufacturing \njob base. Why? Because of outsourcing; moving jobs overseas where you \ncan hire people for pennies on the dollar.\n  Let me go through a couple of charts that show where we are with \ntrade.\n  This chart shows trade with Mexico. We can see where we were just \nbefore our trade agreement. What has happened since that time? A flood \nof red ink every single year; more and more trade deficits with Mexico.\n  This chart shows our trade deficit with Canada. I mention both of \nthese only because this is NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. There is a flood of red ink. We negotiated the trade \nagreement in 1993, and we can see what is happening. And we still have \npeople saying this has been a great free trade agreement.\n  This chart shows our trade deficit, which is completely out of \ncontrol. The President's budget last week asked the Congress to approve \na budget that has a dramatic budget deficit. In it, he predicts in the \nfiscal year in which we now work, the budget deficit will be roughly \n$530 billion, roughly $530 billion. But in order to get to that, he had \nto take the Social Security trust funds for the year and use them as \nother revenues to make the deficit look lower than it really is.\n  The budget deficit this year is going to be about $660 billion. That \nis the budget deficit. Add to that a nearly $500 billion trade deficit, \nand we can see where this is going--higher, higher, and higher. We have \na Government with a combined budget deficit and trade deficit that is \nover $1 trillion, and people walk around as if nothing is going on. \nThis is serious for this country. This is a burden that must be repaid.\n  Let me talk for a moment about a couple of specific trade issues to \nshow the absurdity of what is happening. This chart shows cars to \nKorea. Korea sent to the United States 620,000 cars to sell in our \nmarketplace, and we sold to Korea 2,800.\n  Let me say that again. Mr. President, 620,000 Korean cars came to the \nU.S. We were able to sell 2,800 in Korea. Why? Because the Korean \ngovernment doesn't want U.S. cars sold in Korea.\n  Beef? We can't sell beef in Europe. Why? Because $100 million of beef \nis banned from the EU each year due to bogus reasons, and we have a \nvery large trade deficit with the EU. Here is the way they characterize \nU.S. beef: A cow with two heads because of growth hormones.\n  Guess what. We said to Europe: If you are going to take that action \nagainst us, we are going to take action against you. And in the first \nsmall semblance of direct action on trade, the U.S. Government decided \nto take action against Europe.\n  What did we do? We are going to slap Europe around. We decided to \nslap Europe around by imposing duties on Roquefort cheese, goose liver, \nand truffles.\n  That will strike fear into our trade adversaries, and I say \nadversaries because when they take unfair action against us, we have a \nright to take action against them. What do we do? We slap import duties \non truffles and goose liver. I am sorry, that does not seem to me to be \nthe kind of action that is very effective against trade partners that \nare engaged in unfair trade.\n  I could go on at great length about the issue. The issue, to me, \ncomes down to the subject of jobs. This is a BusinessWeek article of \nFebruary 3, last year. It talked about U.S. jobs moving offshore. They \ntalked about the official estimate of 3.3 million white-collar jobs \nmoving offshore in the near future. They are talking about in the \ncoming 10 to 12 years an additional 3.3 million jobs. These are not \nfactory jobs, manufacturing jobs. These are white-collar jobs that will \nbe moving offshore.\n  On the cover of BusinessWeek Magazine recently, it states: ``Is Your \nJob Next?'' A new round of globalization is sending upscale jobs \noffshore. They include chip design, engineering, basic research.\n  Recently, in the last couple of weeks, a Wall Street Journal article \ntalking about documents from the IBM Corporation gives a rare look, \nthey say, at ``sensitive plans for offshoring.''\n  They got ahold of IBM documents that show the company is acutely \naware of the sensitivities involved when they ship jobs overseas. These \nare white-collar jobs. They say:\n\n       Do not be transparent regarding the purpose/intent, and \n     cautions that the terms ``onshore'' and ``offshore'' should \n     never be used. The memo--\n\n  Which talks about moving jobs offshore--\n\n       suggests that anything written to employees should first be \n     ``sanitized'' by human-resources and communications staffers.\n\n  In the draft prepared for managers at IBM they suggest workers be \ntold:\n\n       This action is a statement about the rate and pace of \n     change in this demanding industry. . . . It is in no way a \n     comment on the excellent work you have done over the years. . \n     . . For the people whose jobs are affected by this \n     consolidation, I understand this is difficult news.\n\n  It is a rare look at companies that are now moving high-skilled, \nhigh-wage, white-collar jobs overseas.\n  We have some serious problems to deal with. This issue of the \nmovement of American jobs overseas is a very serious issue. We can talk \nabout the issue of globalization, and I am somebody who believes this \nis an increasing economy--I understand that--but I also believe there \nneeds to be standards: What is the admission price to the marketplace \nof a developed country, a country that fought, for example, for the \nright of workers to organize, a safe workplace, the ability to prohibit \nthe dumping into streams and waters and the air, poisons and effluents?\n  We fought for years about those things: Child labor laws, fair labor \nstandards, minimum wages. Now, with just an airplane ride and a \ndecision memo by a company which said we will just pole vault over all \nof that, we do not have to worry about that, they move our jobs to \nBangladesh or Sri Lanka, or to a place where they can hire 12-year-\nolds, pay them 12 cents an hour, and work them 12 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek. And they do. Then they will ship the product back to Toledo, \nPittsburgh, Los Angeles, and Fargo. They say that consumers will be \nadvantaged by that because they will get lower priced commodities.\n  I conclude by telling one story that I have told previously. It is \nabout Huffy bicycles. Most people are familiar with Huffy bicycles, 20 \npercent of the American marketplace sold at Wal-Mart, Sears, Kmart. \nThey used to have an American flag as a decal between the handle bar \nand the front fender. That was when they were made by workers in Ohio \nwho made $11 an hour producing a Huffy bicycle.\n  I do not know any of those workers, but I am sure they were proud \nbecause they had good jobs and produced a good bicycle. They were all \nfired. Huffy bicycles are now made in China. The workers in Ohio were \nmaking $11 an hour. That was too much, according to the company. So \nHuffy bicycles are made in China for 33 cents an hour by people who \nwork 12 to 14 hours a day for 7 days a week.\n\n  No, there is not a flag anymore. That little tin decal between the \nfender and the handle bar is not an American flag. It is now a picture \nof the globe.\n  The question for this country is: Are we going to have any \nmanufacturing jobs left? Is it fair competition to ask an American \nworker to compete against 33-cent-an-hour labor? We have to answer \nthese questions.\n  I am not suggesting it is not an increasingly global world, but we \nneed rules for globalization. What is fair competition for the American \nworker and for American businesses? That is something the Congress has \nbeen unwilling to deal with and recent trade agreements have ignored. \nIn fact, the\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\ntrade agreements have been fundamentally incompetent, the ones with \nChina, NAFTA, and others.\n  I have spoken about those agreements at great length previously. \nToday, what I wanted to do was simply show the chart that shows the 100 \ncompanies that have exported jobs, and they have certified that the \nexport of these jobs came about as a result of our trade agreement. \nThis certification is not some speculation on my part. This is \ncertification by each of these companies about the number of jobs that \nno longer exist in this country because they either moved to Mexico or \nthey displaced imports coming into this country.\n  This certification that has been made and the CRS has compiled for me \nis on my Web site, Dorgan.Senate.gov, if someone wants to see the list \nof companies. I think it is important for people to understand this is \nwhat is happening. The question is: Does it matter? For me, it does.\n  If we are going to have a strong manufacturing base, we have to worry \nabout this. No country will remain a dominant economic power without a \nstrong manufacturing base, in my judgment.\n  I have more to say about trade. I will do it at a more appropriate \ntime. I understand my colleague wishes to speak on the bill, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nyielding. He will have ample time to come back and do that. I \nappreciate him allowing us to get back to the bill.\n  The Senator from Ohio has an amendment to talk about, but I encourage \nall Members to come down to the floor. We have time now. Later on, time \nis going to become very precious. As I said last Friday, come to the \nfloor. We stayed open all weekend to work with Members on their \namendments. We are doing that as we speak. We would encourage Members \nto come down and talk about their amendments--now that we have worked \nout amendments--so when the appropriate time comes, if they wish to \nfile those amendments and to debate them and get votes on them, they \nwill be light-years ahead if they come down now.\n  I want to issue that as a very strong suggestion to those members who \nhave amendments. I thank some 30 Members who brought their amendments \ndown over Saturday. A lot of those have been accepted in the managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have been here a long time, as the Senator from \nOklahoma has. Have we had anybody come down?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator DeWine is waiting to speak now on his amendment, \nalthough I think the Senator is making a very good point. We have been \ntalking about this since Friday, and we encourage people to come down.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Well, I hope the Senator from Ohio will get such \nenthusiasm created with his speech that we can spend the rest of the \ntime making some progress.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I can assure the Senator he always does.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank the \nleaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Chairman Inhofe, \nRanking Member Jeffords, as well as Senators Bond and Reid, for all the \nhard work they put in to produce this transportation bill. This is \nreally a transportation bill that does a number of different things, \nbut one thing it does do is stress the importance of safety programs.\n  The bill before us today is a revolutionary bill. It is known as \nSAFETEA. That is what we are calling it. In many respects it certainly \ndeserves this title. I salute my two colleagues, whom I see on the \nfloor, and thank them for their fine work in this area.\n  A strong emphasis on safety programs is vital because in the year \n2002, the last year for which we have complete records, over 42,000 of \nour fellow citizens--in fact, the exact number is 42,815--were lost in \nthis country. That is how many fellow citizens were killed in auto \nfatalities.\n  The No. 1 killer of Americans between the ages of 4 and 34 in this \ncountry is auto fatalities. That is an amazing thing when you think \nabout it. Think about all the other diseases and problems there are in \nthis country, whether it be cancer, all the other things someone could \ndie from, but the No. 1 killer of our young people today is auto \nfatalities.\n  If you look at the age group of 16, 17, 18, 19, the figures go off \nthe charts for that age group. That is what is killing our young people \ntoday--automobiles.\n  In the next 12 minutes, to be precise, at least 1 person will be \nkilled in an automobile accident in this country, while nearly 6 people \nwill be injured in just the next 60 seconds. Tragically, within the \nlast 2 weeks, in my home State of Ohio, two of our soldiers were killed \nin automobile accidents, one of whom was just back from Iraq on a 2-\nweek pass.\n  Sadly, though, it seems these deaths are something we as a society \ntake for granted. We tolerate it. We put up with it. Frankly, we don't \npay much attention to it. How many times every night when we turn on \nthe news do we hear about someone being killed? Unless they are from \nour local community, unless we know them, we don't think a thing about \nit. We tolerate it.\n  If a foreign enemy were doing this to us, we would not tolerate it. \nWe would be up in arms. Someone has said these automobile deaths are \nthe equivalent of a 747 going down every 2 days in this country. If \nthat were happening, it would, of course, be on CNN. It would be \nbreaking news. We would be literally up in arms. We would be demanding \nthe President of the United States and this Congress do something about \nit. Yet these auto fatalities that occur hour by hour, day by day, \nminute by minute, go on and on and for some reason we have become \nimmune to it, hardened to it, really. Tragically these deaths just \ncontinue.\n  That is why I am so pleased the bill before us does go a long way to \nhelp to address several safety concerns that can make a difference and \ncan save lives on our roads. The EPW Committee leaders deserve praise \nfor elevating safety programs to core status among highway programs. In \nthe past, safety programs were of a derivative nature, drawing their \nfunding as a percentage of one of the core programs. This framework \nenabled some States to overlook safety and focus funding and efforts on \nother areas. With the new core designation, safety will take its proper \nplace at center stage. The EPW Committee leadership deserves praise for \ntaking this quantum leap forward.\n\n  Let me again thank Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, Bond, and Reid for \nmaking their staffs available this weekend for work on my amendments. I \nam pleased with the progress that has been made so far, trying to work \non these amendments. One of my amendments has already been accepted. I \nthank them for that. That amendment has been integrated into the \nproposed managers' package.\n  I have another amendment relating to traffic signals that I believe \nwe will have cleared in the near future.\n  I wish this afternoon to take a few minutes to share with the Members \nof the Senate what these amendments will do, because I believe they \nwill help put us even further down the field in terms of saving lives \nand promoting greater emphasis on safety.\n  I have further additional safety-related amendments I will be \noffering to the Commerce Committee portion of the highway bill, and I \nwill be offering those in a future speech when we get to that section \nof the bill, we hope later in the week. I thank Senator McCain for his \nleadership. I look forward to working with him and the Commerce \nCommittee on that section of the bill.\n  The first amendment the EPW Committee has accepted contains two \nparts. First, it would require the States to identify and rank and \ndisclose their most dangerous intersections. That might not sound like \na revolutionary thing to do, but not every State is doing that now. It \nis the right thing to do: to rank them, to identify them, and then to \nmake that information public so the consumers, the citizens will know \nwhat that information is and will then be able to act upon it.\n  A second part of our amendment we are still negotiating with the \nleadership would increase the timely and efficient expenditure of \nFederal safety dollars by the States.\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\n  Let me first talk about the dangerous roads and intersections \namendment. The Environment and Public Works Committee bill focuses some \nresources on these problem areas and this amendment builds on the \ncommittee's fine efforts. Most States, fortunately, do take steps to \nidentify and track the dangerous roads and intersections. They keep a \nlist of the bad ones, the ones with high fatalities and high accident \nrates. But, amazingly, there are many States that keep this information \nsecret and do not tell the public or, in some cases, do not even keep \nthis information at all.\n  My amendment is very simple. It requires States to systematically \nrank and disclose their most dangerous roads and intersections. It \nrequires them to do so in terms of dangers to human beings, in other \nwords, in terms of the number of deaths and the number of injuries that \noccur on these specific roads.\n  Further, my language asks the States to disclose at least the top 5 \npercent of the most dangerous roads and intersections in their States, \nand that they identify to the Secretary of Transportation this \ninformation and therefore ultimately to the driving public.\n  We need to get information on dangerous roads and intersections out \nto the public and to the people we are charged to protect. My amendment \nwould help assure that this in fact happens.\n  Consumers have a right to know this information. As a parent, I might \ntell my 16-year-old or 17-year-old not to go a certain way to a movie. \nDon't go on that dangerous intersection. Don't go by that dangerous \ncurve. At least, if I had that information, I could make an intelligent \ndecision about it. It is wrong for a State department of transportation \nto have that information and to deny me, as a citizen of that State, \nthat same information. I should be able to tell my child, ``Don't go \nthat way. It may take another 10 or 15 minutes, but go a different \nway--be safe.''\n  I would like to briefly tell my colleagues about a woman by the name \nof Sandy Johnson and her mother Jacqueline. On October 5, 2002, Sandy \nand Jacqueline were killed. They were killed in a car crash at a \ndangerous intersection near Columbus, OH.\n  What they did not know as they drove into that intersection--and what \ncountless other area residents who used the roads that cross through it \ndid not know at the time--was this particular intersection was known at \nthat time by the State department of transportation to be a very \ndangerous area. In fact, the State department of transportation had \nindeed known that information for quite some time. Perhaps if Sandy \nJohnson had known that she would have taken a different route that day. \nWe will never know. Perhaps she might have slowed down to see traffic \ncoming from the other direction. Tragically, we simply will never know.\n  This particular intersection was dangerous because of the close \nproximity of a house to the intersection, making it difficult for \ndrivers coming from each direction to see those approaching from the \nother way. The fix to this problem, the installation of four-way stop \nsigns and ultimately removal of a house to improve sight lines, took \nquite some time to be implemented. But eventually, these steps were in \nfact taken.\n  Following the tragic death of his wife and his mother-in-law, Dean \nJohnson initiated a campaign to tackle the issue of dangerous roads and \ndangerous intersections, not just in Ohio but across the country. He \nhas tried with varying results from State to State to get information \non dangerous roads and intersection locations out to the public so \ntragedies like the one involving his wife could be prevented.\n  Today on the Senate floor, I thank Dean Johnson for his dedication to \nthis very important public safety issue and for the progress he has \nmade in my home State of Ohio and elsewhere in terms of getting \ncritical lifesaving information out to citizens through the Sandy \nJohnson Foundation. I must say to him that his work is a real tribute \nto his love for his wife and for her memory.\n  Clearly, tragedies like the one involving Sandy Johnson can be \nprevented in many cases through means as simple and as inexpensive as \ndisclosure to the public of what State departments of transportation \nalready know--the disclosure of where the dangerous roads and \nintersections are located. The States should provide this information. \nThey already know it. They simply should provide it.\n  The second part of our amendment focuses on how States spend their \nsafety money. In this respect, my staff is working with the committee \nto develop additional mechanisms for the timely and efficient \nexpenditure of Federal safety dollars. In the past, there have been \nproblems with getting States to spend their safety money on safety. The \nEPW Committee bill goes a long way towards helping ensure those safety \ndollars do in fact get spent on safety. My efforts in this area are \naimed at further strengthening this portion of the bill. It is simply \nso very important that these dollars be spent on safety--to straighten \nthe road that is killing people or to change a dangerous intersection. \nThis money can be very well spent and should be spent on things that \nwill save lives. It is very cost effective.\n  Let me talk about another amendment. My staff and I are continuing to \nwork with the managers and their staff on accepting the second \namendment that has to do with keeping our intersections safe with \nregard to the safety of first responders as they engage in their daily \nwork. This amendment is derived from legislation I introduced last year \ncalled the Safe Intersections Act of 2003, S. 1825.\n  This amendment would prohibit the unauthorized sale or possession of \ntraffic signal preempting devices, commonly known as MIRTs. This type \nof device is a remote control for changing traffic signals. Members of \nthe Senate may have read about these. They have been used for years by \nambulances, police cars, and firetrucks, allowing them to reach \nemergencies faster. As an ambulance approaches the intersection where \nthe light is red, the driver engages a transmitter. That transmitter \nthen sends a signal to a receiver on the traffic light which changes \nthe light from red to green within a few seconds. It is a very useful \ntool when properly used in emergency situations by someone in an \nemergency vehicle.\n  In a 2002 survey, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that in \nthe top 78 metropolitan areas, there are 24,683 traffic lights equipped \nwith these sensors--in other words, equipped with sensors that can be \ntriggered by emergency vehicles.\n  In my own home State of Ohio, there is a joint pilot project underway \nby the Washington Township Fire Department and the Dublin Police \nDepartment to install these devices. Other areas in Ohio where they are \nin use include Mentor, Twinsburg, Willoughy, and Westerville. In Ohio \nand across the country, law enforcement offices, fire departments, and \nparamedics are investing in this technology to make their communities \nsafer.\n  So what is the problem? Recently, it has come to light that this \ntechnology is being sold to unauthorized individuals--who use this \ntechnology in their own private cars and private vehicles to bypass red \nlights during their commute to and from work or just in their everyday \ndriving. Clearly, preemptive devices were never intended for this type \nof use. This technology in the hands of unauthorized users could result \nin traffic problems such as gridlock or, much worse, accidents in which \npeople are injured or killed. We know of at least one incident in \nModesto, CA, where paramedics on an emergency run used a preemptive \ndevice to clear the way through a busy intersection only to see the \nlight change back to red in their direction due to use of a MIRT by a \nnearby driver.\n  My amendment is simple. It would restrict the sale of preemptive \ndevices to government-authorized users such as ambulance drivers, \nfiretruck drivers, and police. Clearly, these devices should not be \navailable to casual drivers wishing to make a total end run on civil \norder by changing traffic signals to make their commute a little bit \nshorter. It is a very simple amendment.\n  The two amendments I am offering will go a long way towards improving \ntransportation safety. They are commonsense, they are practical, and \nthey will in fact make a difference.\n  These efforts are a continuation of my work in this area--something I \nhave been interested in for many years,\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\ngoing back to a time in the early 1980s when I was in the Ohio State \nSenate. A little boy named Justin--I think Justin was 7--was killed \nright outside his school in my home county of Greene County. We decided \nat that time that Justin had been killed by a driver who had been \ndrinking, a driver who had a very bad previous record of drinking and \ndriving. We decided, frankly, we had had enough of this and we had to \ndo something about it. I introduced a very tough drunk driving billing \nin Ohio. I researched the law and saw what other States and foreign \ncountries had been doing. Ultimately, the bill became Ohio's tough \ndrunk-driving law. I have been interested in highway safety issues ever \nsince. I have worked in the Congress with many of my colleagues. I have \nworked in the State Senate. I saw this firsthand when I was county \nprosecutor. I used to go into county courts and prosecute drunk \ndrivers. I saw the carnage and horrible tragedy drunk drivers cause. I \nhave been interested in highway safety issues for many years. I know \nmany of my colleagues are as well.\n  I again thank Senator Inhofe for his great work in this area to make \nthis a very strong highway safety bill. It has some very strong highway \nsafety components.\n  I think the amendments I have talked about today will go a long way \nto help make this an even better bill in regard to highway safety. I \nwill be back on the floor later this week as the bill continues to \nprogress with some additional amendments in regard to highway safety. I \nwill be talking more about them.\n\n  I thank my colleague for his great work on this bill, and Senator \nJeffords, as well, for his great work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Ohio and his interest in safety issues. I share his concerns. When \nyou have lost a loved one in an automobile accident--in the case of my \nfather, because of a narrow, two-lane road--and you know that such a \ntragic accident could have been avoided and lives saved through things \nsuch as safety striping, laws, or additional safety devices at railroad \ncrossings, you can fully appreciate the need for the attention the \nSenator has given to this important issue.\n  I also thank Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for his leadership. Producing a \nhighway bill is not an easy process. I have dealt with transportation \nissues closely as a Member of the Senate for several years now. I can \nremember when TEA-21 was on the floor how difficult it was to pull \ntogether the bill with the divergent committees--the Finance Committee, \nthe Appropriations Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Banking \nCommittee all had a say in the outcome of the bill. All the Members of \nthe Senate had their oars in the water and we had to have bipartisan \nmeetings in the various committees to produce a bill that could get \nthrough the process and be signed into law.\n  It is not easy to get the reauthorization bill to this point. I \ncommend Senator Inhofe for the work he has already done on SAFETEA, the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of \n2003. Coming up with that good title alone deserves commendation.\n  I also thank the Senator from Vermont for his efforts. As a member of \nthe Finance Committee, as well as the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, he has worked with Senator Inhofe to try to get this bill \ndone. He has made it a point in the Finance Committee that we need to \ncomplete action on this legislation because it is important for our \ncountry.\n  We do need to come up with an acceptable financing plan for the costs \nof this bill. It will take cooperation and teamwork to get it done. I \nknow Members of the Democratic leadership support this legislation and \nI believe we are getting off on the right foot. But we spent a week \npositioning and making speeches. I hope now the Senate will begin to \nhave some votes and conclude action on the bill as soon as possible so \nthat we are not faced with another extension. We need to move this \nlegislation through the Senate, show leadership, and be prepared to go \nto conference with the House of Representatives.\n  In my opinion, there may not be a more important bill we can pass \nthis year. This is not going to be a prolific year in terms of \nmonumental legislation. Frankly, that is not all bad. Some of what we \npassed last year we should have left unpassed. Sometimes we should get \ncredit for what we do not do. But this bill is one we need to complete \nthis year for a variety of reasons.\n  First of all, SAFETEA is about jobs. Very few bills we pass in the \nSenate actually produce something. This is a bill that is actually \ngoing to produce jobs, not just next year but year after year. There \nare projects in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Vermont, Mississippi, and all \nover this Nation, ready to go right now. We need to get this \nlegislation passed as soon as possible so that the funding it provides \ncan be fully utilized during the construction season. If we wait too \nlong and let this drag out, if we get stuck in the Senate or get stuck \nin conference, we will lose another construction season.\n  This bill will create jobs. Not all of the jobs will be high-paying, \nbut they will be jobs just the same. There are very few Federal \nprograms that create more jobs, from engineers down to the guy \nshoveling the gravel or moving around the dirt, all of which are very \nimportant.\n  We need to pass this legislation for its job creation impetus. We \ntalk about how we need more jobs in this recovery; this is one way to \nget them.\n\n  SAFETEA is also about infrastructure. When you get through, you have \nsomething you can see--an interstate highway, a bridge, a safety \ndevice. Maybe even mass transit facilities in some of the larger \ncities. But we have a product we can look at.\n  I found out through my 31 years in Congress, there are few things we \ndo for our constituents that are more important than highways and \ninfrastructure. If you do not have roads, if people cannot get there, \nthey will not come. That is a brilliant statement when you think about \nit, but if companies do not have access to good roads and bridges, \nrailroads, airports, ports and harbors, they will not locate a plant \nand create jobs anywhere in this country. When you are dealing with a \nmajor international corporation, they want to know: Are we going to be \non an interstate highway? Are we going to be close to an international \nairport? Do you have good schools? It starts there. Then you work from \nthere to questions such as: Is the geology good? Will we have water and \nsewer systems? Do we have access roads or existing buildings?\n  My poor State of Mississippi has been making some progress. Why is \nthat? Because we finally figured out that we were trying to fix \neverything and we were actually fixing nothing. We were shooting \nshotgun blasts and trying to do good things up and down the economic \nspectrum to help our State. It was not working because the money was \ndisappearing. People were not getting better off. So we decided to \nfocus. And we focused on education, particularly higher education and \ncommunity colleges, to create workforce training programs for local \ncommunities. And we worked to improve our elementary and secondary \neducation systems, as well.\n  Second was highways. Highways is a code word for infrastructure. It \nis the whole package: The industrial site, water, sewer, railroad spur. \nIf a community does not have good highways, economic development will \nnot happen. We have a major industry right now in my State, Viking \nRange Corporation, that makes the best ranges and some of the best \nkitchen equipment in the world. But to get to their manufacturing \nplant, visitors actually have to travel on a dirt road. This is \nseverely hampering the company's growth.\n  The third thing we focused on in my State is economic development. We \ndecided to aggressively go out and pursue jobs. This bill is an \nimportant component of that effort. SAFETEA is about jobs, it is about \ninfrastructure, it is about quality of life, and it is about safety.\n  I don't want to demean this title. We talk about safety on the \nhighways, safety on the roads, safety on our bridges. We have bridges \nall over America crumbling and being shut down. I admit, some of them \nare local or county bridges, which, in an ideal world, should be \nmaintained by the counties. But at a minimum, shouldn't we continue the \npolicies that started way\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nback in the 1950s--actually back in the 1800s, with Henry Clay, to \ndevelop and federally maintain an Interstate Highway System.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to give the \nleaders of this committee the support to which they are entitled. \nSomeone asked last week: We have all these problems, what do we do? I \nsaid, support the chairman and ranking member. They have a tough job, \nan important job. We should help and support them and try to shape the \nlegislation with them, not just because we want projects in our State. \nYes, we all do. But if we did not get one earmarked project in our \nStates, we ought to support this legislation because of what it means \nfor our country.\n  Now, there is a lot of pontification developing, as often happens \nwith the highway bill, but even more so this time. People are showing \nup, all of a sudden, worried about the costs of this bill. Lots of \npeople are saying: Wait a minute, this may add to the deficit. Where \nhave they been over the last 2 or 3 years? Where were they on the \nprescription drug bill when we were developing a bill that would cost \n$600 billion or $800 billion or who knows how many billions of dollars? \nThey were not worried about the deficit until the highway bill came up. \nAnd they said, wait a minute, the highway bill may cost too much.\n  The Finance Committee has struggled with how to pay for this bill. Is \nit perfect? No. But it was a major effort and we are within a close \nenough range where we can continue to make some adjustments as we go \nthrough the legislative process. Some people say: Once it goes through \nthe process, we may have to vote. That is exactly right. And we will \nhave to look at the final product. Is it something the Republicans, \nDemocrats, Senate, House, labor unions, the White House can live with? \nWe will never know until we move forward on it.\n  So we have people now saying that after ignoring the amount of \nspending last year--in bill after bill after bill--we are going to \nplant our flag on this hill, and we are going to fight excessive \nspending on the highway bill. They picked the wrong bill. This is a \npositive bill, and we will make it work as the process goes forward.\n  People will say: Well, wait a minute. There may be some earmarking in \nsome of these bills before it is over. Yes, there may be. Fine. And I \nam going to fight for my own State to get its share because I do not \nnecessarily believe that all wisdom reposes in the Department of \nTransportation in Washington, DC. I happen to know a little bit about \nsome of the real crises, projects, and problems in my own State, and I \ntrust Senators--men and women--from their own States to identify some \nof the needs that must be addressed in their home states.\n  Then there will be those who will say: This bill doesn't put enough \nfunding into mass transportation or it doesn't put enough funding into \none project or another. Let me point out a couple of things we are \ndealing with.\n  Our Interstate Highway System is nearly 50 years old. Thirty-two \npercent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. Twenty-\nnine percent of our Nation's bridges are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. If we do not complete action on this \nlegislation, we will wind up with a 1-year extension and we will be \nback next year. Some people would say, maybe we could do a better job \nin a nonelection year.\n  But I believe we need a carefully thought out, multiyear, \nmultifaceted federal highway and transportation program, and we need it \nnow. We are having difficulty on other bills, such as the energy bill. \nWe are trying to decide, what bills can we get done this year? Well, \nthere is one thing we should not leave undone this year, and it is this \nhighway bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to try to come to a conclusion \nthis week. If we have to have a cloture motion filed in order to make \nprogress, let's do that. I believe it will pass with a bipartisan vote. \nIt should. And then we can make progress on this bill and be ready to \ngo to conference with the House of Representatives where we can get the \njob done.\n  I know we are going to be getting calls with suggestions of delays. \nSome people do not like the formula. It is tough to come up with a \nformula that is fair to everybody, especially if you have been a big \ndonee State. If you are a small State or a big State that has been \ngetting back $1.21 for every $1 you pay into the highway trust fund, \nyou don't want to lose any funding. But if you are from a poor State \nthat has been getting only 50 or 75 cents on the dollar that your \nconstituents pay into the Highway Trust Fund, you want a fairer deal. \nBut it is not easy to try to come up with a formula that is fair to \nTexas and New York and Rhode Island and Oklahoma all at the same time. \nIt is really a balancing act.\n  I looked at the formula. I don't think the formula is as good as it \nought to be for Mississippi. We are just kind of in the middle. And \nwhen your state has been neglected for 138 years it needs to do a \nlittle better than being in the middle. But I prefer the progress we \nmake on this bill, to nothing. It is progress. So I do not think I have \nany more room to complain than anybody else.\n  But, again, we have some people who do not want to move toward a \nfairer formula for everyone. They do not want to give up anything they \nhave. But I think the formula Chairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords have \ncome up with is good enough. Can they still tweak it a little bit as \nthe bill moves forward through the process? Yes, they can; and I am \nsure they will.\n  So I hope my colleagues will not start blocking this bill with \nprocedural motions because they do not like the formula. I hope they \nwill keep working with the chairman and ranking member, as I will. I am \ngoing to curry favor with the chairman of the committee until the last \ndog dies to try to complete action on this bill in a way that will be \nfair to my constituents and good for the country. But I hope my \ncolleagues will not use the formula as an excuse to block the bill. I \nhope they will not use this newfound fiscal responsibility to hammer \nout the worst possible bill. If we will proceed together, working with \nthe chairman and ranking member, we will complete action on this bill, \nand it will be one of the best things we can do this year.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to comment on this bill. I \nthank the leadership for what they are doing. I was growing concerned \nthat too many people were possibly trying to conjure up some way to \nblock this legislation.\n  So let's keep the process moving. It is not just for the sake of the \nprocess, no. It is for better and safer infrastructure in this country. \nIt is for jobs. I wish the leadership of the committee the best, and I \nam going to be here trying to help them every step of the way.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, that was a great statement by the \nSenator from Mississippi. I appreciate it very much. It is a \nrecognition that a lot of people will think all of a sudden we came up, \nlast week, with a bill and a formula. They don't realize we have spent \na year--a year of our lives--working on a formula, looking into the \nsame things the Senator is talking about.\n  I am from a donor State. We have been a donor State as long as I have \nbeen up here. The Senator talked about working on TEA-21. You also \nworked on ISTEA in the beginning because I was there with you. Those \nformulas were not as good because they were based on minimum \nguarantees. A minimum guarantee is you figure, how do I get 60 votes, \nand then we don't care what happens to the rest of you. We did not do \nthat.\n  We considered the donee States, donor States, the fast-growing \nStates, because there is a ceiling in there for them, and then there is \na floor for some of the States that have either a low population or are \nlow-yield States. All these things were taken into consideration.\n  So anything that is as complicated and long as this is, you can pick \nit apart. But I can tell you right now, we spent a lot of time on it. \nThere are people who are interested in the transit part of it. There \nare some, such as the Senator from Ohio, who have been very much \nconcerned about and made great contributions to safety. Some of them \nare concerned about freight and the obstacles that are out there. But \nwe have it all in this one.\n  I feel good about this bill. It has taken a year to get where we are \ntoday. Frankly, you just cannot start\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nreadjusting a formula of which you took every consideration in putting \ntogether. You have something that is fair. You cannot then start \nreadjusting it. If you change one State, it changes all the other \nStates, and then you have to go back and start all over.\n  I think there are those who would prefer we would have to do that \nbecause they don't want to have a bill. But we are not going to operate \non extensions, and I have every expectation we will get a bill this \nweek.\n  People say: What about the House? They are going to want an \nextension. They are not where we are. Well, you are not going to get \nthem to do anything until we do something, in my opinion.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Mississippi making his \ncomments about this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I also add to the accolades to my good \nfriend from Mississippi for putting in perspective where we are and \nwhat we must do to make this a reality. This Nation cannot wait much \nlonger to have the funds that will be available under this bill in \norder to enhance the employment growth as well as the needs of this \nNation to be more efficient and effective in all categories of life. We \nmust work together. We must work quickly. And we should start today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, while the Senate began debating S. 1072, \nthe Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \nAct, known as SAFETEA, nearly 1 week ago, I am not sure some of my \ncolleagues have been informed about how this bill would impact their \nState's highway funding. While perhaps we have all taken a look at the \ntables distributed by the committee of jurisdiction a few weeks ago, \nthese tables omit some very important facts, including the fact that \nthe number of donor States would actually increase under the pending \nlegislation compared to the last reauthorization bill, TEA-21.\n  Instead of giving greater parity, it appears to be going in the \nopposite direction, as I will explain in a few minutes. Before I go too \nmuch further, I understand that after my colleague from Arizona was on \nthe floor last week in opposition to this legislation, the Senator from \nOklahoma went through some routine about how Arizona would do well \nunder this legislation. Rather than subject my colleague from Oklahoma \nto that again, I would suggest we swap formulas between Oklahoma and \nArizona. If the Senator from Oklahoma is not willing to do that, then \nplease don't waste my time and his in trying to convince me this is a \ngood deal for the State of Arizona.\n  First, I think it might help to put the bill in context by quickly \nreviewing the history of the Federal highway program, which I briefly \nmentioned on the floor last Monday evening. Nearly 50 years ago, the \nFederal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was enacted. As you can see, it was a \ndeceptively inconspicuous-looking piece of legislation. It was 29 \npages, but what it accomplished truly changed this country. The 1956 \nact created programs that constructed the interstate highway system, \nthe largest civil works project ever undertaken by the United States. \nThe act established the highway trust fund, financed by taxes paid by \nmotorists--financed by taxpayers, not by general revenue--which is an \nimportant aspect to look at as we consider this legislation. It \nrequired that the interstate be built using a uniform design that would \nbe safe within most U.S. highways in existence at that time.\n  The program to construct the interstate was first proposed by \nPresident Eisenhower in 1954 and signed into law in 1956. Today we are \nall the beneficiaries of the foresight of President Eisenhower and a \nCongress that helped to shepherd this bill through to enactment. The \ninterstate system is 47,000 miles long, comprised of 62 superhighways \ncrisscrossing the Nation in a grid. Twenty-four percent of all travel \noccurs on the interstate, and it has obtained a record being twice as \nsafe as other highways.\n  Unfortunately, when people look back 50 years from now at the highway \nlegislation currently before the Senate, I don't think history will be \nas kind. We reauthorize the multiyear highway transit safety programs \nabout every 6 years. We last reauthorized these programs in 1998 with \nenactment of TEA-21, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, following extensive debate in the Senate. The highway program \nreauthorization measure is a bill second to none in terms of attracting \nMembers' interests. We all want to know how much our States will \nreceive in highway funding under the byzantine formula distribution \nbeing proposed during each authorization debate. Therefore, because of \nits significance, it is important that each and every Member have an \nopportunity to know what the bill would do and how it would do it.\n\n  At this point, what exactly do my colleagues know about the real \nimpact this bill would have on their States? I recognize the \ndifficulties this reauthorization poses for the bill managers. I would \nprefer to be in a position to support their legislation. But in its \ncurrent form, I cannot.\n  The bill would increase highway funding by over $60 billion over the \nTEA-21 enacted level, again, over $60 billion, for a total of $255 \nbillion. At the same time, the bill not only perpetuates the donor/\ndonee discrepancy that we donor State representatives have battled \nduring every highway bill reauthorization, but it actually expands it. \nThe 28 donor States under TEA-21 will have the company of another three \nStates--New Hampshire, Oregon, and Wisconsin--if this proposal is \napproved.\n  I guess I could say something about misery loving company, but I \ndon't want more States to be shortchanged. Instead, I want all States \nto be treated more fairly. It amazes me that an additional $60 billion \nstill can't enable the authorizing committee to develop a fairer \nformula but, as demonstrated by EPW's funding tables, they cannot or \nperhaps simply will not. Where will this extra $60 billion go?\n  While the EPW Committee argues its bill would get every State to a \n95-percent rate of return by 2009, the sixth year of the authorization, \nI remind my colleagues that under TEA-21, the formula increased the \nminimum rate of return from 85 percent to 90.5 percent in the first \nyear, and it continued throughout the authorization period. Yet, again, \nthe EPW bill we are considering doesn't raise the floor to 95 percent \nuntil the sixth year. So, again, where exactly will this $60 billion \ngo?\n  The committee proposes a new so-called formula. I say that because it \nis not actually a formula but instead is a series of five calculations \nconsisting of funding caps and floors. This Rube-Goldberg-like funding \ncontraption is grossly unfair and would result in 31 States getting \nback significantly less funding than they contribute to the highway \ntrust fund. Further, while a number of the current bottom-of-the-barrel \ndonor States would receive an immediate step up from the smallest of \n90.5 percent rate of return, including a number of donor States with \nmembers on the committee, six States would receive almost no percentage \nincrease until the last year of the authorization in 2009.\n  Under this formula, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, \nand Texas would be held at the very bottom, while many other States \nalso would continue to get shortchanged.\n  This is not the right approach. It is unfair. We should do everything \nwe can to try to ensure that any bill voted on is more equitable for \nall States. Again, it isn't just these six States that I mentioned that \nare being asked to contribute more to the highway trust fund than they \nwill get back. I asked the Department of Transportation to provide an \nanalysis of the formula. I thought it would be revealing to first learn \nhow much each State would receive if the formula funds in the EPW bill \nwere distributed proportionately back to each State based on their \ncontributions to the highway fund.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, 31 States are donor\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nStates under this formula, while 19 get back more than they pay in, \naccording to this chart.\n  Let me give some examples. The people of California are being asked \nto send almost $2 billion to Washington, DC, so that it can be \nredistributed through some arcane funding scheme to the lucky 19 States \nthat would get back more than they put in.\n  For Arizona, $364 million of its contributions would be sent away to \nthe 19 States. You know, it is interesting, Arizona and California, \nneighboring States, have something in common that, frankly, neither \nVermont nor Oklahoma have, which is high growth. Obviously, it puts on \ngreater pressure when you have a high-growth population, which actually \nargues for increased funding. Instead, we are being shorted.\n  But here are other examples of funding. Florida, another high-growth \nState, would send away a billion dollars; Georgia would send away $643 \nmillion; Illinois would send away $403 million; Kentucky would send \naway $304 million; Michigan would send away $383 million; Missouri \nwould send away $286 million; New Jersey would send away $547 million; \nOhio would send away $517 million; and Texas would send away $1.7 \nbillion.\n  The list goes on and on. It is remarkable.\n  I fully realize that during the era when the Federal Government was \nbuilding the Interstate System, a redistribution of funding between the \nStates may have made sense. Clearly, it would have been difficult for \nMontana, for example, with fewer than a million people, to fully pay \nfor building its share of the Interstate System. But that era is over.\n  Congress declared the construction of the interstate complete in \n1991. Yet here we are, 13 years later, and donor States are still being \nexpected to agree to the redistribution of hundreds of millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars to other States, regardless of the already \nenormous transportation needs in donor States. Why?\n  I am sure we will hear about the great transportation needs of the \nStates that receive more than they contribute. I have no doubt that \nthose States do in fact have such needs. But how is it determined that \nCalifornia should have nearly $2 billion of its funding redistributed? \nWhy aren't California's transportation needs as worthy of receiving the \nsame percentage of Federal funds as provided to meet the transportation \nneeds of New York, for example, which will receive $989 million more \nthan it contributes over 6 years? Where is the logic? I am afraid there \nis none.\n  Let's consider New Hampshire and Vermont. These are two very similar \nsized neighboring States. Both have about the same total road and \nstreet mileage--around 15,000 miles. But under this EPW formula, New \nHampshire is a donor and Vermont is a donee, getting a windfall of \nalmost $500 million, or almost 190 percent of what it contributes. In \nfact, Vermont would even receive more in total dollars than New \nHampshire. There can be no policy rationale for that--none.\n  I will admit that I have a certain affection for the State of New \nHampshire--a great deal of affection for the State of New Hampshire. \nBut to have this kind of disparity between two States is rather \nremarkable.\n  Madam President, this bill is suspect. In fact, the tables that have \nbeen circulated by the EPW Committee actually raise more questions than \nthey answer. For example, what affect will new air quality standards \nhave on State allocations? The new formula included in the EPW bill for \nthe congestion management and air quality improvement program, a \nprogram totaling $13 billion, is not reflected in the tables.\n\n  What happens to State allocations if the bill is not fully funded? \nThe promise that your State, if you are a donor, will finally achieve a \n95-percent return by 2009 may be empty. In order to achieve a 95-\npercent rate of return for all States in 2009, it would require a 1-\nyear increase of $5.5 billion in 2009. How likely is that to occur, \ntaking into consideration the projected fiscal year 2005 budget deficit \nof $\\1/2\\ trillion continued budget deficit projections well beyond \n2009?\n  Here is a fundamental question, one I think the President is \nseriously considering: Are we really paying for this bill? The Finance \nCommittee has proposed what many of us consider to be accounting \ngimmicks to make the highway bill appear to be fully paid for. But \nappearances are often deceptive, as several colleagues have already \ndiscussed on the floor. How will the Finance Committee's proposed \naccounting changes for gasohol taxation impact your State's share? I am \ntold it will be dramatic for some States. Should the EPW Committee's \nfunding tables not be updated to reflect any and all changes so that we \nall know the real impact of what we are being asked to vote on?\n  What affect will provisions in a potential managers' amendment have \non your State's funding? Last Friday, on this floor, the chairman of \nthe committee announced that Members' staff should bring all of their \namendments to the committee staff on Saturday to determine if they will \nbe incorporated into the managers' amendment. Today, it was announced \nthat the EPW Committee staff met with 10 Members' offices over the \nweekend. The Democratic bill manager announced this afternoon that 34 \namendments have been accepted by the managers. What amendments are \nbeing accepted? I am sure we will know when we read the Congressional \nRecord. Should we not all be informed? Clearly, the managers' amendment \nneeds to be made available for review prior to us being asked to vote \non it. And will the EPW Committee distribute tables showing the impact \nof any funding changes that will occur under the managers' amendment? \nAgain, we should all want to know exactly what is being proposed and \nhow it will impact our State's funding.\n  I strongly support a long-term reauthorization of the Nation's \nsurface transportation programs and understand the vital nature of this \nfunding to our States. This legislation only comes before the Senate \nevery 6 years. I urge my colleagues to start asking some questions and \nensure that they fully understand how the safety legislation would \nimpact their State before it is allowed to pass the Senate.\n  We also have been told that at some point in the next few days, \nbefore we vote cloture on this bill, we will add a ``slimmed down'' \nenergy bill to the highway bill. Now, I will freely admit--in fact, I \nwill testify to the fact--that many times in our Nation's Capital we \neither are immune to, or insensitive to, the concerns of the American \npeople. Here we are looking at massive deficits, massive overspending, \nmassive growth of Government, unseen in the history of this country, \nand what are we going to do? We are going to add a ``slimmed down'' \nenergy bill.\n  I understand that it has gone from $31 billion to $18 billion or $13 \nbillion--you know, only in the teens of billions of dollars. This is a \nremarkable exercise. Adding an energy bill that was basically \nrejected--thank God--by this Senate, because of its hooters, looters, \nand polluters provisions, and now we are going to stick it on to the \nhighway bill.\n  What does the energy bill have to do with the highway bill? Nothing. \nDo we have no shame? Is there no embarrassment whatsoever about the way \nwe are doing business around here?\n  Madam President, I will continue to struggle and fight to see that \nfor these 19 States, the percentage of what they are getting, as \nopposed to what they donate, is also important, as opposed to the 31 \nStates which will be donating, and that we try to correct this \ninequity. Really what we should do is have a 1-year extension of the \nexisting legislation and go back at this again next year. I think that \nwould probably be of benefit to the taxpayers of America, who are \ndeeply concerned about our overspending.\n  I also point out that I think the attention of the President of the \nUnited States is on this issue. I have heard--not directly but \nindirectly--that he would contemplate a veto of this legislation. I can \nthink of no single act that might be more important or popular with the \nAmerican people than for him to veto this bill, because at least the \nfunding should come out of users fees, which was the fundamental \nprinciple behind the original highway bill.\n  If this Congress, in its wisdom, because we need more money for \nhighways, thinks we need to increase the gas tax, I think that is a \nsubject for\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\ndiscussion and debate. The American people are getting a little weary \nof this smoke and mirrors of passing a $400 billion Medicare \nprescription drug bill and finding out within weeks that it is $130 \nbillion more expensive, to see our deficit skyrocket from surpluses of \nseveral trillion dollars and deficits of several trillion dollars. And \nno one--no one--no economist believes we are going to have the deficit \nwithin the next several years because, guess what, Madam President. We \nare going to be coming back--among other overspending, including this \none--we are going to be coming back next year for another emergency \nsupplemental for our operations in Iraq which will probably be in the \nrange, at minimum, of about $50 billion.\n\n  I am hopeful that the American people will call a halt to this \noverspending. I am hopeful that the American people, particularly in \nthese 31 States, will recognize that for every dollar in taxes they are \npaying when they go to the fuel pump, they are getting less than that \nback because it is being funneled through Washington, DC, to the \nbenefit of States for which no rational argument can be made that it \nwould be more beneficial to them than other States, including those \nthat are experiencing very rapid growth.\n  I will continue, as some of my colleagues will, as long as we can to \nprevent the passage of this legislation. It is not only our obligation \nto our individual States that are not getting their money back for the \nfunds they send, but also to all the taxpayers of America who are being \nvictimized by this back-room, porkbarrel spending process which is \nreally remarkable.\n  Again I want to show my colleagues, in 1956, this was the highway \nbill, and now we all know what rests on our desks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was in this Chamber just a few days ago \nsinging the laurels of my friend from Arizona and saying what a fine \nman I thought he was, what great work he did on campaign finance \nreform. I was basically talking about my deep respect and admiration \nfor the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  Having said that, it does not mean I have to agree with everything he \nsays. I have to say, with the deepest respect, that on this issue he is \nsimply wrong.\n  There are certain things we have to do in this country that are \nlogical and, over the long term, make a great deal of sense. We have a \nnational highway transportation system started by President Dwight D. \nEisenhower. The simple fact that the interstate system has been \ncompleted, meaning all of the interstate system is finished, all the \nconnecting points have been made in this great puzzle, does not mean we \nhave obligations that cease with highways in this country.\n  We not only have a national highway transportation system, we also \nhave a national security system. The State of Nevada contributes \ngreatly to the security of this country. We have Nellis Air Force Base, \nwhich is the largest and most important fighter training center in the \nworld for our Air Force. We have in the northern part of the State the \nFallon Naval Air Training Center, which is the most important part of \nthe fighter training facility for our U.S. Navy. It is so important. \nPeople in that desert learn to fly landing on carriers.\n  We started in Nevada the great work that has been done on unmanned \nvehicles, military vehicles, the drones, at Indian Springs. We store \nthousands of tons of ammunition at Hawthorne Ammunition Depot. People \nfrom all over the country--the State of North Carolina, the State of \nArizona, the State of Vermont, the State of Oklahoma, all over the \ncountry--contribute to taking care of those military facilities. The \nState of Nevada cannot afford to do it all. The taxpayers in Nevada do \nnot pay for those bases even though there is a cyclical spinoff that is \nimportant to the State of Nevada. The State of Nevada depends on the \nAmerican taxpayers to make sure those civilian and military employees \nat those most important bases are taken care of.\n\n  I am the only Member who is in the Chamber who is on the \nAppropriations Committee. When we work for military construction \nprojects at Nellis Air Force Base, Fallon, and other bases I mentioned, \nthose construction projects are paid for by American taxpayers. People \nfrom all over the country make their tax payments. It comes to this \nCongress, and it is decided that Nellis Air Force Base needs new \nhangars or needs to buy some new land so that the people around the \nbase are not bothered. That is all paid for by American taxpayers. It \ndoesn't come equally from Nevada. The Congress does not say: As soon as \nyou get enough money in taxes to come from the State of Nevada, we will \nbuild that new hangar for the F-20s. That isn't how it works. The same \napplies to our National Highway System.\n  I am disappointed that the staff of the good Senator from Arizona did \nnot at least listen to what I said, Senator Inhofe said, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Bond said last Monday. I talked at that time \nabout how this bill is so much more fair than bills in years past.\n  Just a few years ago, there were some States that were only able to \nkeep 75 cents out of every dollar they contributed into the highway \ntrust fund for their own States. The rest of it went to other places. \nBut a decision was made, and it was not an easy decision--the Senator \nfrom Arizona knows around here you count votes, and when you have \nenough votes to get something passed, you pass it. In years past, \npeople counted votes around here. When they found they could get to 60 \nvotes, sometimes 51, the legislation was jammed through this body. That \nis why some States wound up not getting very much on the money they \npaid into the highway trust fund.\n  When the Senator from Arizona talks about this being pork--and we \nhave talked about that here quite a bit--this bill is basically paid \nfor by the highway trust fund. It is paid for by the fact of when \npeople go to buy a gallon of gasoline, they put money into a trust \nfund, and we are using those moneys now to distribute among the States. \nWe were a little bit short to cover everything that needed to be done \nin this bill, so in conjunction with the majority and the minority and \nmembers of this administration, we said, we are not going to raise any \ntaxes but we are going to readjust some of the taxes that are already \nin existence, and we did that to make up a small part of our highway \nbill.\n  To talk about pork and people are sick of money being spent--I didn't \nvote for the Medicare bill. I agree with him, that was a bad deal. You \ncannot come out here with one big paintbrush and paint everything the \nsame. Why is this country in such deep trouble with deficit? It has \nvery little to do with domestic discretionary spending. We could today \neliminate the FBI, close all the prisons in the country, close the \nDepartment of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, close the \nCongress, close the Supreme Court, close the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and we would still be in deficit. We simply do not have \nenough money coming into the Government to cover the expenses. Domestic \ndiscretionary spending--you can eliminate it all, and we still could \nnot balance the budget.\n  The fact is, because of the tax cuts that have taken place over the \nyears, we don't have enough money coming in to cover this. That is why \nlast year we had a budget deficit in excess of $500 billion. This next \nyear will be higher than that. It is not domestic discretionary \nspending. Especially don't pick on the highway trust fund, don't pick \non the highway bill.\n  From everything I have understood, all of the President's statements \nabout not liking the highway bill have nothing to do with the Senate \nversion of the bill. It is what they are talking about doing in the \nHouse. They want to spend more money than what we are spending. The \nPresident has not directed any of his comments to the Senate version of \nthe bill, as far as I know, and I think I pretty much know.\n  I know the good Senator from Oklahoma was on Fox News today \nexplaining that point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is well known that the President sent over \nthree criteria, one of which was funding has to come strictly from the \ntrust fund and not from general revenues. It is well known. It is \npublished everywhere. I am sorry the Senator from Nevada missed it.\n  Mr. REID. Was that a question?\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. I missed the question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator know that the President sent over very \nexplicit principles concerning the bill?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely. I would respond to my friend, yes. I have been \nin on the negotiations, yes. This is not something that has taken place \nover the last 2 weeks. This committee--Senator Inhofe, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Bond, and Senator Reid has spent months working on \nthis bill. Of course, the administration was in on every one--not every \none of them but a lot of those conversations. Yes, we originally wanted \na bill much bigger than this one, but because of the pressure we got \nfrom the White House and other places we have the bill now the number \nthat it is.\n  So I absolutely have followed this very closely. This bill is \nextremely important. This is the fourth or fifth highway bill I have \nworked on.\n  Before I was interrupted, I was talking about how much better this \nbill is than the bills in the past when States gave away 25 percent of \nthe money that came into their States. It was determined, when the so-\ncalled four managers started this, what we would like to do with \nlegislation. What we wanted to do was to try to work it out so that \nevery State of the 50 States would get 95 cents out of every dollar \nthey put into the trust fund.\n  Keep in mind this was a big leap forward because some States were \ngetting less than that. Let me just briefly go over, so that people who \nare watching this--staffs, Senators--understand how difficult this bill \nhas been. Let's go back to the bill of 1982 called the Surface \nTransportation Assistance Act. This bill established the mass transit \naccount of the highway trust fund. What this is all about is a \ndetermination was made to do everything we could do to keep people off \nof our highways, which saves the highway trust fund money. Therefore, \nwe would work to help with mass transit because if we had good bus \nservice, if we had monorail like we have in Las Vegas, if we have \nsubways like we have in various places, including Washington, DC, it \nkeeps people off the streets and saves us money out of the highway \ntrust fund. So that was the first time we established that. That was in \n1982, the first year the Senator from Arizona and I came to Congress.\n  It contained an 85-cent minimum return provision, meaning that all of \nthose States were getting in the seventies before they would get a \nminimum of 85 cents for every dollar they put into the trust fund. The \nFederal gas tax was increased from 4 cents to 9 cents back in 1982. So \nthat took care of that bill.\n  In 1987, this was a difficult year. That year President Reagan vetoed \nour bill. We had to override the President's veto. We did that. We did \nit by one vote in the Senate and they overrode it by a significant \nnumber in the House. It was a good bill. It was a bill that changed the \nspeed limit above 55 miles per hour. It included a provision requiring \nStates to be more concerned about the environment as they were doing \nthe road work.\n  Then 1991 was the first so-called ISTEA bill, Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act. Earlier, all of us talked about the \nimportance of Senator Moynihan and Senator Chafee and having a highway \nprogram in this country that was reflective of the changes to the \nInterstate Highway System that had been constructed. What we did in the \n1991 act was create the CMAQ; that is the Congestion Mitigation \nAir Quality Program. This was extremely important so that there would \nbe transportation conformity, air quality. With the Interstate System \nlargely complete, as I indicated, ISTEA shifted the Federal program \nfrom capital construction to focus on people and goods movement. There \nwere a lot of things we looked at in that bill that simply had not been \nlooked at before. We realized just building new roads was not the \nanswer to all of our highway problems, our congestion problems, our \ntransportation problems in the country. We came to the realization that \nwe talked a lot about that the whole country suffers when there is a \ntraffic jam.\n\n  Millions of gallons of fuel are wasted as cars sit and idle. They are \nthe most inefficient when they idle. We also came to the realization, \ntalked a lot about it, that when people are stuck in traffic they can \nno longer be productive workers. They cannot deliver their goods. They \ncannot be on their computers at work. They cannot be going to court. \nThey cannot be taking care of their patients. When traffic is stopped, \nit stops people from being productive. So we talked about that in the \n1991 ISTEA bill.\n  We also expanded the transportation decisionmaking process to include \nlocal officials, and even citizens.\n  Now, in 1998, we did TEA-21 which continued the basic policy \nstructure established in ISTEA. The reason that was important, from \n1982 to 1998 we had not changed the minimum requirements States would \nreceive. Six years ago when we took this bill up we said every State \nwill get 90.5 percent of the money they put into a program. That was a \nbig step forward involving a changing of formulas and billions of \ndollars changed. We did that. We thought it was fair.\n  In the bill we are taking up this year, we have even gone further. We \nhave said it is important that after we pass this legislation, States \nat the end of this bill will get 95 percent of what they put in.\n  My friend from Arizona is right; States that are getting 90.5 percent \nnow would rather get 95 percent tomorrow rather than at the end of this \n6-year period. But we are moving this ball down the line toward the \ngoal line, and I think we are scoring a touchdown. Even though the \nSenator from Arizona talks about how bad this bill is and how he does \nnot like it because of all the pork in it, I do not know what his \ndefinition of pork is. I really have some trouble understanding that.\n  This is a highway bill. There is some money spent for doing work on \nbridges. As was stated just a few days ago by the Senator from Florida, \nactually 29 percent of all bridges in this country are substandard. \nWhat we have done in this bill, S. 1072, is to try to make sure there \nis growth among the core programs of this bill, and we have created a \nnew program which is called the safe routes to school program. This has \nbeen accepted across the country as being important. We believe \nchildren should walk and ride bicycles to school as much as they can. \nIn some places they cannot do that because the traffic patterns are \nsuch that they cannot. So part of this money would be spent building \nbicycle paths and in effect making it easier for children to walk and \nride to school.\n  This reduces the rate of return gap between donor and donee States. \nSo I think we are doing the right thing in this bill. As I indicated, I \ncannot envision why my friend from Arizona complains about this being \npork. It is a highway bill. Is building a highway something that is \nbad? Is repairing an outdated, dangerous bridge bad? I do not think so. \nIs trying to improve air quality while doing construction bad? I do not \nthink so. So I do not know why my friend from Arizona is so angry and \nis talking about all of these bad things. This is a good bill.\n  As I indicated, the situation in dealing with our national defense \nsystem it is not based upon how much money a State pays into a program. \nIt is based on where we need the defense program. Using the theory of \nmy friend from Arizona, what would the State of Idaho do? Idaho is a \nbig State. It is a bridge State. It helps one get to California. If \nthey only got back the money they paid into the program, the roads in \nIdaho would be a mess. What about Wyoming? What about South Dakota? \nWhat about North Dakota? What about Alaska? If one takes off from \nSeattle and goes to Miami, that is how big the State of Alaska is. Now, \nthey do not have any people there. They do not pay much money into the \ngas fund. They need help. Their roads are very difficult to maintain.\n  Wyoming also has no people in it, basically. My friend from Arizona \nwants Wyoming to get the money they pay into the program, and that is \nall? This is the United States of America. We are a central whole \ndivided among self-governing parts, and we have a central government \nthat helps make these States not independent, saying every penny they \npay into the tax system is all they get out. It will never work that \nway.\n  My friend from Arizona, as much as I respect and understand what \ngreat contributions he has made to the country,\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\non this debate has added nothing. He has added nothing. He is just off \nbase. I don't know how else to say it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to take you back to when the highway \nprogram was started by President Eisenhower. As I remember, one of the \nbig concerns at that time was the inability of this Nation to defend \nitself, some real problems that were created for the defense of this \nNation, because the highway system from East to West and North to South \nwas so poor that in the event we did get an invasion in different \nareas, we would have little or no chance to get the troops there and \nmobilize them on the scene. We recognized at that time we had serious \ndefense problems unless we improved the infrastructure of the United \nStates. Am I correct in my understanding of that?\n  Mr. REID. I would say, through the Chair to my friend from Vermont, \nyes. Major Eisenhower was asked to bring a caravan of military vehicles \nacross the country. He did it, but it was not easy because the roads \nwere impassable on occasions. The people in the convoy had to work on \nroads as they came across the country. This young officer decided at \nthe time if he ever had the ability to change the condition of the \nhighways in our country, he would do it.\n  Lo and behold, Eisenhower is elected to be President of the United \nStates and one of the first things our Republican President does is to \npropose this program that is loaded with pork, that builds roads. \nPresident Eisenhower is responsible for the Interstate Highway System \nmore than any other person, and he did it because it met the needs of \nthis country.\n  As we said, the actual construction of the roads has been completed. \nOne of the last places it was done was in the State of Nevada. Actually \nit was in California, but it connected Mesquite, NV with St. George, \nUT. But they had to go through this terrible hard rock to finish the \nInterstate Highway System. It took a long time and it was extremely \nexpensive to do that, but there were a few little places like that \nwhich hung on for years until we could say we completed the system. We \ndid that. Now we have come up with programs that are so important. \nThere are roadways in the country that are just as important as the \nInterstate Highway System. That is why we have a program, the National \nHighway System. What this talks about is the offshoots of the \nInterstate System.\n  I have talked about this on the floor today. To get to my hometown of \nSearchlight is not easy to do. There are a couple of ways you can get \nthere. But this bill takes into consideration places such as \nSearchlight, NV. They are entitled to good roads also. You are not \nentitled to good roads just because you are on the interstate system.\n  This bill has gone such a long way to making the playing field more \nlevel. I commend my friend from Vermont and my friend from Oklahoma. We \ndidn't have to do this. We could have gotten enough votes to pass this \nlegislation without raising it to 95 percent at the end of this bill. \nBut it was believed by the committee we should do that, that we would \nraise every State to a minimum of 95 percent. We have done that. It was \nhard to do, but it benefits a lot of States and certainly the American \npeople and makes a system that is easier to explain and understand.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Do we not have other problems, in the sense of trying \nto move freight across the country and making the highways safe? We \ntook the intermodal transportation systems we had, and a lot of that \ntakes funds we would normally use, is that not true? Mr. Reid, yes. \nThat is why it was called intermodal transportation system--ISTEA.\n  The reason, as I said before, is we learned a few bills ago that just \nsimply pouring more asphalt is not the way to solve all the problems in \nthis country. What this bill takes into consideration is ways to more \nefficiently move people and products across our country. We have done \nthe best we can on this.\n  Again, I don't see how this, in any form or fashion, can be pork. \nThis is different than our regular appropriations bills. I think people \nare overly critical of those, but this is not even in the same \ncategory.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I also go back to some of Senator Moynihan's concerns \nyears ago. Now looking at what is going on in China and other places, \nwith the development of intermodal systems or the ability to travel at \nmuch faster rates of speed, to move--in their case--millions of people \nwho want to travel, is that not also something we are trying to look \nat, trying to make sure we will not lose our position in the world with \nrespect to our transportation methodology?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. When I served in the House of Representatives, I was \non the Foreign Affairs Committee. I was dumbfounded. We have all this \nsurplus food and we would take it to other continents, for example, to \nAfrica, and the food would never get where it was supposed to go. Why? \nSimple. There was no way of hauling it to the places where it was \nneeded. They had an insufficient transportation program in many of \nthese countries. People were starving to death and they couldn't get \nthe food where it was needed.\n  We don't have anything like that, but it does illustrate why we have \nto have the ability to move things easier. Each year that goes by, we \nhave to make it easier because we have competition around the world. \nThe more people who are tied up in traffic, in trucks and trains and in \npersonal vehicles, the less competitive we will be. That is what this \nbill is all about.\n  For my friend to suggest let's just extend this for a year, come back \nand look at it again--we have already done that once. The State of \nNevada and the other 49 States were grousing when we did that. Why? \nBecause these highway programs, many of them, are multiyear programs. \nIf they can't enter into a multiyear contract, it wastes a lot of \nmoney. It wastes money. Something that would have cost $3 million, if \nwe extend this now for an extra year, by the time we finish it could \nwind up costing $6 million, twice as much as it ordinarily would cost. \nWithout what we have in this bill, we would get a lot less product. \nExtending this bill for a year's time is not the way to go.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Also, isn't this a job creation bill and is this not a \ntime when this Nation is in dire need of improving the employment of \npeople who desire to have work?\n  Mr. REID. The former majority leader and minority leader of the \nSenate, the distinguished junior Senator from Mississippi, was on the \nfloor today and that is one of the things he talked about.\n  We talk about job creation. Here it is actually taking place. This \nbill will be responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \njobs in this country--millions of jobs. For every $1 billion we spend \nin infrastructure, we create 47,000 jobs.\n  In addition to those 47,000 jobs we will create spending $1 billion \nhere, the spinoff of this, according to Senator Frist, the majority \nleader of the Senate, is $6.2 billion that flows from that. This bill \nis a win-win for everyone.\n  I am at a loss as to why my friend from Arizona would come and try to \nthrow this into the same pot as: Boy, we are spending too much money \naround here. This is like Medicare.\n  It has nothing to do with that. These moneys come from the highway \ntrust fund with the exception, which we have already acknowledged, that \nsome moneys are coming from the reshuffling of taxes that are already \nin existence. There are no new taxes.\n  I hope the ship is not tilted even a little bit from these statements \nmade by my distinguished friend from Arizona because they should be \naccorded very little weight.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I appreciate the contributions of the \nSenator in helping us better understand the need for and also the great \nbenefits of this legislation. I am sure when Members go to a vote--if \nwe ever get to a vote--we will overwhelmingly accept the Senator's \nconcept of what should and could be done. I appreciate what the Senator \nhas done to make this bill as good as it is.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I close by saying again I want the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Oklahoma to understand how much I \nappreciate their work on this legislation. We have to keep our eye on \nthe prize. This is, as Senator Lott said, probably the most important \npiece of legislation we will pass all year. He said that an hour ago, \nand he is absolutely right. This could be the most important \nlegislation we pass all year\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\nto stimulate the economy, to create jobs, to help States become and \nremain competitive, and to ease traffic burdens and congestion which we \nhave throughout our country.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would like to make one further \nstatement. The Senator from Arizona indicated we dramatically changed \nthe highway formula. The bill reported out of the EPW Committee, in \nfact, does not change the underlying formulas for interstate bridges, \nnational highways, and air quality. The only change we made was to \nincrease the return to donor States while ensuring growth to each and \nevery State. The EPW Committee wanted to put forth a bill that achieved \nfair balance and growth in every State. As in all of our national \nprograms, we direct resources in our bill to the 50 States in order to \nmaintain a national system. If we only sent funds to programs on a \nState-by-State basis, and then based it only on the ratios of the taxes \npaid from each State, we would be balkanized and disunified.\n  I believe our bill is fair, balanced, equitable, and national in \nscope. As States grow, donor States grow. Every State is equipped to \ncarry the share of the burden it is supporting on the national \ntransportation system.\n  This is a good bill. Let us get it done.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I believe it is always very difficult \nwhen we get a complicated formula. We have been talking about how \ncomplicated the formula is when you take into consideration the growth \nof States. We are dealing with low-population States. We have a floor. \nWe have donor States and donee States. But the Senator from Arizona is \nright when he said we actually have more donor States than we had under \nTEA-21. The disparity amount is far less between the donor and donee \nStates. We are calculating that now. I think the point needs to be \nanswered, and I think we are going to be prepared to do it.\n  A State such as New York, for example, has gone from $1.25--in other \nwords, $1.25 for every dollar that has been put in--down to 99.75. That \nis down to getting back everything they have put in, but it is dropping \ndown substantially from the amount in the previous bill.\n  I have looked at States to try to defend myself in being fair on \nthis. If you look at TEA-21--that was Senator Moynihan, Representative \nSchuster, and Senator Chafee--Moynihan's State went up to $1.25; \nSchuster, $1.20; Chafee, $2.16, and mine--and I am chairman of the \ncommittee--is only going to go up to $.95. And we are still going to be \na donor State. I think that should demonstrate we are being fair on \nthis.\n  To suggest that Colorado is getting a raw deal, they have the highest \nrate of return of any State. But formulas are complicated. I am not \ncritical of the Senator from Arizona. There will be others down here \nwho do not want this bill to pass, and it might not have anything to do \nwith the formula. No one can argue that this formula is the only fair \nformula we have.\n  How many times on the floor of the Senate in previous years have \nMembers waited until they got 60 votes and took care of 60 Members and \nthen turned around and not cared what happens to the rest? We don't do \nthat. It would be easy if we did that. We talk about countervotes, and \ngo back and get it passed.\n  As far as the Finance Committee, I think they have done a good job. \nThey don't have their final product out. But I know the criteria on \nwhich they are working, and I am very proud of Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for the work they have done. It might be that there is \nsome money being taken out of the general fund which is being put back \ninto the highway trust fund. But that is replacing money that came out \nof the highway trust fund which went into the general trust fund. In \none fell swoop, $8 billion went out of the general fund. These are \nraids on the highway trust fund.\n  I believe this is a moral issue. If a State pays the money, they \nanticipate that money being paid because they use their roads. It is \ngoing to go into road maintenance and road construction and bridge \nconstruction.\n  Our State of Oklahoma is still number 50 in condition of bridges. \nThere is a lot to be done all around the country. There will be some \npeople who do not like this bill for reasons having nothing to do with \nformula. But you can always take a formula and pick it apart and make \nit sound unfair. This is not unfair. This is a fair way to approach it. \nI believe it is real equity.\n  As I say, we are now calculating this. The States that went from a \ndonee status to a donor status are a very small amount. But it is \nclosing that disparity between the donee and donor States. This is \nprecisely what we have been trying to do.\n\n  If the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Vermont were talking \nabout job values in this bill--look at any State and you can see the \njob opportunities. There is not one piece of legislation we are going \nto be dealing with during this entire year which is going to have the \neffect on jobs this is going to have. Pick out any State. You can see \nthe total amount of new jobs. It is close to 3 million jobs--and job \nopportunities. We have a jobs chart, and then we have a jobs \nopportunity chart. We know there will be construction jobs. We know \nthat is going to happen. But keep in mind every time you hire someone \nto do more construction, that person is also going to go out and buy \nmore goods and services. They will have to manufacture more, and that \nis going to employ more people. We have calculated that. That is a very \naccurate figure.\n  I know there are a lot of Members who are going to be opposing this \nbecause they may not like some of the freight provisions. Perhaps their \nStates are not treated in a way that other States are treated because \nthey do not happen to be a poor city or they do not happen to be a \nterminal city. Nonetheless, I think Senator Reid made a good statement \nwhen he said this is not just one State but it is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Again, on the particular State of Arizona, that is a 40-percent \nincrease, which I think is very fair. In fact, that is a greater \nincrease than the average increase States have.\n  Let me say to the Senator from North Dakota that he has been very \nkind in working into our schedule at times when we were not working on \nthe highway bill. I do appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2276\n\n       Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have just informed the staff \n     of the managers of the bill that I intend to offer an \n     amendment. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 2276.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the penalty for nonenforcement of open container \n                             requirements)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1409. OPEN CONTAINER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 154 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (c) and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Transfer of Funds.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary shall withhold the applicable percentage \n     for the fiscal year of the amount required to be apportioned \n     for Federal-aid highways to any State under each of \n     paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section 104(b), if a State \n     has not enacted or is not enforcing a provision described in \n     subsection (b), as follows:\n\nThe applicable percentage is:\nFiscal year 2008.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2009.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2010.............................................2 percent.\nFiscal year 2011 and each subsequent fiscal year.............2 percent.\n       ``(2) Restoration.--If (during the 4-year period beginning \n     on the date the apportionment for any State is reduced in \n     accordance with this subsection) the Secretary determines \n     that the State has enacted and is enforcing a provision \n     described in subsection (b), the apportionment of the State \n     shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of the \n     reduction made during the 4-year period.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this amendment very simply deals with \nthe question of open containers of alcohol in automobiles and moving \nvehicles on the roadways. Some perhaps will not believe this, but there \nare some locations in this country where it is still\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nlegal to put one fist around the neck of a bottle of whiskey, use the \nother hand to put the key in the ignition, and then with a hand on the \nsteering wheel and a hand on a bottle of whiskey drive off down the \nroad. And it is perfectly legal. Some would say that can't be. Yes. It \nis. It is the case. In some parts of this country, you can't be drunk \nwhile you drive, but you still can drink while you drive, and you are \nperfectly legal.\n  I don't think there is any intersection in any part of this country \nwhere you or your family or your neighbors ought to meet a vehicle, an \nautomobile, that is being driven by someone who is drinking alcohol, in \na circumstance where it is legal for them to drink alcohol while \nmeeting you at that intersection. That is unforgivable, in my judgment. \nI have been trying, I suppose for 10 or 12 years, to get this done. I \noffer this amendment again. It simply says to the States: You must have \na prohibition on open containers of alcohol in State law. If not, you \nlose 2 percent of your highway funds. And for up to 4 years you can get \nthe funding restored if you pass the prohibition, but you must have a \nprohibition of open containers that meets the Federal requirement.\n  We have that federal requirement. I was instrumental in getting it \npassed into law. It says you must have a prohibition on open containers \nof alcohol, and if you do not, some of your highway money goes to \nhazard mitigation. So we have 36 States that have actually passed \nstatutes that prohibit open containers of alcohol; 14 States have not \npassed statutes that meet this test. A number of them still get the \nsame amount of highway money, but because money is fungible, they use \nit for hazard mitigation and use the money on the other side and there \nis no pain involved at all.\n  The result is that we have States in this country where it is, one, \nlegal, or, two, illegal but not enforced, where people are driving \nwhile they are consuming alcohol. I don't think it ought to be the case \nanywhere in America for it to be legal to drink and drive.\n  Every 30 minutes someone receives a call in this country that their \nloved one has been killed due to a drunk driver. I received that call \nat about 10:30 one evening, a moment I will never forget. My wonderful \nmother was killed by a drunk driver. She, like so many others, was \ndriving down the street 30 miles an hour, coming from the hospital at 8 \no'clock at night, and a drunk was coming in the other direction, \nwitnesses say at speeds between 80 and 100 miles per hour, in a high-\nspeed police chase, and ran into my mother's car and she was killed.\n  This carnage on America's highways that is caused by someone drinking \nand driving is not some mysterious illness or disease for which we do \nnot know the cure. We know what causes this, and we know how to stop \nit. The way to stop it is to say to people all across this country: You \ncannot drink and drive. Just that simple. You just cannot do it. Yet \nthere are still States in this country in which it is legal to drink \nand drive. And there are other States in which it is legal, if the \ndriver does not drink, that other passengers in the car can have open \ncontainers of alcohol.\n  It is long past the time for us to stop it. We have passed \nlegislation that tries to coax the States into doing this, and many \nhave complied by passing legislation that prohibits open containers of \nalcohol. Now I say let's go the next step, to say to the States: It \ndoes not matter where you are driving in this country. We expect, as \npolicymakers, never to have to meet someone at an intersection where \nthe driver or the passengers in that car are drinking, and doing so \nlegally. We know better than that.\n  Again, every 30 minutes someone receives a call that some member of \ntheir family was killed by a drunk driver. That simply means that \nsomeone took a drink of alcohol, took too much alcohol, got drunk, got \nbehind the wheel, and turned the automobile into an instrument of \nmurder. We can do better than that in this country. I suggest this \npiece of legislation is long overdue.\n  It is interesting to note that the States that do not have a \nprohibition of open containers of alcohol on the books have alcohol-\nrelated fatalities that are higher than the States that do have that \nprohibition. So the evidence exists that the prohibition works.\n  It is true that I grew up in a State that is not going to be affected \nby this because North Dakota has never allowed anyone to have an open \ncontainer of alcohol in the vehicle. I grew up understanding you do not \ndo that; no one ought to do that. If you are old enough to drink and \nyou want to drink and it is legal for you to drink, you do not drink in \na vehicle. There are places for you to drink--in your home or perhaps \nin an establishment somewhere, but not in a vehicle, not in a car.\n\n  It is also the case that those States that have prohibitions on open \ncontainers of alcohol have a lower rate of hit-and-run accidents. That \nis a fact. The Department of Transportation has that information. It is \njust common sense for a State to say to people, you cannot do this, No. \n1, by law; and, No. 2, in enforcing the law, you will have fewer deaths \nas a result of drunk drivers.\n  Let me finally say something about an organization called Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving. It was not too many years ago that a drunk \ndriving charge by the neighbor had others giving him kind of a knowing \nwink and a nod and a grin and a pat on the back, saying: Well, tough \nluck, Charlie; you got caught. Not anymore. Now it is serious business. \nDrunk driving is not a joking matter. Do you know what changed that? \nMothers Against Drunk Driving--all across this country, that \norganization, started by mothers who had lost children and lost loved \nones to drunk drivers and decided they were going to make a difference. \nThey went statehouse to statehouse, capital to capital, and they put in \nplace some tough laws. But it is still not enough. I am pleased to say \nMothers Against Drunk Driving have supported what I am trying to do in \nthe Senate today for some long while.\n  They have made a difference. We can help them make an even greater \ndifference by passing this amendment and saying to the States: We are \nnot fooling around. This is serious business. This is life or death for \nthousands of people.\n  As I indicated previously, I have offered this amendment prior to \nthis time, I suppose on three or four other occasions. Each time I have \noffered the amendment, I have been told: Those sanctions are too tough. \nSo they got changed, so that it attempts to coax the States to do the \nright thing. But the fact is, coaxing is not enough. This Congress, \nthis Senate, ought to say to every State in this country, ought to say \nto every State, reflecting every jurisdiction, there should be not one \ncorner, not one highway in this country, in which it is legal for \npeople to drink and drive at the same time. That is the policy that \nought to come out of this Senate.\n  A mandate? It is a mandate, no question about that. We propose a \nnumber of mandates from time to time on a bill such as this. It is not \na mandate that will hurt any State. No State will lose money if only \nthe States decide as a matter of common sense that in their State it \nshall never be appropriate and never be legal for people to have an \nopen container of alcohol in the vehicle, it shall never be allowed in \ntheir State for people to be able to drink and drive simultaneously.\n  People will shake their heads and say it cannot possibly be the case \nthat that would exist today, but it is, long after the time that should \nhave been changed in some little corners of this country.\n  That is the amendment I offer. I know my colleagues from Oklahoma and \nVermont have pleaded with people to come and offer amendments. I hope \nthey will approve this in 5\\1/2\\ or 6 seconds, but perhaps it will \nrequire more discussion because, as is always the case, I understand, \nthere are some who have heartburn when I propose a significant mandate. \nAnd this mandate is 2 percent of highway funds, although no State, in \nmy judgment, would ever lose it and no State need ever lose the highway \nfunds if only they decide, as we have decided, that it ought not be \npermissible to drink and drive at the same time anyplace in this \ncountry and it ought not be permissible to have an open container of \nliquor in a passenger vehicle on America's highways.\n  That is a devastatingly simple concept and one that I hope before we \nfinish this highway bill will be approved by this Senate.\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, first, I say to the distinguished \nmanager and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on \nwhich I have been privileged to serve some 16, 18 years, I commend him \nfor his diligence and commitment to try to get this highway bill \nthrough the Senate and hopefully enacted into law. I had much the same \nresponsibility some 6 years ago. I know the complexity of this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  I have worked with the distinguished chairman and the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri in the preparation of this particular measure. It \nis badly needed by America. I hope we can work our way through this \nsituation.\n  I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The amendment is already at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. WARNER. I address the distinguished manager of the bill and ask \nunanimous consent to have this amendment called up and possibly agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished manager had the courtesy \nto advise me that he would object. Given the situation which I think I \nunderstand, I would just like to speak to the bill and develop a record \nfor today and hopefully eventual consideration of this amendment in the \nnot distant future can be arranged.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Clinton, and my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. DeWine. It is an amendment to increase our national seatbelt \nuse rate to some 90 percent. This amendment is identical to the text of \nlegislation I introduced last year, S. 1993.\n  If my colleagues examine the highway bill and what it means to each \nof our States, our foremost responsibility, in my judgment and in the \njudgment of many, and in the judgment of the President of the United \nStates, must be to improve highway safety for the driving public.\n  Today we had a very impressive press conference. I will give further \ndetails about it shortly. We must have had a dozen or so \nrepresentatives who spoke on behalf of their respective organizations \nendorsing this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of \norganizations endorsing this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations Supporting S. 1993, The National Highway Safety Act of \n 2003--Sponsored by Senator John W.

Mr. President, this is a list of 135 organizations across \nAmerica that advocate their support for this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  This chart is an enumeration of those organizations. It is not \nreadable, but the list is in the Record for all to see.\n  Simply by increasing the number of Americans who will buckle up is \nthe most effective step that can be taken to save their lives and the \nlives of others. That is the single most important step.\n  I am privileged to serve on this committee, as I said, that has the \nprimary responsibility for reauthorizing TEA-21. The bill addresses, as \nit should, highway safety measures, such as how to build safer roads or \nhow to use new technologies to improve safety. But--and I underline \n``but''--statistics show that the greatest measure of safety again to \ndrivers, passengers, and possibly third parties, many of them innocent \nthird parties, not connected with the bill is through the use of the \nseatbelt. It is remarkable the lives that have been saved through the \nuse of this simple device over the years.\n  America has about a 79-percent use rate of seatbelts. That has been \ntranslated into the saving of tens of thousands of lives and injuries \nin automobile accidents, but we can do better. Those are the facts. Are \nwe just going to have a standstill or are we going to move forward? \nSenators Clinton, DeWine, and myself think we should move forward with \na firmer approach with achievable goals and funding.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  We have debated the benefits of seatbelt use on many occasions in \nthis body and elsewhere across America. Whether it is in the town \nforums we conduct, the town meetings, or on the floor of the Senate, \nthere is always that individual who comes back: Don't tell me what I \nhave to do. What does it matter to you--they will often say, or to any \nother colleague with whom I have had the privilege to serve--what does \nit matter to you whether I buckle up? It matters a great deal to me and \nto all those who share the joys but often the burdens--the increasing \nburdens--of driving and using our road system and the risks.\n  Let's take a look. No one disputes that the absence of wearing a \nseatbelt causes more loss of life and serious injury. Statistics \nsolidify that assumption. The statistics show that the impact \nassociated with a crash, to the extent a driver can maintain control of \nthe vehicle in those fatal seconds, the severity of the crash, and \nperhaps the loss of life can be reduced significantly by the use of the \nsafety belt. It is as simple as that.\n  Accidents involving unbelted drivers result in a significant cost. \nMany people are rushed from the accident scene to various emergency \nfacilities. All of that has the initial cost of the law enforcement and \nthe rescue squads that respond, and eventually the cost to the \nemergency room or whatever medical facility you might have the good \nfortune to be taken to hopefully save your life. That does not come \nfree. How well we know that.\n  There is a cost. It is borne by the local community often or the \ncounty or the State. Regrettably, a number of persons who suffer these \ntypes of injuries are uninsured. Again, the cost often devolves down on \nthe good old hard-working taxpayers and, in most instances, the \ntaxpayers who otherwise would buckle up.\n  That is lost time for your mission on the road, be it for business, \nfamily, or pleasure. That is lost time in productivity. Behind you are \noften trucks and other vehicles involved in commerce. That is lost time \nin delay due to the serious occasion of injuries and accidents from the \nlack of use of seatbelts. It is simple as that. Often the highway is \nshut down, and it is just incalculable the inconvenience and cost to \nothers while your safety and perhaps your survivability is attended to \nmore often than not by volunteer fire departments or others who come to \nthe rescue.\n\n  The legislation that we three Senators are introducing today will \ntake an important step for the States to adopt either a primary safety \nbelt law or take steps of their own devising to meet a 90-percent \nseatbelt use rate, not the Warner amendment or the legislative measure \nput forth by the administration upon which Senator Clinton and I draw \nfor concepts of certain portions.\n  The States can decide for themselves--I wish to underline, we are \nchallenging the States to decide for themselves how they achieve a 90-\npercent goal of the use of seatbelts in their respective States. They \ncould have a far better idea than we have. That is the purpose of this \nlegislation, to move every State to a 90-percent use rate for safety \nbelts.\n  In a letter dated November 12, 2003, to Chairman Inhofe of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, on which, again, I am \nprivileged to serve, Secretary Mineta states:\n\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single--\n\n  I repeat, the single--\n\n     most effective means to decrease highway fatalities and \n     injuries.\n\n  That is explicit and clear. The Secretary goes on in that letter to \nsay:\n\n     . . . the surest way for a State to increase safety belt \n     usage is through the passage of a primary safety belt law.\n\n  I have had this debate with Governors, former Governors, even in this \nChamber with former Governors. I think they would all say that a \nprimary safety belt law is tough legislation to pass solely on its own \nin the State legislatures. Those in this Chamber who have been members \nof State legislatures know best. Those of us who have worked with State \nlegislatures, as I have over the 25 years I have been privileged to be \na Senator, I have some idea of how those legislatures operate. \nCertainly, those who have been Governors--and many of my colleagues in \nthis Chamber have been Governors--know full well the difficulty \nconfronted at the State level in getting this type of law through.\n  Frankly, it needs the cover, one might say the political cover, the \nimpetus, given by the Congress--that is us, Uncle Sam--of the United \nStates to move that process in the States forward.\n  So the local politicians can shake their fists at old John Warner, \nthey can shake their fists, hopefully, at those who will join in \npassing this legislation and say it is Washington that has done it \nagain--more regulation, more direction. We know the arguments. We have \nall heard them. But lives and injuries and costs to the community can \nbe saved.\n  I think quietly, in the hearts of those State legislatures, is the \nthought that we will improve safety in our State. We will improve the \nchances of survivability on the roads of our State.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of Secretary Mineta's letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. As provided in our amendment, States can increase \nseatbelt use by enacting, as I said, a primary seatbelt law. Everybody \nknows what a primary seatbelt law is and how it works.\n  I want to explain the basic laws as shown on this chart. The white \nState has a primary enforcement seatbelt law. Those are the existing \nStates. The red State needs a primary enforcement seatbelt law. So my \ncolleagues can see the magnitude.\n  Here is my State, Virginia. Twice now that primary seatbelt law has \ngone through the legislature up to the point of a final vote, and by \none vote only, twice, the General Assembly of Virginia has rejected \nthat primary seatbelt law. That is a clear reason that impetus by the \nFederal Government can help achieve that one vote and hopefully many \nmore.\n  Now, let's talk about the mechanics. It means a law enforcement \nofficer can literally stop a vehicle if they observe that the \nindividual is not wearing his or her seatbelt. It is as simple as that. \nBut a State, if they decide not to enact a primary seatbelt law, can, \nby implementing their own strategies, whatever they may be--and there \nis a lot of innovation out in the States--that would result in a 90-\npercent seatbelt use rate. So that is a challenge to the States.\n  It can be achieved by other means other than having the officers \nunder law be given the right to stop the vehicle when he observes that \nthe driver is not using a seatbelt.\n  The current national seatbelt use, as I said, is 79 percent. But many \nStates, those that have the primary law, are sometimes at 90 or even \nabove 90, but those that do not have the primary seatbelt law are down \nsomewhere in the 60 percentile. Just think, only 60 percent of the \ndrivers in some States utilize that seatbelt. It is the weight of the \nprimary States that carries the percentile and brings it up to 79 from \nthose States that do not have an effective law. States with their \nprimary safety belt law have the greatest success for drivers wearing \nseatbelts.\n  On an average, States with the primary seatbelt law have a 10 to 15 \npercent higher seatbelt use compared to those with a secondary system. \nThis demonstrates that secondary seatbelt laws are far more limited in \ntheir effectiveness than a primary law.\n  Essentially, the secondary laws say if a law enforcement officer has \ncause other than a perceived or actual seatbelt violation, namely the \ndriver did not have it buckled, if they have cause to stop that car, \nfor example, for a speeding offense or a reckless driving offense or \nindeed an accident, and they observe there has been no use of the \nseatbelt, then in that circumstance, in the course of proceeding to \nenforce the several laws of that State as regards speeding and reckless \ndriving or whatever the case may be, they can add a second penalty to \naddress the absence of the use of the seatbelt in that State.\n  Drivers are gamblers, unfortunately, but that is the way it is. They \nsay: Oh, well, don't worry. I will not buckle up--State law does not \nrequire it--unless they stop me, and they are not going to stop me \ntoday.\n  It is that gambling attitude that more often than not will cause an \naccident. Then it is too late.\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n  So we come forward today to build on our national program. We are \nbuilding on what we did in TEA-21. I was privileged to be on that \ncommittee at that time. I was then, as I said, chairman of the \nsubcommittee 6 years ago. I worked with the late Senator John Chafee. \nWhat a distinguished and able Senator he was, and those who were \nprivileged to serve with him have fond memories of working with him. He \nwas chairman of the full committee. We drove hard to make progress for \nthe seatbelt laws, and we did it. This chart shows the result.\n  We basically put aside a very considerable sum of money to encourage \nStates, again, by using their own devices, to increase usage. As a \ndirect consequence of what we did in TEA-21, there has been an 11-\npercent increase in these 6 years in the use of seatbelts. Now, that is \nsignificant, but it could be much greater and stronger.\n  Sadly, traffic deaths in 2002, just one fiscal year, rose to the \nhighest level in over a decade. It is astonishing. Of the nearly 43,000 \npeople killed on our highways, over half were not wearing their \nseatbelts. Now, that is a considerable number of individuals. That is \naccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In the \njudgment of the people who responded to the accidents, they considered \nthat 9,200 of these deaths might have been prevented if the safety belt \nhad been used.\n  Those are the alarming statistics. Automobile crashes are the leading \ncause of death for Americans aged 2 to 34. Stop to think of that, age \n2. That means a child. That means a parent neglected to buckle up the \nchild. Automobile crashes are the leading causes of death for Americans \nage 2 to 34. That is our Nation's youth. So many of them are in the \nArmed Forces of the United States. Passage of this will be helpful to \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Do we have a higher calling in the Congress than to do everything we \ncan to foster the dreams and ambitions and the productivity of our \nNation's youth? I think not. And this is one of the most effective \nmeans to do it.\n  Last year, 6 out of 10 children who died in car crashes did not have \nthe belt on; 6 out of 10. That is over half. I plead with colleagues to \njoin me, join with the President of the United States, join with the \nSecretary who has taken this initiative.\n  My primary responsibility in the Senate--and this is one of the \nreasons I got interested in this subject--is the welfare of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, as I mentioned. I say to colleagues again, \nthe statistics are tragic. Traffic fatalities are the leading noncombat \ncause of death for our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines. \nThey are in that high-risk age category, 18 to 35. I repeat, it is the \nlargest noncombat cause of death.\n  Someone even took a look at the statistics and totaled the fatalities \nlast year and said that represents in deaths the size of an average \nU.S. Army battalion. That is a lot of folks. That is one of the \nprincipal incentives I have. I cannot think of any reason why we all \ncannot join behind this effort. That alone is the driving impetus for \nthis Senator.\n  The time is long overdue for a national policy to strengthen seatbelt \nuse rates. I said a national policy, and that is what this bill \nrepresents, either through States enacting a primary seatbelt law of \ntheir own conception and devising or passing this law, giving far \ngreater attention to public awareness programs that result in more \ndrivers and passengers wearing safety belts. Our goal is 90 percent for \nthe Nation.\n  I have been privileged to serve on this committee 17 years and I, \ntogether with many others, notably my dear friend, the late chairman, \nSenator John Chafee, addressed this issue. Our committee is rich in the \nhistory of focusing revenue from highway trust funds on effective \nsafety programs. It goes back through many chairmen and members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  With jurisdiction over the largest share of the highway trust fund, \nour committee has had the vision to tackle important national safety \nprograms. The legislation before us does provide more funding to help \nbuild safer roads. That is a step forward. But it does not have, in my \njudgment, that provision which represents a step up from what we did in \nTEA-21, that provision that would represent a recognition for the \nPresident's initiative.\n  The President has taken a decidedly strong initiative to increase the \nuse of seatbelts. It is absent from the bill, and that is why we need a \nprovision, by virtue of this amendment, to strengthen and move forward \nthe position of the Congress on the position of increased use of safety \nbelts on America's highways and roads. That is the purpose of this \namendment.\n  It is just unfortunate that those with reckless intent quickly \ndisregard responsible behavior and drive unbelted at excessive speeds, \nand many times with the use of alcohol. So no increased dollars for \nimproving road engineering, which is in this bill--and I commend them \nfor that, but that alone cannot defy, in many instances, the type of \npersonal conduct that results in reckless behavior. In other words, \nengineering can quickly be overcome by the reckless driving, and \nparticularly that associated with alcohol.\n\n  Automobiles now come equipped with crash avoidance technologies and \nare more crashworthy than ever before. But these advances are only a \nvery small part of the solution. In repeated testimony before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee from the administration, from \nour States, safety groups, and the highway insurance industry, we are \ntold three main causes of traffic deaths and injury are unbelted \ndrivers, speed, and alcohol.\n  The formula we have devised in this legislation does have a reduction \nin the amount which the State receives under the proposed bill that we \nwill consider next year when they fail to achieve the 90 percent safety \nbelt use rate. It is as simple as that. But the formula is patterned \ndirectly after the law that is on the books now with respect to the .08 \nlegal blood alcohol content level.\n  In other words, the formula we have in this amendment is identical, \nin terms of that what I call inducement--carrot/stick type of \nlegislation--that we did for the .08 legal blood alcohol.\n  The net effect of this legislation is simply to recognize we are \nasking the same type of sanction policy with regard to one of the three \nmajor causes of death--alcohol--be equated to a second cause of death \nand injury, and that is the absence of the use of seatbelts, bringing \ninto parallel two of the three principal causes of death and injury on \nthe highways: .08 and mandatory use of seatbelts.\n  The administration put forward an innovative safety belt program, as \nI said, under the leadership of the President, and that was a major \ncomponent of a new core transportation program, the Highway Safety \nImprovement Program, submitted to the Congress. Our amendments \nincorporate the administration's bill and include additional incentives \nfor States to increase seatbelt use rates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record today a deeply \nmoving statement delivered by the representative of the American \nMedical Association, strongly in support of this legislation, and a \nletter from the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, strongly in \nfavor of this legislation. Of course, the letter to the distinguished \nchairman, Mr. Inhofe, from the Secretary of Transportation is already a \npart of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                 February 9, 2004.\n\n  AMA Applauds Legislation To Promote Seat Belt Enforcement and Safety\n\n\n    AMA Speaks at Congressional Press Conference to Urge Seat Belt \n                           Amendment Passage\n\n       On behalf of the American Medical Association, I'm proud to \n     stand here with Senator Warner in support of enforcing seat \n     belt use. Preventing deaths and injuries on our nation's \n     roadways has been a priority of the AMA for many years. In \n     fact, over the last seven years the AMA has distributed more \n     than 16 million brochures on protecting children in motor \n     vehicles, and just last year we released a physicians' guide \n     to assess and counsel older drivers. Requiring all states to \n     enact a primary enforcement seat belt law or achieve a seat \n     belt use rate of at least 90 percent will help protect \n     Americans on the road.\n       We know that wearing seat belts saves lives. Over half of \n     the 43,000 people killed on America's highways in 2002 were \n     not wearing seat belts. Tragically, six out of 10 children \n     who died that year in motor-vehicle collisions were also not \n     wearing seat belts. Just\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n     taking one moment to buckle-up could make a life-or-death \n     difference to the thousands who needlessly die on our \n     roadways every year.\n       For those lucky enough to survive a devastating auto crash, \n     the health care costs can be staggering. On average, \n     hospitalization costs for unbelted traffic crash victims are \n     50 percent higher than for those who buckled-up. The needless \n     deaths and injuries that result from not wearing seat belts \n     cost society an estimated $26 billion annually in medical \n     care, lost productivity and other injury-related costs.\n       These deplorable statistics are reversible. We can \n     significantly reduce deaths and serious injuries from motor-\n     vehicle crashes by enforcing seat belt use nationwide through \n     a primary enforcement law like the one Senator Warner is now \n     proposing.\n       In my home state of Michigan, a primary enforcement law has \n     been in effect for three years. In that time, nearly 200 \n     lives have been saved, and over 1,000 serious collisions have \n     been averted because of this change in the law.\n       As a physician, it is a rare blessing to be in a situation \n     where we can easily identify the solution to a public health \n     threat. Passage of the primary enforcement seat belt law will \n     save lives. It's that simple.\n                                                        Ron Davis,\n     AMA Trustee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Virginia Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                   Richmond, VA, February 9, 2004.\n       The Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police (VACP) \n     endorses S. 1993, a bill to create incentives for the states \n     to enact primary safety belt laws. In 2002 in Virginia, we \n     had 913 automobile fatalities. Of those 913 fatalities, 438 \n     (62.7%) were not wearing a safety belt. In those 913 fatality \n     crashes, 9,912 injuries were sustained by unbuckled \n     occupants.\n       Under our current secondary enforcement law, Virginia's \n     front seat safety belt use is 74.6%, which includes drivers \n     and front seat passengers. Research tells us that front seat \n     occupants of vehicles involved in potentially fatal crashes \n     in states with primary safety belt laws have a 15 percentage \n     point higher belt use than persons in states without primary \n     laws.\n       The VACP supports the passage of primary safety belt laws \n     as a proven tool to increase safety belt usage and reduce \n     serious injuries and fatalities in the event of a traffic \n     crash. Public education and enhanced traffic enforcement \n     efforts have failed to increase Virginia's safety belt usage \n     rate much beyond 75%. States with primary safety belt laws \n     consistently experience safety belt usage rates up to 90%. \n     The VACP believes that the passage of a primary safety belt \n     law in Virginia will increase belt usage and save the lives \n     of countless Virginians.\n\n                                               Dana G.

James Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: With almost 43,000 people dying every \n     year on our nation's highways, it is imperative that we do \n     everything in our power to promote a safer transportation \n     system. The Bush Administration's proposal to reauthorize \n     surface transportation programs, the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 \n     (SAFETEA), offers several bold and innovative approaches to \n     address this crisis.\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single most effective means to decrease \n     highway fatalities and injuries. As a result, SAFETEA's new \n     core highway safety program provides States with powerful \n     funding incentives to increase the percentage of Americans \n     who buckle up every time they get in an automobile. Every \n     percentage point increase in the national safety belt usage \n     rate saves hundreds of lives and millions of dollars in lost \n     productivity.\n       Empirical evidence shows that the surest way for a State to \n     increase safety belt usage is through the passage of a \n     primary safety belt law. States with primary belt laws have \n     safety belt usage rates that are on average eight percentage \n     points higher than States with secondary laws. Recognizing \n     that States may have other innovative methods to achieve \n     higher rates of belt use, SAFETEA also rewards States that \n     achieve 90% safety belt usage rates even if a primary safety \n     belt law is not enacted. I urge you to consider these \n     approaches as your Committee marks up reauthorization \n     legislation.\n       While safety belts are obviously critical to reducing \n     highway fatalities, so too is a data driven approach to \n     providing safety. Every States faces its own unique safety \n     challenges, and every State must be given broad funding \n     flexibility to solve those challenges. This is a central \n     theme of SAFETEA, which aims to provide States the ability to \n     use scarce resources to meet their own highest priority \n     needs. Such flexibility is essential for States to maximize \n     their resources, including the funds available under a new \n     core highway safety program.\n       I look forward to working with you on these critically \n     important safety issues as development of a surface \n     transportation reauthorization bill progresses.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Norman Y. Mineta.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to say Senator Murray has asked to join as a \ncosponsor and I so request that be noted on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, more than 1200 high school students from \nacross the Nation will come to our Nation's capital this summer to \nenhance their knowledge and understanding of the history and philosophy \nof our Nation's most important documents: the Constitution and Bill of \nRights. These ambitious students will be participating in the annual \nnational competition of ``We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution.'' This laudable effort, which is federally funded, is the \nmost extensive educational program in the country designed specifically \nto educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of \nRights. At a time when a study by the National Association of \nEducational Progress shows that three-quarters of America's students \nare not proficient in either American history or civics, the importance \nof this program is unquestionable.\n  ``We the People . . .'' helps our students not only appreciate our \nconstitutional democracy, but it allows them to ``participate'' in it. \nStudents start with an instructional program where they learn about our \nGovernment's primary institutions while they discover the relevance of \nour Constitution and Bill of Rights to their daily lives. Their lessons \nthen simulate real-life when the students participate in a \n``Congressional hearing'' where they ``testify'' before a panel of \njudges. By using the principles and knowledge they've learned in the \nclassroom to role play, these students have the opportunity to delve \ninto and appreciate both historical and contemporary issues facing our \nNation.\n  This program is not just reserved for high school students. ``We the \nPeople \n. . .'' recognizes that civic education should not wait until the \nstudents are almost able to vote. Teachers are encouraged to engage \ntheir students in simulated hearings at the elementary and middle \nschool levels. In fact, more than 24 million students and 75,000 \neducators have participated in the ``We the People'' program since its \ninception in 1987. Throughout the years, several of my staff members \nhave served as judges in the State competition.\n  This year, I am proud to inform the Senate that East Grand Rapids \nHigh School will represent Michigan in this prestigious event. These \nstudents demonstrated their exceptional command of issues relating to \nthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the state competition held \nin Lansing.\n  The ``We the People . . .'' program continues to be one of the best \nefforts to counteract the feelings of political apathy and cynicism \namongst our Nation's youth. I wish the students at East Grand Rapids \nand all the students across the Nation who will be competing in this \nyear's competition the best of luck. I know my colleagues will join me \nin recognizing the contributions the ``We the People . . .'' program \nhas provided to students across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S715-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S715-S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in commemorating \nAfrican-American History Month and in\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nrecognizing a crucial part of our diversity: the vast history and \nlegacy that African Americans have contributed to the founding and \nbuilding of our Nation.\n  In 1915, Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson founded the Association for the \nStudy of Negro Life and History, which shortly after its creation, \nbegan a campaign to establish Negro History Week. In 1926, the second \nweek of February was chosen to recognize the contributions of African \nAmericans to American society. In 1976, this week of observance was \nexpanded to a month and became African-American History Month.\n  Each year, the Association, now known as the Association for the \nStudy of African American Life and History, designates a theme for the \nBlack History Month observance. This year's theme, ``Before Brown, \nBeyond Boundaries, Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Brown v. Board \nof Education of Topeka'' marks one of the most seminal moments in the \nfight for equal rights in this country--the Supreme Court's May 15, \n1954 ruling that ``[i]n the field of public education, the doctrine of \n`separate but equal' has no place.''\n  It was a ruling that was met with violent resistance and created \nenormous upheaval. A number of States adopted policies of ``massive \nresistance'' seeking to avert compliance with the Court's decision. \nMany went so far as to adopt resolutions calling for the State \nGovernment to interpose itself, parens patriae, between its citizens \nand the Federal government's efforts to impose desegregation.\n  But in the years that followed Brown, inspired by the framework for \nprogress that the Court had provided, our civil rights leaders and the \nmovement they created never backed down. They instead redoubled their \nheroic efforts often in the face of great risk of personal harm.\n  From the refusal by Rosa Parks to move to the back of a public bus, \nwhich ignited the Montgomery bus boycott, to efforts of the Rev. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. and many others to secure civil rights and desegregate \npublic facilities, to efforts of the NAACP to clarify and expand the \nFirst amendment's protections related to free association, Brown's \neffects were felt across the Nation and beyond the sphere of public \neducation.\n  And, of course, Thurgood Marshall--who I should note was born in \nBaltimore and attended Frederick Douglass High School--was at the \ncenter of these efforts. After graduating at the top of his class at \nHoward Law School, Marshall came back to Baltimore and, after working \nwith NAACP to accomplish the landmark result in Brown led the legal \nfight thereafter to extend its precedent throughout the civil rights \narena. After leaving the NAACP, Marshall put his convictions, \ndetermination, and legal prowess to work as a Federal judge, then \nSolicitor General, and ultimately the first African-American Justice on \nthe Supreme Court. There, he was, as Justice William Brennan remembered \nhim, the ``voice of authority . . . the voice of reason . . . [a]nd a \nvoice with an unwavering message: that the Constitution's protections \nmust not be denied to anyone and that the Court must give its \nconstitutional doctrine the scope and sensitivity needed to assure that \nresult.''\n  At the beginning of the last century, our Nation was a vastly \ndifferent place than it is today. The country was divided along racial \nlines and racism was accepted and institutionalized. African Americans \nwere not allowed to vote, and the opportunities available to African \nAmericans were few.\n  Today, thanks to the visions of a few and the sacrifices of many--and \nin significant part thanks to the lasting effects of Brown--that \nsituation has changed. After much hardship, African Americans have made \ngreat strides in many areas and now participate in every sector of our \nsociety. Throughout the past 100 years, African Americans have made \nremarkable contributions to the Nation and the world as mathematicians, \nscientists, novelists, poets, politicians, and members of the armed \nservices.\n  Through the lessons and struggles of the last century and the trying \nfirst few years of this century, Americans have shown the world how \npeople of all races, colors, religions and nationalities create the \nfabric of our Nation, a fabric that is richer because of our \ndifferences. This month, we honor the special contribution African \nAmericans have made to that fabric.\n  But there is much work left to be done. When in 1981 the City of \nBaltimore unveiled a statue to Marshall, the Justice told the gathered \ncrowd ``I just want to be sure that when you see this statue, you won't \nthink that's the end of it. I won't have it that way. There's too much \nto be done.'' So we take the occasion of African-American History Month \nto celebrate the steps that we have taken toward equality, but also to \nremind ourselves of how far we have to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES: PRIVATE DWAYNE TURNER, 101ST AIRBORNE \n                          DIVISION, U.S. ARMY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the heroic service of \nPvt Dwayne Turner, 23, a combat medic in the United States Army, from \nIndianapolis, IN. Private Turner is a member of the U.S. Army's 3rd \nBattalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, which came \nunder grenade and small arms attack in Baghdad, Iraq on April 13, 2003.\n  According to U.S. Army Sgt Neil Mulvaney, the convoy was under a \nheavy amount of fire from Iraqi resistance forces. During the attack, a \ngrenade struck the Humvee in which Private Turner was riding, seriously \ninjuring both his legs with shards of shrapnel. Ignoring his injuries, \nPrivate Turner bravely fulfilled his duty as a combat medic, selflessly \nputting the lives and comfort of others before his own. While treating \n18 other soldiers' injuries, Private Turner was shot in the arm and leg \nbefore Sergeant Mulvaney had to physically restrain him to administer \nmedical treatment for Private Turner's increasingly severe injuries.\n  When asked by the Associated Press to reflect upon the events of the \nattack, Private Turner humbly said, ``I don't consider myself a hero at \nall. I just figured everybody was going to go home and nobody was going \nto die on my watch.'' However, BG Frank Hemlock's description of \nPrivate Turner's actions seems much more fitting: ``He is a bona fide \nhero. He saved two lives without question and patched up 16 other \nlives.''\n  In honor of the lives he saved through his unhesitating valor, \nPrivate Turner has been awarded the Silver Star, an award earned by \nnothing less than true sacrifice. May this award stand as a reminder to \nPrivate Turner that neither his comrades nor their grateful loved ones \nwill soon forget his heroic actions.\n  As I reflect on Private Turner's service, I am reminded of a quote by \nDouglas MacArthur: ``The soldier, above all other people prays for \npeace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of \nwar.'' The United States will be eternally grateful for the courage and \nbravery Private Turner exhibited on the field of battle.\n  I know that all Hoosiers share my deep sense of pride in Private \nTurner and all of the men and women of our Armed Forces from Indiana \nwho safeguard our country's freedom. My thoughts and prayers are with \nhim as he continues his recovery and begins to make his new goal to \nbecome a civilian physician a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S716-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S716-S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INDIANA STATE TROOPER SCOTT A. PATRICK\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to and honor the \nremarkable life of Scott A. Patrick, an Indiana State Trooper who was \nkilled in the line of duty.\n  During the early morning of December 22, 2003, Trooper Patrick \nstopped to assist what appeared to be a stranded motorist. Shortly \nthereafter, Trooper Patrick was gunned down by the assailant and passed \naway. He was 27 years old.\n  Trooper Patrick graduated from Kankakee Valley High School in 1995 \nwith an academic honors diploma. While in high school, Trooper Patrick \nexcelled in football and wrestling, earning numerous awards. Those who \nknew him remember Trooper Patrick as intelligent, industrious, and \nkind. He attended the University of Southern Indiana on both academic \nand carpenter's scholarships. While at USI, Trooper Patrick was active \nin a variety of\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nsports and was a starting member of the rugby team. He also worked at \nthe university library to supplement his scholarships.\n  Trooper Patrick met Melissa Clark in 1996 while attending USI. They \nwere engaged in February of 1999 and wed on a July afternoon during the \nSummer of 2000. In January that same year, Trooper Patrick was offered \nand accepted his position with the Indiana State Police. He was \nassigned to the Lowell Post.\n  Trooper Patrick was a devoted family man who relished his time with \nloved ones. When he learned that his wife was pregnant, just days \nbefore his death, he could not have been more excited and full of joy. \nMay his child be brought into the world and raised knowing that his or \nher father was a brave, hard-working and loving man who was proud to be \na father.\n  Trooper Patrick was a role model not only for his family, but for all \nwho knew him and whose lives he touched. He dedicated his life to the \nnoblest of causes: his family, his job and keeping others safe.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Scott A Patrick into the \nCongressional Record. As Trooper Patrick rests with God in eternal \npeace, let us never forget the courage and sacrifice he displayed when \nhe laid down his life on December 22, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S717-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY MYOTT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the long \nand distinguished career of Mr. Larry Myott, one of our Nation's most \nrespected maple syrup specialists and a longtime friend. After nearly \nthree decades with the University of Vermont Extension Service, Larry \nretired last week. Known by many as ``Mr. Maple,'' Larry has played an \nintegral role in growing the Vermont maple industry into a $220 million \na year industry. His educational work with Vermont farmers and his \nmaple syrup promotion efforts have played a key role in expanding \nmarkets for producers, allowing more producers to make a living in the \nmaple industry. While Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in \nthe United States, Larry's work has transcended the State of Vermont. \nHe has traveled throughout the United State and into Canada to assist \nmaple producers and promote Vermont's maple syrup.\n  I offer my gratitude for Larry's friendship and his great work on \nbehalf of the State of Vermont's maple industry. I ask that an article \non Larry's career be printed in the Record.\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n   ``Mr. Maple'' Retires From University of Vermont Extension Service\n\n                            (By Lisa Rathke)\n\n       Montpelier, VT.--Larry Myott just got an e-mail from Taiwan \n     asking him when Vermonters ``squeeze'' sap from their trees.\n       The inquirer wanted to visit Vermont during the height of \n     the maple season.\n       Myott, the maple specialist for the University of Vermont \n     Extension Service gets letters from school children, from \n     maple syrup buyers and from producers all over the world. \n     They ask how to store maple syrup, if it's pure and what to \n     do about crystals that form in the syrup.\n       ``I'm often called `Mister Maple,' '' says Myott, 59, who \n     will retire in January after 28 years with the Extension \n     Service. Gov. James Douglas and others will pay tribute to \n     the maple man at a dinner Saturday.\n       Myott has educated and assisted maple producers across \n     Vermont and promoted Vermont's maple products throughout the \n     world.\n       He travels to Minnesota, Nova Scotia and Virginia to learn \n     what's new, share his expertise and spread the word about \n     Vermont's products.\n       ``Larry has a love for the maple industry that is hard to \n     surpass,'' says Jacques Couture, president of the Vermont \n     Maple Sugarmakers Association, who was making maple candy at \n     his farm in Westfield Wednesday. ``He's a real promoter of \n     maple syrup, and he's done it actually by promoting maple \n     syrup to helping producers on the educational side.\n       ``It's been a life pursuit for him to see the maple \n     industry by the best it can be.''\n       Myott became the maple specialist in 1988, after serving \n     as Chittenden County Extension agent, and working with \n     vegetable growers and dairy farmers.\n       And the maple industry today doesn't look anything like it \n     did then.\n       ``Very seldom do you see buckets in the woods any more. You \n     don't see horses anymore,'' he says from his Ferrisburgh \n     home, where he is recovering from a stroke earlier this \n     month.\n       Sugaring has grown from a side business for dairy farmers \n     to a year-round profitable operation for large producers, he \n     says.\n       In 1988 the average producer had 1,000 taps and generated \n     250 gallons of syrup a year. Ten years later, the average \n     size grew to twice that.\n       Now a large-scale sugarer might produce as much as 40,000 \n     to 50,000 gallons a year, he says.\n       New technology such as a system that uses a vacuum to pull \n     sap out of trees; reverse osmosis, which removes water from \n     sap without heat by using a high pressure filter system; and \n     super-efficient evaporators that boil sap with less heat, \n     have made sugaring far more efficient.\n       Producers have expanded to meet the demand, and prices are \n     now high enough for them to make a living, he says.\n       ``Sugarmakers are able to make a living in the maple \n     business today,'' he says.\n       The syrup is also better than it used to be. ``The quality \n     has changed tremendously,'' he says.\n       And efforts by the state to promote the Vermont image and \n     products and draw tourists have increased sales of maple \n     products.\n       Vermont sugarmakers made 430,000 gallons of syrup last \n     year, bringing in an estimated $18 million to $20 million, \n     Myott says. According to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, \n     the entire maple industry generates over $200 million a year.\n       The annual Maple Festival, a local fair started in 1937 in \n     St. Albans, now draws as many as 50,000 people from around \n     the world, Myott says.\n       Vermont, the largest producer of maple syrup, is one of \n     only a few states to have a maple specialist. But Myott's \n     reputation stretches far beyond the Green Mountains.\n       ``Because he's articulate, because he writes a lot, because \n     he'll take telephone calls from anyone at anytime. That \n     reputation spans not only Vermont and the region but also \n     internationally,'' says Gary Deziel, Northwest regional chair \n     of the UVM Extension Service.\n       Although he's retiring Jan. 30, Myott says he will remain \n     involved in the maple industry. He will continue to write \n     about maple for Farming Magazine, Maple Views, Country Folks \n     Magazine and Country Magazine. And he will always take \n     questions from Taiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S717-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On November 14, 2001, Milwaukee resident Pablo Parrilla was charged \nwith first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the death of \nhis lesbian sister's girlfriend, Juana Vega. The shooting occurred when \nVega went to the home of her girlfriend's family to reconcile an \nargument. Instead, Parilla confronted her outside the house and shot \nher repeatedly. Parrilla apparently told Vega ``I'm going to kill you \nbecause you are gay'' and ``because you turned my sister gay.''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S717-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S717-S718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE GIRL SCOUTS' WILDERNESS ROAD COUNCIL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

This year the Girl Scouts in central \nand eastern Kentucky are taking on a new challenge with their annual \ncookie drive. They have started ``Operation Milk and Cookies,'' a \nprogram sponsored by the Girl Scouts' Wilderness Road Council that aims \nto give a box of Girl Scout cookies to families that can't afford them.\n  The Girl Scouts have always afforded a young women the unique \nopportunity to enhance her communication and social skills, to develop \na strong sense of self, to participate in innovative programs, and to \nfoster her creative side. But by participating in Operation Milk and \nCookies, these young women are learning how to be productive and pro-\nactive citizens, who will some day have the chance to change the way \nthe world works. They are learning at an early age how important it is \nto help others that are less fortunate and how\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nto be selfless contributing members to the community.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of Kentucky are proud to have Girl \nScouts' Wilderness Road Council's troops living and learning in their \ncommunity. Their example of hard work and determination should be \nfollowed by all in the Commonwealth. The Girl Scouts' Wilderness Road \nCouncil have found a successful way to bring out the best in its young \nwomen, and I personally thank the leaders and supporters of this great \norganization for continually producing strong and bright young women \ncommitted to making Kentucky a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S718-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING EDWARD N.

On Saturday, February 14, \n2004, friends and family will gather in Mandan, ND to celebrate and \nhonor Edward N. Friesz on his eightieth birthday.\n  Edward Friesz was born on February 14, 1924 to Adam and Magdalena \nFriesz on a farmstead near Fellon, ND. The oldest of nine children, \nEdward worked on his parents' farm before moving to Mandan to live and \nwork. He worked at various places before retiring in 1989 from the \nMorton County Courthouse.\n  In 1951, Edward met Elsie Frohlich, a friend and coworker of his \nsister, Irene. Edward and Elsie were married on September 30, 1953 in \nBismarck. Last fall, the couple celebrated their 50th wedding \nanniversary.\n  Mark Twain once wrote, ``Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles \nhave been.'' Edward's greatest joy in life--the origin of many of those \nsmiles--is his family.\n  Edward and Elsie started their family in 1954 with the arrival of \ntheir first child, Delphine. Their family would grow to include three \ndaughters, Delphine, Sharon and Annette, and three sons, Kennard, \nGerard and Maynard.\n  Edward and Elsie are also proud grandparents. They have 10 \ngrandchildren ranging in age from 25 to 1. They include: Trever, Anton, \nMaria, Elizabeth, Alec, Jakob, Brett, Rachael, Ryan and Adam.\n  While the family has spread throughout the country, they remain very \nclose. The family comes together for birthdays, anniversaries, holidays \nand special occasions. Twelve years ago, the family started a new \ntradition: a summer campout. Armed with tents and campers, sleeping \nbags and lanterns, the Edward and Elsie Friesz family embark each year \non a weekend campout to share food, fun and fellowship.\n  Over the past 12 years, they have camped in North Dakota, South \nDakota and Minnesota. They have endured rainstorms, thunderstorms, and \ncold and hot temperatures. As the family has grown, so have the annual \ncampouts. One year, they even designed t-shirts to commemorate the \nfamily tradition.\n  This Valentine's Day, February 14, 2004, the family will get together \nagain this time to celebrate their patriarch's 80th birthday.\n  I extend a warm birthday greeting to Edward Friesz and wish him well \non his 80th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S718-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HERMAN A. MACDONALD, OREGON VETERAN HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor an Oregon \nveteran who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to \nhis country and to his State. Herman A. ``Mac'' MacDonald was born in \n1929 in Boston, MA and has lived in Oregon since the 1978. Mac's entire \nlife has been dedicated to serving America, its veterans, and citizens.\n  Mac's military career began shortly after he graduated from high \nschool in 1948, when he joined the United States Coast Guard Reserves \nwhile attending Bryant College. After graduation, Mac joined the United \nStates Marine Corps, as an officer. Mac's military career sent him to \ndistant lands to defend America's interests. He served in combat on the \nmain line of resistance in Korea; he was stationed in Virginia, Hawaii, \nIllinois, California and Japan. He served as the Commanding Officer of \nForce Reconnaissance at Camp Pendleton. He also served in Vietnam as \npart of the top-secret Studies and Observation Group, SOG. Along with \nthe team, Mac served with Marine Reconnaissance, Navy SEALS, and the \nGreen Berets.\n  After Vietnam, Mac was transferred to Marine Headquarters in \nWashington, DC, where he became a military aide for Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, George Romney. Mac's military background \nprovided Secretary Romney with important insight for policy decisions. \nFollowing his service with the Secretary, Mac moved to Toronto, Canada, \nwhere he was an instructor at the Canadian Forces Command and Staff \nCollege. He returned to the United States in 1976, and retired from the \nmilitary in 1978. Upon retirement, he had earned a total of 24 ribbons, \nfive of which were personal decorations, in addition to Presidential \nUnit Citations from the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps.\n  For Mac, retirement meant a chance to follow a new dream. His \ncompassion for children brought him to the classroom, where he became a \nteacher. From 1978-1985, Mac taught in the Salem School District in \nOregon, where he worked with troubled teenagers. He became the \nprincipal of the Woodburn Gervais alternative high school and retired \nin 1999.\n  Mac continues to serve veterans today as an advocate for Oregon \nveterans' organizations. He is also the curator of the Oregon Military \nEducational Display, a collection of uniforms, medals, and artifacts \nfrom various wars throughout history. The items are put on a display \nfor a month each year at the Oregon State Capitol.\n  Mac has lived in West Salem since 1978 and is proud to call himself \nan Oregonian. He's been marred to his wife Vi for 46 years and has two \ngrown children, and two grandsons.\n  For his selfless service to others, and to the United States in times \nof war, I salute Herman A. ``Mac'' MacDonald as an Oregon Veteran \nHero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S718-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S718-S719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RUSSELL H. PHELPS III, UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with friends and family \nto recognize the efforts and dedication of CDR Russell H. Phelps III, \nan outstanding American. Commander Phelps began his military career in \n1908 as an Arabic linguist assigned in Athens, Greece. Working in a \nnational airborne reconnaissance program, he supported U.S. military \nmissions to Lebanon, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Honorably discharged in \n1985, he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Northern Iowa \nin 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations.\n  He earned a Naval commission as a Special Duty Officer (Cryptology) \nupon completion of the Officer Candidate School in September 1988, \nwhereupon he was assigned to the Naval Security Group Activity (NSGA) \nRota, Spain. During that tour, he was assigned to the staff of the \nCommander, Middle East Force, Bahrain, and aboard USS O'Bannon (DD-987) \nand USS Aubrey Fitch (FFG-34) in support of Operation Earnest Will, the \nescort of re-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Arabian Gulf. Between \n1989 and 1991, Commander Phelps was additionally assigned to the USS \nWainwright (CG-28), USS Baton Rouge (SSN-689), USS Silversides (SSN-\n679), USS Providence (SSN-719), and to the USS Pittsburgh (SSN-720) \nduring combat support operations throughout Operation Desert Storm.\n  Commander Phelps next assignment was to the USS Oldendorf, where he \nserved as the Cryptologic Officer, Tactical Action Officer, and for 6 \nmonths as the Operations Officer, culminating in his qualifications as \na Surface Warfare Officer. Detaching in 1994, he reported to Menwith \nHill Station, Harrogate, England, and served as a Deputy Division Chief \nand member of the Regional Security Operations Center (RSOC) transition \nteam.

These challenges affected business \nand consumer confidence and resulted in hardship for people in many \nindustries and regions of our Nation. Americans have responded to each \nchallenge, and now we have the results: renewed confidence, strong \ngrowth, new jobs, and a mounting prosperity that will reach every \ncorner of America.\n  This Report, prepared by my Council of Economic Advisers, describes \nthe economic challenges we faced, the actions we took, and the results \nwe are seeing. It also discusses our plans to continue growing the \neconomy and creating jobs.\n  In May 2003, I signed a Jobs and Growth bill that focused on three \nkey goals. First, we accelerated previously passed tax relief and let \nAmerican households keep more of their own money to save, invest, and \nspend. Second, we increased incentives for small businesses to invest \nin new equipment and plant expansions. Third, we enacted important tax \nrelief on dividend income and capital gains to help investors and \nbusinesses. These actions were designed to promote investment, job \ncreation, and income growth. By all three measures of performance, we \nare seeing signs of success.\n  Since May 2003, we have seen the economy grow at its fastest pace in \nnearly 20 years. Consumers and businesses have gained confidence. \nRetail sales are strong, and Americans are buying, building, and \nrenovating houses at a record pace. Investment has strengthened, with \nspending on business equipment the best in 5 years. The unemployment \nrate has fallen from its peak of 6.3 percent last June to 5.7 percent \nin December, and employment is beginning to rise as new jobs are \ncreated, especially in small businesses. Productivity growth has been \nstrong, leading to higher incomes for workers, while the tax relief we \npassed means that American families keep more of their money instead of \nsending it to Washington.\n  We are moving in the right direction, but have more to do. I will not \nbe satisfied until every American who wants a job can find one. I have \noutlined a six-point plan to promote job creation and strong economic \ngrowth. This plan includes initiatives to help manage rising health \ncare costs to make health care more affordable and accessible for \nAmerican workers and families, reduce the burden of junk lawsuits on \nthe economy; ensure a reliable and affordable energy supply; simplify \nand streamline government regulations; open foreign markets for \nAmerican goods and services; and allow businesses and families to keep \nmore of their hard-earned money and plan with confidence by making our \ntax relief permanent. This year, I will work with the Congress to \nachieve these goals.\n  I will also continue to work with the Congress on another important \nshared goal: controlling federal spending and reducing the deficit. The \nfederal budget is in deficit, foremost because of the economic slowdown \nand then recession that began in 2000 and the additional costs of \nfighting the war on terror and protecting the homeland. We are \ncontinuing to take action to restrain spending and bring the deficits \ndown. By carefully evaluating priorities and being good stewards of the \ntaxpayer's money, we will cut the budget deficit in half over the next \nfive years.\n  The task of reducing the deficit will become easier because America's \neconomy is growing. We have taken the actions needed to restore growth, \nand we are pursuing additional policies to help create jobs for \nAmerican workers and families. I'm optimistic about the future of our \neconomy because I know the values of America and the decency and \nentrepreneurial spirit of our people.\nGeorge W. Bush.  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S719-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S719-S721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-6198.

Con. Res. 88\n\n       Whereas members of the uniformed services of the United \n     States and civilian employees of the United States make \n     significant contributions to the general welfare of the \n     United States, and are on the front lines in the fight \n     against terrorism and in maintaining the Nation's defenses;\n       Whereas civilian employees of the United States play a \n     crucial role in the fight against terrorism, as exemplified \n     by--\n       (1) the civilian employees of the Department of Homeland \n     Security and the Department of Defense who are working to \n     ensure the security of the United States;\n       (2) the civilian employees of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation who are \n     investigating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and \n     working to prevent further terrorist attacks;\n       (3) the numerous skilled trade and craft civilian employees \n     of the Federal Government who work side-by-side with the men \n     and women of the armed forces to maintain and deploy our air \n     and sea fleet safely and swiftly; and\n       (4) the employees of the Centers For Disease Control within \n     the Department of Health and Human Services who work every \n     day protecting Americans from bioterrorism and those at the \n     Department of Agriculture who strive to keep the Nation's \n     food supply safe;\n       Whereas civilian employees of the United States will \n     continue to support and defend the United States during this \n     difficult time;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2004 Congress again reaffirmed its \n     long-standing commitment to parity in pay adjustments for \n     members of the uniformed services and all civilian employees \n     in both the annual budget resolution and the Transportation, \n     Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004; \n     and\n       Whereas for fiscal year 2005, the Administration proposed a \n     3.5 percent pay raise for members of the uniformed services \n     but only a 1.5 percent pay raise for the dedicated civilian \n     employees of the United States, a disparity in adjustments \n     that violates the traditional principle of parity of pay \n     adjustments: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that rates of \n     pay for all civilian employees of the United States should be \n     adjusted at the same time, and in the same proportion, as are \n     rates of pay for the uniformed services.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nMikulski, Warner, Akaka, Allen, Collins, Kennedy, Durbin, Dayton, \nLevin, Johnson, and Murray in submitting a resolution expressing the \nsense of the Congress that parity between Federal civilian pay and \nmilitary pay should be maintained.\n  Disparate treatment of civilian and military pay goes against the \nlongstanding policy of parity for all those who have chosen to serve \nour Nation--whether that service is in the civilian workforce or in the \narmed services. In fact, a comparison of military and civilian pay \nincreases by the Congressional Research Service finds that in 16 of the \nlast 18 years military and civilian pay increases have been identical.\n  Indeed, the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act \nConference Report passed by Congress included a pay parity provision \nthat would provide a 4.1 percent average pay adjustment to military and \nall civilian employees.\n  Federal civilian and military employees work side-by-side doing the \nimportant work of the Nation, including protecting U.S. citizens from \nterrorism. As a prime example, during last week's response to the \ndiscovery of ricin in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, civilian \nemployees from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the Coast Guard, the U.S. \nCapitol Police, the FBI, and the Marine Corps Chemical Biological \nIncident Response Force from Indian Head, Maryland responded jointly to \nthe crisis and collaborated in the cleanup of the affected Senate \nOffice Buildings. Now more than ever, an efficient and effective \nFederal Government requires this kind of civilian/military \ncollaboration. We should not undermine the morale of our dedicated \npublic civil servants by failing to bring their pay in line with that \nof the military personnel they work along side of every day.\n  Moreover, both the uniformed services and the Federal civilian \nworkforce need to address critical retention and recruitment problems. \nOur Federal Government is facing a ``human capital'' crisis as a result \nof attrition that threatens institutional experience and knowledge at \nevery level. By the end of 2005, one out of every three current Federal \nworkers will be eligible for optional retirement and by 2007 an \nestimated 53 percent of the Federal workforce will be eligible to \nretire. These vacancies will occur in an era in which those entering \nthe workforce are far less likely to join public service. As evidence \nof this, a 2002 survey commissioned by the Partnership for Public \nService reveals that only one in four college-educated workers \nexpressed significant interest in working for the Federal Government.\n  Inequitable pay only serves to perpetuate this lack of interest. \nCongress has continually asked Federal employees to make significant \nsacrifices for the sake of our Nation's fiscal health, including more \nthan $200 billion in deficit reduction contributed by Federal employees \nand retirees in lost and delayed compensation. In addition, FEPCA--\nlegislation passed in 1990 to bring the pay of Federal employees in \nline with that offered in the private sector--has never been fully \nimplemented. Nonetheless, Federal employees have continued to provide \nhigh quality service to the American public, usually with fewer \nresources and personnel.\n  One way to ensure the Federal Government is able to attract and \nretain qualified public servants is to ensure parity between civil \nservice employees and members of the uniformed services. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/09/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2273.

COMMERCIAL TRUCK HIGHWAY SAFETY DEMONSTRATION \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Commercial Truck Highway Safety Demonstration Program Act \n     of 2004''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public safety on the highways of the United States is a \n     paramount concern of all who use the highways and all who \n     prescribe public policy for the use of those highways, \n     including public policy on the operation of heavy commercial \n     trucks on highways.\n       (2) Federal highway funding law effectively imposes a limit \n     of 80,000 pounds on the weight of vehicles permitted to use \n     Interstate System highways.\n       (3) The administration of this law in Maine has forced \n     heavy tractor-trailer and tractor-semitrailer combination \n     vehicles traveling into Maine from neighboring States and \n     Canada to divert onto small State and local roads where \n     higher vehicle weight limits apply under Maine law.\n       (4) The diversion of those vehicles onto such roads causes \n     significant economic hardships and safety challenges for \n     small communities located along those roads.\n       (5) Permitting heavy commercial vehicles, including tanker \n     trucks carrying hazardous material and fuel oil, to travel on \n     Interstate System highways in Maine--\n       (A) would enhance public safety by reducing--\n       (i) the number of heavy vehicles that use town and city \n     streets in Maine;
