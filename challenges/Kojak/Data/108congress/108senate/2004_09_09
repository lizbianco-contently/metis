Mr. President, this morning following my remarks, which \nwill be brief, and any comments from the Democratic leader, we will \nhave a 60-minute period for morning business, with the first 30 minutes \nunder the control of the majority, and the last 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Democratic side.\n  At the conclusion of morning business, we will resume consideration \nof the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Last night, we were able \nto reach an agreement which limits amendments to the bill, and although \nthe list is much longer than we would like, I am hopeful many of the \nlisted amendments will not be offered. As we continue discussion among \nourselves and between both sides of the aisle, hopefully many of those \namendments can be either addressed in another way or will not be \noffered at this point in time.\n  It is imperative for us in this body to stay focused on the safety \nand security of the American people, and this bill demonstrates that. \nWe have worked very well together thus far.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the importance of staying focused \non this bill. Let's move on with the amendments--we are on the \namendments--and debate them in an expeditious way so we can finish this \nbill.\n  I previously stated we should finish the bill this week. Given the \nlist of amendments which have appeared, we will, in all likelihood, go \nover into next week. We absolutely must have as our goal and make it \nreality of finishing the bill in the early part of next week or prior \nto the Rosh Hashanah holiday. I know Members' schedules are fluid, \nespecially at this time of year when people have so many demands back \nin their home States, as well as here. The schedules are challenging, \nbut I ask everybody to work with the Democratic leader and myself in \nterms of the scheduling so we can have real movement on these bills and \nbring them to completion in as expeditious a way as possible.\n  On Fridays and Mondays, we will be in discussion to let people know \nexactly what the voting schedules will be. In large part, it depends on \nhow much participation we get during the course of the day today and \ntonight and a day like yesterday. If everybody can help us, I think we \nwill be able to complete this bill in an expeditious way with respect \nto everybody's schedules.\n  We will have a full day today and this evening, I would suspect, as \nwe continue to make progress on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8977-7", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8977-S8978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REFORM OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very briefly want to speak to a meeting \nthat the leadership, not just elected leadership but leadership and \ninterested parties, both Democrats and Republicans, had yesterday with \nthe President of the United States, with the Senate and House \nrepresented. It was a very good meeting.\n  The focus of that meeting was to discuss the President's views, his \nplans to reform the intelligence community. The focus of this body for \na long time, but very specifically since the 9/11 Commission report \nrecommendations were made, has been on the safety and security of the \nAmerican people as it is reflected in the 9/11 Commission report and \nour study of that report.\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\n  Between the House and the Senate, over 20 different hearings were \nheld during August. I thank our colleagues for working very hard in \ncollecting information and assessing people's ideas and thoughts from \nexperts from around the world--from around the country and around the \nworld--on the recommendations that were made by the 9/11 Commission.\n  Our meeting yesterday was another step at the committee level and on \nthe floor of the Senate, as we are on the Homeland Security bill and as \nwe address other bills, and in meetings such as at the White House. \nThere is a real bipartisan commitment to making progress, not a knee-\njerk reaction but progress on intelligence reform.\n  The President discussed with us his plan to complete the \nreorganization of the executive branch, consistent with those \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. He asked for our support. He \nsays he does expect legislation, recognizing that once we leave in \nOctober, we will have November and January when we are not in session, \nand it is important for this reorganization to take place.\n  I think there was clear support for what the President presented \nyesterday, a general consensus that we need to continue to move \nforward.\n  As I outlined on Tuesday, and as the Democratic leader and I outlined \nprior to the recess, immediately after the 9/11 Commission report, we \nhave two arms in this body addressing the recommendations. First, in no \nparticular order, but to look outside this body, what is going on in \nthe executive branch, and that has been delegated to the appropriate \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Governmental Affairs Committee, under \nthe very able leadership of Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman. They \nworked through August diligently collecting information on this \nassignment.\n  There are many committees of jurisdiction, and those committees have \nparticipated with the Governmental Affairs Committee. They will likely \nmark up specific legislation the week of September 20, and then that \nbill will be brought to the floor the following week.\n  The only reason I am that specific about days is to share with our \ncolleagues the sense of urgency and the sense that we do not have that \nmany legislative days.\n  What is in that bill specifically and how far it goes is really up to \nthat committee, taking the very best from all of the committees and all \nof our colleagues in the Senate, as well as the advice of outside \nexperts. That is one arm.\n  The other arm addresses the internal reform that really applies to \ntwo very important of the 41 recommendations by the 9/11 Commission, \nand that the Democratic leader and I have delegated to a task force \nthat has been appointed to collect information and to discuss that \ninformation and to advise us how best to proceed.\n  Our majority and minority whips, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, \nare representing the chairs of that task force; that is, to look at the \nbest way the Senate should be organized in this newly transformed \nworld, internal organization, committees, new committees, changing \njurisdiction. It is a tough issue because in each case it involves a \nchange where somebody has to give up something or, in their mind, they \nare giving up something.\n  The good thing about it is it is going to be bipartisan, working \ntogether. We are talking about the safety and security of the American \npeople, and when people say this sort of task cannot be done in a \nhighly charged political environment with Presidential races and races \nin this body, when it comes down to the safety and security of the \nAmerican people and the appropriate oversight of the intelligence upon \nwhich that safety and security is protected, partisanship gets put \naside.\n  We are on a very tight schedule. There is a lot to be discussed, a \nlot to be debated. I am confident that with the focus and with the \nbipartisan effort we will get this done.\n  Quickly, and it has been covered a little bit in the press today, the \nPresident's plan calls for a number of substantial changes. First and \nforemost is the appointment of the national intelligence director--\npeople are now getting comfortable with this--the ``NID,'' which is the \nnational intelligence director.\n  As the President described, the post would be as follows: The new \ndirector would be appointed by and report to the President, to be \nconfirmed by the Senate. He or she will act as the principal adviser to \nthe President. He or she would not be located in the Executive Office \nof the President or serve as a member of the President's Cabinet.\n  The real news, if one looks at the headlines and the interpretation \nof what the President says, is this full budget authority by the \nnational intelligence director. That director would be responsible for \ndeveloping objectives and guidance for the intelligence community to \nensure the timely and effective collection, analysis, processing, and \ndissemination of national intelligence for the country; of determining \nand establishing requirements and priorities for intelligence \ncollection; of establishing intelligence analysis and production \npriorities for the intelligence community, and directing the national \ncounterterrorism center.\n  The NID would have full budget authority over the national foreign \nintelligence program appropriation and would have the necessary \nauthority to carry out reforms we agree are so crucial to our Nation's \nsecurity.\n  There are a lot more details and these details will be coming forward \nover the next several days, but this short description gives a general \noutline of the direction the President has requested that we move.\n\n  The purpose of creating this new post is to improve how we collect \ndata, analyze data, and how we act upon intelligence data across \nagencies in order to strengthen America's defenses and stop terrorism \nbefore it ever hits. This will make us safer abroad and I believe it \nwill clearly make us safer and more secure at home.\n  I commend the President for his decisive leadership in this regard. \nHe is committed to protecting the American people. As the President \npointed out yesterday, many of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 \nCommission report had been and were being addressed by the \nadministration. Mention was made yesterday that the administration had \naddressed 36 of the Commission's 41 recommendations.\n  I look forward to working with leaders on both sides of the aisle and \nwith both Chambers of Congress. It is going to take a lot of \ncoordination working in the House, the Senate, and the administration. \nWe do not have very much time. We have 22 legislative days remaining in \nthis body, but I know there is bipartisan agreement on the security of \nthe United States and that agreement means we cannot wait and push this \noff until sometime in the future.\n  How much is addressed and what the specifics are has not yet been \ndetermined, and that is what is being worked on at the committee level \nand at the task force level right now. Protecting our fellow Americans \nfrom attack is the Government's highest duty. From the Oval Office to \nthe Capitol steps, we are working hard to move America forward and to \nwin this war on terror. That will very much be the focus of the Senate \nfor the next 22 days, the security and safety of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8978-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

He and I have \nworked very closely together, and I share his view that it has been a \nlaudable bipartisan effort.\n  As he has noted, our purpose is to address the recommendations made \nby the 9/11 Commission on two levels: the executive branch, which is \nlargely the responsibility of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nthe legislative branch, which is going to be the responsibility of our \ntask force. Both groups are doing the work that we would hope they \nwould. They have invested a good deal of time already. I share his view \nthat there is an urgency to this important effort, and I hope we can \ncontinue to work in the manner with which all Members so far have \ndemonstrated; that is, a commitment to a real bipartisan approach to \nresolving the many challenges that we face.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8979-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n               TED KENNEDY'S HISTORIC MILESTONE IN SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

This is the day when Senator Kennedy actually \nbecomes the third most senior Member in the Senate's history, and I \nthink it ought to be noted. He just surpassed the time of seniority by \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, Carl Hayden. So he now ranks as \nthe third most senior person in all of Senate history. I commend and \ncongratulate him, and I know I join colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in calling attention to this remarkable new addition to his \nalready impressive and extensive resume.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8979-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will comment on a matter that the \nmajority leader raised with regard to the current legislation. The \nHomeland Security appropriations bill is critical legislation. I have \nadmonished Members on our side of the aisle to recognize how critical \nit is we finish this work before we leave for the Rosh Hashanah holiday \nnext week. It is very important that this work be done. As I understand \nit, we have 28 Senators--on both sides of the aisle--who have \namendments. We will work with them. Senator Reid has noted that he has \nbegun to call each Senator to express the hope that we could winnow \ndown the list.\n  I noticed as the finite list was established last night that many of \nthese amendments are simply listed as relevant. I hope that many of \nthese so-called placeholders could be eliminated and we could get on \nwith the important work.\n  There is a need to work under time limits for each amendment and \nhopefully we can work as late in the evening each day to accomplish \nwhat is going to be an aggressive schedule as we try to finish this \nbill--I should say, as we finish this bill. We are going to do more \nthan try. We will complete it no later than next Wednesday morning, and \nhopefully sooner than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8979-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8979-S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONCERNS IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, each year, I travel through South Dakota, \ntalking to people where they live and work, in the cafes where they \nmeet, the schools where they send their children, the ranches and sale \nbarns where they hope that this year will bring better prices than the \nlast, the farms where they raise their crops--anywhere people gather to \ndiscuss what matters to them.\n  Every year, I get to all 66 counties, and every year, I marvel at the \nincredible range of opinions and perspectives I encounter along the \nway.\n  But there is another thing that was striking to me this year--and \nthat is the fact that wherever I was, I heard from different people \nfrom different backgrounds a lot of the same hopes, and a lot of the \nsame concerns.\n  People have a sense of uncertainty. They are uncertain about the \nprogress in the war on terror and the war in Iraq, and they are anxious \nabout the economy--not just about their own jobs, and their own health \ncare, but also about whether their communities and their way of life \nare going to survive.\n  In the past few years, whenever I have traveled home, I have sensed \nthe strength of those feelings. And for many of the people I have met, \nthose feelings are growing stronger.\n  South Dakotans are intensely proud of the valor of our troops serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan--and I share that pride. But ours is a small \nState, and when South Dakotans talk about ``the troops,'' they are not \ntalking about some abstract concept. They are talking about friends and \nloved ones. They are talking about a person who is not there behind the \ncounter when they go to work, or a side of the bed that lies empty.\n  South Dakota is contributing more troops to our war effort than all \nbut seven other countries.\n  And so, while South Dakotans support our troops, they also know \nbetter than most that support in words is not enough.\n  While I was home last month, I met a young man named Tyler Neuharth, \nwho was on leave from Iraq and was just a week away from being sent \nback. He was proud to serve. But he was also looking forward to \nreturning to college, and he wanted some sense of how long he would be \ndeployed so he could plan for his education and his future.\n  I spoke to a woman whose husband has been in Iraq for over a year-\nand-a-half, and she and her young son just learned that the earliest \nthey can hope to see him home is the end of this year.\n  And I met Lloyd Dejung, who talked about how his unit in Iraq was \nbuilding bridges in flak jackets that, in his words, you could poke a \nhole through with a knife.\n  Our Guard and Reserve troops deserve the same state-of-the-art \nequipment as active duty personnel. They should get honest answers \nabout when they're coming home. And while they are fighting for their \ncountry, they should not have to worry about whether they will have to \nfight for their jobs, or for health care, or for their education once \nthey return home.\n  That is why, tomorrow, I will be introducing a National Guard and \nReserve Bill of Rights--to say to all our soldiers: You have met your \nduty to your country, and your country will meet its duty to you.\n  South Dakotans are fiercely proud, and fiercely independent. When you \ntalk to them, they will tell you what you can do to help a neighbor or \na friend, but it takes a little while to get people talking about their \nown concerns. But when they do, there are a couple of things you hear \nover and over. They are worried about their jobs, they are worried \nabout their health and their health care, and they are worried that as \njobs become more scarce and health care becomes ever less affordable \nand less available, they are going to lose something else, too. They \nare worried that the strain these things place on the fabric of their \ncommunities will become just too much, and that their communities and \ntheir way of life just won't be able to survive.\n  These are concerns I heard everywhere I went, and they are concerns \nthat we here in Washington have the power to do something about.\n  More than any time in my memory, people were telling me they needed \ntwo and three jobs--not to get ahead, not to save for a house or their \nchild's education, but simply to make their monthly bills. Many good \nmanufacturing jobs have left the State, and it is getting more \ndifficult to find a full-time job that pays a wage good enough to raise \na family.\n  I visited the town of Elk Point. A lot of the folks in Elk Point work \nabout 20 minutes down the road in North Sioux City, where there is a \nGateway plant. That plant has been cutting jobs, sending them to India. \nThat plant is now down to 2,000 employees from a high of 6,000.\n  The people I met simply can not understand how this administration's \ntop economic adviser and its Secretary of Labor can both say that \noutsourcing of jobs is good for the economy.\n  In Yankton, 10 percent of the work force is in manufacturing. I spoke \nto the owner of a company that makes road construction equipment. He \nsaid that he has had to cut jobs because we have not passed a highway \nbill.\n  The Senate version of the highway bill would create 6,500 jobs in \nSouth Dakota and over 1.7 million new jobs nationwide. Our \ninfrastructure, our economy, and our communities need this bill.\n  Closely tied to concerns about jobs are concerns about health care.\n  In Huron, a woman came up to me at a meeting. She told me that her \nhusband had been laid off from his job in February. They went on COBRA \nfor a while, but it was expensive, and this month it ran out anyway. \nThey both have health concerns, and they don't know what they are going \nto do.\n  Just a couple of nights ago, another woman approached me. She told me \nabout her brother, who has diabetes.\n  He is 60 years old. He works 40 hours a week. He also took a paper \nroute to earn some more money. But neither of his two jobs offers \nhealth insurance, so he doesn't have any. He has begun losing feeling \nin his legs, but he has not seen a doctor because he does not think he \ncan afford to. A 60-year old man, working full-time and then some, can \nnot afford to go see a doctor. In this country, in this century, that \nis a disgrace.\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\n  Everywhere I go, people are worried that their health care costs are \nrising. If they have health care through their jobs, they are afraid \nthey might lose it. If they are paying for it themselves, they are \nafraid they can not afford it any longer. I think every American should \nhave access to the same affordable health care options that members of \nCongress have.\n  At the very least, there are a number of steps we can take \nimmediately. We should be providing health coverage to uninsured \nparents who have children eligible for Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and I think we should let States \nhave the option of covering pregnant women and children until the age \nof 20.\n  We should create a tax credit to help small business owners provide \nhealth care coverage for their employees. Most employers I talked to \nwant to provide health insurance; they are just having an increasingly \ndifficult time affording it.\n  This is a crisis, and we need to confront it. The ideas are there. We \nneed the leadership.\n  Out in our small towns and farming and ranching communities, those \nconcerns add up to one that is even greater--that a way of life is \nbeing lost. I have been visiting these communities for more than 25 \nyears. There is nothing more gratifying to me than to see a family \nfarmer or rancher raise their children up, teach them how to farm, and \nthen pass their land down to them. But it is happening less frequently \nthese days.\n  More often, children are forced to leave the communities they know \nand the families they love to find work in other places. They do not \nwant to leave. But they can not find work good enough to allow them to \nraise a family. And so the way of life their families have enjoyed for \ngenerations is being lost.\n  But there is something else shared by the people I saw, and the \nplaces I visited: determination.\n  They are determined to make tomorrow better than today. You put them \non a job, and they will work harder, and longer, and better than any \nworker in the world. You give our farmers and ranchers a fair price for \nwhat they produce and they will feed the world. You respect the service \nand protect the rights of our Guard and Reserve, and they will always \nstep up to serve.\n  That is why I ask that in the time we have left in this session of \nCongress, we hear these concerns and act on them.\n  Yes, I saw anxiety and uncertainty. But I also saw pride and \ndetermination. I saw people willing to work together to make life \nbetter for their families, and strengthen their communities. That is \nwhat South Dakotans have always done.\n  If we adopt the same sense of patriotism and common purpose I saw \nacross South Dakota, I have no doubt that we can make the short time we \nhave left this year a time of accomplishment for the people we serve, \nto help them meet the challenges they face.\n\n\n                    Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders\n\n  There is one other serious public health challenge I want to mention \nthis morning. It is a challenge I first learned about years ago during \nvisits to Indian reservations in South Dakota. It is called Fetal \nAlcohol Spectrum Disorders--FASD, for short.\n  FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of physical and \nmental birth defects that can occur in a fetus when a pregnant woman \ndrinks alcohol. It is a leading cause of mental retardation in America. \nIt is also 100 percent preventable when women abstain from alcohol \nduring pregnancy.\n  Every year in America, an estimated 40,000 babies are born with FASD, \ncosting Americans more than $3 billion each year in direct health care \ncosts, and many times that amount in lost human potential. You can find \nFASD in every community in America. Native, non-native, rich, poor it \ndoesn't discriminate.\n  Today is an important day in America's fight against this devastating \ndisorder. It is America's first National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Day.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for sponsoring this resolution establishing \nnational FASD day. I was proud to be a cosponsor.\n  Fifteen years ago, my wife Linda and I and a group of friends founded \nan organization that we called NOFAS, the National Organization of \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome. Back then when we met in the living room of a \nvery dear friend, Terry Lierman, there were not many of us to talk \nabout these issues. And scientists and doctors understood very little \nabout FAS. But we have learned an extraordinary amount since then. \nNational FASD day will help us get the knowledge we have learned out to \nthe people who need it the most.\n  We can save so many children and save families so much heartache \nsimply by increasing people's awareness of what FASD is and how we can \nprevent it.\n  But we can't stop there. We need to continue to research and do more \nto help people who are living with FASD make the most of their God-\ngiven talents and abilities.\n  In 1998, I was proud to be the lead sponsor of legislation that \ncreated an FASD prevention and services program and a national task \nforce on FAS and fetal alcohol effect.\n  Two months ago, I introduced a bill called the Advancing FASD \nResearch, Prevention, and Services Act. My bill would identify areas \nfor additional research by the National Institutes of Health.\n  It would improve coordination among Federal agencies involved in FASD \ntreatment and research, and establish statewide FASD systems and local \ncommunity partnerships--like a model partnership that is already up and \nrunning in South Dakota and other Midwestern States.\n  It would improve support services for families who are living with \nFASD. And it would strengthen educational outreach efforts to doctors, \nteachers, judges and others whose work puts them in contact with people \nwith FASD, or with women who might be at risk of drinking during \npregnancy.\n  Forty-thousand American children a year are born with FASD. We cannot \nleave these children behind, either. Whatever investments we make in \nFASD prevention, research and treatment will pay for themselves many \ntimes over in reduced health care costs and increased human potential.\n  Over the last 15 years, we have unlocked many of the mysteries \nsurrounding FASD--and many more answers are just inches beyond our \nreach. As we observe this first National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Day, I ask my colleagues to take the next necessary steps in \nthe fight against this devastating but completely preventable disorder. \nBefore this Congress ends, let us pass the Advancing FASD Research, \nPrevention, and Services Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished leader leaves the \nfloor, I knew the minority leader was going to speak on fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. But I ask the distinguished Senator from South Dakota--I have \nin my library a book that he recommended written by someone from South \nDakota on this subject, a book on this terrible problem that affects a \nlot of different people, especially in Indian country. I have never \nforgotten that book. It was something I had never heard of until I read \nthat book. Does the Senator remember that book?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do so well. I have shared it with many people. I thank \nthe Senator from Nevada, my dear friend and colleague, for sharing that \nobservation. Michael Dorris is the author's name. The name of the book \nis ``The Broken Cord.'' Michael introduced me to this whole issue. He \ntells the story in his book about two children in South Dakota who had \nfetal alcohol syndrome. Both have passed away. Both struggled mightily \nfor years. And, of course, the extraordinary problems that the family \nhad to confront are all accounted for in that book. Unfortunately, we \nlost Michael a few years ago, a powerful advocate for a national \nadvocacy for addressing this issue. But I only hope more people will \nread that book. I appreciate the fact that my friend called it to the \nattention of our colleagues this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8980-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8980-S8981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, as the distinguished minority leader \nand distinguished Senator from Nevada have spoken to this morning, \ntoday is Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day in the United \nStates.\n  The ninth hour of the ninth day in the ninth month having arrived, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senate observe a moment of reflection to \nremind women who are pregnant and those women who may become pregnant \nthat no amount of alcohol, none at all, is safe during the 9 months of \npregnancy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The Senate observed a moment of reflection.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, by raising awareness one moment at a time, we can \nattempt to minimize the damaging effects of drinking during pregnancy.\n  In late February of 1999, there was a small group of parents who were \nraising children afflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and \nthis small group of parents essentially set out to change the world. \nThe leaders of this group were Bonnie Buxton and Brian Philcox of \nToronto and Teresa Kellerman of Tucson.\n  They were frustrated, frustrated about the lack of public awareness \nabout fetal alcohol spectrum disorders by both the public and the \nprofessionals. These parents wondered aloud. They were communicating \nwith one another on an online Internet support group called F-A-S link. \nThey wondered, What if on the ninth minute of the ninth day of the \nninth month we asked the world to remember that during the 9 months of \npregnancy a woman should remain alcohol free. And what if we also asked \nthe world to remember those millions of people who will never fulfill \ntheir potential because of prenatal alcohol exposure.\n  And at this moment, they asked: Could we begin to change the world? \nCan we begin to change the path that so many children have been faced \nwith as they set out in the world burdened with the affliction they \nwere born with, fetal alcohol disorders?\n  So this year, for the sixth consecutive year, communities across the \nworld are pausing during the ninth hour to acknowledge International \nFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day. FAS Day will be \nobserved extensively in my home State of Alaska with ceremonies being \nobserved across the State.\n  I appreciated the comments from the minority leader about the \ndevastating effects in his home State of South Dakota. In Alaska, we, \ntoo, are faced with incredible statistics as they relate to those who \nare born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\n  In many parts of my State, particularly in the rural parts of the \nState, we have villages where the amount of children born with FASD is \nfour times the national average. The statistics are absolutely \nhorrific.\n  I was in a very small community of about several hundred people \nduring the August recess. I was approached by a woman who was a \nteacher. She had been out in this community for several years. Her \ngreatest concern as a teacher was what I was going to do in my capacity \nin the Senate to make women aware of the consequences of drinking while \npregnant. She was dealing with students coming to her classroom who \nwere not only not able to learn but quite possibly will never be able \nto learn because they were born with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\n\n  I am grateful the Senate is recognizing International Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorders Awareness Day and has paused to join in this \nworldwide moment of reflection. For this, I thank my colleagues, \nespecially the distinguished minority leader, the Senator from South \nDakota, who has joined with me in offering Senate Resolution 390 \ncreating the first National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness \nDay earlier this year. I hope we will continue to pause in the ninth \nhour of the ninth day each September until fetal alcohol spectrum \ndisorders are eradicated.\n  The eradication of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is by no means an \nimpossible dream. This is achievable. The simple truth about fetal \nalcohol spectrum disorders is they can be eradicated, they can be \nstopped, they can be wiped out if women resolve to consume no alcohol \nduring the term of their pregnancy.\n  This simple prescription--no alcohol--may seem extreme, it may seem \nabsolute, it may even seem harsh to some, but there is no gentler way \nto put it.\n  The term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' describes a range of \nconditions that can befall a child whose mother consumed alcohol during \npregnancy. I will not list the technical names of each of those \nconditions because that is not important. What is important is that if \nwomen consume alcohol during pregnancy, they expose their unborn child \nto the risk of suffering one or more of the fetal alcohol spectrum \ndisorders.\n  It is vitally important for all women to know that fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders are the No. 1 preventable cause of mental \nretardation and birth defects. An individual with fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders can incur a lifetime health cost of over $800,000. \nChildren do not outgrow fetal alcohol disorders; the physical and \nbehavioral problems can last a lifetime. When a pregnant woman consumes \nalcohol, it passes through her bloodstream to the unborn child. It can \ncause damage to the brain. It can result in low birth weight. The \nchild, when he or she is born, may have trouble sleeping, may have \ntrouble eating. As the child matures, he or she can have problems \nlearning, paying attention. Some even need lifelong medical care.\n  It should be stressed that there is no woman who is genetically \nimmune from the consequences of consuming alcohol during pregnancy. The \nmessage is very clear, it is very simple: In pregnancy, no amount of \nalcohol, no matter how small, is safe. There is no safe time. There is \nno safe drink. There is no safe amount. The message is, if you are \npregnant, do not drink. If you drink, do not get pregnant.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the President of the United States wrote a \nmessage to all of those observing National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nDisorders Awareness Day. I ask unanimous consent the text of the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, September 8, 2004.\n       I send greetings to those observing National Fetal Alcohol \n     Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day on September 9, 2004.\n       Children are a precious gift and a source of great hope for \n     our future. To preserve their dreams and their health, we \n     must continue to work together to increase awareness about \n     the dangers of alcohol consumption by expectant mothers. This \n     observance helps to educate the public about Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome and its effects, such as learning disabilities and \n     mental illness, and promote healthier communities.\n       I applaud all those involved for your compassion and your \n     dedication to improving the health and well-being of our \n     children and their parents. Your efforts bring comfort to \n     countless families and help make America a better place.\n       Laura joins me in sending our best wishes.\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me first commend my colleague from \nAlaska as well as my colleague from South Dakota for their very \nexcellent statements about a problem that I understand affects their \nStates but certainly affects every State in the Union. I hope their \ncomments today will be of help. I know their efforts will certainly \nhelp. It is, as my colleague from Alaska has so eloquently said, very \npreventable. It is something that we who have the opportunity to use \nthis bully pulpit of the Senate, as Theodore Roosevelt would say, can \ntalk about to educate and inform people about the problem and that it \nis, in fact, preventable.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8982-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Specialist Charles E. Odums II\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I come to the Senate today to pay \ntribute to Army SPC Charles Odums, II, who lost his life in the service \nof our country in Iraq. At times like this, I am reminded of a speech \nPresident Ronald Reagan gave on Veterans Day many years ago. He said:\n\n       It is, in a way, an odd thing to honor those who died in \n     defense of our country, in defense of us, in wars far away. \n     The imagination plays a trick. We see these soldiers in our \n     mind as old and wise . . . . But most of them were boys when \n     they died.\n\n  SPC Charles Odums was 22 years old when he died after an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. Today, I \nrise to remember this brave young man, who was taken from us much too \nsoon.\n  Charles, or ``Chuck'' as he was known by family and friends, was an \nambitious kid who always tried to do the right thing. Friends lovingly \nremembered him as the ``sweet and quiet boy who would do anything that \nwas asked of him.'' He came from a close-knit family and developed an \nespecially strong bond with his younger brother, Robert. The two loved \nto ride their motorcycles and talk of their big plans for the future. \nThey were going to be millionaires.\n  Chuck went to Sandusky High School and graduated in 1999. While \nthere, he played football and participated in track. He was the likable \nguy everyone wanted to be around. Chuck's coach, Brett Fuqua, \nremembered him as a hardworking young man who would run a marathon if \nasked. Chuck was always willing to do whatever needed to be done.\n  After high school, Chuck enrolled at the University of Toledo. While \nthere, he met the love of his life, Melanie, and the two married in \nDecember 2001. Chuck remained in college for more than one year, but \nfound that it wasn't for him. After much consideration and much time \ntalking it out with his parents, he decided to enlist in the Army.\n  Though this would be a difficult decision for anyone to make, Chuck \nknew it was the right one for him. Brett Fuqua described Chuck's \nreasons for enlisting this way:\n\n       He didn't do it because it was glamorous. He didn't do it \n     because he would be a hero. He did it because he believed it \n     was his duty to defend the freedoms that define America: the \n     freedom to worship, to speak freely, to be safe.\n\n  Chuck was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st \nCavalry Division, where he worked as a medic and driver. His comrades \ncalled him ``Odie'' or ``Doc,'' and they knew they could trust him with \ntheir lives. In fact, during his time in Iraq, Chuck was credited with \nsaving three lives and helping countless others. His commanding officer \nrecalled that Chuck would steer his Humvee in such a way that \nsuspicious bumps in the road would pass under the driver's side--his \nside--putting Chuck in danger rather than his passengers.\n  While overseas, Chuck made sure to keep in touch with his family by \nphone or e-mail, and his parents made sure they held on to everything \nhe sent them. In the binder that they now cherish, Annie and Charles \nOdums have pictures of their son serving in Iraq. In one, Chuck, in \nfull gear, is waiting on a helicopter landing pad for his transport to \narrive. In another, he stands guarding an Iraqi man while other \nsoldiers search for a weapons cache. Chuck's e-mail read: ``Well, I'm \ndoing good out here.''\n  While Chuck was in Iraq, he was careful of what he told his mother. \nHe knew she would worry. Chuck missed his parents, his brother and \nsisters, but especially his wife Melanie. Melanie and Chuck were \nalready planning what they would do when Chuck's enlistment ended. They \nboth wanted to start a family. Chuck had dreams of becoming a police \nofficer. No matter what they decided to do, Chuck and Melanie were \nlooking forward to being together.\n  After Chuck was killed, in his hometown of Sandusky, OH, thousands of \npeople gathered to show their support for the Odums family and to honor \nChuck. They lined the street for the funeral procession and placed \nflags in their yards. One woman held a sign that read: ``Thank you, \nCharles, God bless America.'' Veterans groups saluted the fallen \ncomrade and many held their hands over their hearts.\n  One Sandusky native, Debra Churchwell, took her grandchildren, \nnieces, and nephews to watch the funeral procession. When asked why she \nbrought her family, she replied: ``I want them to see a part of history \nbecause they'll never see this again. I pray to God they never see this \nagain.'' No one wants to see this again.\n  I know Chuck will live on in the hearts of his many friends and his \nfamily, especially his wife Melanie, his mother Annie, father Charles, \nbrother Robert, and sisters Janel, Sophia, Candie, and Tashica. Chuck \nis an American hero who will live on in all our hearts.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I would like to inquire about the time \nremaining and how it is divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining on the Republican \nside and 30 minutes remaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I do not want to use all that time if \nothers have a need to come and make comments, but I do have a couple \nissues I would like to speak on briefly this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8982-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8982-S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SUSAN WOOTEN WELLS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute this morning to \nSusan Wooten Wells, a native of Jackson, MS, who today is marking her \n30th year on my staff.\n  Many of you knew Susan when she worked with me in the leader's \noffice. She started off as a scheduler but over the years worked up to \nbe executive assistant and then was administrative assistant in the \nmajority leader's office. Today she serves as the majority staff \ndirector of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, and she has \noverseen a lot of the moves and renovations and has worked with \nSenators and their staffs on a number of issues over the past year and \na half, and has done a wonderful job.\n  I first met her in 1974, when she was starting out, teaching eighth \ngrade English in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS.\n  Despite the fact she is an alumnus of the other university in my \nState, Mississippi State University, and I am a graduate of the \nUniversity of Mississippi--she is very proud of that institution, and \nshe points out that comedian Jerry Clower and thriller author John \nGrisham and Washington Redskin Fred Smoot are also graduates of that \nuniversity, so over the years we have had fun picking at each other \nabout our alma maters--she came to Washington and worked with me for \nwhat was supposed to be 1 year, helping me out in a crunch to get my \nstaff filled and to do the scheduling.\n  Well, here she is 30 years later. She has had a tremendous influence \non my office operations, on my life, and I believe on this institution. \nI am very proud of the fact she went from being an English teacher--and \nhelping me with my English along the way--to being a real leader on my \nstaff for these many years.\n  In fact, I refer to her as my Mikey, from the old television \ncommercial. I used to call Paul Coverdell, the great Senator from \nGeorgia, Mikey because if we had a task nobody else wanted or would not \ndo, Mikey would do it. Well, that has been Susan on my staff. If there \nneeded to be something done and we wanted it done right, Susan would \nhandle the job.\n  When I decided years ago to bring 150 Mississippians to annual events \nhere in the city for a day-long seminar, she made it happen. When I \ndecided to bring in entire communities from Hancock County to cook \ngumbo for the congressional community once a year, she got the \nassignment, and she made it happen. It turned out to be a tremendous \nevent. A lot of people enjoyed it and everybody benefited from it. In \nthe process, she did go from being one of\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\nthe staff members to being a real leader in the majority leader's \noffice.\n  She helped expedite the construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. I \nbelieve history will look back on it, when it is completed, as one of \nthe wisest things we have done in maybe 100 years in terms of this \nCapitol and the security of our constituents, their convenience and \nsafety and education as they see this building and all it stands for. \nShe oversaw a lot of the Capitol restoration, including changes in this \nChamber. She helped me with the Leader's Lecture Series which turned \nout to be an acclaimed program of oral history lectures by former \nSenate leaders and Vice Presidents.\n  Parts of our public and private lives over this time obviously have \nbeen intertwined. We have shared three decades of America's triumphs \nand three decades of accomplishments for our beloved State of \nMississippi. Together we have also endured tragedies that have befallen \nour country and our families. In fact, last month the love of her life, \nMilton Wells, passed away, and I shared her grief at that moment and \ncontinue to work with her as she comes through this difficult period.\n  Throughout this time she has been loyal, she has been respectful. She \nhas been very helpful to many people. I could not let this day pass \nwithout making a public record of my appreciation for Susan Wooten \nWells and her service to this institution.\n  So many times we forget to say thank you to the people who are on our \nstaffs, who work day in and day out for us, the people in this Chamber, \nthe people who make this place function, who serve us and help us in so \nmany ways. We should not forget to say a small word of thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8983-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGHWAY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I was pleased to see the majority leader \nsay yesterday he was still holding out hope we could get a highway bill \ncompleted before we go out for the election. To me this should not be \nabout the election, but it should be a major focus of what we are \ndoing. Another week is about to go by without any real apparent \nmovement on the highway bill. Why? Why isn't the conference getting \nthis job done? It would mean jobs instantly from Alaska to Mississippi \nand from Maryland to California, because the projects are ready to go, \nbut the money and the new authorizations and new formulas are not in \nplace.\n  Some suggestion was made yesterday, perhaps we could get together \nwith the House and Senate, the President, and do a 1-year extension. \nWhy? Why would we want to extend the current program? It needs to be \nbigger and better. It needs to be updated. We haven't done this now in \n4 or 5 years. It is time to have a highway bill.\n  It is not only about highways. It is about highways and bridges and \nabutments and public transportation and innovative programs that take \nadvantage of modern technology. We need to upgrade this law.\n  One other thing. Every day that passes, every week that passes, \npeople are being killed on highways because they are not modern and are \nnot safe. That is what drives me the most. I know too many cases of \npeople who have died on narrow, hilly, inadequate roads in my State and \nI am sure all over the country.\n  I am not going to let up on this. As long as we are in session, I am \ngoing to keep asking the question: Why aren't we doing a highway bill? \nThere is plenty of blame to go around. But there is no need to get into \nthat. I want to give credit. I want to praise the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member, Senate and House, and the leadership \nfor getting the job done. But I don't think that is happening. I don't \nquite understand why.\n  Is there some decision that has been made, some silent conspiracy to \nextend it, do it another day? Maybe we could get more money next year. \nMaybe we could raise taxes next year and get it even bigger.\n  Of all of those, if that is the thought, that is wrong. We need to \nget a bill that is at a level we can defend as being one that is going \nto be paid for by gasoline taxes, how we use the trust fund, maybe some \nchanges in how that is handled, but we need to find a way to get it \ndone now. We should find a bill the House can pass, the Senate can \npass, and the President can sign. Let's do it and let's do it now.\n  We could complete this bill within a week. Why don't we do it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the majority side.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will take 2 minutes from our side. I \nhave already allocated that.\n  Let me simply say, I appreciate my friend from Mississippi trying to \nbe a leader of the Senate, being chairman of a committee, doing all \nthose things he is very capable of doing.\n  The fact is, there is blame to go around on the highway bill. I hope \nwe can pass a bill. I hope we can finish the conference. But let's \nunderstand why we are in the predicament we are in today.\n  The Senate passed a bill of $318 billion--not a Cadillac version, \nprobably a low level Chevrolet or Ford, barely enough to keep the \nfunctions of our transit highway systems together. That bill, passed \nwith four or five dissenting votes, did not increase the deficit 2 \ncents, not 1 cent. It did not increase the deficit. Suddenly, out of \nnowhere, the President said he will veto the bill. You figure that one \nout. No one else can.\n  As a result, the President has locked in a number. He was at 256. Now \nthey have a number that is 289. They say it is 299, but it probably \nisn't. It doesn't allow the highway and transit functions to go on.\n  We are trying. I spent time with Senator Inhofe on Tuesday and \nWednesday. Hopefully something can be arrived at. But at that number, \nit is very difficult, if not impossible, to do.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I have an agreement. That agreement is, \nif I don't like the bill, he is not going to support it. If he doesn't \nlike the bill, I am not going to support it. That is one of the \narrangements we made to go to conference.\n  I am doing everything within my abilities. I have been chairman of \nthe full committee on two separate occasions. I am speaking for the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords. I am doing everything \nwithin my power to come up with an arrangement so we can have a highway \nbill. But unless it is good for the country, I am not going to approve \nit. That is the arrangement Senator Inhofe and I made. If people don't \nlike it, that is part of what goes on around here. We have to work with \neach other on different issues.\n  Let me finally say: I have the greatest respect for my friend from \nMississippi. But he has not been in on all the arrangements we have \nmade on this bill. It has been very difficult. It was hard to complete \nthe bill at $318 billion. As we were doing the $318 billion \nlegislation--this is a 6-year bill--the House was talking about $375 \nbillion. I was not able to hear all of the comments of the Senator from \nMississippi. I was with Senator Domenici working on the energy and \nwater bill. But I do not apologize to anyone for what the Senate did on \na $318 billion highway transit bill that was approved by this Senate \noverwhelmingly because it was a good bill.\n  I am sorry. For reasons I dare anybody to determine why, a bill that \ndoesn't increase the deficit at all, the President says it is too much \nmoney. I will not get into some of the reasons I believe he did this \nother than to say I am going to continue to work to see if we can come \nup with a bill. I will do everything I can. But I am laying out as much \nas I can the position we find ourselves in today.\n  How much time did I consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator consumed 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Jersey then would have 18 minutes. The \nSenator from Arkansas will have 8\\1/2\\ minutes. I think that works out \nright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8983-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8983-S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FLIP-FLOPPING\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, this morning I rise to talk about \nsomething that we heard quite a bit about these days. The subject is \nflip-flopping.\n  Flip-flopping is kind of an easy thing to identify. During a recent \nconvention, we heard an irate Senator make an angry speech declaring \nthat it is not what you say but, rather, what you do\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\nthat counts. You flip-flop when you make promises and fail to fulfill \nthem.\n  In my 20 years in Washington, there has not been more flip-flopping \nin a President's office than we have seen in that of President George \nW. Bush. He calls others flip-floppers, but President Bush needs to \nlook in the mirror, because on issue after issue he has given a new \nmeaning to flip-flop. The President essentially says: Forget what I \nsaid the first time, I may change that very soon.\n  Let's start with one of the earliest and cruelest flip-flops: \neducation. It is cruel because the victims of the President's broken \npromises are our Nation's children.\n  The flip was a bold promise of an education bill called No Child Left \nBehind, with the expectation that the program would produce more money \nfor kids who deserve a quality education.\n  In July 2001, I quote President Bush when he said he was dedicated to \n``increasing funding for public schools.'' Then came a whopper of a \nflop when he refused to provide the funding promised in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. President Bush's 2005 budget underfunds education by \n$9.5 billion.\n  The next flip was in March of 2001, when President Bush promised our \nNation's seniors not to touch the Social Security surplus. In March \n2001, President Bush said:\n\n       We're going to keep the promise of Social Security and keep \n     the Government from raiding the Social Security surplus.\n\n  Flop: He broke that promise and proposed diverting billions in Social \nSecurity surpluses to other programs in the budget.\n  Flip: He promised to create more jobs for our Nation, but he flopped \nand has done nothing to create jobs. We are now seeing the first \nPresident to have actually lost jobs during the course of his \nadministration since the dark days of Herbert Hoover. His \nadministration ran from 1929 to 1933.\n  Flip: President Bush has repeatedly promised to pressure OPEC to \nlower gasoline prices. When he was running for President, Governor \nGeorge W. Bush said:\n\n       What I think the President ought to do is he ought to get \n     on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say we expect you to \n     open your spigots. . . . And the President of the United \n     States must jawbone OPEC members to lower the price.\n\n  Flop: Over the course of this administration, the average cost of a \ngallon of gasoline has skyrocketed from $1.47 a gallon to $1.87 a \ngallon. President Bush's failure to keep prices down is costing \nfamilies hundreds of extra dollars per year.\n\n  Flip: President Bush pledged to push to renew the ban on deadly \nassault weapons. In April of 2003, White House spokesman Scott \nMcClellan said:\n\n       The President supports the current law, and he supports the \n     reauthorization of the current ban.\n\n  So the flip was that President Bush pushed to pledge to renew the ban \non the deadly assault weapons. In April 2003, we heard what Scott \nMcClellan said.\n  Flop: The ban on assault weapons is set to expire in a few days, and \nPresident George W. Bush has not lifted a finger to get Republican \nleaders to pass the bill in Congress. We know that one in five police \nofficers killed in the line of duty are killed with an assault weapon.\n  We see the promises here on this chart. On this side are the flips, \nand we see the flops on this side. It is not just domestic issues that \nthe President has flip-flopped on. When it comes to foreign affairs, \nthe defense of our Nation, our Nation's veterans, President Bush has \nflip-flopped more than he has stayed the course.\n  One flip was the Department of Homeland Security. That was designed \nto protect us at home while we sent our troops abroad to protect us \nfrom terrorist activities overseas. President Bush strongly opposed \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security in March of 2002. His \nspokesman said that a Homeland Security Department ``doesn't solve \nanything.''\n  Flop: Three months later, the President said he wants a Homeland \nSecurity Department, saying it is critical to protecting the American \npeople.\n  Of course, those of us who follow this game know the President flip-\nflopped on this issue and it is part of a political scenario.\n  Flip: President George W. Bush opposed the creation of the 9/11 \nCommission. That is right, he opposed it. In April of 2002, President \nBush said he was against the creation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Flop: After increased political pressure, the President said he \nsupported creating the 9/11 Commission in September of the same year.\n  The President even flip-flopped on catching the man who murdered \n3,000 Americans, Osama bin Laden. In September of 2001, George Bush \nsaid he wanted Osama bin Laden ``dead or alive.'' He said, ``I want \njustice. There is an old poster out West, I recall, that says `wanted \ndead or alive,' '' when he was talking in September of 2001. But in \nMarch of 2002 he said, ``I don't know where he is. You know, I just \ndon't spend that much time on him. . . . I truly am not that concerned \nabout him.''\n  I can tell you that the families of the 700 people from the State of \nNew Jersey who lost their lives thought about Osama bin Laden, and they \nthink about him every day and night--the children who have no father, \nthe spouse who has no mate. That is an outrageous comment.\n  Of course, then there was the major flip, known as ``mission \naccomplished.'' If I can interpret that, he said: Rest easy Americans, \nthere will be no more deaths and casualties, no more injuries that will \nlast a lifetime.\n  The President announced that major combat operations in Iraq were \nover during a political appearance on an aircraft carrier.\n  Reality flopped him there--a tragic reality. Since declaring \n``mission accomplished'' on May 1, 2003, we have lost 864 people in \nIraq. Tell those families that the mission is accomplished. Tell them \nthey have nothing to worry about. What they have is an empty home and \nan empty heart. Tell those families that the danger is over.\n  On the war on terror, President Bush flip-flopped again. One day in \nthe same week he said he doesn't think we can win the war on terror. I \nbelieve that was a Monday. A day or two later, he flopped and said: Oh, \nno, we can win the war on terror.\n  What is it, Mr. President? Can we win or can we not win? Don't \ndisrupt the morale of the people serving over there by discouraging \ncomments such as we cannot win and then boldly say, heck, why did I say \nthat?\n  He flip-flops on veterans issues as well. Just this month, he told \nthe American Legion:\n\n       All our Nation's veterans have made serving America the \n     highest priority of their lives, and serving our veterans is \n     one of the highest priorities of my administration.\n\n  But what has the President quietly done? His plan for 2006, which is \nout there already--the budget year--is to cut veterans health care by \n$910 million after the election. None of this came out publicly before. \nYou have to search to find it. The evidence is in an OMB memo that \nreveals the President's budget plan for 2006. President Bush has also \ndoubled copays for prescription drugs for many veterans.\n\n  I served in a war a long time ago, and I say to my fellow veterans \nacross the country: President Bush is talking the talk, but he doesn't \nwalk the walk. Just as he failed to answer the call to combat during \nVietnam, he is failing our veterans as President.\n  Behind the scenes here in Washington, President Bush is undermining \nveterans health care, and one thing that particularly enraged me was \nwhen I tried to make flag-draped coffins available to be photographed \nby the news media for those who gave the ultimate sacrifice on the \nbattlefields of Iraq, who deserve a last tribute from their country, a \nflag on their casket to tell their families they died honorably, \nPresident Bush would not allow it. He refuses to allow the public to \nsee the flag-draped coffins arrive on our shores, such as in Dover, DE. \nThat is where the bodies are brought back home.\n  I will never forget President Reagan's funeral, the deliberate care \nthe honor guard took when they folded the flag crease by crease, and \nfinally the last person in the line put it into a triangle and walked \nstiffly over to Nancy Reagan and gave her the flag. She was beaming.\n  I was at Arlington National Cemetery, where a young soldier was being \nburied. I joined his family. It was the same way: The honor guard \nfolded the\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\nflag crease by crease, and finally gave the triangular-folded flag to \nthe young man's mother. Although she was crying, she was beaming with \npride that this last tribute was given to her son. But the White House \nis saying: No, we do not want the American people to see those flag-\ndraped coffins because it tells the truth about the cost of this war. \nThe administration wants those images hidden because it is not good for \nreelection.\n  President Bush uses a lot of broad language and imagery when he \nspeaks. It makes him sound determined and decisive, but when you get \nbehind that facade and look at the actions, you see flip-flop. Make no \nmistake about it, George W. Bush knows exactly what flip-flopping is. \nIt takes one to know one.\n  I close with the comment about an election that took place a few \nyears ago in Georgia when a beloved comrade of ours--no legs, one arm \nleft after his tour of duty in Vietnam--lost an election because he was \ndeclared to be soft on defense. The words almost were unpatriotic, and \nhe lost an election because he was soft on defense--three limbs left \nbehind in Vietnam, an American tragedy of the worst order.\n  Now the same thing is happening with our colleague, Senator John \nKerry, in trying to paint him as soft on defense, unwilling to support \nthe soldiers, unwilling to buy the material that is needed to protect \nthemselves. It is an insult not just to those veterans but to every \nAmerican. Those are the actions of a chicken hawk. I had a drawing of a \nchicken hawk here. A chicken hawk is someone who makes wars for other \npeople to serve.\n  We know President Bush's record is very hard to come by. It is all \nobscured with was he there or wasn't he there. We know one thing, he \nwasn't there more than he was there.\n  Vice President Cheney had five deferments and said, during that war \nwhen Americans across our country were being called on to fight to \nperhaps sacrifice limb or life, he had other priorities. It is a bad \ngame, but I hope the American people will be aware of what is taking \nplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes 20 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, this morning with my opening statement, I \nnoted that most of the next 22 days on the floor of the Senate will \nfocus on the safety and security of the American people. In addition, \nat the conference level, there are a number of other issues being \ndiscussed--like the FSC/ETI JOBS bills and the transportation bill for \nexample. I want to speak to the FSC/ETI JOBS bill very briefly.\n  There is a provision in that bill that is very important to families \nand workers all across Tennessee. It has to do with the deductibility \nof sales tax. Senator Hutchison, Congressman Brady and Congresswoman \nBlackburn have all worked tirelessly on this issue. The majority leader \nin the House, Congressman DeLay, has as well. I thank them all for \ntheir continued leadership. And I appreciate all they have done to see \nthat State sales tax deductibility was included in the House version of \nthe JOBS bill.\n  I have heard from countless Tennesseans about their adamant desire to \nbe able to deduct sales tax from their Federal income tax. Again and \nagain it comes back to a matter of equity and fairness. Mr. Henry \nBranch from Goodlettsville, TN wrote to me, Senator Alexander and \nCongressman Jim Cooper with his one request.\n  His words:\n\n       I hold that sales tax deductibility should be very \n     seriously considered since continuation of the current status \n     penalizes citizens of all states not having a broad-based \n     income tax. I simply ask that all of you work together to \n     remove the inequity.\n\n  A matter of equity.\n  Mr. James Griggs from Nashville writes:\n\n       I cannot conceive of a single reason why states that use a \n     different type of tax system should be punished for it. It \n     seems to me to be a clever ploy to force states into using \n     income taxes instead, a position I strongly stand against. In \n     my opinion, citizens should be able to deduct any kind of tax \n     they pay.\n\n  A matter of fairness.\n  Mr. Robert McCulloch from Knoxville writes:\n\n       Having just completed my Federal income tax return for \n     2003, I am once again reminded how unfairly treated are the \n     good citizens of Tennessee.\n\n  As all of these fine Tennesseans point out, enactment of this \nprovision will restore a measure of fairness to the Tax Code that \nexisted up until 1986, but was lost at that point in time. The current \nFederal Tax Code unfairly encourages States to impose an income tax \nbecause part of that cost is borne by the national Treasury. This is \nwrong. The Federal Government should be neutral on how States decide to \nraise revenue. States should be able to decide for themselves without \nthe intrusion of Federal tax policy. We must restore equity and \nfairness to the system.\n  It also is consistent with the principles of fairness to all \ntaxpayers. Deductibility for State sales taxes was eliminated in 1986, \nbut deductibility for State income taxes was retained. It is long past \ntime to fix this fundamentally unfair and counterproductive result.\n  If someone at any time wants to debate whether the Federal Tax Code \nshould allow a deduction for any State and local taxes, whether it is a \nsales tax or an income tax, be that as it may, that debate could take \nplace. But there is no principled reason why sales taxes should be \ndenied a deduction that is applicable to income taxes.\n  Equally important, including the deductibility of sales tax will also \nprovide a direct boost to consumers and to our economy. For example, in \nTennessee alone, almost one-quarter of all taxpayers would receive an \naverage benefit of $470 each. Citizens in States such as Texas, South \nDakota and Tennessee could use that money to buy school supplies, to \ninvest in their businesses, to make a downpayment for a car, to pay off \nsome of those credit card bills.\n  This provision takes relatively little from the Federal Treasury but \nmonumentally changes the lives and livelihoods of the 54 million \nAmericans living in States that have chosen not to impose an income \ntax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8985-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FSC/ETI JOBS CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I am hopeful that the House will appoint its conferees to \nthe FSC/ETI JOBS conference so we can start producing this important \nconference report which affects manufacturing jobs throughout America. \nI am optimistic that when the conference report is finished, it will \ninclude this very important provision on State sales tax deductibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8985-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8985-S8986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALES TAX DEDUCTIBILITY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a matter of simple \ntax fairness for the citizens of my State.\n  South Dakota, like several other States, has no State income tax. Our \nState relies on sales tax to pay for schools, police departments, and \nother critical needs.\n  While people in other States can deduct their State income taxes from \ntheir Federal taxes, people in States without income taxes do not get a \ncorresponding deduction for the State sales tax that they pay. Those \npeople are losing out on a deduction they deserve.\n  I strongly support fixing this unfairness, and last year I and a \nnumber of my colleagues introduced a bill to do that. I also agree with \nthe bipartisan group of my colleagues--including Senators Frist, \nHutchison, Cantwell, Murray, and Enzi--who point out that we can fix \nthis problem now in the FSC/ETI bill. The sales tax fix will be part of \nthat conference.\n  We in the Senate have appointed conferees and are ready to roll up \nour sleeves and get to work on the conference. However, the House has \nyet to appoint conferees so our work can begin.\n  I do not understand what the House is waiting for because this is \nimportant\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\nlegislation, and I urge them to act quickly so that we can address both \nthe broader bill and the State sales tax issue very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S8986-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4567, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4567) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2005, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first, I thank all Senators for their \ncooperation in the handling of the bill yesterday. We made progress in \ndisposing of several amendments. We also achieved a very important \nmilestone in the handling of the bill. We have an agreed list of \namendments that are in order to the bill. This will limit the offering \nof amendments to only those on the list. We appreciate very much \nSenators permitting us to enter that order last evening.\n  The bill provides total new budget authority for fiscal year 2005 of \n$33.1 billion to fund the Department. In addition, an estimated $2.9 \nbillion in collections from offsetting collections from user-financed \nservices, Customs duties, and trust funds will be available to finance \nactivities of the Department for fiscal year 2005.\n  Excluding mandatory appropriations for retired pay of the United \nStates Coast Guard, the bill provides $32 billion in discretionary \nspending, consistent with the amount allocated by the full committee \nfor this bill. This is $896 million more than the President's fiscal \nyear 2005 discretionary spending request; and $2.8 billion more than \nthe fiscal year 2004 appropriations level, excluding emergency \nsupplemental appropriations and including a $1.6 billion increase in \nthe availability of advance appropriations for biodefense \ncountermeasures.\n  The additional amount above the President's request level is used to \nincrease funding to assist State and local first responders, to enhance \naviation security, to harden critical infrastructures that are \npotential targets to terrorists, and to better secure our ports and \nwaterways.\n  The bill also attempts to address the most critical outstanding need, \nthat of rail and transit security. This proposal includes $150 million \nfor rail and transit security grants; $34 million for high explosives \ncountermeasures, including $24 million for commuter and passenger rail \nenvironments; $194 million for protective actions, including protective \nmeasures for rail; and $15 million for rail inspectors and canine \nexplosives detection teams.\n  The bill recommends $632 million for management and operations of the \nDepartment, including $65 million requested by the President to \ncontinue to consolidate the Department's headquarters operations at the \nNebraska Avenue Complex.\n  To secure our Nation's borders and enforce and investigate customs \nand immigration laws, the bill recommends total appropriations of $8.7 \nbillion, including $5 billion for the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection and $3.4 billion for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement. This includes an increase of $50 million more than the \nrequest level for the Federal air marshals.\n  An increase of $64 million is provided for the container security \ninitiative. This initiative seeks to enhance the security of an \nindispensable, but vulnerable, link in the chain of global trade: the \noceangoing shipping container. Proactively screening containers before \nthey reach the United States will significantly contribute to efforts \nto secure the borders against dangers that might be introduced through \ncommercial trade. A more secure maritime trade infrastructure will \nensure the continued smooth flow of merchandise through seaports.\n\n  The illegal alien population of the United States has risen to record \nlevels. According to the Department, the undocumented alien population \nhas grown from approximately 3 million in 1990 to an estimated 9 \nmillion today. This bill provides $107 million in additional resources \nfor detaining and removing such individuals from this country.\n  The bill also provides $478 million for the Federal Protective \nService, which is the same as the President's budget request, to ensure \na safe and secure workplace for Federal employees.\n  Also included is $340 million for U.S. VISIT, the new system to \nidentify and track foreign visitors and students and to screen for \npossible terrorist or criminal involvement.\n  In new budget authority $140 million is provided for Citizenship and \nImmigration Services in addition to the $1.5 billion estimated in \ncollections available for these operations.\n  For the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, responsible for \nensuring security across the U.S. transportation system, including \naviation, railways, highways, and ports, the bill provides total \nfunding of $5.2 billion, $184 million more than the President's budget \nrequest, and $648 million more than the fiscal year 2004 level. In \naddition, it assumes $400 million less than the President's request in \noffsetting aviation security fee collections. While the bill does not \ncontain the President's requested legislative proposal to mandate the \nlevel of fees, it does require the General Accounting Office to \ninitiate review activities necessary to resolve the appropriate level \nof fee collections based on calendar year 2000 airline security costs.\n  Over 53 percent of the funds made available for TSA are provided for \nFederal screeners at our Nation's commercial airports. This includes \n$2.8 billion for aviation security personnel compensation and benefits, \nand training of passenger and baggage screeners. Also provided for \naviation security is $161 million for passenger checkpoint support and \n$210 million for the purchase of baggage explosive detection systems.\n  For airport security direction and enforcement, $872 million is \nprovided, including $293 million for airport information technology \nsupport, $25 million for Federal flight deck officer training, and $43 \nmillion for air cargo security and enforcement.\n  For maritime and surface transportation security activities, the bill \nprovides $55 million for transportation worker identification \ncredentials; $15 million for rail security efforts; $17 million for \nhazardous materials driver license endorsement program; and $24 million \nfor maritime and land security staffing, operational oversight, and \nadministration of maritime and land grant functions.\n\n  To further improve transportation security, $181 million is provided \nfor research and development of the latest technologies to detect and \ndeter terrorist attacks, including $57 million for research and \ndevelopment of next generation explosive detection systems, and $75 \nmillion for research and development of new technologies to screen air \ncargo.\n  This bill provides nearly $7.5 billion for the United States Coast \nGuard, including $5.2 billion for military pay and operation of bases \nand $1.1 billion for upgrading and replacing the Coast Guard's cutters, \nhelicopters and planes.\n  Currently, the Coast Guard is deployed in support of operations in \nIraq, is conducting its new homeland security mission, and is \nmaintaining its traditional missions such as marine resource protection \nand drug interdiction.\n  The Coast Guard's deepwater recapitalization program is funded at \n$776 million, $98 million more than the President's request level.\n  For the United States Secret Service, the President's budget request \nof $1.2 billion is fully funded to support the Service's protective and \ninvestigative missions.\n  For the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, $224 million is \nincluded to provide preeminent law enforcement training to more than \n20,000 Federal law enforcement professionals in the coming fiscal year.\n  To further strengthen the capacity of the Nation's first responders, \na total of $3.7 billion is provided for the new Office of State and \nLocal Government Coordination and Preparedness, created\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\nby the Secretary of Homeland Security through the use of his \nreorganization authority. The Department's grant programs have been \nconsolidated under this new office. Included in the amount recommended \nis $1.37 billion for State and local basic formula grants, including \nlaw enforcement terrorism prevention grants; and $1.2 billion for urban \narea security initiative discretionary grants.\n  Within the urban area security initiative, specific funds have been \nprovided, $150 million for port security grants, $150 million for rail \nand transit security grants, $15 million for trucking security grants, \nand $10 million for intercity bus security grants.\n  The bill also provides $700 million for firefighter assistance grants \nand $180 million for emergency management performance grants. Both of \nthese programs are continued under the consolidated office as stand-\nalone programs.\n  The bill provides over $5.6 billion for programs and activities of \nthe Directorate for Emergency Preparedness and Response which was \ncreated with the transfer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFEMA, to the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  This appropriation includes over $231.499 million for preparedness, \nmitigation, response and recovery activities, including $30 million for \n28 strategically located urban search and rescue teams.\n  Disaster assistance is funded at $2.151 billion, as requested in the \nPresident's budget. The President's request of $2.15 billion is based \non the historical yearly average of $2.9 billion, and relies on an \nanticipated carryover balance from the previous year to meet the needs \nof disaster victims.\n  Previously appropriated funds of $2.528 billion, will be available \nfor fiscal year 2005 for Project BioShield to spur the development of \nbiodefense countermeasures.\n  In addition, the bill assumes the transfer of the Strategic National \nStockpile to the Department of Health and Human Services, as proposed \nin the President's budget.\n  For the Department's information analysis and infrastructure \nprotection activities, the bill recommends $876 million to identify and \nassess current threats to the homeland, map threat information against \ncurrent vulnerabilities, issue timely warnings, and take preventive and \nprotective action.\n  A critical component of IAIP is the development and implementation of \nprotective actions for the Nation's critical infrastructures. The bill \nprovides $193 million to carry out activities including the buffer zone \nand site security program for protection of chemical facilities, \nnuclear power plants, nuclear spent fuel storage facilities, water \ntreatment facilities, bridges, subways, tunnels, and other critical \ninfrastructures.\n  To identify these critical infrastructures and their vulnerabilities, \nto assess identified risks, and to deploy a database of critical \ninfrastructures, the bill provides $65 million.\n  The bill provides $92 million to allow for the Department to share \ndata with infrastructure owners and operators regarding vulnerabilities \nand for the hosting of departmental applications, network connectivity, \nand critical data storage.\n  As part of the effort by IAIP to better secure not only physical \nassets but also cyber assets, the bill includes $67 million to monitor, \npredict, and prevent cyber attacks, to minimize the damage from and to \nefficiently recover from attacks.\n  For science and technology, total appropriations of $1.1 billion are \nrecommended to support homeland security through basic and applied \nresearch; to develop prototypes; and to procure technologies to detect, \ndestroy, dispose, and mitigate the effects of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Of this amount, the bill provides $346 million for biological \ncountermeasures to deter, detect, and mitigate acts of biological \nterrorism against the United States.\n  The bill also provides $128 million for nuclear and radiological \ncountermeasures for use in operational environments; $52 million for \nthe development of technologies to defend against attacks by chemical \nwarfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals; and $34 million for high \nexplosives countermeasures, including $24 million for rail security \nhigh explosives countermeasures.\n  A total of $75 million is made available for the rapid development \nand prototyping of new technologies in support of homeland security.\n  The bill also continues funding of $69 million for the establishment \nof a university-based system to enhance and strengthen the efforts of \nhomeland security on our Nation's campuses.\n  Funding of $61 million is provided for research, development, \ntesting, and evaluation of an anti-missile system for commercial \naircraft.\n  Mr. President, I know other Senators wish to speak on the bill, and \nsome want to make opening statements. I think particularly the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has a statement to make on the \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3597\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the President of the United States has been \nout on the campaign trail asking the question, is America safer? That \nis a good question. Is America safer? That is a good question. \nPresident Bush concludes that America is safer. He pats himself on the \nback, wraps himself in the flag, and tells Americans that he is a war \nPresident and that we should trust him.\n  The President is asking himself the wrong question. He asserts that \nAmerica is safer. Well, safer than what? Safer than we were on \nSeptember 11, 2001?\n  In August of 2001, while in Crawford, TX, the President read an \nintelligence report providing clear warnings that al-Qaida was \npreparing to attack the United States. Yet, tragically, on September \n11, 2001, Americans were not safe. Therefore, telling Americans that we \nare safer than we were on September 11 is not much of an \naccomplishment. Making America safe is not that simple.\n  The President should be asking himself, in the 3 years since the \nterrorist attacks of 9/11 have we been taking the prudent steps \nnecessary to address the clear and present dangers that we face right \nnow and that we know of right now? Last week President Bush said:\n\n       This election will also determine how America responds to \n     the continuing danger of terrorism--and you know where I \n     stand. Three days after September 11 I stood where Americans \n     died in the ruins of the twin towers. Workers in hard hats \n     were shouting to me, ``whatever it takes.''\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Since that day I wake up every morning thinking about how \n     to better protect our country. I will never relent in \n     defending America, whatever it takes.\n\n  Rhetoric is easy. Rhetoric is cheap. But the followup is hard. If the \nPresident meant what he said last week he would not be satisfied with a \nbill that cuts funds for first responders. He would not be satisfied \nwith a bill that leaves first responders unable to communicate. He \nwould not be satisfied with a bill that leaves airline passengers \nworrying about explosives on board, or that fails to adequately invest \nin securing our ports, our chemical facilities, and our trains. We have \nto match talk with action and I hope the people will remember that, \ninsist on it, and hold us responsible if we don't do it. And that goes \nfor the President as well.\n  In response to authorization bills signed by the President but not \nfunded, in response to 9/11 Commission recommendations, and in order to \naddress well known vulnerabilities not funded in the committee bill, I \nhave offered an amendment today that totals $2 billion and includes \n$586 million to equip and train our first responders and to address the \ninteroperability radio communications problem. Consistent with the 9/11 \nCommission recommendation, all of these first responder funds will be \nallocated based on threat.\n  Moreover, I am adding $350 million to help secure our rail and mass \ntransit system. Also included is $324 million to expedite the \nmodernization of Coast Guard ships, planes and helicopters, bringing \nfunding for the Deepwater program to the level recently authorized by \nCongress and signed by the President. Also included is $150 million for \nimproved air security for purchasing equipment for screening passengers \nand carry-on baggage for explosives, consistent with 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations.\n  How many people realize that we do not have the equipment that checks \nairline passengers for explosives? People may think that we do have it. \nWe do not. We have equipment that checks passengers' carry-on for guns, \nmetal objects, but not explosives. Now, remember that. Keep that in \nmind. So, included in my amendment is $150 million for improved air \nsecurity for purchasing equipment for screening passengers and carry-on \nbaggage for explosives.\n  Also, there is $125 million for port security grants, $111 million \nfor border security for additional radiation detectors, additional \nborder patrol personnel and for improved detention and removal, $100 \nmillion for hiring additional fire personnel, $100 million for securing \nour drinking water systems, $100 million for securing chemical \nfacilities. In the Kanawha Valley in south central West Virginia there \nare chemical facilities. There is a great complex of chemical \nfacilities, as great as any other in the Western Hemisphere, I would \nsay.\n  Also included in this amendment is $50 million for grants to secure \nnonprofit organizations such as hospitals, colleges, churches and \nsynagogues, and $4 million for hazardous materials and grants.\n  This amendment meets critical needs. It addresses vulnerabilities \nthat we all know exist. And let there be no doubt. If we know that \nthese gaps exist, so do the terrorists know these gaps exist.\n  It has been more than 2\\1/2\\ years since Richard Reed, the so-called \n``shoe bomber,'' tried to blow up a Miami-bound aircraft over the \nAtlantic Ocean with explosives that he carried onto the aircraft. Only \nlast month, two Russian airplanes simultaneously were blown out of the \nsky most probably by Chechnyan terrorists who carried the explosives on \nboard the aircraft. The 9/11 Commission report states clearly and \nsuccinctly that the threat posed to passenger aircraft by explosives \nbeing carried onto the plane is real. Yet the President has not \nresponded, so the Senate must respond.\n  The additional $100 million in this amendment will significantly \nexpand the effort to screen air travelers for explosives and chemical \nweapons. We know that newly developed passenger portals can detect \nwhether passengers are carrying explosives. These systems have been \ntested, and these systems have been proven to work. We need the money \nto deploy these systems at our Nation's airports. Lives depend on it. \nThose of you who travel on aircraft, your lives depend on it.\n  Following the March 11 Madrid railroad bombing, the administration \nissued security bulletins to law enforcement officials and transit \nauthorities warning of the danger of similar attacks here at home.\n  So that is what we did. We issued security bulletins.\n  Crowded trains are inviting targets for terrorists. Busy transit \nstations allow for easy access, anonymity, and quick escape. Yet the \nadministration requested no new funding to secure mass transit \nfacilities.\n  Your lives depend on it.\n  We cannot continue to deceive the American people. The American \npeople believe they are being made safe. They undoubtedly believe the \npassengers are being examined, tested, and checked for carry-on \nexplosives.\n  Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson said ``millions of Americans travel by \nrail every day and recent world events highlight the need to ensure \nthey are kept safe from acts of terror.'' Yet this White House proposed \nno new funds, just an unfunded mandate. Paper directives and press \nreleases will not--will not--stop terrorists bombs.\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\n  On May 6, 2004, the Senate Banking Committee on a bipartisan basis \napproved S. 2453 which authorizes $5.2 billion for transit security. On \nMay 21, 2004, the Senate Commerce Committee, also on a bipartisan \nbasis, approved S. 2273 which authorizes $1.2 billion for additional \nrail security activities.\n  On a broad bipartisan basis, these committees have recognized the \noverwhelming need for this Congress and this administration to step up \nto the plate and robustly address the security threat facing our rail \nand transit systems. The President has not responded. The Senate \nabsolutely must respond. So my amendment includes $350 million for \ntransit security grants.\n  Three years now after 9/11, despite hundreds of firemen losing their \nlives in the World Trade Center because they could not receive \nemergency radio messages to evacuate, the Federal Government has \ncontributed little to the efforts to solve the interoperability \ncommunications problem. In fact, the President proposes to terminate \nthe Justice Department's Interoperable and Communication Grants Program \nand proposes no funding for fire departments and other first responders \nthrough the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  What in the name of Heaven is the President waiting on?\n  This amendment provides $100 million for interoperable communications \nequipment. The Senate Commerce-Justice-State bill is expected to \ninclude $100 million for the COPS Program to improve interoperable \ncommunications for police departments. Why not make sure that police, \nfire, and emergency medical personnel can communicate with one another? \nThe $100 million contained in my amendment meets only a fraction of the \nneed. But it is a critical start.\n  While States can use their first responder grants to solve the \ninteroperability problem, many States have not chosen to use first \nresponder dollars to address this problem because of the complexity of \nmultijurisdiction and multiagency purchases, and because of competing \ndemands on first responder funds. In 2003, according to the Alliance in \nSupport of America's First Responders, only 3 percent of the funding \nwas dedicated for interoperable communications equipment. A separate \nfunding source is required to overcome these hurdles. My amendment \naccomplishes that goal.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommends allocating first responder funds based \non threat rather than on population. My amendment adds $440 million to \nthe $875 million currently provided in the Senate bill for urban areas \nsecurity initiative grants. These grants are targeted to cities that \nare determined to be at greatest risk of a terrorist attack, that have \nthe highest number of critical assets such as tunnels, bridges, and \nchemical plants, and have population density. We need to get funds to \nplaces that are most at risk.\n  On August 1, the Department had such specific threat information that \nit moved northern New Jersey, Washington, DC, and New York City from \nCode Yellow to Code Orange. We must back up such targeted warnings with \nfunds, and the Urban Area Security Initiative Program allows the \nSecretary to send funds where they are needed most--not based on \nformula but based on facts.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations report, authored by former Senator \nWarren Rudman, found that America will fall approximately $98.4 billion \nshort of meeting critical emergency responder needs in the next 5 \nyears. Cities are spending an additional $70 million per week on \npersonnel costs alone. Funding urban area security initiative grants is \nthe only way to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security can get \nmoneys to the cities that are most likely at risk.\n  My amendment also provides an additional $46 million for the Fire \nGrant Program to restore the program to current levels and avoid an \nill-advised funding cut. In the current threat environment, why in the \nworld would one slash fire grant funding?\n  This year, the Fire Administration received 20,366 applications \ntotaling $2.6 billion from local fire departments. The bill provides \n$700 million for the program. As one the pillars of the first responder \ncommunity, it is essential that our firefighters have the best \nequipment and the best training possible, but because of shortsighted \nadministration budgets, too many fire departments are being left high \nand dry.\n  What about our borders? What about our national borders? The U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection Agency, CBP, has a 5-year plan for \ndeploying radiation portal monitors at our ports. The plan calls for \ndeployment of approximately 2,000 of these monitors at locations around \nthe country based on assessment of the nuclear smuggling threat, \nfocusing on nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons material, radiation \ndispersal devices, and other illegal or illicit radioactive material. \nWhy should we wait for a 5-year plan? The additional $50 million in \nthis amendment will allow CBP to deploy radiation portal monitors to \nscreen 100 percent of the inbound containerized cargo at 30 additional \nseaport terminals, thus completing the deployment of these monitors at \nAmerica's top 22 seaports and several Southwest border land crossings. \nLet's start now.\n  My amendment also addresses the need for more personnel on our \nborders. The USA PATRIOT Act, passed in the immediate aftermath of the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks, calls for a tripling of the number of \nborder patrol agents as well as Customs Service and Immigration and \nNaturalization Service inspectors on the northern border. While the \nborder patrol has met the PATRIOT Act requirements to increase the \nnumber of agents on the northern border, the number of Customs and \nBorder Protection--CBP--officers remains woefully inadequate. In May of \nthis year, the CBP was 1,428 officers short of the goal. I repeat, in \nMay of 2004, the CBP--Customs and Border Protection--was 1,428 officers \nshort of the goal. Yet, incredibly, the agency has been stuck in a \nhiring freeze ordered by the administration in March. The $50 million \nprovided in this amendment will add 439 new CBP officers, getting us \nalmost a third of the way toward meeting the PATRIOT Act requirement.\n  My amendment also includes $324 million for the Coast Guard Deepwater \nProgram. Prior to September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard began to \nmodernize its fleet of assets. The program, named Deepwater, called for \nthe modernization or replacement of some 100 cutters and 200 aircraft \nover a 20-year period.\n  Since the attacks on September 11, the Coast Guard's responsibilities \nhave grown substantially. As a result, assets vital to homeland \nsecurity are being used more today than ever in the Coast Guard \nhistory. The Government Accountability Office recently reported that \n``resource usage--as measured by the number of hours the Coast Guard's \ncutters, boats and aircraft are used to perform its mission--was up \nalmost 40 percent from pre-September 11 baseline.''\n  The Coast Guard Commandant, in testimony before the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, testified that the \ncurrent condition of the aging fleet threatens Coast Guard mission \nperformance. He testified that Coast Guard assets are in a ``declining \nreadiness spiral.'' Yet the President does not respond. What happened \nto ``whatever it takes''? The President's budget for the Deepwater \nProgram will take 22 years to complete. This is 2 years slower than the \nCapital Improvement Program envisioned when Deepwater was conceived \nprior to the tragic events of September 11.\n\n  My amendment provides $324 million above the amount provided in the \ncommittee bill, the full amount authorized by the Congress and the \nPresident just 1 month ago. This funding will address the Coast Guard's \n``declining readiness spiral.'' The funding would go to accelerate the \nCoast Guard's highest priorities, which are to enhance safety and \nreliability on the HH-65 helicopter, accelerate the design of the fast-\nresponse cutter for near-shore missions, and complete design of the \noffshore response cutter for the high-endurance missions of the Coast \nGuard. The funding will accelerate the Deepwater Program, finishing it \nin 15 years instead of the administration's 22-year plan.\n  We must do more to protect our seaports. The top 50 U.S. ports \naccount for 90 percent of all cargo container tonnage entering the \nUnited States. A 1-month closure of a major port would cost our \nnational economy at least $60 billion, but because of the tremendous \nvolume of containerized cargo, customs officials are inspecting only 5 \npercent\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nof the 9 million containers that come into our ports on vessels each \nyear.\n  The Coast Guard has estimated that $1.125 billion will be needed in \nthe first year, and $5.4 billion will be needed over the next 10 years \nfor the ports to comply with the Federal regulations mandated by the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act which was signed into law by \nPresident Bush with great fanfare in November of 2002. However, until \nthis year's budget submission, President Bush had requested no funds--\nnone--for port security. Last year, Congress provided $125 million for \nport security grants. Yet, despite telling the people that security is \nhis top priority, President Bush proposes to cut port security funding \nby 62 percent. Promises are broken once again.\n  Upon adoption of the Levin-Collins amendment last March, the Senate \nversion of the resolution assumed that $275 million would be \nappropriated for port security grants in fiscal year 2005. The bill \nbefore the Senate today provides $150 million. The additional $125 \nmillion in this amendment keeps the port security grant promise that \nwas made in the Senate budget resolution.\n  The amendment also includes $100 million to secure our Nation's \ndrinking water systems. The Nation's water infrastructure includes \n75,000 dams and reservoirs, 168,000 public drinking water facilities, \n16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities, and thousands of \nmiles of pipes, aqueducts, water distribution and sewer lines. We have \na sense of the vulnerability. Why not protect this piece of critical \ninfrastructure?\n  The amendment also includes $100 million for chemical security \ngrants. In March 2003, Homeland Security Secretary Ridge said, ``There \nis no question that when we take a look at a chemical facility, the \npossibility that terrorists could use that economic asset and turn it \ninto a weapon is something that we need to be concerned about and are \nconcerned about.''\n  Apparently that concern has vanished. Since September 11, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has done little to enhance security at \nthe 66,000 chemical plants across this country. This is frightening, \nwhen security experts such as Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings \ninstitution called the threat to chemical plants a ``ticking time-\nbomb.''\n  When Secretary Ridge testified last year he said that the chemical \nindustry was better suited to assess vulnerability and take appropriate \nsecurity measures than the Federal Government. But earlier this year \nthe Government Accountability Office submitted testimony to Congress \nsaying that ``Despite the industry's voluntary efforts, the extent of \nsecurity preparedness at United States chemical facilities is \nunknown.''\n  When Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Under \nSecretary Frank Libutti testified in March before the subcommittee, he \nsaid the key in working with the chemical industry was ``partnership'' \nbetween the Federal Government and the private sector. Yet almost in \nthe next sentence, he said industry needs to ``belly-up'' when it comes \nto paying for improved security. What kind of partnership is that? We \nshould be taking action now instead of rolling the dice hoping that an \nattack against a chemical plant does not happen.\n  My amendment also includes $50 million for hiring additional Federal \nair marshals. The administration has failed to meet its goal for hiring \nair marshals. In fact, the administration has allowed the number of air \nmarshals to drop by 9 percent this year. With numerous terrorist \nthreats against our airlines and a 6-percent increase in the number of \nflights, why allow the number of critical flights covered by Federal \nair marshals to drop?\n  Since 9/11, the administration has increased the threat level risk to \nCode Orange six times. On September 1, Secretary Ridge spoke before the \nAmerican Legion's national convention and said:\n\n       Terrorists in the 21st century represent a daunting enemy. \n     They represent no country, no cause, no flag, no people--yet \n     they have access to a steady supply of technologies, and \n     funds, and willing recruits. They are undeniably methodical \n     and maniacal in both their weaponry and will. They seek to \n     use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons . . . and before \n     them lays a map of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, according to the New York Times, on September 7, Vice \nPresident Cheney said:\n\n       It's absolutely essential eight weeks from today, on \n     November 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the \n     wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and \n     we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the \n     standpoint of the United States.\n\n  What an irresponsible, what an utterly irresponsible statement for a \nVice President of the United States, or for any public officer, to \nmake. Think of that.\n  Let's read that again. According to the New York Times, on September \n7, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       It's absolutely essential eight weeks from today, on \n     November 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the \n     wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again and \n     we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the \n     standpoint of the United States.\n\n  How utterly irresponsible. What an irresponsible statement for a \npublic officer to make. If the Vice President were all that interested \nin homeland security, rather than political posturing, he would be \nurging his Republican colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The President has said he would do ``whatever it takes'' to defend \nAmerica. If the President was being straight with the American people \nwhen he said that, he would be supporting--he would be supporting--this \namendment. He would support it. It provides $2 billion for a targeted \nset of programs. It implements several 9/11 Commission recommendations. \nThe amendment funds programs that have been authorized by the Congress \nbut not funded by the President.\n  We cannot make America safer with empty promises. We cannot make \nAmerica safer with duct tape. My amendment funds the bricks and mortar \nof a strong homeland defense. It could save countless lives and it \noffers real security, not just empty rhetoric. What could be wrong with \nspending a little more to protect the American people? What could be \nwrong with keeping a promise? What could be wrong with actually doing \n``whatever it takes''?\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator yields the floor, I, \nduring the break--and I called the Senator at his home and told him \nthat I read his book, which at the time I read it was No. 2 on the New \nYork Times Bestseller List. And I told the Senator that I used this \nbook as a text for several townhall meetings I held.\n  The Senator wrote this book. I will direct the attention of the body \nto page 112 of the book, ``Losing America.'' I say to the Senator, \nthrough the Chair, in this book you have one, two, three--about four \npages of detail of times you personally have tried to increase the \nfunding for homeland security. I refer to page 112, where you say:\n\n       On November 14, 2001, the White House opposed the inclusion \n     of $15 billion for homeland security in an economic security \n     package, including $4 billion for bioterrorism and food \n     safety, $4.6 billion for emergency first responders and \n     computer improvements at the federal level, $3.3 billion for \n     transportation security for airports and ports, $1.1 billion \n     for border security, $2 billion for security at nuclear \n     power, water, and other facilities and mail screening, \n     warning that such spending ``will only expand the size of \n     government.'' All Senate Republicans voted to block the \n     funding. . . .\n\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. BYRD. I recall it.\n  Mr. REID. I refer to this same page:\n\n       On December 4, 2001, the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     unanimously sent the fiscal year 2002 defense appropriations \n     bill to the Senate floor for action. The bill included $13.1 \n     billion for homeland security.\n\n  There was a parliamentary point of order raised by the Republicans \nthat reduced the funding.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am aware of it.\n  Mr. REID. Continuing to quote:\n\n       On June 6, 2002, the Senate passed by a vote of 71 to 22 a \n     supplemental money bill that contained $8.3 billion for \n     homeland security. . . . On June 17, the president's senior \n     advisor recommended a veto of that bill because it contained \n     ``excessive'' homeland security spending.\n\n  Does the Senator recall writing that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, I will continue to quote:\n\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\n\n       In August 2002, the president failed to make an emergency \n     designation for $2.5 billion for homeland security to \n     specifically address shortcomings identified by the Rudman/\n     Hart Report on terrorism vulnerabilities. . . . Bush said at \n     the time, ``I made my opposition clear. We were pretty plain-\n     spoken. . . . We'll spend none of it.''\n\n  Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I will not list all of these, but suffice it to say, again, \non January 16, as reported in your book, there was a vote on an \namendment you had offered to add $5 billion. By a party-line vote that \nwas defeated. It had $5 billion. You reduced it to $2 billion. That was \ndefeated by a party-line vote.\n  On April 2 and April 3, you had amendments which provided $4.8 \nbillion more than the President requested. All of the amendments were \ndefeated.\n  On July 24, 2003, I say to Senator Byrd, you--quoting from your \nbook--``offered an amendment to the homeland security bill that would \nhave provided $292 million for activities such as port security grants, \ngrants to train firefighters to respond to a terrorist attack, funds to \nhelp the Coast Guard provide security at our ports, funds for locating \nterrorism vulnerabilities at chemical plants'' and the amendment was \ndefeated on a party-line vote.\n  Finally, on September 17, 2003, shortly before we recessed:\n\n     . . . in the House-Senate conference on the same homeland \n     security appropriations bill, [the Senator from West \n     Virginia] again tried to add homeland security money, $1.25 \n     billion for port, aviation, Coast Guard, customs, first \n     responders, and chemical facility programs, and [his] \n     amendment failed on a party-line vote.\n\n  Continuing to quote from ``Losing America,'' the Senator from West \nVirginia wrote:\n\n       Nobody can convince me that this White House is serious \n     about homeland security.\n\n  The Senator, of course, recalls that. Does the Senator still believe \nthat it appears the administration is not serious about homeland \nsecurity when time after time they refuse to fund these programs that \nare essential to the State of Nevada and the rest of the country? Does \nthe Senator agree that they haven't shown any seriousness about this?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no question about it. Time after time, as the \nSenator says, they have turned down amendments of this Senate to \nenhance the security of our people, our facilities, our properties. \nTime after time after time. Our pleas have fallen upon deaf ears. And \nin the nearly 3 years since the tragic events of 9/11, I myself have \npressed the Senate to provide additional resources for homeland \nsecurity. The administration, the President, including the great Vice \nPresident we have, consistently opposed these efforts. The President \nwent so far as to threaten to veto bills if they included what the \nadministration characterized as ``wasteful spending.''\n  There are many examples--let me give a few--of funding contained in \nthese amendments that certainly would have helped to make America \nsafer. In November of 2001, Senate Democrats supported my amendment to \ninclude $15 billion for homeland security in an economic stimulus \npackage, including $4 billion for bioterrorism and food safety; $4.6 \nbillion for State and local law enforcement and fire training and \nequipment and Federal computer improvements; $3.3 billion for \ntransportation security, including airport and port security; $1.1 \nbillion for border security; $2.0 billion for security at nuclear \npower, water, and other critical infrastructure facilities, and for \nmail screening. The White House opposed the effort, warning of \n``permanent spending on other projects that have nothing to do with \nstimulus and that will only expand the size of government.''\n  I could go on with example after example. But I shall simply ask \nunanimous consent that there be printed in the Record a litany of these \nprojects.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Byrd Amendment\n\n       Provides an additional $2 billion for the following \n     Homeland Security functions:\n       $665 million for the Office of State and Local Government \n     Coordination and Preparedness ($440 million for discretionary \n     grants for use in high-threat, high density urban areas; $125 \n     million for port security grants; and $100 million for grants \n     for interoperable communications equipment);\n       $350 million for Mass Transit and Rail Security;\n       $324 million for the Integrated Deepwater Systems program \n     of the Coast Guard;\n       $100 million for screening passengers and carry-on baggage \n     for explosives by Transportation Security Administration \n     Aviation Security;\n       $100 million for Custom and Border Protection Salaries ($50 \n     million for purchase and deployment of radiation portal \n     monitors and $50 million for staffing at the northern \n     border);\n       $11 million for detentions and removals by Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement;\n       $50 million for Federal Air Marshalls;\n       $4 million for hazardous materials security grants of the \n     Transportation Security Administration;\n       $50 million to secure high risk non-profit organizations;\n       $46 million for Firefighter Assistance Grants;\n       $100 million for Firefighter Hiring Grants; and\n       $200 million for Information Analysis and Infrastructure \n     Protection.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The President has tried to convince the American people \nthat they are safer because he created a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Well, reorganizing the deck chairs of our bureaucracy does \nnot make us safer. It takes money. Money.\n  I have offered this amendment in the hopes the Senate will accept it \nand that we might take it to conference. This is an opportunity to do \nwhat we should do in order to save our people and their homes.\n  I thank my distinguished friend from Nevada for his contribution to \nthis debate. I thank my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee on which I serve, the subcommittee making \nappropriations for homeland security. I thank that Senator. He does the \nbest he can do and has done the best he can do, but he is limited in \nwhat he can do. I thank him for his cooperation, for his manner of \nholding the hearings. He has always been very fair. I thank him. I \nthank other members of the subcommittee.\n  But we need to do more. My amendment is an opportunity for the Senate \nto do more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has offered an amendment that would increase the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, according to the CBO, by $2 billion.\n  A variety of accounts are included in the amendment for increases. \nThe Customs and Border Protection account, for example, would be \nincreased under the Senator's amendment by $50 million for northern \nborder staffing and $50 million for radiation detectors at ports of \nentry.\n  The bill we have before us already includes a $50 million increase \nfor radiation detectors. The Department has met the goal already of \ntripling the number of border patrol agents on the northern border. \nFunds were provided last year in the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill to ensure that more border patrol agents would be deployed on the \nnorthern border. We have provided significant increases for inspector \nstaffing since September 11, 2001. We have included funds, for example, \nfor radiation detection equipment and other detection systems along the \nnorthern border.\n  Last year, Congress provided funding for the permanent establishment \nof the first northern border air wing to be located in Bellingham, WA. \nResources are being made available for a second northern border air \nwing in New York. We expect further funds will be requested to continue \nthe expansion of coverage of the northern border in future years. It is \na challenging undertaking. That border covers over 5,000 miles. It is a \ndaunting task. We cannot accomplish in 1 year or with one amendment all \nof the goals we have to enhance and improve the protection of our \nhomeland by more sophisticated, more modern deployments along the \nnorthern border, but we are making and have made important strides. We \ncannot achieve every goal immediately. It is going to take time.\n  My suggestion in opposing this amendment is that we are appropriately \nidentifying the priorities and making the funds available to achieve \nthe goals in a thoughtful, coherent, and successful fashion. The \nadministration is proposing increases in these accounts. We have \naccommodated those proposals. We have added to many of\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\nthe proposals over and above what the administration has requested.\n  Another example in this amendment offered by my friend proposes a $50 \nmillion increase in the Federal Air Marshal program. The Department has \nworked to supplement resources for these activities by using transfer \nauthority to increase resources. The Department has used other Federal \nlaw enforcement officers to provide additional flight coverage on \ncommercial airliners as needed. The committee recognizes in this bill \nthe needs of this organization, and we have provided an additional $50 \nmillion in this bill for this next fiscal year for Federal Air Marshals \nout of additional funds provided to this Committee.\n  Another account is Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Senator's \namendment would add an additional $11 million for the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, Alternatives to Detention program. The bill \nalready provides $14.2 million--an increase of $11 million--providing \nfunding for 30 new positions, as requested by the President, to expand \nthe Alternatives to Detention program. This amendment, if we agree to \nit, would expand the program 12-fold in a single year.\n  Another account, Transportation Security Administration. The \nSenator's amendment proposes a $104 million increase for the \nTransportation Security Administration for enhanced passenger \ncheckpoint screening and hazardous material security grants. Last year, \nour committee proposed and Congress approved $153.2 million for these \nactivities. In this bill for next year, we have included $344.3 million \nfor passenger and baggage screener training of all newly hired \nscreeners and for recurrent and advanced technical training for the \nentire screener workforce to meet proficiency and qualification \nstandards. In addition to the training of screeners, funding is \nincluded for an annual proficiency evaluation of all screeners and \nsupervisors to ensure that the screener workforce meets all of the \nqualifications and standards required to perform their duties as \nrequired by the Aviation Transportation Security Act.\n\n  For this fiscal year, 2004, $33 million was made available for \nairport passenger security checkpoint support. For this next fiscal \nyear, in this bill we provide $161 million--$128 million more than last \nyear's level and $75 million more than the President's request. This \nbill is meeting the challenge. We are providing the funds that will \nenable the Department of Homeland Security to have well-trained, well-\nqualified personnel doing these jobs in our airports, that will meet \nthe requirements of the law and also meet the expectations we all have \nto use the airlines for qualified, capable, and dependable workforce \nparticipants.\n  The additional funding we have provided above the President's request \nis available also to deploy explosive trace detection portals, taking \nadvantage of new technologies that are being developed which help \nensure that we do the best possible job, the most thorough job of \nmaking sure people are not getting on the airplanes with explosive \nmaterials. This is something the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has made a point of in our hearings and in statements on the \nSenate floor--the challenge that is provided by these dangers. We are \ndoing what ought to be done by providing the funds to take advantage of \nnew technology, to encourage development of new technology to help us \nmeet these goals.\n  The Senator's amendment also proposes a $324 million increase in the \nCoast Guard's Deepwater capitalization budget. I am excited about the \nDeepwater Program and the plans the Coast Guard has for modernizing and \nimproving its fleet. This needs to be done. In testimony in our \nhearings, we learned that some of our Coast Guard cutters have hulls \nthat are rusting away. Some are dangerous to operate. They are a threat \nin some cases to the men and women who serve in the Coast Guard. We \ncannot tolerate that. So it is time for us to make new investments in \nrefurbishing and building new ships and boats for the Coast Guard, and \nother equipment, such as helicopters. The whole point is the bill we \npresented to the Senate, though, funds each asset requested in the \nbudget within the Coast Guard's acquisition, construction, and \nimprovement account. It has requested funds it can reasonably and \nefficiently use in the next fiscal year, and our committee has \nrecognized and agreed with this need to address the top priorities of \nthe Coast Guard sooner rather than later.\n\n  So we have increased the funding for reengineering the HH-65 \nhelicopter and have moved forward the plan design of the offshore \npatrol cutter.\n  You cannot build a ship, though, before it is designed. You cannot \nmodernize before you have the preliminary work done. So what we are \ndoing is providing the funds that can be used by the Coast Guard to \nadvance the construction program and to modernize their fleet.\n  The bill before us has already increased the Deepwater account $98 \nmillion above the President's request. We are bordering on overdoing it \nalready, but I am satisfied these additions are necessary and they are \njustified. Going to the level proposed in this amendment is overdoing \nit.\n  In the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \nPreparedness, the distinguished Senator's amendment would add over $700 \nmillion to the First Responder Grant Programs.\n  Some Senators have suggested that we carefully review the Hart-Rudman \nreport, which I did when I was asked to serve as chairman of this \nsubcommittee and talked with my good friend, the former Senator from \nNew Hampshire, who helped write that report to get his thoughts and to \nfind out all I could about their suggestions.\n  What they suggested was there was a $98 billion unfunded need for \nfirst responders, but the report says this: The budget estimates are \npreliminary and the estimates they make in their report are \npreliminary. It depends upon other factors. And the report ``cannot be \nmore precise in the absence of systematic national requirements \nmethodology and that the development of such a methodology is badly \nneeded.''\n  Rather than bank on a number that was reached up and brought out of \nthin air, the administration has gone to a more authoritative \nCommission that was given the responsibility of doing what they said, \nand that is to develop a methodology.\n  That has been done and suggested by the Commission, the Gilmore \nCommission. It is an advisory panel to assess domestic response \ncapabilities for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Gilmore Commission's final report, which was issued in December \nof 2003, includes the following statement:\n\n       Prognostication about the amount of funding that the \n     Federal Government should provide in the near future is \n     premature at best. Recent calls for the funding upward of \n     $100 billion is, in our view, not the wisest approach. \n     Federal funds have started to flow. Absent a more clear \n     articulation of an end state and the levels of preparedness \n     sought to be achieved with some reasonable way to measure our \n     efforts, any attempts to establish an overall price tag is \n     mere speculation and could be politically unwise.\n\n  I agree with that. We have carefully reviewed at our hearings the \ntestimony of experts, those who are in the administration as well who \nhave responsibilities for administering these programs. We have \nquestioned them. We have cross-examined them to find out what the facts \nare, what are the needs.\n  There is adequate funding in the pipeline, I suggest, now for first \nresponder grants. A pipeline is only so big. You can stuff it full of \nmoney and you stop the flow. We do not want to do that. So I think we \nhave to be careful about how much we direct the administration to spend \nand make sure it can be efficiently used, effectively used, and will \nachieve the goals we all share.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will agree that we should not overdo it. We \ndo not need to overspend, and overspending is not going to make us a \nsafer or more secure Nation. Throwing money at complex, technical \nproblems will not produce the results we need for a safer and more \nsecure homeland.\n\n  Having said those things in an effort to put in context the proposal \nthat is before the Senate from the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, and my views, at least, of why we should support the \ncommittee's recommendation, additionally, I am constrained to observe \nthat because of the Congressional Budget Office assessment that this \namendment would call for spending $1.889 billion in additional funds, \nover and above the $32 billion that is already included in this bill, \nit is beyond the allocation of the committee, as agreed to by the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nCommittee on Appropriations yesterday. And because it exceeds that \nallocation, I am constrained to make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the good fortune, when I was home this \npast break, to meet all the sheriffs of Nevada. They have a lot of \nproblems with the unfunded mandate because of the homeland security----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, haven't I made a point of order? Doesn't \nthat require a ruling of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been made against the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I did not hear the point of order as it was \nbeing made, but I understand it has been made.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive the applicable sections of that act for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. But I also ask \nunanimous consent, Mr. President, that there may be a few minutes for \ndebate of the point of order and/or the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to there being some \nopportunity for debate for those who may want to debate it. I hope we \ncan move to a vote on the motion to waive, and it should not be \ndelayed. I understand the Democrats have a luncheon they are looking to \nattend some time around quarter of 1. I hope we can vote before then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. There \nwill be time for debate on the motion to waive.\n  Is there a sufficient second on the yeas and nays?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief. I met with the chief law \nenforcement officers of the counties of Nevada. Without any hesitation, \nthey said they are having tremendous difficulties meeting their \nresponsibilities because of the unfunded mandates that have been \nrequired as a result of this homeland security problem that faces all \nAmerica.\n  As an example, I say to the two managers of the bill, one big problem \nwe have is inoperability. They cannot communicate with each other \nthrough their radio, not only police, but they cannot speak to the fire \nofficials. That is something that needs to be done. That is not covered \nin this bill.\n  With the additional funding that is requested by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, we could start that program, something that is so \nimportant and needs to be done, and the sheriffs and law enforcement \nofficers of Nevada need that very badly. Inoperability of \ncommunications is important. With regard to the gates and the \nscreening, one reason we have these tremendously long lines all over \nAmerica is we do not have enough people to do the work.\n  We need to hire some more people. I appreciate what the Senator from \nMississippi said, that we are doing more training. We need to \naccelerate this significantly.\n  I say to my friends, the managers of this bill, we, of course, are \nfaced with the problem--the Senator from Mississippi says, well, the \ncommittee is funding what the administration requests. That is the \nwhole problem. They are not requesting enough. The fact that they are \nmeeting what the administration has suggested is not appropriate. There \nis a lot more that needs to be done and I again refer to ``Losing \nAmerica: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency,'' which shows \nin script, beginning on page 98, but specifically this morning I \nreferred to pages 112 through 115, where we have tried time and again \nto see if we could get funding for problems that are so important to \nthis country, programs that deal with seaports, airports, border \nsecurity, nuclear facilities, first responders, and we have been turned \ndown every time.\n  Last year, when we approved funding for Iraq early in the year of $69 \nbillion, later in the year of $87 billion in supplemental funding, \ncould we not spend $2 billion rather than in Iraq and use it at home \nand take care of the law enforcement officers in Nevada, take care of \nall the other requests we have to make our homeland more secure?\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to Byrd \namendment No. 3597 and extend my appreciation to the Senator for \noffering this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No specific debate time was allocated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for the \nwork he has done. Nothing I have said is in any way any criticism of \nhis work. I commend him for producing a balanced bill. Given the \nconstraints under which we are being forced to operate, he has done his \nbest. I have no criticism of him whatsoever, but I would argue that $2 \nbillion is not that large for the very short list of programs in this \namendment that address vulnerabilities that are well known. Indeed, \nmost of these programs have been authorized by the Congress and the \nPresident and this amendment tries to provide the authorized funding.\n  Regarding the Deepwater Program, the Coast Guard authorization bill \nPublic Law 108-293 authorizes $1.1 billion for the Coast Guard's \nDeepwater Acquisition Program. My amendment provides an additional $324 \nmillion to meet the authorization level for this critical activity.\n  It was the USA PATRIOT Act, Public Law 107-56, which authorized a \ntripling of the number of border patrol agents and legacy immigration \nand Customs agents on the northern border. That law was passed nearly 3 \nyears ago and this administration has failed to provide the funds to \nmeet the authorization. My amendment adds $50 million so we can get \nnearly one-third of the way toward meeting the requirements of the law.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act, Public Law 107-295, created \nthe Port Security Grant Program. It called upon the Coast Guard to \nprovide estimates of the costs for that program. The Coast Guard has \nestimated that $1.125 billion will be needed in the first year and $5.4 \nbillion will be needed over the next 10 years for the ports to comply \nwith the Federal regulations mandated by the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act which was signed into law by President Bush with great \nfanfare in November 2002.\n  Despite the President's paucity of funding requests to implement the \nlaw, the Congress has stepped up to the plate and has appropriated a \ntotal of $493 million towards these grants.\n\n  The Senate version of the budget resolution assumed that $275 million \nwill be appropriated for port security grants in fiscal year 2005. The \nbill before us today provides $150 million. By adopting this amendment, \nthe Congress still will have provided over 4 years only $768 million of \nthe Coast Guard's first-year cost estimate of $1.125 billion for port \nsecurity grants, but the additional $125 million in this amendment will \nmeet the assumption for port security grants made in the Senate budget \nresolution.\n  On May 6, 2004, the Senate Banking Committee, on a bipartisan basis, \nreported S. 2453 which authorizes $5.2 billion over the period of \nfiscal year 2005-2007 for transit security activities under its \njurisdiction. On May 21, 2004, the Senate Commerce Committee, also on a \nbipartisan basis, reported S. 2273 which authorizes more than $1 \nbillion for rail security activities under its jurisdiction over the \nperiod of fiscal year 2005-2009. My amendment provides $350 million in \nsecurity grants to rail and transit systems. Combined with the funds \nprovided in the committee-reported bill, we still fall more than \nhalfway short in meeting the requirements of these bills. The \nauthorization bills and the laws written and passed by this Congress by \noverwhelming margins and signed into law by the President clearly \ndemonstrate a far greater funding\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\nneed than that contained in my amendment. My amendment, which would \nimplement several 9/11 Commission recommendations, is but a small step \nin meeting the homeland security requirements authorized already by the \nCongress.\n  The President has said he would do whatever it takes. However, his \nbudget takes a hike when it comes to actually funding homeland \nsecurity.\n  I note that, and I agree with Chairman Cochran, we must operate \nwithin limits on spending, but the limits must be set at a level that \nallows the Congress to fund homeland security programs that address \nclear dangers. We are debating an amendment that provides $2 billion \nfor securing our homeland. In the last 3 years, the President has \nsigned three tax cuts. These tax cuts increased our Federal deficit for \nfiscal year 2005 by $232 billion. Where were the limits? Where were the \nlimits on the tax cuts? Where are those voices who say we are overdoing \nit in this amendment? Where were they when it came to the tax cuts? Did \nwe overdo the tax cuts?\n  The President increased our deficits for fiscal year 2005 by $232 \nbillion in tax cuts, but we cannot afford $2 billion today for securing \nour rail systems, for securing our chemical plants, or making sure a \nterrorist does not blow another plane out of the sky.\n  In summary, in the nearly 3 years since the tragic events of 9/11, I \nhave pressed the Senate to provide additional resources for homeland \nsecurity and the President consistently opposed those efforts. He went \nso far as to threaten to veto bills if they included what the \nadministration characterized as wasteful spending. Let me give a few \nexamples of funding contained in those amendments that certainly would \nhave helped make America safer.\n  In November of 2001, Senate Democrats supported my amendment to \ninclude $15 billion for homeland security in an economic stimulus \npackage, including $4 billion for bioterrorism and food safety, $4.6 \nbillion for State and local law enforcement and fire training and \nequipment and Federal computer improvements, $3.3 billion for \ntransportation security, including airport and port security, $1.1 \nbillion for border security, $2.0 billion for security at nuclear \npower, water, and other critical infrastructure facilities, and for \nmail screening. The White House opposed the effort, warning of \n``permanent spending on other projects that have nothing to do with \nstimulus and that will only expand the size of Government.''\n  On November 28, 2001, Office of Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge \nwrote to me and said, ``. . . no additional resources to protect the \nhomeland beyond what the President has already requested are needed at \nthis time.''\n  Senate Republicans, under pressure from the White House, objected to \nthe ``emergency designation'' for the homeland security funding and \nvoted to block the funding.\n  On December 4, 2001, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported, by \na vote of 29-0, the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill. This \nbill included $13.1 billion for homeland security programs, $8.7 \nbillion above the President's request. In a meeting with congressional \nleaders, President Bush threatened to veto the Defense appropriations \nbill that contained the additional homeland security funding.\n  On December 6, 2001, Senate Republicans, voted against the \n``emergency designation'' for the homeland security funding. As a \nresult, homeland security funding was reduced by $4.6 billion, from \n$13.1 billion to $8.5 billion.\n  Under further pressure from the White House, conferees further \nreduced homeland defense funding from $8.5 billion to $8.3 billion, a \nlevel that was still $3.9 billion above the President's request. In \nreducing the funding from $13.1 billion to $8.3 billion, funding was \nreduced for bioterrorism and food safety, border security, airport \nsecurity, port security, nuclear facility security, and postal \nsecurity.\n  In June of 2002, by a bipartisan vote of 71-22, the Senate passed a \nsupplemental appropriations bill that included $8.3 billion for \nhomeland security. The funding was allocated based on a series of five \nbipartisan hearings held by the Senate Appropriations Committee when \nthe committee heard testimony from Governors, mayors, police, fire \nfighters, emergency medical and other first responders, port security \nspecialists and other experts in the field of counterterrorism, seven \ncabinet officers and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.\n  On June 17, 2002, the President's senior advisors recommended a veto \nof the Senate version of the supplemental bill because it included what \nthey asserted was excessive homeland security spending.\n  Under pressure from the White House, the conferees agreed to reduce \nhomeland defense funding from $8.3 billion to $6.7 billion. Funding was \nreduced for food safety, for cyber security, for solving the first \nresponder radio interoperability problem, for nuclear security, for \nincreased lab capacity to determine whether biological or chemical \nweapons have been used in a potential attack, for airport security, \nport security, and water security.\n  Then, in August of 2002, the President refused to spend $2.5 billion \nthat Congress had approved for homeland security. The President chose \nnot to make the emergency designation, asserting that the contingency \nemergency fund contained wasteful spending.\n  In making that decision, the President blocked funding for homeland \ndefense programs that would have specifically addressed known \nshortcomings including: firefighting grants; security improvements at \nour nuclear plants and labs; grants to make police and fire \ncommunications equipment interoperable in response to weaknesses \nidentified on September 11; port security grants; airport security \nfunding, including funds for more Federal air marshals; Coast Guard \nfunding; law enforcement resources for State and local governments for \npolice equipment and training; FBI funding for counter terrorism and \ninformation technology enhancements; urban search and rescue teams; \ncyber security improvements to protect our economy; food and water \nsecurity, including funds for addressing the threat of mad cow disease; \nborder security; dam and reservoir security; and Customs Service funds \nto increase the number and quality of the inspections of the six \nmillion cargo containers that come into this country each year.\n  President Bush announced at his economic forum in Texas that he was \nrejecting the $2.5 billion bipartisan homeland security funding \npackage. President Bush said, ``I made my opposition clear. We were \npretty plain-spoken. . . I understand Congress's position, and today, \nthey're going to learn mine. We'll spend none of it.''\n  In connection with the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations \nlegislation, the White House said, ``the administration strongly \nopposes amendments to add new extraneous spending to the package.'' On \nJanuary 16, 2003, Senate Republicans fell in line behind the President \nand voted 45-51 to defeat an amendment that I offered to add $5 billion \nfor homeland security activities for port security, airport security, \nborder security, nuclear security, and for implementing the President's \nsmallpox vaccine plan.\n  My amendment included $300 million for mass transit security. Perhaps \nif that amendment had been adopted, we would be better prepared today \nto prevent a terrorist attack on our subways, buses and trains.\n  On January 29, 2003, the President, in his State of the Union message \nto the Congress said, ``Whatever action is required, whenever action is \nnecessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American \npeople.''\n  Three months later, on April 2 and 3, 2003, the White House opposed \nall five amendments that I prepared for consideration on the fiscal \nyear 2003 emergency Iraq/Afghanistan war supplemental to increase \nfunding for homeland security programs. In total, the amendments would \nhave provided $9 billion, $4.8 billion more than the President \nrequested. All of the amendments were defeated on virtual party-line \nvotes. Funding was rejected for radiation and portal monitors, for \ngrants to public transit agencies for security of transit facilities \nagainst chemical, biological, and other terrorist threats, for grants \nto improve communications within and among first responders, for funds \nfor the Coast Guard to implement the Automated Identification System \nand other tracking systems to\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\nactively track and monitor vessels operating in United States waters, \nfor port security, and for the FBI.\n  Then, in July of 2003, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill to add $1.75 billion for homeland \nsecurity programs. The amendment was defeated 43-50. The amendment \nincluded funds to implement several authorization laws that the \nPresident had signed shortly after 9/11, but then failed to either \nadequately fund or fund at all, including the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act of 2002, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act of 2002, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, and \nthe USA PATRIOT Act. Once again, funding was rejected for mass-transit \nsecurity, for securing the northern border, for air-cargo security, for \nport security and for first responders.\n  In the September 2003 conference on the fiscal year 2004 Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, I tried again to add $1.25 billion to the \nbill, and the effort was defeated on party-line vote of the conferees \nof 8-9. The amendment would have added $375 million for port security \ngrants, $400 million for aviation security, $66 million for \nimplementation of port security enhancements required by the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act, $34 million for the Coast Guard Deepwater \nProgram, $125 million for 1,300 additional Customs inspectors at the \nborders, $200 million for first responder grants, and $50 million to \nenhance security at chemical facilities.\n  I urge that the Senate waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nmade a couple of points that I think require response. One was that no \nfunds are available in this bill for local law enforcement and other \nfirst responders for interoperable communications and other new \ntechnologies. The Senator is correct, we are not directly funding local \nlaw enforcement officials interoperable communications needs, but they \nare eligible for funds provided to States in this bill by the Office of \nState and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness to help \nimprove technologies, communications equipment, training, and other \nactivities that are important to enhance the capabilities of the first \nresponders, whether they are fire departments, law enforcement \nofficials, or the like.\n  We are providing funds in broad grant programs to States and \nlocalities in order for them to have the ability to make the decisions \nat a local level in determining what their greatest needs may be.\n  In addition, the National Sheriffs Association, for example, has \ndeveloped a nationwide program for other sheriffs' departments--the \nPegasus Program--I know some sheriffs in my State are actively involved \nin helping convince others they ought to take advantage of that \nprogram. I know another program in my State that has gotten Federal \nfunds from the Justice Department and is available on the Mississippi \nGulf Coast now, a new interoperable communications system, computer \nbased, where laptop computer capability will be available in patrol \ncars, other vehicles, and in police stations, in sheriffs' departments \nalong the Mississippi Gulf Coast so they can keep up with what each \njurisdiction is doing. They will know if an arrest has been made of \nsomeone who may have escaped from a jail in one of the adjoining \ncounties.\n  All of these law enforcement officials along the coast will be able \nto have access to that information immediately because of this new \nsystem.\n  So opportunities are available to local jurisdictions to take \nadvantage of new programs that are being developed and made available \nto help achieve the goals that my friend talks about. We all share \nthose goals.\n  One other point on that subject. The committee provides in this bill, \n$30 million ``for direct technical assistance to State and local \ngovernments.'' And, of this amount, $20 million, it says in the report \non page 57, ``is for the Interoperable Communication Technical \nAssistance program to enhance interoperability of public safety \ncommunications.'' So technical assistance is available directly from \nfunds that are in this bill to achieve the goals to which the Senator \nfrom Nevada has alluded.\n  We are encouraging the Department to consider designating a lead \norganization within the Department to provide technical assistance for \ninteroperable communications. I think we are meeting our challenge in \nthis area under the restraints that we have to impose. We can't fund \neverything directly. We don't want to get in the business of choosing \none communications system over another, and I haven't meant to do that \nby pointing out two in my State that I happen to know about. We are \nletting local jurisdictions make those decisions. We do not have to \nmake those decisions as Members of the Senate. We are not competent to \nmake those decisions. So I don't want to start writing into our bill a \nspecific communication system and then funding it and trying to make it \navailable to all of the jurisdictions throughout the United States. We \nwould run out of money quickly if we tried to do that.\n  But I think we are meeting the challenge, and I hope Senators will \nagree and will support the point of order and vote against the motion \nto waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi knows how much \nI care about him and respect him. But $20 million for interoperability \nis so short of what is needed. The 9/11 Commission Report states, among \nother things:\n\n     . . . high risk urban areas such as New York City and \n     Washington, D.C., should establish signal corps units to \n     ensure communications connectivity between and among civil \n     authorities, local first responders, and the National Guard. \n     Federal funding of such units should be given high priority \n     by Congress.\n\n  The city of New York alone is more than $20 million. The State of \nNevada is around $6 or $7 million. So $20 million is a literal drop in \nthe bucket. I repeat, if we can, through supplemental funding, provide \n$69 billion, $87 billion in 1 year in supplemental funding for Iraq, \ncouldn't we spend a few dollars for America to be safer? It appears \nthis administration does not believe we should.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor and to speak \nin support of the amendment offered today by my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. As Members of Congress, our most sacred duty is \nprotecting our fellow Americans. We do this in several ways, of course, \nby supporting our troops at home and abroad, by our oversight of the \nintelligence community, and now, with the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security, with an annual appropriation to fund the security \nactivities of the various agencies that make up DHS, and to fund grant \nprograms to States, localities, and private industry to make certain \nthat citizens of the United States are protected from terrorist \nattacks, life-threatening accidents, and acts of God.\n  In the last 3 years I have sat down with hundreds of first responders \naround my State of West Virginia, as well as local elected officials \nand experts from my State's core industries, to discuss what they were \ndoing to protect West Virginians, and to hear from them directly where \nthey needed help from the Federal Government. I am sure that each of my \ncolleagues has had similar meetings. While I would not presume to know \nspecifically what was said at these meetings, I would be willing to \nwager that no member of Congress heard anything other than ``We have \nhuge unmet security needs and we need Federal resources to make our \ncountry safer.''\n  When we created the Department of Homeland Security, and when we \nauthorized many billions of dollars in additional funding to protect \nthis Nation, I am sure we convinced some people that we had learned the \nharsh lessons of September 11. In fact, I think we have done well \nmaking increased safety and security priority issues for the Federal \nGovernment and for all Americans. Unfortunately, we have fallen short \non addressing these needs, and the Byrd amendment is a very good\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\nstep in the right direction. This amendment would not do everything \nthat needs to be done for Congress to be able to say we are delivering \nthe goods to our first responders, State and local officials, and to \nthe industries that make up our critical infrastructure, but it would \nbe a much-needed boost for all those trying to make America safer.\n  I commend Senator Byrd for making his usual strong, principled stand \non this matter. Let me be clear, too, that I do not believe the funding \nlevels in the underlying bill reflect any lack of understanding of the \nscope of the problem on the part of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. The chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, my \nfriend, Senator Cochran, has done very well with the amount he was \ngiven to distribute. The problem is, quite simply, that the \nadministration's past policy choices--and the need to adequately \nsupport our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan--have left Senator Cochran \nand his fellow appropriators with too little to do this all-important \njob.\n  It is not a question, let me reiterate, of our Republican colleagues \nor the President not wanting to see our Nation adequately protected. I \ndo question, I am sad to say, the idea that it is vitally important to \nmake unaffordable tax cuts permanent, but it is not more immediately \nimportant to secure our chemical facilities, our railroads, our \nelectricity grid, or provide training and technical assistance to our \nfirefighters and emergency medical personnel.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see just how important this is. It \nwould be a tragedy beyond measure if we failed to do the right thing \nwhen we had the chance, and only provided funding, for instance, to fix \nthe problem of interoperable radios after another tragedy where first \nresponders were at risk because they could not talk to each other.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Byrd amendment because I \nthink that it includes important investments in our homeland security. \nFor example, the amendment includes over $500 million for \ninteroperability for our first responders. It includes $125 million for \nport security grants so that we can increase our surveillance of the \nthousands of containers that enter our country. And it includes $111 \nmillion for border security. Overall, the amendment provides $2 billion \nin 11 key areas that desperately need increased funding.\n  In its current form, this amendment does not include any offsetting \nreductions to pay for the new investments. If this amendment is adopted \ntoday--and I hope that it will be--I intend to work with the conferees \nto offset these increases by reducing funds that have been earmarked \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. I believe this expenditure should be offset \nwith these other spending cuts.\n  Iraq is a nation that sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the \nworld. My view is that Iraq should pay for its own reconstruction.\n  Last year, this Congress acted in an expedited way to appropriate \n$18.4 billion for Iraqi reconstruction. And yet, 10 months later, most \nof that money is still unspent. Less than $1 billion has been actually \nexpended and only about $7 billion has been obligated.\n  Therefore, I support Senator Byrd's amendment and I will vote for it \ntoday. But my intention is to push for the rescission of those \nunobligated Iraqi reconstruction funds and use them to offset the \nneeded security investments that have been identified by Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to waive with respect to the Byrd amendment occur at 2 p.m. \nthis afternoon; provided further that the amendment be temporarily set \naside in order for Senator Dodd to offer the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is \ncontemplated--we think it will work out--is we will have two votes at 2 \no'clock. The majority has not had an opportunity to look at the \namendment of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Dodd and Ms. Stabenow. But as soon as they do, I think we \nwill be able to vote at 2 o'clock. In the meantime, until that happens, \nwe agree to the unanimous consent of the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3604\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3604.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount provided for first responder programs, \n                        and to provide offsets)\n\n       On page 19, line 17, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,552,000,000.\n\n       On page 21, strike lines 14 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                     Firefighter Assistance Grants\n\n       For necessary expenses for programs authorized by sections \n     33 and 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of \n     1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229 and 2229a), to remain available until \n     September 30, 2006, $4,000,000,000, of which $3,000,000,000 \n     shall be available for necessary expenses for programs \n     authorized by section 33 of such Act and $1,000,000,000 shall \n     be available for necessary expenses for programs authorized \n     by section 34 of such Act: Provided, That not to exceed 5 \n     percent of the amount provided for the programs under each \n     such section shall be available for program administration.\n       On page 22, line 3, strike ``$180,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$660,000,000''.\n\n       On page 28, line 21, strike ``$181,440,000'' and insert \n     ``$690,994,000''.\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my good friend from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow, we are once again offering an amendment \nwhich deals with the underlying issue of this debate, and that is the \nadequacy of our resources to the homeland security effort.\n  In recent days we have heard the Vice President of the United States \nsuggesting that we ought not enter the mindset of a pre-9/11. I \ncouldn't agree more. It is a dangerous thing for this country to forget \nwhat our Nation went through 3 years ago come Monday. Certainly, what \nwe are suggesting with this amendment we are offering--Senator \nStabenow, myself, and Senator Kennedy--is to put some real resources, a \nreal effort behind the homeland security effort.\n  We have put this amendment together not based on our conclusions \nindividually of what ought to be a part of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act. Rather, we draw upon the tremendous work done by a \nformer colleague of ours, Senator Warren Rudman, and his report that \nwas produced by experts in conjunction with the Council on Foreign \nRelations. A significant amount of time was spent to assess the \nadequacy of our first responders and whether we have in place across \nthis country 3 years after the brutal attacks of 9/11 the resources, \nthe personnel, the equipment, and the training necessary to provide the \nprotections this country needs if, Lord forbid, we are attacked again \nby terrorists.\n  That report concludes that we are woefully inadequate to meet those \nchallenges with which we are confronted. It lays out in detail \nsuggestions as to what needs to be done in\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\norder to make us better prepared to respond to those situations. So we \nare offering this amendment in the same spirit in which our colleague \nfrom West Virginia offered his amendment. It is out of a deep concern \nwe are not doing enough to protect our Nation from the risk of a \nterrorist attack.\n\n  Last June, former Senator Warren Rudman, with a very distinguished \npanel of experts, produced a report sponsored by the Council on Foreign \nRelations. Their report concluded that we must spend at least $98 \nbillion over the next 5 years in order to provide a reasonable degree \nof security here at home.\n  The Council on Foreign Relations report was not just another study \nthrown together over a few days; it was authored by a friend and former \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman. He assembled a very \ndistinguished group of Americans to serve on a task force which wrote \nthe July 2003 report. The task force members included Richard Clarke, a \nformer counterterrorism adviser for three Presidents. It also included \nAdmiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nunder President Reagan; George Shultz, President Reagan's Secretary of \nState; Harold Varmus, former Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth under President Clinton; William Webster, who served both as the \nDirector of the CIA and the FBI in the 1980s and 1990s, among many \nothers.\n  Regrettably, 1 year later, the urgent recommendations of this very \ndistinguished panel--a very comprehensive study--have been almost \ntotally ignored by the leadership of the Congress and the executive \nbranch. According to the Rudman report:\n\n       Estimated combined federal, state and local expenditures . \n     . . would need to be as much as tripled over the next five \n     years to address the unmanned need. Covering this funding \n     shortfall using federal funds alone would require a five-fold \n     increase from the current levels.\n\n  So, depending upon the level of State and local funding available, \nthe Federal Government should be committing between $15 and $25 billion \nper year according to the Council on Foreign Relations. If $15 billion \nto $25 billion a year is what it takes to get the job done, that is \nwhat we ought to be providing. Unfortunately, the bill before the \nSenate only commits about $3.4 billion a year, which is a fifth of what \nis really needed to support our first responders.\n  The amendment Senator Stabenow and I are offering would commit a full \n$20 billion necessary in fiscal year 2005 and would set us on the path \ntoward meeting the Council on Foreign Relations' recommendations for \nfirst responder investments over the next 5 years. I realize $20 \nbillion a year is a lot of money. I would like to put that number into \ncontext, if I may.\n  First, I don't believe that any of my colleagues who served with \nWarren Rudman or know Warren Rudman would call him free spending. In \nfact, when one hears the words ``deficit hawk,'' you often think \nimmediately of Warren Rudman. He led the Concord Coalition in the mid \n1990s with another friend and former colleague, the late Paul Tsongas \nof Massachusetts. He fought tirelessly for deficit reduction and \nbalanced budgets while serving in the Senate. He also lent his name to \nthe landmark 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act, of which I was honored to be a cosponsor at the \ntime. So when Warren Rudman says we need to be spending $20 billion a \nyear for our Nation's first responders, I think we need to take his \nadvise very seriously.\n  When George Shultz, when Mr. Webster, when Admiral Crowe and others \nmake these recommendations, we are not talking about people who do not \nknow what they are talking about. We are talking about some of the most \nserious public servants of the last two or three decades, people who \nhave taken a serious look at our needs, a serious look at the threats \nfacing us, in a bipartisan way, and have urged this Congress to do a \nbetter job in seeing to it that the American public is protected from \nthe dangers of a terrorist attack by insisting that our first \nresponders receive the necessary tools they ought to have in order to \nrespond.\n  We should also keep in mind that the current Department of Defense \nbudget is about $400 billion per year--that is more than a billion a \nday we are investing on our military security. If we would allocate an \nadditional $20 billion a year for first responders, as the Rudman \nreport recommends, our amendment would provide only 5 percent of the \ntotal defense budget. Isn't 5 percent of that budget worth it in order \nto provide more protection to the American citizens at home?\n\n  By the way, that $400 million does not necessarily include the money \nwe are spending in Afghanistan and Iraq. Iraq alone is $200 billion we \nhave already spent in that particular conflict.\n  We are also spending billions of dollars, as I mentioned, to sustain \nour efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. I believe that $20 billion a year \nis a good investment to ensure our urgent homeland security needs are \ngoing to be met. Again, focusing $20 billion on domestic security would \nrepresent only a fraction of 1 year's military budget. If we committed \nthe entire amount identified in the Warren Rudman report--$98 billion--\nit would only be 90 days' worth of military spending in any given year.\n  If we as a nation can find the resources we need to ensure our \nmilitary security, and I believe we should, then we must make a similar \ncommitment to find the resources we need to ensure that the domestic \ndefenders of our Nation are also equipped to provide domestic security. \nWe do not send our military personnel into battle without the equipment \nthey need to do their jobs, and we should not send our law enforcement \npersonnel, our firefighters, our emergency medical technicians, out \ninto a field without equipping them with what they need. We do not send \nour military into battle without the training to succeed. We should not \nsend our domestic defenders into the field without proper training, \neither. We do not send our military to battle without sufficient human \nresources, and we should not send our firefighters into dangerous \nsituations without the backup they need in order to ensure their \nsafety.\n  In the 3 years since September 11, we have made progress. But we also \nknow categorically that we are not doing enough and we need to do more. \nIf the choice is between tax cuts that we cannot afford and securing \nthe public against the now known threats of terrorism, I believe the \nchoice is simple. We must act responsibly to protect the public we \nserve. To not do so and then be attacked, then to not look back and \nwonder why we did not take the necessary steps, would be an indictment \nagainst this Congress and the people who are unwilling to step up and \nprovide the resources we need at the local and State level.\n  September 11 was one of the darkest days in our history. We all know \nthat. We have heard about it. We all feel it very painfully. The \nsimultaneous attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as well \nas the battle in the airspace over Pennsylvania was the deadliest \nforeign attack ever launched against the citizenry of this great \ncountry of ours.\n  September 11 drew our attention to a fact that experts had known for \nyears--namely, that the United States is vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks. Certainly we had experienced acts of terrorism before. Indeed, \nthe World Trade Center itself had been attacked by terrorists in 1993. \nWe had experienced the horrific attacks in Oklahoma City. We knew \nterrorism was possible anywhere, even in our schools. But it took the \nattacks of September 11 to focus our attention on the magnitude of the \ndangers we face and the people we are up against and what they are \nwilling to do in order to do great damage to our country.\n  Since September 11, the Federal Government has taken steps to improve \nour Nation's security. I applaud that. The fact we are even debating \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill is a reflection of the \nFederal Government's efforts to meet the challenges posed by the \nthreats of terrorism. Yet there is still more that we must do. We can \nheed the recommendations of the Rudman report, which tells us we have \nnot done nearly enough to protect the public we serve. That would be a \nmajor step in the right direction. It tells us that despite the risks \nthis Nation faces, despite the real and present dangers, even the real \nlikelihood of future terrorist attacks, that we are failing to take the \nsteps necessary to protect the American people.\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\n  The Rudman report also tells us that the Federal Government has not \nmade a sufficient commitment to help ensure that our first responders--\nour firefighters, our police, and our emergency medical personnel--have \nthe training, the equipment, and staffing levels they need to \neffectively respond to what seemed unthinkable but that we now know can \nhappen anywhere at any time.\n  After talking to State and local emergency management professionals--\nfire chiefs, police chiefs, the authors of the Rudman report--I have \nconcluded we need to do much more than we have been doing. Local \nauthorities asking for Federal assistance are told: We are sorry, but \nthis is the best the Federal Government can do right now. Is this \nreally the best we can do? I don't think so. I think we can do better.\n  In addition, Vice President Cheney has been attacking the Democratic \ncandidate on homeland security and warning about the risks of returning \nto a pre-September 11 mindset. I am almost quoting him. But who is \nreally in a pre-September 11 mindset? This homeland security has not \neven begun to reflect the post-September risks that have been clearly, \npainstakingly detailed by our former colleague, Warren Rudman, and the \ndistinguished panel that compiled this report.\n  Three years ago, President Bush asked for and Congress agreed to \nlarge tax cuts. The rationale at the time was we had a huge surplus and \ncould afford a tax cut. However, this year things have changed and \nrecord surpluses have become record deficits, staggering deficits, the \nlargest in our Nation's history on an annual basis, and a national debt \nthat is mounting. By the end of this fiscal year, the total Federal \ndeficit will be nearly $422 billion. That will be the largest deficit \nin our Nation's history.\n\n  This deficit is being racked up at a time when we have to address \nclear and immediate threats that are before us. However, instead of \nmarshaling our resources in a comprehensive, responsible way, the \nadministration did something that, in my view, will be recorded in \nhistory as irresponsible. It committed even more resources for the \npurpose of giving more tax benefits to the most affluent of our \ncitizens.\n  That was the choice they made--a clear choice to give tax benefits to \nthe privileged few rather than taking the steps to make the commitment \nto protect all of us. Our enormous budget deficit has been coupled with \na huge security deficit. There is now an enormous gap between what we \nare committing to homeland security and what we should be providing to \nState and local first responders.\n  We have an opportunity with this amendment to set our priorities \nstraight. We can, and we should, reestablish that the priority of this \nNation is to protect all Americans and not to lavish scarce public \nresources on the privileged few.\n  The amendment Senator Stabenow and I are offering would adhere to the \nrecommendations of the task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign \nRelations and establish a more responsible and realistic baseline for \nsupporting our first responders--our firefighters, our police, and our \nemergency medical personnel.\n  To those who say we cannot afford to commit the resources to protect \nour people, I ask: Can we really afford not to do so? It seems to me if \nwe can afford trillions of dollars in tax cuts that benefit the most \naffluent, then we ought to be able to afford $20 billion this year, \nnext year, and the 3 years following to ensure, or to do a better job \nof ensuring, our security.\n  According to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased last month, the tax cuts approved in the last 3 years \nexacerbate income inequality by boosting the after-tax income of high-\nincome households far more than that of middle- or low-income \nhouseholds. Based on the Congressional Budget Office data, the top 1 \npercent of households whose annual incomes average $1.2 million a year \nwill receive an average tax cut of approximately $40,000 in the year \n2004. This tax break is more than 40 times--40 times!--the average tax \nbreak for those in the middle fifth of income distribution.\n  With the amendment we are offering today, millionaires are going to \nbe asked to take a smaller tax cut than they are already receiving \nunder the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. With our amendment, these individuals \nwould still be able to benefit from significant tax cuts. But by simply \nreducing the 2003 tax breaks for those earning in excess of $1 million \na year--one-tenth of 1 percent of all taxpayers; which is what our \namendment does--we would be able to live up to our commitment, our \nobligation, to our Nation's first responders and to the people of this \ncountry by providing them with the resources to see to it they can \nrespond if, God forbid, we are confronted with another terrorist \nattack.\n  So we have an offset. I suspect it will be challenged as a violation \nof the Budget Act. But here we are paying for an amendment by reducing \nthe tax cut for the most affluent, to see to it that the general public \ncan have the kind of protections they need, in order to see to it that \nwe are protected against terrorist attacks that may come at a future \ndate.\n  With that, Madam President, I will yield to my colleague from \nMichigan, who is a cosponsor of this amendment. And she was there the \nlast time we offered this amendment. She is a great advocate of these \nefforts to improve our homeland security picture. I am honored to join \nwith her in this effort once again this year.\n  I yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I, first, thank my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut for his eloquence and leadership on this \nissue. He proposed this amendment last year, and I was very proud to \njoin him in this effort. If we had done this amendment last year, we \nwould be having a very different discussion, I believe, right now. So I \nthank the very distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his \nleadership.\n  I think it is important we recognize the fact that we have been told \nby the Department of Homeland Security that this is National \nPreparedness Month, which has just been announced. We are told there \nare hundreds of activities planned. The Department is encouraging us to \nencourage families we represent to be prepared individually.\n  In the spirit of National Preparedness Month, I think we have a \nresponsibility to do exactly the same. That is why I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to support the Dodd-Stabenow amendment that will provide \nAmerica's first responders with the equipment and the training they \nneed to protect the people of our country.\n  As the President often says, we are at war. The threat level has been \nraised to High or Orange six times since it was created. Americans are \nrepeatedly warned the terrorists will strike again, that we should be \nvigilant and prepared. The experts and our leaders are certain that we \nremain under the threat of terrorist attack, and certain that we must \nbe ready to prevent, hopefully, and, if not prevent, be able to respond \nto an attack.\n  However, what remains uncertain is our ability to prepare for and \ndefend against potential terrorist threats. That is where our \nGovernment up until now has failed. We have the opportunity to correct \nthat on this bill.\n  The experts I speak of, and Senator Dodd spoke of, are a blue-ribbon \npanel of Nobel laureates, U.S. military leaders, former high-level \nGovernment officials, and other senior experts, brought together by the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, led by former Senator Warren B. Rudman, \nand advised by former White House terrorism and cybersecurity chief, \nRichard A. Clarke.\n  During the spring of last year, this Independent Task Force on \nEmergency Responders conducted meetings across the Nation with first \nresponders and national organizations seeking the answer to one simple \nquestion: What do you need to keep us safe? What do you need as first \nresponders to keep us safe? The answer Senator Rudman received was \ndaunting. Unbudgeted needs totaled about $98.4 billion, and these funds \nwould only establish a minimum effective response, according to the \nreport.\n  I would like to detail some of the deficiencies in our preparedness \nthat the Rudman report outlined.\n  On average, our fire departments have only half the number of radios \nneeded on a shift and only enough breathing apparatus for one-third of\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\ntheir firefighters. Now, imagine that. I know in Michigan people assume \nfirefighters and police officers, emergency responders, have \ncommunications equipment, that they can talk to each other. I have met \nwith police departments where they have said they cannot talk to the \nfire department, and they are in the same town or in the next town. \nThis report said, on average, fire departments have only half the \nnumber of radios needed on a shift.\n  They also found police departments across America do not have the \nprotective gear to respond to weapons of mass destruction attacks. They \ndo not have basic protective gear.\n  Why have we ignored this panel's recommendations?\n  When the 9/11 Commission recently offered its recommendations--and I \ncommend them for their thoughtfulness--Senators of both parties \nimmediately took action. In fact, there is now a bipartisan bill that \nincorporates all 41 of the Commission's recommendations, and the \nmajority leader has pledged to take up this legislation in the next \nmonth. I support that. In other words, approximately 2 months after we \nreceived the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission we are acting.\n  Unfortunately, the Rudman report is a year and a half old, and I \nwould argue, even though there have been some changes in funding, we \nhave basically done nothing to fundamentally respond to the seriousness \nof this report. In fact, what we have seen, in some cases, in order to \nfund homeland security and first responders, other programs have been \ncut. The COPS Program or other programs have been cut to move dollars \nover. And the local police department--it does not matter which pot it \ncomes from--what they are looking at is the bottom line: Can they \nafford to add another police officer? Can they afford protective \nequipment? And way too many of the law enforcement leaders in Michigan \nare saying, no, they cannot.\n  During a series of 11 meetings I held across Michigan, I met face to \nface with many people I consider to be experts--first responders, \ncommunity leaders in Michigan. They have told me in no uncertain terms \nthat they are woefully underfunded and underequipped. Month after month \nthey continue to remind me of the fact that they still don't have the \ndollars they need, even though some dollars have trickled down from \nWashington.\n  The situation in Michigan is of particular importance to me, of \ncourse, but this is not only about Michigan. This is a problem and a \nchallenge for all of us. This is not a partisan issue. This is about \nhow to keep Americans safe all over the country. We have ignored this \nreport for too long.\n  I thank the Senators from Mississippi and West Virginia, the \ndistinguished members who have worked hard on this bill. I know they \nfind themselves in a difficult position confronting new threats and \ncorrecting countless vulnerabilities that were exposed on September 11. \nThe legislation before us is a step forward. Unfortunately, I believe \nit is a very small step. We can do better, and we must do better.\n  The Dodd-Stabenow amendment will provide $690 million for the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center; $11.5 billion for the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness State and Local Programs; $3 billion for \nfirefighter assistance grants; $660 million for the emergency \nmanagement performance grants; $3.3 billion for the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response directorate; and $1 billion for the staffing \nfor adequate firefighter and emergency response grants. In total, the \namendment would provide an additional $15 billion in assistance for our \nNation's front-line first responders.\n  Perhaps we should elevate the capabilities of our first responders \nabove the reconstruction of Iraq. Over the past 2 years, Congress has \nprovided $24 billion in American dollars for the reconstruction of \nIraq. In late June, the Government Accountability Office told us that \nonly $3 billion had been spent, leaving $21 billion in a fund for \nreconstruction, substantially more than what we are talking about here. \nI assure my colleagues that if we had had these funds and they had been \ngiven to our first responders, they would have done more and done more \nquickly, and that would have provided greater safety and the capability \nto deal with terrorist attacks. Those dollars would have been used here \nto keep us safe.\n  I am not suggesting we don't need to be supportive in Iraq, but this \ntruly is a question of urgency and priorities for the American people. \nI have supported the request by the Department of Defense in support of \nour Troops. I cannot imagine why we are not giving that same sense of \nurgency to the total request to keep us safe here at home.\n  Again, the legislation we are now considering is a good step, but \nmuch more needs to be done. Senator Rudman's efforts have made it clear \nthat the safety of the American people requires we do more. We can't be \ndoing this around the edges. We have to do what is necessary, as we \nneed to do what is necessary for defending ourselves abroad in terms of \ndollars needed for equipment and troops and so on. The very same thing \nshould apply here. We should do what is necessary to keep us safe, \nperiod.\n  This Saturday is the third anniversary of 9/11. We know thousands of \nAmericans lost their lives on that day. We owe it to their families and \nto all Americans to do everything in our power to defend our country, \nour families from another terrorist attack.\n\n  The Dodd-Stabenow amendment will begin to provide our police \nofficers, firefighters, and emergency medical workers with the \nequipment and training they need to do one of the hardest jobs in this \ncountry--protect their communities and their citizens' lives.\n  When it comes to providing funding for our military men and women in \nIraq and Afghanistan, we have provided money for what they need. I \nsupport that and will continue to. The President has requested numerous \nsupplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan. We have promptly \napproved those funds. In most cases, Congress provided money in excess \nof what was actually needed at the time. Unfortunately, we have not \ndone the same when it comes to homeland security. We would never want \nour troops to fight without the best guns and tanks, but we are willing \nto let our police and firefighters use outdated and inferior \ncommunications and bomb detection equipment. It makes no sense.\n  God forbid we have another terrorist attack in our country. Despite \nnumerous Code Orange alerts, we have avoided another tragedy. I commend \nall of those involved in that effort. However, we do know there are \nlikely terrorists already in this country and many trying to gain \nentry. We know they want to kill innocent citizens. Therefore, we must \nstrengthen our resolve and do whatever it takes to keep us safe. When \nit comes to protecting our children, we should not be penny wise and \npound foolish.\n  We have seen the pictures of the recent horrific terrorist attacks in \nRussia. Our hearts and prayers go out to all who are grieving. Who \nwould have thought terrorists would go to such extremes that they would \nkill innocent children in a school? It demonstrates we can be attacked \nanywhere at any time.\n  Again, God forbid such a tragedy would happen in our own country, but \nif it did, could we look those grieving parents in the eye and tell \nthem we did everything we could to protect their children? Could we \ntell them we did everything we could at the border to keep the \nterrorists out? Could we tell them we had the best bomb detection \nequipment possible? Could we tell them we had the best trained and \nequipped first responders who could act quickly and communicate with \neach other to prevent loss of life?\n  I remind my colleagues, when people call 9-1-1, they don't get \nsomebody in the Homeland Security Department in Washington, DC. They \nget their local police or fire department. Local police and \nfirefighters are ready and waiting respond to a terrorist attack and \nsave lives, if it happens.\n  I honestly believe if we don't pass this amendment, based on this \nreport, we are not doing everything we can do to keep Americans safe. \nThat is, frankly, a risk I am not willing to take.\n  I urge my colleagues, before they vote on the amendment, to ask \nthemselves: Are we doing enough at home to keep us safe? Are we doing \neverything we need to do as quickly as we can? Currently the answer is \nno, with any objective analysis. With the adoption of this amendment, \nthe answer can be yes.\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to come together with a sense of urgency, as \nthey would if their own families were immediately threatened, because I \nbelieve they are.\n  I urge adoption of the Dodd-Stabenow amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the comments \nbeing made by the proponents of the amendment. But the fact is, it \nincreases funding in this bill by over $15 billion, and there is no \noffset for it.\n  There is a provision in the amendment suggesting that taxes be \nincreased to pay for the amendment. I don't think it is consistent with \nthe Budget Act in terms of offsetting spending. We are confronted with \nan allocation of a limited amount of money to appropriate for all of \nthe programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. We are at the \nlevel of our allocation. So if we approve an amendment that exceeds \nthat allocation, we have to reduce other accounts in this bill to pay \nfor that amendment.\n  This amendment is subject to a budget point of order. It is the \nintention of the manager of the bill to make that point of order and to \nsuggest that the Chair sustain that point of order.\n  Having said that, let me make a couple of other points about the \ncomments that have been made about the fact that we are not doing \nenough. That is easy to say. We all know there is a lot to be done. The \nbudget process of the Congress is restricted under its terms because we \ndo have constraints on how much we can spend. If we overdo it, for \nwhatever the reason, and go beyond the limitations we have imposed on \nourselves to help ensure guaranteed opportunities for economic growth, \nexpansion of the economy and the private sector, and all of the rest, \nwe are not doing our job with respect to the integrity of the budget \nprocess. Any good-sounding program will be met with enthusiastic \napplause if you say: Let's increase that. It would be good for the \ncountry. Well, of course. But we have to have limits. Those limits have \nbeen imposed by ourselves, on ourselves, and now some Senators come to \nthe Senate floor and say that is not enough for this program because it \nis so important.\n  These are important programs. The firefighter assistant grant program \nis very important. That is why we put $700 million in this bill for \nthat program. The domestic preparedness grants program is a very \nimportant program. It contributes to making our country safer and more \nsecure. That is why we put $2.8 billion in this bill for those grants. \nThey will go to State and local governments. State and local \ngovernments will decide how they use those funds, consistent with plans \nthat have been developed at the State and local level under the \nguidelines of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Emergency management performance grants are involved here. These are \nfirst responders who work as emergency responders for medical care \ncenters, hospitals, and the rest. We have included $180 million for \nthose grant programs.\n  This amendment goes beyond some of the grant programs. It even \nincreases funding for the base program of the Federal Law Enforcement \nCenter by $500 million--just $500 million more than has already been \nappropriated for the base program for this center to use.\n  Well, my point is, because the amendment asks for spending $15 \nbillion that we don't have in our allocation, we are constrained to \nmake a point of order. I do think we need to recognize that important \nprogress is being made. I know in my State the State government \nofficials and the local mayors, local board of aldermen, the city \ncouncil persons have done a very important job of identifying their own \nneeds, how they can better improve the facilities, the infrastructure, \nthe training of personnel, equipping of personnel at the local level, \nand then applying for the grants made available through the new Federal \nprograms for homeland security. We are seeing improvements made. I am \nvery happy we are making progress in that area.\n\n  My good friend from Connecticut suggests the Hart-Rudman report of \nthat task force should be considered, and we have considered that. I \nthink one of the first calls I made after I realized I was going to \nserve as chairman of this Appropriations Committee subcommittee was to \nWarren Rudman, my friend from New Hampshire, a former colleague whom I \nrespect a great deal. His advice has been very helpful to me.\n  That Warren Rudman report was written several years ago, as we \nprobably realize. Of course, they wrote a recent paper for the Council \non Foreign Relations that got a lot of attention. I read an article \nthat was published in the Council on Foreign Relations magazine as a \nresult of that task force report. That is all helpful to us. We are \ncarefully considering suggestions from people with ideas of how we can \nmore effectively reorganize our agencies and provide funding for \ndifferent programs that are important, and I think we have made great \nprogress. We are definitely wiser, safer, and more secure as a result \nof the efforts by this administration, local and State government \nleaders, with the support of this Congress, in providing generous new \nappropriations for activities that previously were not funded at the \nlevels they should have been funded in the Federal budget.\n  We are going to continue to make progress--I am optimistic--with the \nfurther support of this Congress and a strong record of accomplishment \nthat will be continued by this administration. We will definitely see \nthe results pay off for safer and more secure American citizens.\n  Madam President, I am advised that we have the time set for a vote at \n2 o'clock for the Byrd amendment, or a motion to waive the Budget Act \nfor the Byrd amendment. It would be my hope that we could set a time \nfor voting on the Dodd amendment--or if the point of order that I make \nis sustained after the motion to waive is made--and that we could set \nthat vote to occur after the vote on the Byrd amendment. That would be \nmy intention.\n  I say that to give all Senators notice of the intention of the \nmanager of the bill to have that vote occur at 2 o'clock. We hope that \nwill be possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I say to the chairman, we will be happy to \ntry to work that out. I don't know if other colleagues want to be \nheard. I will find out. If not, I will certainly not oppose the idea of \nhaving a vote. We will make a motion to waive if the point of order is \nraised. We will work that out.\n  If I can, let me, first of all, say that the chairman of the \nsubcommittee has been a wonderful friend of mine. I have great respect \nfor him. He has a thankless job, in many ways, in trying to deal with \nbudget constraints. I am not sure that history is going to judge us \nwell if, in fact, we are confronted with one of these dreadful attacks \nand the argument is we were prohibited because the Budget Act would not \nallow us to respond. We had an emergency supplemental adopted to deal \nwith the situation in Iraq. Certainly, this Chamber and the other \nresponded to it. The American public responded to it.\n  Certainly, nothing could be more important. The first and most \nsignificant obligation that all of us at a Federal level assume when we \ntake the oath of office is to protect the citizenry of this country. \nNothing is more fundamental to our jobs. We all understand that and \nrespect it. This is not a request we are making for some social \nspending or education or health, and I argue that there is a good case \nto be made for those. We are talking about fulfilling the most basic \nobligation we have; that is, to protect and defend the people of this \ncountry. We have been given more than adequate warnings of what those \nwho would do us great harm intend to do given the opportunity.\n  My colleague from Michigan rightfully points out the tragedy that \noccurred halfway around the globe in Russia only a few days ago. We are \ndealing with similar people. You need only look at your local newspaper \nand reports of how hostages--innocents doing humanitarian work in \nIraq--are being treated by terrorists who apprehend them and threaten \ntheir lives. Let there be no doubt of the intentions of those who would \ndo us great harm.\n  To argue that because there is restraint in the Budget Act that \nprohibits us from coming up with an offset--and again, I know it takes \na little work to get it done, but I argue strenuously that history will \nlook back and say: Why didn't you provide these resources when we knew \nwe needed them. We are not making this up out of whole\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\ncloth. It is not as if the Senator from Michigan and I sat around and \ndecided what ought to be done. We are relying on a very significant \ngroup of people who made some very serious recommendations.\n\n  Once again, I share with my colleagues the members of this panel. \nThese are very distinguished people. This report was done a year ago, \nin July of 2003. It is not ancient history.\n  I mentioned already, of course, the chairman of this task force, \nWarren Rudman, our former colleague, the author of the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings deficit reduction package, a fiscal hawk during his tenure in \nthe Senate, certainly not one who is known as a profligate spender.\n  I already mentioned Admiral Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. Margaret Hamburg, vice president for Biological \nWeapons at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. Before coming to NTI, she was \nAssistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel laureate, and who currently serves as \npresident emeritus and Sackler Foundation Scholar, Rockefeller \nUniversity.\n  Donald Marron, chairman of UBS America, as well as Light-Year \nCapital. Previously, he served as chairman and chief executive officer \nof Paine Webber. Certainly no wild spender when we start talking about \npeople who looked at these issues.\n  I believe I mentioned Norm Ornstein, resident scholar at the American \nEnterprise Institute.\n  George Shultz, former Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, \nSecretary of Labor, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nwho is certainly not a wild spender, and who sat and unanimously \nadopted the recommendations my colleague from Michigan and I are \nsuggesting.\n  Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and \nInternational Affairs at Princeton University. Prior to her appointment \nat Princeton, she was the J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of \nInternational, Foreign and Comparative Law at Harvard Law School.\n  Harold Varmus, president and chief executive officer of Memorial \nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Previously, he served as the Director of \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  John Vessey has served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as \nwell as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.\n  I mentioned Bill Webster as well. He served as Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, as well as the Director of the FBI.\n  Steven Weinberg is director of the Theory Group of the University of \nTexas. He is a Nobel laureate in physics and a recipient of the \nNational Medal of Science.\n  The list goes on. These are highly competent people who sat down \nunder the leadership of Warren Rudman and said this is what we think we \nneed to do. The Senator from Michigan and I know it is a lot of money. \nIt is a lot of money--$20 billion a year over the next 5 years, an \nadditional $15 billion, included with what is in this budget. But if \nsomething happens tomorrow, next week, next month, and we are not \nprepared to respond to it, people will ask: What did you do? You have \nbeen given an opportunity to get ready, to be responsible, to take the \nnecessary steps so we would be prepared to respond. And we were told we \ncould not because of the Budget Act.\n  Imagine if we offered this amendment without offset. We would be \naccused of spending money without coming up with resources to offset \nthe obligation. Is it too much to say to one-tenth of 1 percent of our \npopulation, not to eliminate your tax cut, but reduce it for 1 year in \norder to pay for this? That is the choice.\n  We are all confronted with difficult choices. I do not think this one \nis terribly difficult, and I suspect if you asked that one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the most affluent of our citizenry whether they are willing \nto give up a tax cut for 1 year in order to enhance the homeland \nsecurity of this Republic, I suspect an overwhelming majority of them \nwould say: Do it; do it.\n\n  These are patriots. These are people who understand difficult choices \nneed to be made. We are going to be given the chance in the next few \nminutes to waive the Budget Act to make it possible for us to come up \nwith the resources to do this. This is the choice with which we are \ngoing to be confronted, and I do not think history is going to accept \nthe argument that the Budget Act somehow could not be waived because we \ncould not come up with the resources to do it, because somehow a \nregulation or some provision of law made it difficult for us to do so.\n  I think that answer is pathetic. It is inadequate. It is not going to \nbe accepted by history or the American public. Yet that is the choice I \nthink we ought to be making today.\n  Senator Byrd, our colleague from West Virginia, has offered a modest \nincrease. My colleague from Michigan and I are offering something that \nis larger. We know that. It may be asking a lot, but I think to do \nanything less is to place our Nation at risk.\n  We are once again asking our colleagues to put aside the technical \narguments that could be raised and do what is right for our country. \nLet's waive the Budget Act. There is a resource to offset this cost. We \nneed not add to the deficit of the country to do what needs to be done. \nThe people who made these recommendations are distinguished Americans. \nThey come from all political walks of life, all parties. They are \ninvolved in science, national security, and the domestic security of \nour Republic. They have come to the conclusion that this is what we \nought to do. We ought to listen to them, and we ought to respond to \nthem by adopting this amendment and waiving the point of order when it \nis made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut one more time for his eloquence on this point. I was \nthinking, as my colleague was speaking in terms of the choices we have \nto make and whether someone with great means in this country would be \nwilling to defer a small portion of a tax cut in order to keep us safe, \nthat it does not matter how much your income, you are still vulnerable \nto terrorist attack in this country. And I cannot imagine anybody who \nwould not say: Do what you need to do to keep my family safe. Do what \nyou need to do to keep my children safe on the way to school or at \nschool or after school or at their college or my husband and wife at \nwork or me driving down the street. These are serious choices.\n  I am constantly amazed at the times we use bureaucracy and budget \narguments versus the times we ignore them. I very much understand the \nconstraints of the appropriations process and the difficulty the \nsubcommittee chairman has in operating within the amounts that have \nbeen allocated. I understand that and appreciate the hard work that \ntakes. But I remember also, as a member of the Budget Committee, \nraising questions about why we could be appropriating $87 billion and \nbefore that $150 billion--over $200 billion--to Iraq that has never \nbeen in the budget at all, has never been anywhere in the budget. \nInstead of offsetting that in some way, we added it to the deficit, the \nlargest deficit in the history of the country.\n  We could eliminate everything except the Department of Defense in \nterms of annual spending and equal what this debt is this year. It is \nhuge. But when we were focused on Iraq, somehow it was ``whatever it \ntakes,'' not only for the troops but in addition to whatever folks felt \nwas necessary to rebuild Iraq--to rebuild their roads, their schools, \nand give them a health care system, and all these other items. It did \nnot matter whether there was any money appropriated or if there was any \nway to pay for it.\n  Monday night, we responded quickly--and I supported so responding--to \nFlorida with $2 billion. That was not in the budget. We responded \nbecause of an emergency.\n  We are talking about, in relative terms to the huge allocation in \ndefense and the hundreds of billions of dollars now in Iraq, a \nrelatively small amount. It is less than 3 months' spending in Iraq to \nkeep us safe at home.\n  I cannot imagine anybody from any part of this country, any political \npersuasion would not look at this and say: This should pass \noverwhelmingly with a voice vote. Why are we struggling with the \nquestion of doing everything possible as quickly as possible?\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n  I know there have been improvements made, but we are not doing \neverything that needs to be done as quickly as possible.\n  I also know that when I talk at home to folks who are on the front \nlines and they tell me, You are taking money out of this pocket and \nputting it in this one, it is not new money. Or that they received \nsmall amounts, but they are not large increases that have been coming \nto local communities. When we take an officer whose salary is paid by \nthe COPS Program and we cut it and then we restore the funding through \nhomeland security, it is still only one officer. That is what is \nhappening in too many places.\n  Again, I agree with my friend from Connecticut that there needs to be \na sense of urgency about this matter. I understand budget constraints, \nand I understand the limits that have been placed on this particular \nbudget. But I suggest it is our responsibility to challenge that and \ntogether stand up and say the rules do not fit for this situation. That \nis what we are expected to do. We make the rules.\n  It is pretty hard for us to say we cannot change them when they do \nnot make sense, and particularly when we change them all the time. We \nchange them. Depending on whatever the majority folks want to do, we \nchange them. Why in the world would we not want to make sure we are \ndoing everything possible?\n  I remember a week before we left for the August recess and we were \nsitting in 407, all of us together hearing about the new sense of \nurgency and the very specific threats that were present. We watched at \nboth conventions the armed fortresses around not only the conventions \nbut our hotel. It was amazing. Certainly there were resources those \ncommunities needed to have to deal with that, but we were told in no \nuncertain terms that it is very likely something could happen between \nnow and November 2.\n  Then I go home and speak with the sheriffs, the police chiefs, the \nfirefighters, the emergency preparedness folks, the folks at the \nemergency rooms at the hospital, and they look at me and say, what are \nyou doing? We do not have the resources to do this ourselves.\n  I know there are those who believe local communities should bear the \nbrunt of this funding. I would argue that when New York and Washington, \nDC, were attacked, they were attacking the country. Regardless of where \nwe are attacked in the country, it is our responsibility, the Federal \nGovernment, to be a serious partner with local communities to make sure \nthe resources are there.\n  Again, if we are saying we are conducting military actions abroad \nbecause of the threat and we are being told that there are the threats \nhere and they are real, why would we not provide the same approach in \nsaying we will do whatever is necessary? That does not mean \nindiscriminately throwing dollars at a situation. It means in a \nthoughtful way using the complete report the Senator from Connecticut \nhas spelled out as a basis for why would we not respond. That is all \nthis amendment does. It allows us to respond to a thoughtful report, \njust as we are responding to the 9/11 report. I argue very strongly we \nshould think long and hard, while this budget is in front of us, about \nwhether we can honestly say to the people we represent, as well as our \nown families, that we are doing everything possible, as quickly as \npossible, to keep us safe.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, be also added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am prepared to go into a quorum call at \nthis point to chat with our friend from Mississippi as to how he wants \nto proceed on points of order and waivers. I would also like to at \nleast give the respective leaders an opportunity to inquire as to \nwhether any Members would like to be heard on the amendment before we \nend the time. I assume it will not be much and I would be happy to \nagree on a time certain. I would be happy to make it around the time \nfor the vote on the Byrd amendment to accommodate Members' interests.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I make a point of order against the \nDodd amendment on the grounds that it violates the Budget Act, section \n302(b) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that the relevant points of the \nBudget Act be waived and ask for the yeas and nays on that. Also, Madam \nPresident, I ask that the vote on this follow the completion of the \nvote on the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished manager of the bill, \nwould the manager of the bill object to 2 minutes, evenly divided, \nprior to the vote on the Dodd amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, I would. We have thoroughly debated that.\n  Mr. REID. It doesn't hurt to ask.\n  Madam President, we have 1 minute to go. I ask consent that the vote \nstart now rather than at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Senator Dole has asked me to advise that \nshe is absent from this afternoon's votes due to an emergency visit to \nher home State of North Carolina. As you know, the remnants of \nHurricane Frances devastated a large portion of western North Carolina \nthis week, and Senator Dole felt it was imperative that she make an \nimmediate trip to the State to assess the damages and offer assistance \nin whatever manner possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Record show that had she been \npresent, Senator Dole would have voted against the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nDole) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mrs. Dole) would vote ``no''.\n  Mr. REID.

A minute, and I will not use my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi.\n  Very briefly, I know Members were at the various luncheons during the \ndebate on the amendment we are about to vote on. This is the Warren \nRudman report prepared in July of 2003. It laid out in a very detailed \nway what needs to be done in order to provide the necessary resources \nfor first responders. This was a task force that included Admiral Crowe \nand George Shultz, William Webster, who served as Director of both the \nFBI and CIA, and many others, who said we need to be doing a lot more \nto see to it that our first responders have the necessary resources to \ndo the job, Lord forbid we are attacked by terrorists again.\n  Now we have included an offset that makes this subject to a point of \norder. But I believe we have to come up with some choices. One choice \nis whether one-tenth of 1 percent of the American taxpayers for 1 year \ncould do without a tax cut to pay for the $15 billion to make our \ncountry more secure. That is what this amendment does.\n  I urge my colleagues to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could involve my friend in a brief \ndialog, I have come to the floor on many occasions and talked about the \nneed for our leadership to cut off these votes. If we are going to \nfinish this bill by next Tuesday, we cannot spend an hour on two votes. \nWe cannot get the bill done.\n  I hope there will be some degree of understanding that this is \nunfair. Republicans do it and Democrats do it. I am not picking on one \nside. We should not have to wait on votes. People have the idea that \nwhen a vote is called, they will come when they get around to it and \nthat we will hold the vote for them, and we do, which is wrong. That is \nmy personal opinion.\n  If we are going to try to finish this bill by next Tuesday night as \nthe leaders want, we are going to have to start cutting off these votes \nat a reasonable time; otherwise, there is no possibility while we are \nstanding around here looking at each other while other people are in \ntheir offices completing phone calls or whatever else they do. It is \nunfair to the Senate, and I think it is unfair to the country.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the point of the Senator is well taken. I \nhope the Senate will consider his remarks very carefully. We need to \nmove ahead with dispatch. There is no reason why we should consider \ndelaying the consideration of this bill even further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The total amount appropriated by title III for \n     the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \n     Preparedness under the heading ``state and local programs'' \n     is hereby increased by $300,000,000. Of such total amount, as \n     so increased, $1,500,000,000 shall be available for \n     discretionary grants for use in high-threat, high-density \n     urban areas, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, of which $450,000,000 shall be available for port \n     security grants.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an \namendment that would help make our communities and our Nation's ports \nsafer and more secure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators as cosponsors \nto my amendment: Senators Bill Nelson, Clinton, Schumer, Mikulski, \nKennedy, Boxer, Cantwell, Graham, and Landrieu.\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I appreciate that funding for homeland \nsecurity is significantly higher in this bill than in the President's \nbudget request. It should be noted that under the leadership of \nChairman Cochran and Senator Byrd, we have made progress since the \nRudman report suggested that we are ``dangerously unprepared and \nunderfunded for a catastrophic terrorist attack.''\n  However, I am still very concerned that the priorities established in \nthis bill are not sufficient to meet the challenges we face in \nconfronting the terrorists who want to do us harm or the homeland \nsecurity needs throughout the country. It is our duty to protect our \nNation, and in order to do that we need to make the right investments.\n  These decisions are critical to ensuring that the American people, \nthe communities they live in, our economy, and our country are safe and \nsecure.\n  The debate we are having could not be more critical to the defense of \nour country. The bottom line, though, is we have to do more to confront \nterrorists abroad and defend ourselves at home. Nowhere is this more \ntrue than in the areas of port security and securing our trade lanes. \nThis is not only one Senator's opinion; it is the opinion of experts in \nthe field and those brave men and women who defend our Nation.\n  In a recent interview, the commander of NorthCom said:\n\n       It's just a matter of time before terrorists would attempt \n     a sea-borne . . . a maritime attack on the U.S.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission report stated:\n\n       While commercial aviation remains a possible target, \n     terrorists may turn their attention to other modes. \n     Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in \n     maritime or surface transportation.\n\n  Steven Flynn, perhaps the most preeminent expert in the field, says \nthis about our Nation's efforts to better secure our ports: ``This is \nan extremely soft target for America's enemies to exploit'' and that a \n``two-week shutdown of U.S. ports would collapse the global trade \nsystem. That's what we're talking about.''\n  Despite this clear evidence, time after time the White House and the \nrest of the administration have taken the position of limiting \ninvestments in many of the policies and security initiatives that would \nmake our Nation safer.\n  I do not say this to criticize Chairman Cochran or his staff, and \nSenator Byrd has been a true champion every single step of the way in \nfighting to improve the security of our Nation. Without their efforts, \nwe would be even worse off. But I raise this issue this afternoon to \nreiterate my strong belief that we have a great responsibility to \nbetter secure our country, and it is my own belief we are not doing \nenough to protect the communities we have been sent here to represent.\n  Specifically, we need to do more to identify and address the threats \nto our country before they leave foreign shores. That means better \nintelligence and more personnel dedicated to finding and stopping \nterrorists. And those are the issues this Senate is currently debating. \nBut we also need to give the people engaged in antiterrorist activities \nthe tools they need to succeed.\n  We also need to harden our port facilities, support the Coast Guard \nin fulfilling the missions they have been tasked to perform, and \nfacilitate better coordination among Federal agencies, States, and \nlocal first responders.\n  In the last several years, we have made steady but slow progress in \nbetter securing our port facilities and our trade lanes, and we have \nlearned some important lessons through innovative programs such as \nOperation Safe Commerce, the Container Security Initiative, and the \nCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism.\n  Soon the lessons we have learned should be applied in a way to better \nprotect our Nation, and with the support of Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Byrd, the report accompanying this bill directs the \nadministration to create a national standard for cargo security.\n  By February, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to take \nthe data, analysis, and lessons learned from these cargo security \nprograms and create a plan that will ensure that the cargo headed for \nour shores is safe to bring into our ports.\n  As the author of Operation Safe Commerce, I am particularly proud to \nreport that despite early reluctance by the administration, we are \nseeing real results through the implementation of this security \nprogram.\n  After more than a year of preparation, we launched Operation Safe \nCommerce. It is a new era of port and cargo security that uses smart \ntechnology and the best supply chain systems to protect our ports from \nthose who would do us harm.\n  Only last week, I had the opportunity to visit the port of Tacoma to \nsee how Operation Safe Commerce, our three largest container load \ncenters, and the private sector partners had answered our call.\n  Over the past 5 months, shipments have been tracked from their \norigination point, whether that was in an overseas factory floor or an \nagricultural field, to their final destination. The cargo traveled by \ntruck, train, and ship along its journey, and we watched it every step \nof the way. The security was monitored and analyzed at the origination \npoint, every subsequent transfer point, and on each mode of \ntransportation until it reached the customer.\n  When vulnerabilities were found in the supply chain, solutions were \ndeveloped to ensure the integrity of the shipments. In many cases, it \nwas discovered that the origination point lacked access, control, and \ngeneral security.\n  So now we know that cameras, biometric identification technology, and \nthird party inspection are necessary to ensure the product's integrity \nbefore it is loaded into a container.\n  In other cases we found that the integrity of container seals was not \nverified at each point in the supply chain. If the seal had been \ncompromised when it arrived here, it is too late. So several \ntechnologies were recommended to ensure that we know if a seal has been \nbroken or a container has been opened.\n  It was learned that the identity used by drivers to transfer the \ncontainers between supply chain points was not always easily verified. \nSo the final Operation Safe Commerce report will make recommendations \nto address that as well.\n  When the 9/11 Commission published its report, it noted that \ninitiatives such as Operation Safe Commerce had just begun to secure \nshipping containers but that an integrated strategic plan had not been \ndeveloped. These early findings prove that Operation Safe Commerce is a \nmodel for how our Nation can improve port security by identifying \ndangers before they leave foreign shores and helping to ensure that \ncargo is safe when it arrives in the United States.\n  This innovative program is an excellent example of industry coming \ntogether to share experiences and best practices, and I could not be \nmore proud that my home ports of Seattle and Tacoma, along with Los \nAngeles, Long Beach, New York, and New Jersey are leading the way to a \nnew standard to secure cargo bound for U.S. ports.\n  While the hard work of these partners has begun to answer the call in \ndefending our Nation and responding to the 9/11 Commission, there is \nstill much more that we need to do. As a few of us in Congress, the 9/\n11 Commission and experts in the field have called for, we must \ncontinue working together to develop a cargo security system as a \nnational and ultimately international standard. We must provide the \nfunding necessary to harden and protect our port facilities and the \npeople who live and work near them.\n  I am reminded of the challenge we face to secure these critical \nassets every time I come home to Washington State. My office in Seattle \nis located in the Jackson Federal Building. From my office window, I \ncan see the third largest container load center in the country, the \nlargest passenger ferry system in the continental United States, \ncarrying 26 million passengers annually. I can see an ever-increasing \nnumber of cruise ships that call on Seattle. I can see active commerce \nand thousands of people engaged in trade on a daily basis. I can see \ntwo professional sports stadiums that hold tens of thousands of people \nand literally thousands of residences and homes of people who live near \nour port facilities.\n\n  Again, this is all in close proximity to the port of Seattle. This \nview is not\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nmuch different than the view of other ports in my State and, frankly, \nall around the country, and that is why I want to make sure all of \nAmerica's ports are safe.\n  I know every Senator agrees there is nothing more important than \nprotecting our country, and over the next few days I hope we can all \nwork together to do a better job for our Nation, for our States, and \nthe individual communities we all represent. I know unless we make the \nright decisions in Washington, DC, our security, our economy, and our \ncommunities will be threatened. That is why today I am offering the \nMurray amendment to triple the level of port security grant funding in \nthe underlying bill.\n  While the amount contained in the bill for port security grants is \ngreater than that included in the House bill, I remain concerned that \nthe amount is simply not enough to help our ports with their security \nneeds. The Commandant of the Coast Guard has testified that it will \ntake more than $7 billion, including $1.5 billion this year, to \nimplement the port security plans which were mandated by the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act.\n  In the last fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security received \nnearly $1 billion in requests for port security grants. Since that \ntime, Congress has only provided $275 million in port security grants, \n$150 million last year and $125 million this year.\n  According to the Coast Guard, that leaves us over $1 billion short of \nour commitment to these vulnerable assets, and according to the \nAmerican Association of Ports Authorities, a minimum of $400 million is \nnecessary to safeguard the most critical ports in the country.\n  While I have always known the need for extra port security funding, \nthe urgency was recently highlighted for me at home in Washington \nState. We have had the terror level raised to Orange six times in the \npast 3 years, and soon ferry systems across the country will be \nrequired to increase their threat posture due to suspicious activity on \nferries and at terminals nationwide. While this suspicious activity is \nnot necessarily attributable to the action of potential terrorists, the \nsteps we are taking are a necessary precaution.\n  Protecting our country comes with a price. This means increased \nvehicle inspections, and for the Washington State ferry system that \nmeans each month an estimated 21,000 additional vehicles will need to \nbe inspected before they board our ferries. The ferry system, State \npatrol, and Coast Guard will incur tremendous additional costs to \nsecure what is essentially an extension of our highway system that are \nnot budgeted for and costs that, frankly, could have been avoided.\n  We could have avoided these extra costs with enough funding to secure \nthose terminals. It seems penny-wise and pound-foolish to scrimp on the \nport and terminal security so many experts have called for. The Murray \namendment would provide a $300 million increase in port security \nfunding for a total of $450 million in fiscal year 2005. This amendment \nwould help put the safeguards in place to ensure that local communities \nare not forced to pick up the tab for a federally mandated security \nmeasure. This increase is necessary to make an honest attempt to cover \nthe Federal share of securing some of the greatest economic engines of \nour economy and the communities that surround them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my \nsupport for Senator Murray's amendment to the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  Our Nation's seaports are now the gateway for 95 percent of our \ninternational trade, and as such they play a vital role in our national \neconomy. The volume of domestic and international trade is expected to \ndouble over the next two decades, as globalization continues to \nincrease linkages between the people of different countries.\n  Seaports' essential role in our economy makes them a natural target \nfor terrorist groups or other entities seeking to inflict harm on the \nUnited States of America. We know that al-Qaida and other international \nterrorist groups have shown a preference for targets of economic \nimportance, and we have seen the economic impact of port closures \ncauses by strikes or weather emergencies. We can conclude from this \nthat terrorist groups could consider American ports to be viable \ntargets, and there are a variety of ways that terrorists could attack a \nport to disrupt activity, cause damage, and kill American citizens.\n  It is therefore vital that we take adequate steps to ensure that our \nNation's ports are appropriately defended. Congress has addressed \nseaport security concerns over the last several years, and we have \npassed several bills that have sought to modify and improve the \nsecurity of American seaports.\n  In 1997, I had the opportunity to spend a day working as a customs \ninspector at Port Manatee, FL, where I was able to learn about these \nsecurity challenges firsthand. Several of my Senate colleagues and I \nconvinced President Clinton to appoint an interagency commission \naddressing seaport security. This commission's recommendation were \ntaken seriously by members of Congress, and we began working on \nlegislation.\n  In the fall of 2002, we passed the Maritime Transportation Safety \nAct, which raised security standards at American ports. This \nlegislation authorized the appropriation of whatever funds were \nnecessary to meet the new security requirements. The Coast Guard has \nestimated that meeting these new requirements will cost approximately \n$7.2 billion over the next decade, and that first-year start up costs \nwill total roughly $1.4 billion.\n  America's port authorities seem to agree with the Coast Guard's \nassessment, since they have requested nearly one billion dollars in \nport security grants. So far only a fraction of this need has been met \nby federal funding. This means that we have essentially handed our \nlocal port authorities a very large unfunded mandate. If we are going \nto follow through on our commitment to protect our Nation's seaports, \nwe must ensure that port authorities have the resources they need to \nmeet the security requirements we have established.\n  Increasing funding for port security grants will help ensure that our \nseaports are able to prepare for a possible terrorist attack. While \nthis amendment does not provide port authorities with the nearly $1 \nbillion they need, it certainly brings us much closer to that goal.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Murray amendment because I \nthink that it includes important investments in port security. The \namendment includes $300 million for port security grants so that we can \nincrease our surveillance of the thousands of containers that enter our \ncountry.\n  In its current form, this amendment does not include any offsetting \nreductions to pay for the new investments. If this amendment is adopted \ntoday, and I hope that it will be, I intend to work with the conferees \nto offset these increases by reducing funding that have been earmarked \nfor Iraqi reconstruction. I believe these expenditures should be offset \nwith these other spending cuts.\n  Iraq is a nation that sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the \nworld. My view is that Iraq should pay for its own reconstruction.\n  Last year, this Congress acted in an expedited way to appropriate \n$18.4 billion for Iraqi reconstruction. And yet, 10 months later, most \nof that money is still unspent. Less than $1 billion has been actually \nexpended and only about $7 billion has been obligated.\n  Therefore, I support Senator Murray's amendment and I will vote for \nit today. But my intention is to push for the rescission of those \nunobligated Iraqi reconstruction funds and use them to offset these \nneeded security investments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered to increase \nfunding for port security grants. Specifically, it would increase the \nauthority for spending in the bill by $300 million. Senators should \nknow the bill already contains funding for port security grants in the \namount of $150 million, and since fiscal year 2002 we have provided \nfunding for this program of almost $500 million, specifically for port \nsecurity grants.\n  A lot of progress has been made to upgrade the quality of our \ndetection\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nprocesses. We have seen money going for training and equipping of port \nsecurity officials. We are making important and constructive changes in \nprocedures to help ensure that we can identify suspicious activity \naround the ports of the country. The Coast Guard is involved, of \ncourse. As we have talked about earlier today, we are providing for \nmodernizing the fleet of the Coast Guard and doing other things that \nhelp assure that across our country we are going to be able to enjoy a \nsafer and more secure environment.\n  On Friday, September 10, all of the funds that were appropriated for \n2004, the current fiscal year, $50 million in grants, were awarded. So \nthe administration is working expeditiously to carry out the directives \nof the Congress in awarding these funds.\n  I may point out that the President's request for this particular \ngrant program for this next fiscal year was only $46 million.\n  So we have already tripled the amount of money that will be going out \nto State and local officials, security officials, for this program.\n  We have one other problem with the amendment as well and that is that \nthere is no offset provided as required by the Budget Act. To simply \nadd money for a program is not going to be permitted unless an offset \nis provided. So under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, a \npoint of order would lie against the amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this time I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate? If there is no further debate, the question \nis on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Ms. \nDole) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3607\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3607.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To provide funds for the American Red Cross)\n\n       On page 25, lines 6 and 7, strike ``$2,151,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended'' and insert ``$2,221,000,000 \n     to remain available until expended, of which $70,000,000 is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement under \n     section 502(c) of H. Con. Res. 95 (108th Cong.) and shall be \n     made available for a grant to the American Red Cross for \n     disaster relief, recovery expenditures, and emergency \n     services in response to Tropical Storm Bonnie, Hurricane \n     Charley, and Hurricane Frances''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is an amendment to the \nHomeland Security bill to provide $70 million to the American Red Cross \nfor the purposes of their relief efforts as a result of Tropical Storm \nBonnie and Hurricane Charley, which hit us 4 weeks ago, and Hurricane \nFrances, which hit us this past week.\n  The American Red Cross is out of money. Their coffers have run dry. \nThey have people all over Florida right now. In order to pay expenses, \nin doing what the American Red Cross does so well, they have had to go \nout and borrow $10 million.\n  I just got off of the phone with the national president of the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  I want to show you what else is lurking out there. I did not have \ntime to blow this illustration up for everybody, but this is the third \nhurricane, in the last 5 weeks, that is headed to Florida. This \nhurricane, at 11 o'clock this morning, was down here in relation to the \nsoutheast of Jamaica. Its track will take it right over Jamaica and \nacross western Cuba, on a track that is eerily reminiscent of Hurricane \nCharley which hit us 4 weeks ago, and going right out into the warm \nwaters of the Straits of Florida, across the Keys. On the track that is \nshowing the center line, it would take it right to the southwest coast \nof Florida.\n  Now, you can imagine a hurricane of this magnitude. It has 160-mile-\nper-hour sustained winds, with gusts to 190 miles per hour. It came \nacross Grenada, and 90 percent of all the homes in Grenada are \ndestroyed. Let's hope the Good Lord will spare us in our State from \nhaving a third hurricane hit in a row, as two have already hit, the \nlast one of which was so massive that it covered up the entire State of \nFlorida with severe winds and just a deluge of rain.\n  This amendment is offered, albeit the majority leader, now talking to \nthe assistant minority leader, has assured me next week we are going to \nhave another emergency supplemental that will take care of FEMA \nexpenses and the Department of Agriculture, the Department of \nTransportation, the Army Corps of Engineers--all of those. We are going \nto be looking at a minimum of an additional $2.5 billion--minimum--\nbecause the $2 billion we just passed the night before last is not even \ngoing to cover the first hurricane.\n  So instead of taking the chance that next week's emergency \nsupplemental, which will originate in the House, will come to us at the \nlast minute in a take-it-or-leave-it situation--I do not want to take \nthat chance because of all of those Red Cross volunteers who are down \nthere who are so essential to our recovery efforts right now, trying to\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nrecover from a second hurricane, and not the least of which we will \nneed them desperately if we get hit with Hurricane Ivan, now scheduled \nto be in the Florida Keys Monday morning at 8 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I have stated my case. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, has an amendment been reported?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An amendment has been.\n  At the moment there does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have not had an opportunity to check \non the legal authority for appropriations being made directly to the \nAmerican Red Cross, but I have asked my staff to check to see under \nwhat authority the Senate would be authorized to appropriate funds for \na private or a charitable organization.\n  The American Red Cross, I do not think, is an agency of the Federal \nGovernment. There has been no request submitted to the Congress from \nthe administration to fund volunteer charitable organizations under \nthis bill or under any other bill, as far as I know. They, of course, \nrender very valuable and very important services not only here but \naround the world. We are all familiar with the good work they do.\n  So I am hopeful we can check to see what the authorities are and can \nprovide the Senate information on which to base a judgment as to what \nwe should do with respect to this amendment.\n  It requests, as I understand it--I do not have a copy of the \namendment. That is why I asked if it had been sent to the desk.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if I might answer some of those \nquestions.\n  This Senator personally gave the chairman of the committee a copy of \nthe amendment about 45 minutes ago. It is my understanding there are \nprovisions in this Department of Homeland Security bill for \nappropriations for private entities such as the American Red Cross. \nThat is the part of the bill we are amending, to provide $70 million of \nrelief money, specifically for disaster relief, recovery expenditures, \nand emergency services in response to Tropical Storm Bonnie, Hurricane \nCharley, and Hurricane Frances.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be glad to consider the amendment and review it \ncarefully. I wonder if there is an offset in the amendment that would \nprovide some source for making up the funds. We are limited in our \nallocation of funding under the Budget Act, and we are at the limit. \nAny amendment that adds spending to the bill without offsetting it \nagainst some other account is subject to a point of order under the \nBudget Act. That was the next part of the process of analyzing this \namendment. I hadn't gotten any satisfaction on the answer to that \nquestion. Maybe the Senator knows the answer.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will work with me, I will find \nan offset. If this is the chairman's pleasure, if we can hold this in \nabeyance, we will come back to him with an offset.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the American Red Cross dated September 9, 2004.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           American Red Cross,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, 716 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: It is very likely that the response by \n     the American Red Cross to back-to-back hurricanes Charley and \n     Frances will be the largest and costliest natural disaster \n     humanitarian effort in the 123-year history of the American \n     Red Cross. In order for the American Red Cross to carry out \n     the duties delegated to it by the federal government under \n     its Congressional Charter, I am respectfully requesting your \n     help in securing $70 million for the American Red Cross \n     Disaster Relief Fund within the Fiscal Year 2005 Department \n     of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill (S. 2537).\n       Because the needs of Florida residents who have suffered as \n     a result of the two hurricanes is so immediate, Congress \n     quickly provided FEMA with an additional $2 billion. It is \n     critical that further assistance also be provided \n     expeditiously. Because the Homeland Security appropriations \n     bill is expected to reach the President's desk prior to the \n     second emergency supplemental bill, we are asking that \n     funding for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund be \n     included in it. However, if the second supplemental bill \n     appears to be moving first, then we would ask that all \n     disaster relief funds be stripped from the Homeland Security \n     bill and added to the supplemental bill. The bottom line is \n     that we get the money to the victims and those helping them \n     as quickly as possible--whatever the vehicle. In times of \n     extraordinary need, such as that in Florida today, the Red \n     Cross Disaster Relief Fund requires federal assistance in \n     addition to charitable donations to meet the responsibilities \n     delegated to it by the federal government.\n       The response by the American Red Cross to Hurricanes \n     Charley and Frances marks the largest mobilization of Red \n     Cross resources since Hurricane Andrew. It encompasses a \n     geographic area that exceeds all other past disasters, \n     including the 1993 Midwest floods. To date, we have served \n     over four million meals and sheltered close to 300,000 people \n     in response to these back-to-back disasters. We are \n     continuing our expanded efforts to raise money from the \n     American public, who are always willing to aid their \n     neighbors at times like these, but the unprecedented need in \n     Florida clearly requires additional and immediate assistance \n     from the federal government.\n       I thank you for your consideration of this request, and the \n     volunteers of the American Red Cross and I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and your colleagues to ensure \n     that we meet the needs of every disaster victim.\n           Sincerely,\n                            Rear Adm. Marsha J. Evans, USN (Ret.),\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a lot of Senators who have indicated \nthey want to offer an amendment. We have worked through the list, and \nwe have a number of people who are going to offer amendments. Senator \nHarkin is going to come over at 5 o'clock or thereabouts. We are \nrunning into the thing we run into a lot around here. People say: We \nhave amendments, but we are not ready yet.\n  The two leaders have said they are going to end this bill Tuesday \nnight. There are different ways of fulfilling the wishes of the two \nleaders. One way would be to work hard and try to work our way through \nthe amendments. It is my understanding, speaking to the two leaders, \nthat we are going to be here tomorrow morning and have a couple votes. \nI guess what I am saying is: Staff of the Senators, if they would also \nlisten, if there are not going to be amendments offered, let us know.\n  It would be in everybody's interest to come over and start offering \nthese amendments. I am sorry we don't have it set up so people can come \nover immediately and not have to wait 2 or 3 minutes or even 20 \nminutes, but sometimes it works that way. I hope those within the sound \nof my voice will do whatever they can to come and offer their \namendments. It is 4 o'clock. We don't have anybody here to offer \namendments.\n  Monday is going to be a short day, as it always is, and Tuesday is \ngoing to be a long day. I believe there is a pretty good sense from the \ntwo leaders that they are going to do everything they can to finish \nTuesday night because the Jewish holiday starts on Wednesday. If we go \neven until noon on Wednesday, that means people who have to travel to \nthe west coast for religious observance on Wednesday cannot get there \nunless they leave earlier than that. You cannot automatically go to the \nairport and hope a plane is there. The latest plane going to \nCalifornia, for people who have to leave this body, is about 10:30 in \nthe morning.\n  I hope that Senators will come over and we can have two or three in \nline here. Senator Cochran has the theory--and I am confident that he \nis probably right--that as soon as somebody offers the amendment and it \nis debated, we can vote on it. So I hope we have some people show up.\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I had an opportunity to review the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Florida and to \nconsult with representatives of the administration and my staff who \nhave helped me analyze this. This amendment, as proposed, would provide \n$70 million to the Red Cross to reimburse them for expenses and enable \nthem to provide disaster assistance to hurricane victims and for other \npurposes under their authorization, under their jurisdiction.\n  We passed yesterday a $2 billion appropriation supplemental for the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency General Disaster Relief Fund. These \nfunds are to be used for the emergencies that exist in the State of \nFlorida and elsewhere, where the funds in this account had been \ndepleted.\n  We are told by administration officials, in consultation now, that \nthey are considering whether an additional amount may be needed in a \nsupplemental that could be submitted to Congress as early as Monday.\n  Officials are discussing this with the Red Cross. They are discussing \nthis with the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. So we do not know right now exactly how much the Red \nCross is going to need and whether additional funds need to be added to \nthat $2 billion account we have already approved and, if so, how much.\n  What I am hoping is we can withhold action on the Senator's amendment \ntonight and continue to stay in touch with officials in the \nadministration and with the Senator from Florida and others who are \ninterested in this and make sure the funds that are needed, that the \nRed Cross is entitled to, are in some bill. It may be the next \nsupplemental is the appropriate bill rather than this annual \nappropriations bill we are considering now.\n  I want to cooperate with the Senator and help make sure the disaster \nvictims get the help they need and that the State of Florida gets the \nhelp it needs to recover from this very serious situation.\n  Those are my findings and those are my assurances. I hope the Senator \nwill understand and not urge we take action on his amendment tonight.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding. With the assurances of the chairman and the committee that \nthe supplemental that has been promised by the majority leader will be \ncoming, with the assurances that the Red Cross would be included within \nsuch supplemental, then that solves this Senator's concerns. The \nsupplemental will have many other items, and by Monday, we will find \nout whether that supplemental is going to have to include the effects \nof this third hurricane that is headed our direction or whether we are \nstill looking at the two hurricanes that have already hit us.\n  The supplemental we passed two nights ago was merely an emergency \nsupplemental to get cash into FEMA. FEMA's well had run dry. They were \nflat broke. They had no more money to pay for the ongoing relief \nefforts. The $2 billion is not enough, and everybody acknowledges that, \nfor the first hurricane, much less all of the additional expenses for \nthe first hurricane plus the second hurricane. I wanted to protect the \nAmerican Red Cross, which is so vital to the interests of the recovery \nongoing right now, since their well had run dry as well.\n\n  So with the assurances of the Senator from Mississippi that this new \nsupplemental, whenever it comes--and it originates in the House and it \nis usually in a posture of ``take it or leave it'' at the last moment \nfor the Senate--that we are not in the situation where we are going to \nbe lacking for funds, this Senator is willing to set aside his \namendment, holding it pending on those assurances from the Senator.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nwillingness to set his amendment aside. It will be held at the desk, \nand we will consider it in due course if we do not resolve it in the \nsupplemental as I expect it to be resolved.\n  I assure the Senator that he is correct in the notion that we are \ngoing to work with him, cooperate with him, and with the people of his \nState and others who benefit from these Red Cross activities.\n  I thank the Senator for his cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3608\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander], for himself, \n     Mr. Coleman, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Allen, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3608.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used to amend the oath of \n allegiance required by section 337 of the Immigration and Nationality \n                                  Act)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 515. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to amend the oath of allegiance required by section \n     337 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1448).\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the manager and the assistant \nDemocratic leader for this opportunity, which will take only a moment. \nThis amendment is very simple and straightforward. The idea behind this \namendment has the support of 34 Members of this body, with the \nprincipal Democratic sponsor being Senator Schumer in the authorization \nprocess.\n  In this appropriation process, the amendment simply says:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     amend the oath of allegiance required by section 337 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n  Said more simply, it assures the oath of allegiance will not be \nchanged at any time during the next fiscal year without congressional \naction. The language in this amendment is already in the House version \nof the bill.\n  The oath of allegiance is a fundamental statement of what it means to \nbe an American. Much of the language in the oath dates back to the \n1790s when Congress first required new American citizens to swear an \noath of allegiance to the United States.\n  Today all new U.S. citizens--and many years there are nearly a \nmillion such new citizens--take this oath when they are naturalized. \nOne of the most inspiring events of my life has been to attend those \ncitizenship days in Federal courthouses that take place all over \nAmerica, usually once a month.\n  Typically, in the Nashville courthouse or in some other courthouse, \none might see 75 or 100 men and women and their families who come from \nall over the world. They spent 5 years waiting, learned the English \nlanguage, and learned about U.S. history. They have conducted \nthemselves well and they have decided to become citizens of the United \nStates. There has been a lot of discussion in this body about the \nimportance, especially in these times, of encouraging more focus on \ncitizenship and what it means to be an American. The assistant \nDemocratic leader and I proposed legislation last year, which passed \nthe Senate unanimously, to create summer academies for outstanding \nstudents and teachers in U.S. history.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and I have introduced \nlegislation that would allow our Nation's report card to test eighth \ngraders and high school seniors on U.S. history on a State-by-State \nbasis because at this time in our history, unfortunately, the\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nlowest scores in any subject among seniors in high school in the United \nStates is in U.S. history.\n  So taking the oath of allegiance and treating it with respect, not \nchanging it except by act of the Congress, is an important part of a \nseries of steps that we need to take to underscore the importance of \nhelping all citizens, and especially new citizens, understand our \ncommon culture and what it means to be an American.\n  If my colleagues will indulge me, I would like to read the oath:\n\n       I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely \n     renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any \n     foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or \n     which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I \n     will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States of America against all enemies, foreign and \n     domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the \n     same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States \n     when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant \n     service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \n     required by the law; that I will perform work of national \n     importance under civilian direction when required by the law; \n     and that I take this obligation freely without any mental \n     reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.\n\n  That is an oath with strength and decorum. It sounds like something \nthat might have been written by a group of rowdy patriots in \nWilliamsburg a long time ago.\n  Since the late 1990s, under the Clinton administration and it \ncontinues today, there has been some movement to amend the oath. Under \ncurrent law, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, now \nhoused in the Department of Homeland Security, has the authority to \nunilaterally change the oath. That is not right. Congress, this \nCongress, not a Federal agency, has designated the wording of the \nPledge of Allegiance, of the National Anthem, of the national motto, \nand the content of our national flag. The oath, some of which predates \nall of those other national symbols, ought to be treated with the same \nrespect.\n  I have a bill pending in the Judiciary Committee, and I am joined in \nthat bill by Senator Schumer and many others, including the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, who is the manager of this \nbill, which will do just that. While the Senate works its will on that \nbill, this amendment will ensure the oath is not changed unilaterally \nby an agency in the meantime. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee for this amendment. I think what this achieves, \nif it is agreed to by the Senate, is that it prevents this oath being \nchanged by regulation or fiat by some administration official. If the \noath is going to be changed, it will have to be changed by law because \nit was established by law, as he points out, in section 337 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n  I am glad to be reminded that I am a cosponsor of his corresponding \nbill, and so are other Senators. I am told that an effort is being made \nto clear the amendment on the other side of the aisle, and we are \nawaiting the advice of the distinguished leader. I am going to ask if \nthe Senator will permit us to go into a quorum until we can get a \nresponse from the other side.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, be temporarily \nlaid aside to permit the Senator from California to offer her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3609\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Feinstein and Senator Harry Reid, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) for herself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3609.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate $70,000,000 for grants to States, local \ngovernments, and first responders to purchase or improve communication \n  systems to allow for real-time interoperable communication between \nState and local first responders and to offset this appropriation with \n   a corresponding reduction from the Human Resources Account of the \n              Office of the Under Secretary of Management)\n\n       On page 19, line 17, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and all that \n     follows through line 22, and insert the following: \n     ``$2,915,081,000, which shall be allocated as follows:\n       ``(1) $970,000,000 for formula-based grants and \n     $470,000,000 for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants \n     pursuant to section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT ACT (42 U.S.C. \n     3714), of which $70,000,000 shall be used by States, units of \n     local government, local law enforcement agencies, and local \n     fire departments to purchase or improve communication systems \n     to allow for real-time, interoperable communication between \n     State and local first responders: Provided, That the amount \n     appropriated under title I for the Human Resources Account of \n     the Office of the Under Secretary for Management shall be \n     reduced by $70,000,000: Provided further, That''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Cochran and Reid for \ngiving me this opportunity to send my amendment to the desk. I \nunderstand I may be interrupted for a unanimous consent request. At any \ntime, that is fine. But this is a very important amendment.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues who seem to be voting against all \nof our amendments to increase funding for homeland defense, we pay for \nthis amendment. We do something very important in this amendment, and \nwe pay for it by cutting out a frill that happens to be included in \nthis particular legislation. Let me explain what we do. My amendment \nwill increase Federal support for local efforts to improve homeland \nsecurity by providing $70 million to State and local agencies for \ninteroperable communications. What does that mean, interoperable \ncommunications? That is so our various first responders can talk to \neach other, can communicate with each other across jurisdictional lines \nas they respond to a tragedy, to an emergency. As I said, we fully pay \nfor this amendment, so all we need is a majority vote and we will be \nable to get this help to the police who need it so badly, and to the \nfirefighters--the first responders.\n  One of the most painful parts of the September 11 attacks in New York \nwas the loss of more than 300 firefighters and other law enforcement \npersonnel who died inside the collapsing Twin Towers, trying to save so \nmany beautiful, innocent lives that also wound up being lost. So many \nof our finest were killed--police officers, firefighters, other public \nservants--because they couldn't communicate with one another on the \nequipment they had. Imagine, they could not communicate in this crisis \nwith one another because of the bad equipment that they had.\n  This was not a new problem. As the \n9/11 commission report points out:\n\n       The New York Fire Department's radios performed poorly \n     during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, for two reasons. \n     First, the radio signals often did not succeed in penetrating \n     the numerous steel and concrete floors that separated \n     companies attempting to communicate; and second, so many \n     different companies were attempting to communicate on the \n     same point-to-point channel that communications became \n     unintelligible.\n\n  We have known this from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The \ninability for our first responders to communicate with one another \nhampered them way back then. We have a repeat of those two problems 8 \nlong years later, on September 11, 2001.\n  There is a lot of talk in Washington about the fact that we are going \nto get hit again. We were called up to a secret room up there and we \nwere told that. Then 5 minutes later Secretary Ridge told the whole \ncountry--so I am not saying anything out of school here--that we were \ngoing to be hit in this country before the election. Under this \nadministration--forget about any new administration, whether there will \nbe a new one or the same one--we were told by this administration that \nwe were\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\ngoing to be hit this year. This is an important bill on which my \ncolleagues are working so hard.\n  I commend both sides of the aisle for their work on this bill. This \nbill is deficient and we are trying to make it better. One of the ways \nwe can make it better for a relatively small amount of dollars--and I \nwill tell you how I pay for this in a moment--is to make sure our first \nresponders across our country get help so that they have the funds to \nbe able to communicate with one another.\n  We have not fixed the problem after the World Trade Center. We have \nnot fixed the problem after the Twin Towers calamity and the Pentagon \ncalamity, and it is unacceptable. That is the bad news. The good news \nis we can do something about it today. Thank goodness this bill is \nbefore us so we can let the American people know their security and \nprotecting them is not so many words; it is reality. We are doing \nsomething. But in the area of interoperability, what is in this bill is \nso small and it doesn't even call for a grant to actually purchase \nequipment. Can you imagine? It doesn't even call for grants to purchase \nthe equipment. Our local responders know what they need, and we should \nbe helping them purchase the equipment they need.\n  Our emergency public safety personnel must be able to speak to one \nanother in real time. I am on the first floor of the building and I \nhave gotten a report that something is wrong on the fourth floor of the \nbuilding and communicate that to all of the emergency personnel so they \nknow something is happening on the fourth floor of the building, and \nthey can act because time is life in that world. Time is life in that \nworld.\n  Almost every community in California I visited over this break--I \nspent my entire July and August at home. I visited small cities and big \ncities and small counties and big counties and rural counties and \nsuburban counties and urban counties. Let me tell you, they all told me \nthey need interoperable communication, that they need our help in \nfunding it and they need it as soon as possible.\n  Let me go on the record stating that we have been warned. If, God \nforbid, there is another tragedy and the first responders can't talk to \none another, it is our fault because we have the resources to do it. We \nhave to do it. Lots of secret meetings don't do us any good to find out \nwe are going to be attacked if we don't act.\n  Senator Byrd said the emperor has no clothes. That is one way of \nputting it. Today is a chance to put some clothes on the emperor. It is \nalso a chance to have a real defense--not a Wizard of Oz defense that \nhas a lot of bells and whistles, and color codes and orange lights and \nred lights and duct tape and all the other things--to put some \nequipment into the hands of our first responders and have a real \ndefense so they can catch something before it happens, and if they \ncatch it when it happens they can make sure people's lives are saved.\n  Developing a single radio system will make a real difference in \npublic safety, but paying for it is a huge burden on our local people. \nWe need to give them the funding they need to purchase the technology \nthat makes interoperability possible. Our first responders must be able \nto communicate with one another in that real time. They should not have \nto rely on their cell phones in a time of emergency. We need to do our \njob so they can do their job.\n  The administration's budget contains nothing for interoperable \ncommunication. The appropriations bill we are now considering only has \n$31 million for research and technical assistance. Our first \nresponders' first priority is not research, it is equipment. They know \nwhat they need. They are smart. This is their life. This is what they \ndo every day. They are ready to make the purchases they need. So what \nare we doing? We have technical assistance from Uncle Sam. That is not \nwhat they need. They need to be able to have the hard dollars to go do \nwhat they have to do from the ingenious American technology sectors of \nour great country and put those units to work so they can talk to each \nother and they can rely on those communications.\n\n  My amendment goes a long way to addressing this issue. It would \nprovide an additional $70 million to help State and local agencies \nimprove existing communications systems or purchase new systems. This \nfunding would help our local agencies purchase equipment for real time, \ninteroperable communications between first responders. This $70 million \nwould be above the $30 million in the bill I talked about for research \nand technical assistance. The funding in my amendment is offset.\n  Let me repeat that. We are paying for this. I am going to ask the \nAmerican people to judge along with the Senators how that $70 million \nshould be spent.\n  There is $70 million in the bill from the human resources account. \nThe Office of the Under Secretary of Management wants to design and \ndeploy a new human resources system--a human resources system--and they \nare going outside the Federal Government to do it, hire high-paid \nconsultants to do it instead of keeping the money where it belongs, in \nthe hands of the first responders. We are going to have a new human \nresources system, another layer of bureaucracy brought to you by \noutside consultants who are going to probably go to lunch at the fancy \nplaces in Washington and send us the bill. I would rather give the \nmoney to my firemen and my policemen and policewomen any day of the \nweek. That is the case you have. You can keep the money in there for \nthis human resources account and spend this money on outside fancy \nconsultants who are going to tell us how to deal with our human \nresources or we can get that $70 million and give it to the first \nresponders.\n  That is what we say we are for. We say we are for defending the \nhomeland. Let us prove we are for defending the homeland.\n  I propose shifting the funds from the luxury and the frills while our \nemergency responders can't even talk to one another in a burning \nbuilding. There is time for frills, my friends, and there is time for \nreal decisions to be made. This is not the time for frills. This is a \ntime to make a decision that our first responders are more important \nthan some consulting firm that is going to make millions off the \ntaxpayers for no reason whatsoever.\n  If our people do not know how to handle human resources, then get new \npeople who know how to handle human resources. I thought that is why we \npaid management. That is what I think you should do. I have been in the \nprivate world, and the bottom line in the private world is you hire \npeople to handle management. If you are going to take the money out of \nthe business and go outside to hire high-paid consultants, then fire \nthe people you have. If you want to do that, fire the people you have. \nIf you have no trust in their management capability, fire them and then \ntake care of that and put it into first responder funding.\n  After 9/11 we all asked what could we have done better? How could we \nhave been better prepared? And the answer came back to me. I represent \nthe largest State in the Union. We have high targets in our State, \nbeautiful bridges and buildings. We have very famous landmarks in my \nState. We worry about terrorist attacks. My people are no-nonsense \npeople. They know frills when they see it. And they know. I have talked \nto them. They know that one of the most important things our fire \npeople and our police people need is to be able to talk to one another \nin an emergency in real time. If there is a terrorist attack on a \nrailroad track, they have to get that word out up and down that rail \nline.\n  If there is an attack on a high building, on a high floor, the people \ncoming in the building need to know something has collapsed up there. \nThey need to know not to run up there and face the chaos of hell. They \nneed to talk to one another. It is fairly basic.\n  The choice is clear. This amendment is an important step in \nfulfilling our responsibility to protect the homeland and to do it in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  I am pleased Senator Reid is a sponsor of this amendment, and I am \nvery proud that Senator Feinstein is. I hope we can get some Republican \nsupport. This is paid for by a frill that we do not need.\n  The first responders in our States are the heroes. We say it every \nday. There is not one Member who does not say it every day. If they are \nthe heroes and they are telling us they need this, then let's do it.\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Clinton as a cosponsor to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have some articles, including this one from the PR \nNewswire Association. It says:\n\n       Almost three years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, \n     thousands of police and fire divisions in cities and counties \n     across the USA still do not have coordinated communications \n     capabilities. This unresolved national crisis--referred to as \n     a lack of ``interoperability''--is prompting the First \n     Response Coalition to reach out directly to more than 43,000 \n     local police and fire officials to solicit their help to get \n     Congress to. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the PR Newswire Association, Inc., August 25, 2004]\n\n  Nearly 45,000 U.S. Police, Fire Officials Urged To Push Congress To \n  Solve First Responder Interoperability Crisis; Hundreds of Rank-and-\n      File First Responders Expected To Oppose Giveaway to Nextel\n\n       Amost three years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, \n     thousands of police and fire divisions in cities and counties \n     across the United States still do not have coordinated \n     communications capabilities. This unresolved national \n     crisis--referred to as a lack of ``interoperability''--is \n     prompting the First Response Coalition to reach out directly \n     to more than 43,000 local police and fire officials to \n     solicit their help to get Congress to overturn the Nextel \n     spectrum grab in favor of a plan that deals both with the \n     interference problem and the interoperability crisis.\n       Gene Stilp, who is the First Response Coalition coordinator \n     and a volunteer firefighter, EMT and vice president of the \n     Dauphin-Middle Paxton Fire Company 1, in Dauphin, \n     Pennsylvania, said that, ``the FCC plan is wrong for police \n     officers and firefighters. It only take on part of the \n     interference issue and doesn't do a thing about \n     interoperability. The FCC plan is short-sighted, and, if we \n     don't act together, we'll miss the opportunity to get \n     Congress to step in and solve both the interference issue and \n     the significantly larger interoperability problem.''\n       The letters to a total of 42,463 police and fire officials \n     in all 50 states started going out earlier this month and \n     responses are just now starting to come in. The outreach \n     program is getting a very favorable grassroots response \n     including over 17 fire chiefs who have joined the ranks of \n     the First Response Coalition in opposing the FCC's current \n     plan for the taxpayer-owned spectrum.\n       In the letter, the First Response Coalition proposes a plan \n     to ``auction off the spectrum that the FCC plans to give away \n     and dedicate the $5-10 billion that would be raised for \n     communication system upgrades. (The plan) also would \n     accelerate regional deployment to ensure that a majority of \n     systems nationwide are upgraded by 2006.''\n       ``Nearly three years after the tragedy of 9/11 was made \n     worse because first responders could not adequately \n     communicate with one another, almost nothing has been done to \n     address the interoperability crisis,'' said Bill Fox, a New \n     York Metropolitan Fire commissioner and a member of the First \n     Response Coalition.\n       During August, the Coalition is underscoring its call to \n     action with key Capitol Hill meetings, including sessions \n     with U.S. House of Representatives members serving on Energy \n     and Commerce, Government Reform and the Select Committee on \n     Homeland Security. The coalition also has met with the U.S. \n     Senate Governmental Affairs and Commerce committees.\n\n\n                          about the coalition\n\n       The First Response Coalition (http://\n www.FirstResponseCoalition.org) consists of citizens, \n     individual first responders, and advocacy groups who are \n     particularly concerned about first responders having the best \n     possible communications capabilities. The First Response \n     Coalition believes interoperability issues must be addressed \n     by the FCC or Congress in any plan that reorganizes spectrum \n     and, as a result, will disrupt public safety communications \n     systems across the country. The First Response Coalition has \n     developed a white paper, ``It's Time to Talk: Achieving \n     Interoperable Communications for America's First \n     Responders,'' which is available online at http://\n www.FirstResponseCoalition.org.\n       Since its launch in June 2004, the First Response Coalition \n     has grown to include the National Black Police Association, \n     the American Legislative Exchange Council and the California \n     Seniors Coalition. In addition to Stilp and Fox, a number of \n     other individual first responders--including fire chiefs from \n     around the nation--have joined the Coalition's initial \n     members.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to have an article from the \nDesert Sun, Palm Springs, CA, printed in the Record. In this particular \narea of my State, the Republicans are in most of the elected offices. \nThey say every single day they are all on a different radio frequency \nand they don't have the ability to communicate. It is amazing, because \nit is 2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Desert Sun (Palm Springs, CA), July 4, 2004]\n\n                 First Responders Homeland Defense Act\n\n                           (By Lois Gormley)\n\n       Homeland defense could get $300 million a year in federal \n     money under legislation sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer to \n     develop a communication system that would allow first \n     responders to talk to each other.\n       ``If we expect our first responders to do their jobs, we \n     need to help them,'' Boxer, D-Calif., said Saturday.\n       Boxer discussed the First Responders Homeland Defense Act \n     she introduced in March during a visit to the Coachella \n     Valley.\n       ``Every single agency in this valley--really the state--\n     we're all on a different radio frequency,'' said Capt. Sandra \n     Houston, commander of the Indio area California Highway \n     Patrol.\n       The inability of different agencies to communicate with one \n     another during an emergency is a major obstacle to working \n     together and being able to relay information immediately.\n       ``We don't have that ability and it's amazing because it's \n     2004,'' she said.\n       The problem, usually caused by incompatible equipment, can \n     sometimes translate into loss of lives, as it did during the \n     Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Houston said.\n       Boxer's bill, if passed, would provide $50 million a year \n     in grants to nonprofit organizations to conduct training and \n     $300 million a year in grants for communication systems.\n       The act also would provide a hotline to help first \n     responders navigate the often confusing and time-consuming \n     task of finding and obtaining federal grant money.\n       ``There are so many different strings of funding coming \n     from so many different places, it's a full-time job to keep \n     track of it all,'' Boxer said.\n       She discussed the key points of her bill after meeting with \n     local police, sheriffs, and highway patrol officials at the \n     Palm Springs Police Department's Training Center.\n       The inability to communicate with one another has long been \n     a point of concern for valley law enforcement officials.\n       Desert Hot Springs Police Chief Roy Hill said he, Palm \n     Springs Chief Gary Jeandron and other valley police chiefs \n     have been looking into federal funding options for an inter-\n     operable radio system for about six months and recently \n     submitted a request for grant funding.\n       Riverside County has also been exploring the costs and \n     benefits of developing a regional system that would bring all \n     of the county's 54 public safety agencies onto shared \n     frequencies.\n       Boxer's legislation could provide the money needed to solve \n     what is a statewide problem.\n       ``They need to speak to each other in real time but very \n     few communication systems in California have that ability,'' \n     Boxer said.\n       Her bill, SB 2239, is now in the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs.\n       In a closed-door meeting with local law enforcement \n     officials, Boxer talked about their efforts to improve \n     homeland security.\n       She also brought them up to date on federal funding and \n     proposed cuts by the president, and the survival of older law \n     enforcement grant programs that help keep police and \n     sheriff's departments well-staffed, equipped and trained.\n       Hill said the grants are particularly important to smaller \n     departments.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. And from the Contra Costa Times, ``Gaps in \nCommunication'':\n\n       We have a patchwork of communication systems out there, and \n     we do what we must to make it work. . . . But there are times \n     where we're only one step above tin cans and string.\n\n  Further in the article:\n\n       We can literally be rolling side by side with a unit from \n     another city and not be able to talk to them. It's not too \n     difficult to imagine how crazy things could get with several \n     agencies converging for one incident.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, CA), September 5, 2004]\n\n                         Gaps in Communication\n\n                            (By Guy Ashley)\n\n       If the airliner hijackings of Sept. 11, 2001, drove a \n     dagger into the nation's heart, the news that followed was a \n     splash of salt on its wound.\n       Soon after thousands of people died in the World Trade \n     Center, investigators unearthed evidence that as many as 100 \n     firefighters killed when the two towers crumbled might have \n     survived had their emergency radios worked.\n       To most of us, the fatal shortcomings of basic equipment \n     seem unimaginable.\n       But to those who keep up with such things, including the \n     first responders on the front lines of emergencies throughout \n     the East Bay, the radio breakdowns of Sept. 11, 2001, not \n     only rang familiar, they hinted at the\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n     disastrous potential of communications failures that persist \n     to this day.\n       ``We have a patchwork of communications systems out there, \n     and we do what we must to make it work,'' said Robert \n     Maginnis, an assistant Alameda County sheriff. ``But there \n     are times where we're only one step above tin cans and \n     string.''\n       The Sept. 11 attacks were far from the first glaring \n     example of a public safety communications breakdown amid \n     large-scale disaster.\n       Nightmares still flare about the 1991 firestorm that \n     swallowed neighborhoods in the Oakland and Berkeley hills. \n     Firefighters from surrounding communities converged swiftly \n     on the chaotic scene that October day, but were left to watch \n     the inferno rage because they could not communicate with \n     officials coordinating the response.\n       In the rubble wrought by the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, \n     radio breakdowns forced emergency workers to ferry \n     handwritten notes to and from the ravaged Alfred T. Murrah \n     Federal Building.\n       But those headline-grabbing ordeals are outnumbered by the \n     all-too-ordinary instances where a quick-thinking East Bay \n     police officer or firefighter must work around transmission \n     blockages that leave them feeling that their safety, and \n     their ability to protect the public, hangs by a thread.\n       ``Knock on wood, it's never created a life-or-death \n     situation,'' said Lt. Steve Pricco of the San Leandro police, \n     whose officers cannot communicate directly with police in two \n     adjacent cities because of incompatible radio systems.\n       ``It's something all of us have had to work around for \n     years . . . and it's just a fact that it slows down our \n     ability to coordinate a response'' with neighboring police, \n     Pricco said.\n       Surely, in the era of Homeland Security czars and their \n     multicolored alert systems, of special commissions and \n     congressional hearings, a fix must be at hand.\n       But a Times survey found otherwise. Interviews and a review \n     of other evidence showed that emergency radio problems caused \n     by incompatible technologies and overcrowded frequencies \n     abound across the East Bay.\n       ``We can literally be rolling side by side with a unit from \n     another city and not be able to talk to them,'' said \n     Livermore police Lt. Scott Trudeau. ``It's not too difficult \n     to imagine how crazy things could get with several agencies \n     converging for one incident.''\n       Experts pin the blame on a longstanding public-sector \n     mindset that local needs take precedent over regional, and on \n     radio manufacturers who routinely design their equipment with \n     proprietary parts and software, so that incompatibility with \n     systems designed by rival companies is commonplace.\n       Throughout the East Bay, the resulting incompatibilities \n     make for illogical communication gulfs and a few strange \n     bedfellows:\n       Richmond police can't radio sheriff's deputies in their own \n     county but can talk with Oakland and BART police via radio \n     with little effort.\n       Oakland police cannot speak directly on their radios with \n     officers from their two biggest neighbors--Berkeley and San \n     Leandro, Berkeley police, meanwhile, can't speak directly \n     with officers who operate within their city on the University \n     of California campus.\n       Nobody uses the same band of radio frequencies as the \n     California Highway Patrol. Nobody, that is, except the East \n     Bay Regional Park District.\n       Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Concord, Clayton, Pittsburg \n     and Martinez police cannot radio firefighters in their \n     cities. Neither can Pinole or Hercules police.\n       BART police cannot radio city police departments anywhere \n     along the Pittsburg-Bay Point line: Lamorinda, Walnut Creek, \n     Pleasant Hill, Concord or Pittsburg.\n       Oakland police and Alameda County sheriff's deputies mingle \n     among rowdy fans while splitting security duties at Oakland \n     Raiders games, but if the fun turns to mayhem, the two \n     agencies cannot speak to each other on their portable radios.\n       Ambulances cannot communicate directly with fire crews in \n     Richmond. To receive updated information at the scene of an \n     emergency, ambulances must instead talk through a dispatcher \n     in a remote location.\n       Workers caught in the confusing web of incompatible \n     communications systems have talked for years about a logical \n     solution, an ``interoperable'' regional radio system that \n     could be easily accessed by all of the East Bay's public \n     safety and emergency services agencies.\n       Lately, there have been signs that the years of talk are \n     finally being converted into action.\n       A new ``working group'' of Alameda and Contra Costa \n     officials formed this year to address first responder \n     communications problems. The group has hashed out a rough \n     plan to pool Homeland Security funds due the East Bay for a \n     down payment on a regional system, which could cost as much \n     as $75 million.\n       But such a system is at best several years away, thanks to \n     a shortage of funds available to financially challenged local \n     governments and the need for consensus among all agencies \n     likely to participate.\n       Meanwhile, concerns persist about what police, firefighters \n     and other first responders are working with today.\n       Public safety agencies, the backbone of any emergency \n     response, are forced to work around plugs in the regional web \n     of communications systems as officers chase vehicles fleeing \n     into neighboring cities, or firefighters are called on to \n     provide backup on a fast-moving fire.\n       The same problems hinder electronic links to ambulances. \n     They hover with menacing potential over radio links to \n     National Guard units that routinely are called upon to keep \n     order in large-scale emergencies, as well as public works and \n     water agencies whose contributions could prove pivotal in a \n     fast-moving crisis.\n       ``Having the communications linked is not a strength \n     here,'' said Leslie Mueller, operations director for American \n     Medical Response, the private ambulance company that serves \n     Contra Costa and the majority of other California counties.\n       Clashing communications equipment forces stopgap measures \n     that can be confusing. East Bay firefighters, for instance, \n     frequently ride with multiple sets of radios in hope that one \n     will serve them during a regional incident.\n       Communities stockpile portable radios to pass out to \n     outside responders in case of a large-scale emergency, a \n     sensible solution as long as everyone knows where to go to \n     get one.\n       In a large-scale incident, Trudeau said, ``You have to \n     literally grab a representative from another agency and pair \n     up with them so the two agencies can talk.''\n       Other area police officers note that when the California \n     Highway Patrol helicopter is dispatched to an East Bay \n     search-and-rescue incident, it often must land first and pick \n     up a representative from a local police department.\n       That can be the only way crews on the ground can \n     communicate with the helicopter, whose CHP radio is \n     incompatible with that of most police agencies.\n       The most common way police and other first responders \n     communicate when their radios don't mesh is through \n     dispatchers: An officer in the street radios a request to a \n     dispatcher, who feeds the message to a counterpart in another \n     city, who radios the message to officers in that city.\n       The system sounds complicated on paper, but it is performed \n     with impressive coordination on routine calls day to day.\n       But first responders are dogged by a nagging fear that the \n     system could break down in a large-scale disaster as \n     dispatchers are besieged by radio calls from first responders \n     in the field and 911 calls from residents seeking help.\n       The most obvious solution now available to dispatchers is \n     to direct first responders to turn their radios on to \n     ``tactical'' channels available to most radio systems.\n       But because only a handful of tactical channels are \n     available to local responders, they easily can become \n     overwhelmed with chatter during a large-scale incident--\n     precisely what happened during the Oakland hills firestorm.\n       Agencies in Alameda and Contra Costa are taking another \n     step to improve the systems they have. Both counties are \n     installing new equipment that will ``patch'' signals from \n     disparate radio systems together in emergencies.\n       The equipment, known as ``black boxes,'' holds great \n     potential in providing East Bay responders with a level of \n     interagency communications capacity not previously available.\n       Again, though, the equipment has limitations.\n       Even with the ``black boxes,'' one agency's radio equipment \n     is only as good as the infrastructure that supports it, \n     especially the transmission towers and ``repeaters'' required \n     to transmit the messages of responders in the field.\n       If, for instance, an Oakland police officer is sent to \n     Lawrence Livermore Laboratory to help in a large-scale \n     incident, the officer's radio may not work, even with the \n     ``black boxes,'' because the radio will be so far away from \n     the equipment that supports its signal.\n       Communications breakdowns that plagued first responders \n     Sept. 11 have fueled the drive toward interoperability \n     nationally and across the East Bay.\n       Experts have testified that the deaths of more than 100 \n     firefighters who died in the south tower of the World Trade \n     Center can be blamed in large part on incompatible radios, \n     problems that the 9/11 Commission said ``will likely recur in \n     any emergency of similar scale.''\n       The bite of past natural disasters, and the East Bay's \n     possible appeal as a terrorist target in the future, offer \n     reasons enough for the region to find a solution to its \n     decades-long problems with incompatible communications \n     systems, officials said.\n       ``The mistakes that were made on Sept. 11, we can prevent \n     them now,''' said Assistant Chief Chris Suter of the San \n     Ramon Valley Fire District. ``We should be working \n     together.''\n       Such solutions will pay dividends day to day, as well as \n     when the Big One hits.\n       Just ask the law enforcement officers who were on duty when \n     an Oakland police officer was killed July 22 in a traffic \n     accident in Castro Valley.\n       Officer William Seuis, 39, of Pleasanton died when the \n     motorcycle he was riding was struck by a truck on Interstate \n     238.\n       Witnesses to the afternoon accident called 911 to report \n     that the truck did not stop and continued onto eastbound \n     Highway 580. The call went to the California Highway Patrol, \n     whose officers eventually stopped the truck described by \n     witnesses in Dublin, about 12 miles away.\n       Alameda County sheriff's officials say the truck probably \n     would have been stopped a lot sooner if two deputies \n     traveling on I-580 just in front of the truck had known about \n     the downed officer.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n       But they never heard about it. The CHP broadcast did not \n     transmit on their radios.\n       ``We don't need the 9/11 Commission report to tell us \n     interoperability is a major concern,'' Robert Maginnis said.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope and pray the vote on this amendment \nis bipartisan. This amendment is paid for. It does not add to the \ndeficit. It makes a choice between a frill of outside consultants \ncoming in to tell management how to run the show.\n  If the administration is not happy with who is running the show, fire \nthose people and get somebody else. But do not spend 70 million bucks \nof the hard-earned taxpayer money, when these working men and women who \nare our first responders, who are our heroes, who we rely on, are \ntelling us they are one step above tin cans and a string to \ncommunicate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nCalifornia offering her amendment.\n  I want the Senator from California to recognize that Senator Byrd and \nI talked a little bit today about interoperability radios. At that \ntime, I indicated I had met with all the sheriffs and law enforcement \nofficers of the 17 counties of the State of Nevada. Every one of them \nlamented the fact--whether it is the fire departments in Clark County, \nthe most populous city, Las Vegas, sheriff's department, or in \nHenderson, the second largest city in Nevada--departments cannot talk \nto each other.\n  I said this morning I think it costs approximately $6 million or $7 \nmillion to take care of that, but that was from memory and I was wrong. \nMy staff heard me say that and, of course, got the correct figures.\n  In the city of Las Vegas alone, it will cost $40 million to take care \nof their problem; for the city of New York, $400 million. We have in \nthis bill $20 million to take care of radio interoperability. It is \nimportant we increase that to $70 million plus the $20 million.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is $30 million in the bill and we increase it by $70 \nmillion for $100 million.\n  Mr. REID. So we have $100 million. That would do a lot. A lot that \nneeds to be done is simply planning and designing how we will do that.\n  My point is, these are problems that are very difficult to take care \nof but they have to be done because you cannot have a situation such as \nwe had in New York City where the people were dying in those towers \nbecause they could not talk to each other.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Wouldn't my friend agree that we are now saying to our \nfirst responders all across the country, regardless of where they are, \nwhether they are in Oregon, whether they are in Mississippi, whether \nthey are in Nevada, whether they are in New Hampshire or whether they \nare in California, are we not saying to them that they, in essence, \nhave to respond to an attack on our homeland that is, in fact, part of \nthe war on terror? Are we not telling them when 9-1-1 is called at a \nlocal level, regardless of the crisis, if it is attached to terrorism, \nit is, in fact, a national attack?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. It is a \nnational attack.\n  In the Senate I have something called a BlackBerry. My staff in Las \nVegas can contact me on this. Whether it is Carson City, Reno, my staff \nup here in the Capitol, my staff in the Hart Building, they can contact \nme on this. There is a low vibration, I pick it up, read what they have \nto say, and I can communicate back with them--yes, no, let's do it \nlater or a longer message.\n  We have the ability to communicate in the Senate.\n  It is important for us to be able to communicate. As the Senator \nknows, we came together as Members of Congress quite a few years ago. \nBack then faxes did not work very well. But now we have so many \ndifferent ways to communicate with each other. It seems to me if we can \ncommunicate the way we do, our first responders should be able to \ncommunicate.\n  The Senator has made a small step toward a big problem, an important \nstep but it is not one to break the bank.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We pay for it.\n  Mr. REID. We sent to Iraq last year--and I also mentioned this to \nSenator Byrd earlier--in supplemental appropriations--meaning \nappropriations over and above the normal appropriations we do, last \nyear we sent a first supplemental of $69 billion and the second was $87 \nbillion. Couldn't we spend $70 million on my State in Nevada and \nCalifornia?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague, in an attempt to get some votes \nfrom the other side of the aisle, we actually found an offset. We are \nnot adding; we are cutting out a part of this bill that deals with an \noutside consulting contract to bring people in on human resources \ndevelopment.\n  As I said to my friend, if this administration does not think they \nhave the right management in place that can handle their human \nresources, then they should get rid of them and get new people. But the \nfact is, they are spending in this bill $70 million on fancy-dressed \noutside consultants who eat in the best restaurants in town, while the \nleast we could do is put that off and let the management do their job \nthere and use this funding to help our people on the ground.\n  Does my friend agree this is a time when we cannot really afford \nfrills, that we need to spend the money where it is most needed, in the \nhands of our first responders?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. We will have, as soon as \nthis vote is called, a simple majority vote. That is all it will take \nnow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Today, we have had supermajority votes because there have \nbeen points of order because there have not been offsets. I, of course, \nwould vote for this amendment whether it had an offset or not because \nit is so important. I appreciate this amendment.\n  When we send our people to battle in Iraq and Afghanistan and other \nplaces, they have the ability to communicate with each other. That is \nmodern warfare. But with modern firefighting, police work, as with \nother first responders, they do not have that same benefit. That is \ncertainly something they should have.\n  I hope this amendment is adopted. I hope our friends on the other \nside of the aisle will recognize how important this is. It is just the \nevidence we need to do more. As I say to my friend from California, \nthis is a step in the right direction. We need to do a lot more. I \ncertainly hope this amendment is adopted. I hope it is by an \noverwhelming margin.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the \namendment offered by Senator Boxer to provide $70 million to our \nNation's first responders for interoperability.\n  In the days following 9/11, interoperability became one of my chief \nconcerns. I was appalled that our first responders did not have the \ntools they need to communicate with each other. I know that some \nprogress has been made in distributing funds to States and localities \nto develop interoperable communications plans and to purchase \ninteroperable equipment. However, I continue to be dissatisfied with \nthe levels of commitment and funding dedicated to this critical need by \nthis administration. It is clear that the Congress needs to take a \nleadership role to ensure that our first responders are adequately \nequipped to deal with future disasters, whether caused by terrorism or \nnatural weather events. I urge my colleagues to support additional \nfunding for interoperability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the distinguished Senator \nfrom California----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3608\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have gotten approval from the Judiciary \nCommittee on the very fine amendment offered by the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to have that information from \nthe distinguished leader. Previously\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nthe Senator from Tennessee offered an amendment. We had set that \namendment aside to see if it could be cleared on both sides. We are \nglad it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we call up the Alexander \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3608) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3609\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that we \nreturn to the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Boxer amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from California, she proposes to add $70 million \nto a grant program account that provides funds for State and local \ngovernments for a variety of purposes. The purposes include a strategy \nfor dealing with homeland security issues, including training and \nexercises, equipment, including interoperable communications equipment \nand technical assistance, and may not be used for construction \nactivities. The amount of money in that account in the bill is \n$2,845,081,000. Her amendment would add $70 million to that amount and \nearmark that $70 million for interoperable equipment only.\n  Now, just looking at what this does to one State--let's just pick out \nCalifornia, coincidentally--funds have been made available to the State \nof California under this grant program for State and local governments \nin excess of $680 million since fiscal year 2002. The State of \nCalifornia can use that money for interoperable communications. They \ncan use it for other things. I do not know exactly what they are using \nthe money for, but I assume they are using some of it for interoperable \ncommunications, as they are authorized to do, as they are permitted to \ndo.\n  But what is a concern is to shut down a new management system that is \nbeing developed by the Department to make the Department more \nefficient, to make it operate more effectively, to take all that money, \nprohibit the use of any of that money, and add it to this other \naccount. It seems to me it is second-guessing the decision made by the \nfull Committee on Appropriations, and our subcommittee in particular.\n  When we analyzed the request from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, there was a request for $102.5 million for a program to \ndevelop a new pay system, performance management, managerial training, \nto modernize the human resource system of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Our staff conferred closely with the Department, asked questions \nabout what this would do, how important was it, and went through the \ndrill. We also had an opportunity to review our staff's assessment of \nit. The committee decided to approve $70 million of that $102 million \nrequest. The work is now underway. The work is to develop and put this \nin place. It would be a big mistake at this point to take that $70 \nmillion and shift it to another program, where we already provide a \nsubstantial amount of money, as I said, $2.8 billion, for these grants \nto State and local governments, and then to earmark some parts of that \njust for interoperable communications equipment. The point was to leave \nthese judgments up to State and local entities, not to, as a U.S. \nCongress person or a Senator, make these decisions for the States.\n  California has plenty of money in this account to buy a lot of \ninteroperable communications equipment if they want it, if they need \nit. But to make a judgment as to how they should use the money now and \nearmark certain parts for specific functions is beyond our ability to \nreally make the decisions and make them in a correct way that serves \nthe final goal, the objective of an improved national homeland security \nprogram.\n  So we are strongly opposed to the adoption of this amendment. We \nthink it would be a mistake. It may sound good to some, but it does not \nmake any sense to this Senator. The subcommittee has worked closely \nwith the Department to understand the need for the human resources \nsystem. It has helped determine the level of spending to allow the \nDepartment to move forward with this system. We concluded the funding \nincluded in the bill is necessary for the Department to be able to move \nforward with a pay-for-performance system.\n  I do not have anything else to say about the amendment. It is offset. \nI move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I understand we may have an amendment to \nbe offered by the Senator from Iowa at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Harkin is in the building and he should be here \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. There are Senators who have indicated an intention to \noffer other amendments. We are reviewing some at this time. We hope to \nbe able to accept some of these amendments. We appreciate the \ncooperation of all Senators today. We have made excellent progress on \nthe bill. We have taken up a number of amendments and voted on them and \nwe hope to be able to complete action on this bill on Tuesday evening. \nWe hope it is not late Tuesday evening. So we are making every effort \nto organize our effort and encourage those who do have amendments to \nplease let the committee know about the amendments. We have an \nidentified list that is in order, and for those who intend to offer \namendments, the sooner they can get us copies of those amendments, the \nsooner we may be able to let them know whether we can accept them or \nsuggest modifications that could be acceptable.\n  We would like to cooperate with all Senators in moving the bill along \nwith dispatch. We do not see any need to delay the Senate and to cause \nus to be in late tonight or tomorrow. We know\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\nsome Senators have plans for travel and we are hoping we can take up \nanother amendment or two tonight and then be able to work on other \nparts of the bill tomorrow as well. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation with the committee.\n  I understand the Senator from Iowa is on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3612\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that my amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be called up on behalf of myself and Senator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself and Mr. \n     Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 3612.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To restore the maximum percentage of hazard mitigation \n          contributions that may be made for a major disaster)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. HAZARD MITIGATION.\n\n       Section 404(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(a)) is amended \n     in the second sentence by striking ``7.5 percent'' and \n     inserting ``15 percent''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for giving me this \ntime to lay my amendment down and discuss it for a few minutes. It is a \nvery simple amendment. It has to do with FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's postdisaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. For \ncolleagues who may not be familiar with the postdisaster Hazard \nMitigation Grant Program, this is money that is sent by FEMA to the \nStates following disasters such as floods, tornadoes, or hurricanes \nthat have affected so many of our constituents this year. The \nassistance follows, and it is in addition to the immediate disaster \nassistance for cleanup and reconstruction. This money is for hazard \nmitigation. It is used to reduce the likely devastation of future \ndisasters by buying out flood-prone property or by flood-proofing, \nstabilizing buildings or other structures, building hurricane shelters, \nseismic retrofits for earthquake or shock absorption, and for drainage \nimprovements.\n  This money helps to reduce what it is going to cost us in the future \nfor other disasters, so it saves lives and it saves money in the long \nrun. These moneys are in addition to the moneys that go out for \nimmediate reconstruction.\n  In 1993, I and some other Senators led an effort here to ensure that \nthe grants would provide an additional 15 percent in FEMA money for \nwhatever was provided for both in public and individual assistance. So \nit has been at 15 percent since 1993. In 2003, that percentage was cut \nin half, to 7.5 percent. The bill before us today leaves that lower \nfunding level in place. This is totally inadequate. Let me give some \nexamples.\n  Following the Midwest floods of 1993, it became apparent that the \nthen-level of mitigation disaster assistance, which was at 10 percent, \nwhich was in the original Federal law, was not enough. Again, as I \nsaid, I and other Senators worked to increase this from 10 percent to \n15 percent. Keep in mind, that 10 percent was in the original law.\n  In 2003, that percentage was reduced to 7.5 percent. Since we \nincreased that to 15 percent, there has been tremendous success in \nreducing disaster risk in many communities all over the Nation. Many \ncommunities in the Midwest that suffered flood damage in 1993 saw a \nmajor reduction in applications for emergency aid for damage due to \nsubsequent floods, thanks to these hazard mitigation grants.\n  One example I have, and I have many, is in Louisa County, IA. They \nhave a floodwall that was designed to protect against a 500-year flood. \nBut when this levee is damp for an extended period of time, the water \nseeps through and damages property. In the flood of 1993, 275 homes \nwere damaged; 200 residents were evacuated. It was not feasible just to \ngo in and demolish all these houses. They have a lack of affordable \nhousing in that area. But luckily, with these mitigation funds, a local \nentity stepped in, used the hazard mitigation funding to move and \nrefurbish the salvageable houses, and to protect them from future \nflooding.\n  This repeated itself in 2001, but because we had used the hazard \nmitigation funds we avoided more than $1.2 million in losses that would \notherwise have occurred. How do we know that? Because that is what \noccurred almost 10 years earlier in the flood of 1993. That is what we \nwere just talking about in terms of money. But I remind my colleagues \nthat these savings do not include the noneconomic heartbreak, stress, \nand trauma that goes along with losing your home, family pictures, all \nyou have worked for, overnight. That is why I was so dismayed to see \nthe 15-percent level reduced to 7.5 percent in the 2003 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill.\n  Some colleagues may have concern about amending the Stafford Disaster \nRelief Act on an appropriations bill that we have before us. I assure \nyou, this amendment only restores a cut that was made in a previous \nappropriations bill.\n  Also, for my colleagues who may not be here but may be watching this \non their sets in their office, I also want to note that the House has \nalready passed this restoration. The House of Representatives has \nalready restored the hazard mitigation funds from 7.5 percent to 15 \npercent. So, again, as we have seen what has happened, especially the \ndevastation we have had in Florida, we really do need to make sure we \nhave not only the funds to respond but to mitigate in the future.\n  I hope Florida is spared another hurricane, but we know that \nhurricanes will hit Florida sometime in the future. That is just where \nthe hurricane track goes.\n  I want to read a quote from the Wall Street Journal on August 16 of \nthis year from Frank Reddish, the Dade County emergency management \ncoordinator, referring to Hurricane Charley:\n\n       Anyone looking at this can clearly see that Charley was a \n     pretty good terrorist. He did a much better job than al-Qaida \n     ever could.\n\n  I am all for doing everything I can to protect our country against \nterrorism. But we also must protect against future floods, hurricanes, \ntornadoes, earthquakes. One of the best ways we do that is through \nhazard mitigation; to do things that will prevent the kind of damage \nthat will occur in these future catastrophes. So think about it as \ncombating terrorism. We don't wait until the terrorists strike. We do \nthings beforehand. That is what hazard mitigation is for, to protect us \nbeforehand. Don't just wait until the event occurs but let's go ahead \nand invest in making sure our houses, our facilities, our public \nutilities and others are, to the best extent possible--after they have \nbeen damaged in a catastrophe--to make sure they have the funds \nnecessary so if such a catastrophe strikes again, they will not be \nsubject to such terrible losses.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand the amendment proposed by \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, it would change the percentage by \nwhich mitigation funds are calculated to be due from the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. The Disaster Relief Fund, which we \nreplenished with a supplemental appropriations bill just yesterday with \nthe approval of $2 billion of new money, is an example of the stress \nthat has been placed on this fund because of recent disasters in \nFlorida and elsewhere. To refresh the memory of Senators, the program \ninvolves a disaster relief and mitigation funding program. The Disaster \nRelief Fund provides individual assistance to those who have been \ndisplaced from their homes in disasters.\n  It helps pay for food, shelter, and other emergency needs. FEMA--the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency--administers this program after a \ndisaster. As I understand, approval of the amendment would increase the \nfunds FEMA has to pay out of the Disaster Assistance Fund. I am, \nfrankly, not clear in my own mind exactly how this works, but I am \nadvised this is\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\ngoing to have the net effect of more than doubling the Federal \nobligation in disaster assistance. Every State that is declared by the \nPresident to be eligible for disaster assistance has its damages \nassessed and becomes eligible for mitigation money. I am told the fund \nthat pays for mitigation benefits is like buying out homes which are in \nflood-prone areas or building retaining walls to help in the event of \nthe next disaster. These are important efforts to undertake so future \ndisasters will not result in the same kind of damage and will be \nmitigated or lessened, reduced. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \ncalculates that 7\\1/2\\ percent over and above the amount of Federal \ndisaster assistance it has provided and gives that money to States.\n  In the past 2 years and in this year's Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, there is another form of mitigation funding which \nis available to States called the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund \nadministered by FEMA, to which States can submit competitive \napplications to receive mitigation funding before a disaster strikes. \nAny State, regardless of it having been designated a Presidential \ndisaster, can submit a request and have it judged on its merits.\n  We have attempted to balance the various kinds of disaster assistance \navailable to victims and available to States in this bill. We support \nthe President's effort to offer assistance to communities before and \nafter disaster strikes. It allows communities to raise risk awareness \nto help reduce the Nation's disaster losses through better mitigation \nplanning, and the implementation of plan and cost-effective measures. \nWe think at this point it is not the responsible course of action to \ndouble the formula and increase the amount States are going to be \npermitted and can claim from FEMA and not increasing the amount of \nmoney that is available to FEMA to pay out the money. This is language \nchange. It is actually bill language. It is authorizing language on an \nappropriations bill. It doesn't belong on this bill. It should be \nconsidered first by the Environment and Public Works Committee, the \ncommittee that has legislative jurisdiction of these programs. I \nunderstand that committee has a bill that has been sent over to the \nHouse that deals with this issue. We should await the advice and \ncounsel and action of the authorizing committee before we act on this \nproposal.\n  Because of those reasons, I urge the Senate to reject this amendment. \nI think it is clearly authorizing language, and it will be my \nintention--I don't want to cut off the right of any Senator to speak--\nto move to table the Harkin amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. \nBut I will refrain from doing so until I am assured that Senators who \nwant to speak on the amendment have a right to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend the managers of the bill for \nthe way this bill is proceeding. But I want to make a plea to the \nSenate. We have been informed that the FBI, the Customs Service, the \nImmigration Service, and other portions of the Homeland Security \nDepartment are running short of money, as so many agencies are \nconcerned with the problems of homeland security now. I consider this \nbill to be the second most important bill before our Appropriations \nCommittee. We finished the Department of Defense bill which is the \nfirst bill. It was the bill to fund those who are serving in uniform \nabroad when we have forces involved in wartime circumstances. We did \nact on the Defense bill before the last recess. We are going to be in a \nperiod next week which is a very confusing period. It is a period \njustifiably recognizing a Jewish holiday that is coming up, but it is a \nsituation I think that requires us to consider the time factor on this \nbill.\n  I am rising tonight to tell the Senate that it is my hope we will \nfinish this bill by next Tuesday. If we get this bill passed by the \nSenate next Tuesday night, we can get it to the House and we can get \nconferees appointed and the various conference staff who are not \ninvolved with the holiday we are going to observe will be able to work \non the bill. I hope we can get this bill to the President before the \nend of this month. September 30 is the end of this fiscal year. These \nagencies need this money. The agencies of the Homeland Security \nDepartment need this money by October 1.\n  I plead with the Senate to recognize the time factor and cooperate \nwith the managers of the bill. It is entirely possible for us to finish \nthis bill by next Tuesday as far as I can see.\n  I again congratulate particularly my good friend, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, for the way this bill is being handled.\n  But please consider the effect of not getting this bill passed in \ntime for the money being available on October 1. A continuing \nresolution will have to be before us sometime next week, but it will \ncontinue the Department of Homeland Security at the existing level. \nThis bill represents an increase in money for various agencies in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and that money is necessary by October \n1. It is a security matter now. It is not a matter of adopting a \nresolution for departments that can operate for at least a month or so \non the continuing resolution. This committee cannot and should not \noperate on a continuing resolution. I urge the Senate to help us get \nthis bill passed by next Tuesday night.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full \ncommittee, my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, for his kind \ncomments about managing this bill. I appreciate his urging also that \nthis bill be completed on Tuesday. We think that can be done. We think \nwith the cooperation of the Senate it will be done.\n  I am now advised the amendment of the Senator from Iowa does contain \ngeneral legislation, and because of that a point of order might be \nsustained under rule XVI. Therefore, I raise a point of order under \nrule XVI that the amendment constitutes general legislation on an \nappropriations measure and is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has an \namendment. This may be a good time for him to offer that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, at the direction of the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment 3610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator calling up \nhis amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3610\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 3610.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency to conduct an investigation of the Shockoe Creek drain field in \nRichmond, Virginia, to determine means of preventing future damage from \n                  floods and other natural disasters)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INVESTIGATION OF SHOCKOE CREEK DRAIN FIELD, \n                   RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.\n\n       As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     shall conduct an investigation of the Shockoe Creek drain \n     field in Richmond, Virginia, to determine means of preventing \n     future damage in that area from floods and other natural \n     disasters.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand also my colleague, Senator Warner from Virginia.\n  This amendment has to do with directing the Director of Federal \nEmergency Management Agency to conduct an investigation of the Shockoe \nCreek drain field in Richmond in order to prevent future damage from \nfloods and other natural disasters. This amendment does not call for \nany additional spending.\n\n  Many Members may not be aware that, less than a week ago, remnants of \nTropical Storm Gaston pounded the\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nRichmond area with rain and flooded many areas, leaving eight people \ndead. This storm dumped more than a foot of rain on the Shockoe Bottom \narea of Richmond, the oldest historic part of Richmond. The flood \nwaters rose about 8 feet in 15 to 20 minutes, finally leaving about 20 \nblocks of the low lying bottom swamped in up to 10 feet of muddy \nrunoff.\n  In this area of very old brick buildings, most thought they were \nprotected from the James River flooding by a flood wall. What actually \nhappened was the rising waters came from the land side down Church \nStreet, as opposed from the river side and flooded this whole Shockoe \nValley watershed.\n  I was there Monday and saw these business owners who were trying to \nshovel and take out buckets of mud and disinfecting their shops. It is \na lot of work. At least 150 families had to leave homes that were \ndeclared uninhabitable. The floods destroyed over 35 various small \nbusinesses that had invested and renovated a lot of the old historic \nstructures. There were 25 restaurants out of business that are going to \nhave to clean up and disinfect and will need health certificates to \nreopen. Dozens and dozens of businesses are condemned, most of them \ncondemned because of wrecked electrical systems. Actually, several \nbuildings were even demolished. It will take a great deal of work, a \ngreat deal of patience, and a great deal of risk-taking for this \nwonderful historical area that had been recently renovated and \nrejuvenated to actually come back to life again.\n  Most of the people, all but one, did not have flood insurance because \nthe insurance folks and the lenders all figured with a flood wall you \ndo not have to worry. One in particular, Sosie Hublitz, owner of the \nKitchen Table, had to shut down because of the terrible flooding at her \nrestaurant. All her life savings went into opening the business, plus \n$200,000 in loans. She still owes half of that and is worried about \ngetting deeper in debt. Hublitz didn't have flood insurance.\n  So there will be added costs. I am sure the insurers and the lenders \nwill have added concerns before future investments can be made.\n  The most encouraging aspect was the spirit of the people in this \npainstaking process, as tedious and tough as it is to be cleaning all \nthat mud out, worrying about the mold and the bacteria, yet they still \nhave a great spirit.\n  These folks were concerned about such an act occurring again, with so \nmuch rain falling that quickly. This Shockoe area has a drainage system \ndesigned to prevent this problem. In the 1920s, a 27-foot culvert was \nput in underground to replace Shockoe Creek. Obviously that did not do \nthe job in 2004.\n  The point of all of this is to help out these folks in this natural \nbasin, this historical basin, for one of the oldest cities in the \nUnited States, to see if this is an adequate drainage system in the \nlikelihood that such rainfall would occur again. Sometimes when there \nare floods--and we see this same thing in the mountain areas--after \nthere is a flood, the river beds end up being so filled with rocks and \ndebris that it takes less rain the next time for those rivers or those \ncreeks to leave their banks.\n  One of the things we really must do, and it makes a great deal of \nsense to me, is to determine whether this 27-foot culvert that conducts \nthe water from the Shockoe Valley into the James River a few hundred \nyards to the south actually is sufficiently adequate for that area. It \ndoes serve as a stormwater drain. It has worked well since the 1920s. \nClearly, attention should be focused on this culvert and the basin \ndrainage system.\n  The people have amazing spirit. They will keep fighting. But it is \nimportant not only to help them--and the Small Business Administration \nis doing a great job, as is FEMA and all the folks at the local and \nState level--but beyond making sure they clean up and disinfect and get \nback on their feet and get their businesses back running, we think it \nis very important that we direct steps toward preventing any future \ntragedies or disasters. I'm sure the Corps of Engineers will \nundoubtedly be involved when FEMA coordinates this effort.\n\n  We have introduced this amendment, Senator Warner and myself, \ndirecting FEMA to conduct an investigation in the Shockoe drain field \nto prevent future damage from flood and natural disasters. This is a \nvery logical, appropriate way to plan for the future and prevent such \ndamage and all the costs of repair.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I thank my colleagues for also \npassing the supplemental for FEMA earlier this week which will also \nhelp the Small Business Administration take care of those not only in \nFlorida but also Virginia and others who have been harmed by these \ndisastrous floods and storms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The people of \nVirginia will appreciate it. I know the folks at FEMA will also do the \nright job in the analysis of the Shockoe Valley.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator for \nhis explanation of his bill and for his initiative in calling attention \nto the needs of the area of his State in need of special attention from \nFederal agencies, particularly designing some way to help make sure \nthis kind of disaster does not occur--if it is possible to do that--\nwith engineering changes or other mitigation efforts, particularly in \nthe Richmond area which was so seriously devastated and damaged \nrecently by flooding.\n  We think the Senator has a good suggestion and we are willing to \nrecommend the Senate adopt this amendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia had requested the \nyeas and nays; does he wish to withdraw that request?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I am happy for it to be passed on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been advised that the other side \nwants to look at the amendment. I am happy for anyone who wants to look \nat the amendment to look at it. It was very coherently explained by the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been advised that the other side \nwants to look at the amendment. I am happy for anyone who wants to look \nat the amendment to look at it.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       The Tragedy And Atrocities That Occurred In Beslan, Russia\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I believe it is safe to say that later on \nin the evening the Senate will consider and I am certain approve a \nresolution of support and solidarity with the Russian people over their \nrecent tragedy and atrocities that have occurred in Beslan. I am \nprivileged to have the opportunity to cosponsor that resolution, and I \ncongratulate the leaders on both sides of the aisle because I believe \nit will be cleared.\n  I know it is not the desire of the chairman that we have a lengthy \ndebate on it, and I certainly understand that.\n  All of our hearts break at what happened, and although we have seen \nterrorists at low points before, to hold hundreds of children hostage \nfor days, to deprive them of food and water, to terrorize them, to \nignore their pleas for mercy, to shoot them in the back when they are \ntrying to escape when it can achieve no possible end, is a level of \ndepravity I do not believe I ever witnessed in my lifetime.\n  Like all who watched the horrific coverage of the school hostage \nsituation in Russia last week, I was shocked by the images of \nfrightened children and their parents inside the gymnasium of School \nNumber One, surrounded by several hooded hostage-takers and plastic \nexplosives hanging from basketball hoops. On September 1, more than \n1,100 parents, students, and\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nteachers who had gathered for the first day of school were taken \nhostage by approximately 30 terrorists who had rigged the school with \nexplosives. On September 3, Russian troops and the Beslan hostage-\ntakers exchanged gun fire, a bomb exploded collapsing the roof of the \nschool, the terrorists began killing the hostages, and massive loss of \nlife ensured. This horrendous terrorist action left at least 335 people \ndead, many of them children, as well as hundreds more severely wounded \nand over 200 unaccounted for, who are most likely dead.\n  I join my colleagues, Senators Daschle, Frist and Santorum, in \ncondemning this despicable terrorist act and in expressing our \ncondolences to the Russian people and in particular to those families \nwho lost their loved ones in the Beslan school tragedy. We commend the \ncontinuing efforts of the U.S. Government in providing humanitarian and \nmedical assistance to the people of the Russian Federation.\n  The terror last week at the school in Beslan is the same face of evil \nwe saw in the U.S. on September 11. The terrorists held children, \nparents and teachers hostage for more than 2 days without food, water \nor medicine. Without conscience or mercy, the terrorists shot children \nin their backs as they fled for safety. These killers seek to terrorize \nthe entire civilized world. They have no regard for human life, even \nthe lives of children. Today, America stands together with the Russian \npeople more resolved than ever to win the war against terrorism.\n  I know the Senate will vote unanimously for the resolution. I am \nconfident that because of incidents such as this in Beslan and around \nthe world, Americans and civilized people everywhere will draw \nincreased resolution to lead and win the war against terrorism that has \nreally become a war of civilization against barbarians, like those who \ncommitted these atrocities.\n  I thank the Senate for giving me a moment to give my remarks.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the Allen amendment be laid \naside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3615\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3615.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate $100,000,000 to establish an identification \nand tracking system for HAZMAT trucks and a background check system for \n                      commercial driver licenses)\n\n       On page 13, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n\n                         Ground Transportation\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Transportation Security \n     Administration to establish an identification and tracking \n     system for HAZMAT trucks and a background check system for \n     commercial driver licenses, $100,000,000.\n       On page 2, line 17, strike $245,579,000 and insert \n     ``$175,579,000''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment, which I am told, for my \ncolleagues' benefit, will not be voted on tonight but will be voted on \nat some point late Monday afternoon, is a very important amendment. It \ndeals with truck security.\n  As we go forward in the war on terrorism, we learn more and more. One \nof the things we have learned only in the last 6 months is that the \npreferred method of destruction of al-Qaida is truck bombs. They have \nused these bombs in the past, but we were given a new sense of urgency \nabout al-Qaida's use of truck bombs from intelligence that has been \npicked up in the last 6 months and subsequently made public.\n  Truck bombs, unfortunately, can create tremendous destruction. We saw \nthat in Oklahoma City. At the same time they are very easy to put \ntogether. Ammonium nitrate, which can easily be made into an explosive \ndevice, is readily available. Then all you need is a truck filled with \nammonium nitrate or some other kind of hazardous material and that \ntruck can cause huge amounts of destruction.\n  In our brave new post-9/11 world, we have to guard against all forms \nof terrorism. It is not sufficient to say because on 9/11 the \nterrorists struck through the air that we can ignore other ways they \nmight seek to hurt us. That means we have to tighten security at the \nports and on the rails. It also means we have to look at truck \nsecurity. Unfortunately, probably of all the areas where terrorists \nmight hurt us, we are doing the least in terms of truck security. We \npay some lipservice to it, but I am not aware of very much the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is doing at all in terms of defending \nus against truck security.\n  One may ask: What can be done? For one thing, we can put some \nlimitation on how ammonium nitrate, especially in large amounts, is \ndistributed. That is not the purpose of this amendment. I might be \nintroducing further legislation in that regard. But second, we can be \nmuch more careful about trucks, particularly trucks that carry \nhazardous materials.\n  Let me say that right now we do virtually nothing. Only a few months \nago, a truck with hazardous material was found missing in Pennsauken, \nNJ, neighboring the State of New York. They still haven't found the \ntruck. Perhaps the truck was lost. Perhaps more likely it was stolen. \nBut God forbid someone who might be part of a terrorist organization \ntook that truck and is lying in wait to do something that would be \nterrible and despicable.\n  Of course, we know a truck bomb struck the people in Oklahoma. It was \nused by McVeigh. This is not something we are unaware of. Truck bombs \nhave been used by al-Qaida in other parts of the world. Again, I \nunderscore the fact that trucks are sort of the preferred method of \nterrorism for al-Qaida.\n  We have lots of these trucks available in America. According to the \n1997 Census of Interstate Commerce, 740,000 hazardous material \nshipments travel each day by truck in America. In the United States, \n50,000 trips are made each day by gasoline tankers, many of which hold \nas much fuel as a Boeing 757. They often end with a late-night delivery \nto a deserted gas station. Experts say that trucks carrying chemicals \nsuch as ammonium nitrate, chlorine, or cyanide form even a more deadly \nrisk. Imagine if al-Qaida or another terrorist organization took 10 of \nthese trucks, parked them near a large, tall building in 10 of our \nlargest cities and exploded them all at once, something that would \nhardly be inconceivable right now. The amount of lives lost might even, \nGod forbid, exceed those lost on 9/11, and fear would descend across \nthis country.\n\n  We have to be doing more. In December of 2002, almost 2 years or more \nthan a year and a half ago, I called on Federal officials to rectify \nthis problem. The first thing that I asked be done is that background \nchecks for truck drivers certified to carry hazardous materials be \nundertaken. The TSA announced it would do so on May 2, 2003, 5 months \nlater. But despite this progress, much more work needs to be done. \nThere are two particular areas that we think greatly need improvement. \nThose are the things we are asking for tonight.\n  The first is tracking technology for trucks. It is very easy. You can \nbuy a car and pay a couple hundred bucks more and have a GPS system \nwhich tells exactly where the vehicle is. Wouldn't it make sense that \nevery truck carrying hazardous material was required to have such a GPS \nsystem? That would mean if the truck were stolen, if the truck were \ntaken to a far different location than where it should be and the \ncompany wished to find out where it was, we could find it in a minute.\n  Ironically, a country far less developed than ours requires this for \nall its trucks--Brazil. There is a GPS system on every one of its \ntrucks. In fact, the companies that do it there do it not to combat \nterrorism but, rather, to deal with theft. They actually make money.\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nThe point is this is feasible. It works. It is simple. It is hardly pie \nin the sky. It probably costs about $200 to install in each truck. I \nwould be happy, if once TSA started implementing this for individual \ntruck drivers who might feel that $200 is too much, even though a rig \ncosts much more than 100 times that, to have the Federal Government \npay, although we don't provide that in our legislation. We do require \nthat any truck carrying hazardous material have a GPS system installed. \nThere are many companies that want to put this in place but are waiting \nuntil Government rules are in place. Thus far there are no Government \nrules.\n  Second, there ought to be a HAZMAT database. Just as we plot the path \nof thousands of planes in general aviation and commercial aviation and \nwhere they go and we know that if they are off course, something is \nawry and our air traffic control system deals with that, we should do \nthe same for hazardous materials.\n  The bottom line is, any truck with a hazardous material would simply \nfile a little plan as to where it was going and what deliveries it was \nmaking. And then again, if the truck was stolen or went off course, we \nwould know. In Brazil they have a system when the truck goes too far \noff course, the truck stalls and can't be driven.\n  We could actually do that here and the money that we are providing \nwould be within the ambit of the Homeland Security Department to do \njust that. But with this database, if a truck carrying hazardous \nmaterial would be off course, we would know, and there would be a much \ngreater chance that some kind of action could be taken before the truck \nwas used for terrorism.\n  As for the background checks of those certified to carry hazardous \nmaterials, again, I have been pushing the TSA to do this. They have \nsaid they are going to do it. They have delayed it several times, and \nthey have not completed doing it yet. But we urge them to do that as \nwell.\n  The hour is late. I don't want to hold up you or the President of the \nSenate or other colleagues. People will have the weekend to read this \nlegislation. Again, it is a rather small amount of money, $100 million. \nWe do offset it. We take money from the human resources account--the \nsame $100 million--so this doesn't increase costs. The bottom line is \nvery simple: On truck security, a lot more must be done.\n  The amendment I have will help move us in that direction. This is a \ndanger that we face in this country, which we have done virtually \nnothing about, and we could be moving, for a rather small amount of \nmoney, toward making ourselves far more secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We appreciate the Senator from New York bringing this to \nthe attention of the Senate. We know there is a tracking system in \neffect--but we are not sure it is as inclusive as he suggests we need \nit to be--for trucks that carry hazardous material. They try to keep up \nwith that. They have a system in place. We are glad to have the chance \nto review this suggestion, and we will do that and hope the Senate will \nwithhold action on this amendment tonight, and we can call it up \ntomorrow, or later, whatever the leaders end up deciding we will do in \nterms of further action on this bill.\n  We are at a point where I think we are close to winding up the action \non this bill today. We have had a full day of activity. A number of \namendments have been presented and voted on. We appreciate the \ncooperation of all Senators in letting us know the identity of the \namendments that were to be offered. We are going to continue to work \nhard to get this bill finished by sometime on Tuesday of next week. \nThat is our goal, and I think we will be able to achieve that goal.\n  One item we hope to be able to clear has been presented to the Senate \nby the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, related to a survey in the \nState of Virginia on a mitigation issue surrounding flooding in the \nRichmond area. It is my hope that we will be able to get that passed, \nif we can, by a voice vote tonight, and then maybe go out if there is \nno further business.\n  I yield to my friend from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3610\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the leadership \nwants the Schumer amendment to be one of the votes we are going to have \nMonday evening. Also, it is my understanding, having spoken to the \nmanager of the bill and his staff, that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and the Office of Management and Budget have reviewed \namendment No. 3610, offered by the Senator from Virginia, and they have \nboth said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be in a \nposition to conduct an investigation of this creek drainfield in \nRichmond, VA; and this has been signed off on by FEMA, as I have \nindicated, and also by the OMB.\n  That being the case, even though on our side maybe there are people \nwho think this is not something that is normally done, if FEMA and OMB \nsigned off on it, which they have, we would be wasting the Senate's \ntime by having a vote on it. That having been said, I say there is no \nfurther debate on this side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask that we agree to the Allen \namendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be made \npending.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3610) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Can we agree that my amendment will be voted on on \nMonday afternoon when we resume voting?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I think that is the understanding.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the Senator from New York, as I \nindicated, members of the leadership are lining up votes for Monday \nand, in all likelihood, the Senator's would be the first vote. We don't \nhave a unanimous consent agreement to that effect but----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is consistent with my understanding of the schedule \nas well.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have done about all we can do tonight. \nThat is my understanding. I say to the manager of the bill that \ntomorrow, it is my understanding, there is an amendment to be offered \nby the majority. I cannot remember by what Senator, but someone told me \nabout it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Frist, intends to offer an amendment tomorrow morning. So we \nwill have that before the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. On this side, Senator Corzine is willing to offer an \namendment, Senator Lautenberg is willing to offer one, and maybe the \ndistinguished Democratic leader will be ready to offer one. Whenever we \ncome in, there will be opportunities to offer these amendments. It is \nmy understanding that the Senate is not going to stay until a late \nhour. If those amendments are offered, we will have plenty to do Monday \nnight, unless there is some agreement on amendments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think this is a good plan. The Senate \nhas done good work today. I think the outline the Senator from Nevada \nhas given us is a thoughtful way to handle the bill. We will be here \ntomorrow morning and continue to make progress on the bill. We will be \nready to cooperate with all Senators to the fullest extent possible.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the minority whip yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I didn't hear exactly what has been said about the plan. \nThere was another amendment Senator Clinton and I were going to offer. \nI was going to cover it this evening, but she could not be here because \nof the illness of her husband.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, there will be an opportunity to offer \nother amendments next week. He is on the list.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask whether there be objection to \nproceeding to the measure at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The message is before the Senate.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask, then, unanimous consent that the Senate concur in \nthe House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is a much happier day for me than it \nwas 1 year ago. A year ago yesterday, my son, Garrett Lee Smith, took \nhis life. Today it is his birthday, and today my heart is not filled \nwith sadness but with joy because the Congress of the United States has \nacted with near unanimity, an overwhelming vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, Republicans and Democrats alike, and for a second time \nnow the Senate, without objection, 100 strong, Republican and Democrat \nalike, has acted not as partisans but as Americans on an issue that \nafflicts families all over our land, the issue of mental health, of \ndepression among our youth that often, too often, even at epidemic \nlevels, can lead to suicide.\n  This has been for me a very long and difficult year. I am grateful \nfor the support of family and friends and, especially here now, my \ncolleagues. I had many thoughts in mind when this occurred because I \nwas raised to believe that no success can compensate for failure in \none's home. And when my son took his life, I felt the ultimate failure. \nYet I have come to learn from colleagues, some of them, like the \nleader, medical experts, others like Mike DeWine, who has suffered much \nin his family through the loss of a daughter; Pete Domenici, who has \nhelped me to understand the lethal nature of mental illnesses, and so \nmany more.\n  I have been buoyed up and strengthened sufficient to carry on my \npublic responsibility and try to find from the loss of my son some new \nmeaning in his life. Today the Congress has acted on his birthday. My \nwife Sharon and I are profoundly thankful to all of you. What we have \ndone today is to pass a bill that will enable the States, encourage the \nStates, incentivize the States to have youth suicide prevention \nprograms to, with parental permission, give testing to identify, under \nthe strictest of privacy, those children who may have a predisposition \ntoward depression and suicide.\n\n  We have given the incentive to the States to set up college \nbackstops, counseling, intervention measures, to help where this \nepidemic is most acutely felt, and that is on American college \ncampuses. We are setting up a national repository of information \nthrough SAMSHA, where the best ideas from the 50 laboratories that are \nthe 50 United States can be brought together and shared so intervention \ncan be more effectively made to save more of America's sons and \ndaughters.\n  When this bill left the Senate, I thought it was in perfect form. But \nI learned something about a bicameral legislature in working with my \ncolleagues in the House. They made it better. They had many good \nsuggestions. And I feel it appropriate to say that while some I am \nentirely in agreement with and others I would have preferred not be \nthere, I support the bill as it has come from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I owe a great deal of thanks to some specific individuals. If you \nwill bear with me, Mr. President, I would like to thank some of them \nand also note for those colleagues who may be concerned about parental \nnotification precedence that the House was willing to put in there \nprovisions that this tougher parental notification is applicable just \nto this bill and in no way affects No Child Left Behind legislation.\n  I need to say thank you to some very significant people without whom \nthis bill would not have passed. First, I want to thank Chairman Joe \nBarton, the Congressman from Texas, who chairs the House Commerce \nCommittee. I say to all the world, and particularly his constituents, \nhe is a man of his word. He had tremendous pressure on him not to \nproceed with this, but he gave me his word. He is good for it. He \nworked with me. He demanded much of me. We gave much. But under \nconsiderable pressure he stood up against it and made this to pass.\n  To Speaker Hastert and Leader DeLay, thank you for your permission, \nthank you for making this happen, allowing it to happen, and also being \ngood to the commitments that were made to me and other colleagues and \nto the White House.\n  I thank my House sponsors, Congressman Bart Gordon of Tennessee, \nCoach Tom Osborne of Nebraska. Coach Osborne knows something of young \npeople and their struggles. He was wonderful to work with. Danny Davis, \nof Illinois, spoke eloquently about this bill on the Senate floor last \nevening. My own Congressman, Greg Walden, who helped to shuttle this \nthrough the House, I am profoundly thankful to him. I also note Earl \nBlumenauer and Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island were particularly \nhelpful to me in passing this legislation. I am grateful to them.\n  Senator Santorum--they call him a Pope over there--is regarded in \nvery exalted terms and a term of affection. He was unusually helpful in \nhelping me to make my way through the House membership and to get this \npassed.\n  Leader Frist, this would not happen without you. At every turn you \nhave been there for me and helped me to get through this year. Judd \nGregg, the chairman of our committee, with jurisdiction, was wonderful \nto make this possible and happen in the Senate. Mitch McConnell, your \nstaff, Leader Frist's staff, were very helpful. They went the extra \nmile back and forth from the House to Senate Chambers time and again \nfor me. I thank the staffs of all of these people who worked so hard.\n\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Kennedy have been unusual champions of this \nissue, and issues of mental health. They have been wonderful guides. \nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island helped to author a major provision.\n  Harry Reid, the Democratic whip, has been a stalwart and counseled me \nto take this and do that. I say to him, thank you, sir, for your help \nand your understanding of the issue of suicide.\n  I thank Leader Daschle as well because without his understanding that \nthis was not partisan this would not have happened. I am grateful to \nLeader Daschle.\n  I mentioned Mike DeWine. Mike is behind me and will speak to this \nissue. If you could package goodness in human form, it would look like \nMike DeWine.\n  I think most significantly for me has been the woman who sits to my \nright, Catherine Finley, who is a person of talent, tenacity, and \ntemperament sufficient to take a stand-alone bill, in a very short \nperiod of time, pass it through the Senate, the House, and back through \nthe Senate again. I am\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\neternally in her debt. And my wife joins me in those sentiments.\n  Finally, I thank George W. Bush, the President of the United States, \nand his staff at the White House, who have been with me from the \nbeginning and who have urged me on time and again to get this done and \nto get it to him. He has understood that this issue is part and parcel \nabout being compassionate and being conservative. I thank the President \nof the United States.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to read a letter that I think \nsays more eloquently than I can why this legislation is so necessary \nand why it has the prospect of doing so much good. I received this \nletter from a student at George Washington University in Washington, \nDC. She urged passage of this bill. Her name is Miss Meredith Jessup of \nSturgis, MI. She wrote this:\n\n       This past year I arrived in Washington, DC with a new \n     educational landscape set before me, convinced that I was \n     equipped with the essential skills I would need to survive \n     college. But I was in no way prepared when my close friend \n     and neighbor committed suicide by jumping to his death from \n     his dorm window.\n       The story that unfolded was his personal narrative of his \n     fight with depression and his constant feelings of \n     worthlessness. He openly wrote about how he had planned his \n     own suicide and about the frightened ideas of acting out his \n     plans. This young, brilliant person, never seen without a \n     smile on his face, had been secretly battling severe \n     depression for a year. None of his friends had had a clue and \n     he had never shared this with his family.\n       He was depressed and confused and I was scared and utterly \n     unprepared to know how to keep my friend alive. I was never \n     sure why he had chosen to confide this to me, but he made me \n     promise to keep his confidence. In the following days I \n     convinced him to accompany me to the university counseling \n     service.\n       Two weeks later I received another desperate call from him, \n     he was contemplating death at the dorm. I convinced him to \n     begin walking to meet me and we went to the hospital \n     emergency room. As I sat in the hospital waiting room, tears \n     streaming down my face, I prayed that the hospital would \n     admit my shattered friend for emergency counseling and \n     intervention. I was not a professional; friendship was the \n     only tool I could use to try to help him and as I sat at \n     his bedside I grabbed his hand and told him how I was \n     proud of his courage.\n       On Sunday, April 18, 2004, a week after his discharge from \n     the hospital, he called my cell phone once again. This time \n     his voice was barely recognizable, laden with sadness. He \n     called from his dorm room, four doors down from mine. ``I \n     don't want anyone to worry about me,'' he said. ``When you \n     wake up tomorrow, I want you to forget about anything that \n     happened today.'' As he kept repeating these lines over and \n     over again, it hit me like a load of bricks. He was going to \n     commit suicide. ``Good-bye . . . '' rang in my ears as he \n     hung up his phone.\n       I repeatedly tried to call his phone and pounded on his \n     door. Then the sound of emergency sirens flooded in from open \n     windows, and a harsh reality set in. He had jumped from the \n     balcony of his fourth floor window. My friend was dead at 19 \n     and I hadn't been able to save him.\n       Perhaps his condition was beyond anyone's help--friend, \n     family or trained professional. Perhaps there was more that \n     could have been done. In his case, however, we will never \n     know. The only thing for us to do after a tragedy like this \n     is to work to ensure others who are struggling do not face \n     the seemingly hopeless situation he had found.\n       On this, the three-month anniversary of my friend's death, \n     I am writing to thank you for championing the issue of youth \n     suicide prevention. I am writing to thank you for your \n     courageous efforts to help people struggling like my friend. \n     I applaud the courage it took for you to stand before your \n     Senate colleagues and reopen the emotional wounds that are \n     just below the surface from the suicide of your own son.\n       These wounds are all too familiar to me in the death of my \n     friend. He was one of five students of The George Washington \n     University to die this last school year in suicides or \n     preventable acts. Perhaps the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act \n     is a way that I can help others who are struggling on my \n     campus. This piece of legislation and the opportunities it \n     presents provide a way to create something good out of so \n     many tragedies. What I could not do for my friend perhaps can \n     be accomplished in an educational outreach and counseling \n     protocol program I plan to propose for GW, seeking funding \n     through your legislation.\n       I would like to personally thank you and other members of \n     the United States Senate for taking up this initiative to \n     help prevent suicide among America's youth. I would also like \n     to encourage members of the House of Representatives to pass \n     the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. By instituting the grant \n     program for America's universities, I hope to be a part of \n     alleviating the nation's third leading cause of death among \n     young people. It's the least I can do to honor the memory of \n     my friend. Our country cannot afford to lose to depression \n     the character and the substantial talents of young people \n     like him.\n\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for supporting this historic act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me congratulate but mostly thank my \nfriend and colleague from Oregon. We would not be here tonight without \nhim. It is true many people worked on this bill, but he is the one who \ngot us here. No one but my friend knows how many people he talked to \nand what he had to go through to get us to this point. I think everyone \non this floor knows it could not have been done without our colleague. \nHe did it. He did something that no one else could have done.\n  Our friend, my friend, suffered the worst tragedy--he and his wife \nSharon--that any couple, any family can suffer; that is, to lose a \nchild. They took that tragedy and resolved that they would do something \nso other families would not suffer as they have suffered.\n  I say to my friend that neither he nor anyone else in this Chamber \nwill ever know what families will be spared because of the action taken \nby the House and Senate and because of his hard work.\n  But the one thing we do know is, there will be many families who will \nbe spared what he and Sharon fought through. For that, we all should \nsay thank you. There will be many children out there who will not lose \ntheir lives, many families who will not suffer.\n  This bill is a wonderful, living tribute to their son Garrett Smith. \nIf we do our job, not only this year, not only this moment, but in the \nyears ahead in properly funding this, it will remain year after year \nafter year a wonderful living tribute to him. It will remain also a \nliving tribute to all the young children who have lost their lives over \nthe years.\n  I thank my colleague. On behalf of all the people and families who \nwill be spared and all the children whose lives will be saved--and we \nwill never know who they are--he has done something that is very \nwonderful. He has taken his sorrow and grief, taken the position God \nhas given him and the people of his State have given him and has made \nsomething wonderful out of it. It is, in fact, a wonderful tribute to \nhis son, a tribute to the love he has for his son.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues Senators \nGordon Smith, Chris Dodd, Mike DeWine and Jack Reed in support of the \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. I thank them all for their tireless \nefforts to see this legislation enacted.\n  I especially thank Senator Smith for his courage in helping us \nunderstand this rising problem that for so long has been misunderstood. \nThe legislation we are passing today is an important first step we must \ntake--we know we must take--to help our troubled young people \ncontemplating suicide.\n  Youth suicide affects us all. And while we also understand that no \nwords can heal the deep pain or replace the great loss of an anguished \nchild we love, we know we can do better. We can work to prevent the \nkind of debilitating despair that leads young person to end their lives \nand to let them know that there are other options. There are people out \nthere who care. You are not alone.\n  Make no mistake, we are truly in the middle of an epidemic of teen \nsuicide. Suicide is now the third leading cause of death among \nadolescents. And while the years of lost potential and productive \nliving are never really captured in the statistics, we know the death \nof a young person has a devastating and long-lasting effect on family, \nfriends, and the whole community.\n  To the youth of America this bill has a simple message--help is on \nthe way. We have heard your pleas for help and we are acting. And it is \nparticularly important at a time when cash-strapped States are cutting \nfunds for many vital services.\n  This legislation will give grants to States to develop youth suicide \nprevention programs in settings ranging from schools to foster care \nhomes to juvenile justice settings, to substance abuse and mental \nhealth treatment and prevention centers. It gives States the \nflexibility to target resources and set goals. It gives priority to \nfunding entities with experience delivering these kinds of services and \nensures that 85 percent of every dollar spent goes toward direct\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nprevention efforts--toward saving lives.\n  It is appropriate that we are passing this legislation just as \nmillions of our young people are headed off to college for another \nsemester. We know that college is a place where young people can expand \ntheir horizons and learn so much about themselves and the world around \nthem. It is a time of great opportunity, but also a time of great \nchallenge for many young people. Away from home for the first time, \nwith new and enormous pressures to succeed, many struggle with feelings \nof depression, which in the most extreme cases lead to thoughts of \nsuicide.\n  Thanks to the efforts of Senator Dodd, this legislation will increase \nthe presence of counseling programs on college campuses across the \ncountry. It will allow colleges to conduct education seminars, operate \nlife-saving hotlines, train other students to recognize and counsel \ntheir struggling peers, and link colleges and universities that do not \nhave mental health services with health care providers that can help.\n  The program authorized under this bill recognizes that colleges and \nuniversities have a role to play in funding prevention efforts, and so \ndoes the Federal Government. For every dollar a school contributes to \nthe health and well-being of their students, we contribute the same. It \nis the right thing to do, and it will save lives at campuses across the \ncountry.\n  This legislation will also create a new national center to monitor, \ncoordinate and assist our national suicide prevention efforts. This \nnational coordinating mechanism is long overdue and it will make a \nworld of difference.\n  This bill will not solve the issue of youth suicide, but it \nrepresents real progress. We still have so much more to do to see that \nno child falls through the cracks, and that mental illnesses receive \nthe same insurance coverage and quality of care as physical illnesses.\n  But today we move forward with the Garrett Lee Smith Act, knowing \nthat we will have made a brighter tomorrow for many of our young \npeople.\n  Mrs. DODD. Mr. President, I believe that the legislation before us \ntonight--the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act--represents a positive step \ntowards finding concrete, comprehensive and effective remedies to the \nepidemic of suicide in our Nation's young people. I intend to support \nthis legislation, and I would like to thank my friend and colleague, \nGordon Smith, for all his tireless work and commitment in seeing this \nlegislation through.\n  By authorizing $82 million over 3 years, this bill seeks further to \nsupport the good work being done on the community level, the State \nlevel, and the Federal level with regards to youth suicide early \nintervention and prevention in four principal ways.\n  First, it establishes a new grant initiative for the further \ndevelopment and expansion of youth suicide early intervention and \nprevention strategies and the community-based services they seek to \ncoordinate in schools, mental health programs, substance abuse \nprograms, foster care systems, juvenile justice systems, and other \nyouth support organizations.\n  Second, it authorizes a dedicated technical assistance center to \nassist States, localities, tribes, and community service providers with \nthe planning, implementation, and evaluation of these strategies and \nservices.\n  Third, it establishes a new grant initiative to enhance and improve \nearly intervention and prevention services specifically designed for \ncollege-aged students.\n  And fourth, it creates a new inter-agency collaboration to focus on \npolicy development and the dissemination of data specifically \npertaining to youth suicide.\n  In July, the Senate took up this important bill and showed its \ncommitment to reduce the public and mental health tragedy of youth \nsuicide by passing it unanimously. I hoped at that time that the House \nwould see this strong example of bipartisanship and follow suit.\n  Regrettably, the House sent back the legislation containing a \ncontroversial provision authored by a small group of House Members with \nrather extreme views that has the potential actually to harm, rather \nthan help, suicide prevention and suicide awareness efforts.\n  Simply put, this provision sets a new precedent by erecting and \nmandating broad and ambiguous parental consent measures across all \n``school-based programs'' and non-medical services in our nation's \nschools--the very places where most children who are prone to suicidal \ntendencies first seek help. These measures are stigmatizing, untried, \nunproven, and arguably most importantly--undefined.\n  I am afraid that because of the ambiguity of this provision, we \ncannot know what ``prior written, informed consent'' really means, what \n``school-based programs'' will require this consent, or what emotional \nstate a child must be in to be considered for ``emergency'' care.\n  I am also afraid that because of this provision, we may not be able \nto guarantee that the services this bill funds will be made available \nto all children who need them. We may not be able to guarantee that a \nchild who is being abused by parents or guardians--an unfortunate \noccurrence that's unacceptably common in our country--will be able to \nobtain the appropriate mental health services he or she might \ndesperately need without the consent of that very same parent or \nguardian.\n  Nevertheless, the strengths of this bill outweigh its weaknesses. The \nGarrett Lee Smith Memorial Act is an important first step towards \nrecognizing the causes of this public and mental health tragedy and \nsupporting innovative and effective public and mental health \ninitiatives that reach every child and young adult in this country--\ncompassionate initiatives that given them encouragement, hope, and \nabove all, life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in this body, occasionally we have such \nmoments we share as colleagues, and they are probably more rare than \nany of us would like. The rarity is really centering around what we \nhave heard, and that is a juxtaposition, a coming together of probably \nthe deepest pain and sorrow and sadness with a real celebration, \nmanifested in part by the birthday of Garrett Lee Smith, but also the \ncelebration and accomplishment that can only be accomplished on the \nfloor of the Senate, working with the House, working with the President \nof the United States, where a piece of legislation is passed and you \nknow it is going to affect scores of lives, hundreds of lives, and \ndirectly and indirectly thousands of lives of people we will never see, \nfaces we will never see, but who will be touched in a way that is most \npowerful, and that is allowing them to lead fulfilling lives and not be \ncaptured by tragedy which, without this legislation, unfortunately \ntoday, where we are, would occur.\n  It is that oneness of humanity, of the ups and the downs, but the \ngoodness that comes out of it that this bill represents. The comments \nby both Senator Smith and Senator DeWine reflect it so well.\n  Senator Smith thanked so many of the people. I think it is very \nuseful to do because it allows them to be thanked, but more importantly \nfor others to see how hard it is, even with legislation that we know \nwill save lives and do good, to pass legislation in this body and in \nthe House. It takes a lot of people working together, unselfishly, to \nproduce a beautiful product such as has been passed minutes ago.\n  The act itself reaches out to a population we know is going through \nthe most dynamic changes at any stage in life, as the population \ntravels through adolescence, meeting changes and challenges, leaving \ncertain securities and insecurities of their past and being struck day \nin and day out. And up until passage of this bill, there was simply not \nhelp there, or it was not there when somebody reached out. The \nwonderful thing this bill does, through referral networks, through \nprograms to raise awareness of teen suicide and youth suicide, until we \nhave a program that trains faculty and others to respond when a student \ndoes reach out, things will simply not change. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  I want to in particular say thank you to our colleague Senator Gordon \nSmith. This is painful. This is a real triumph, which is the \ncelebratory part, but it is a difficult moment for him, for Sharon, for \nhis family. As he mentioned, it has been a year and a day ago since the \ndeath of his son Garrett. But\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\nsince that time, working through the grief and the sorrow and the \nsadness and the loss that can't even be described in words, he and \nSharon have consistently and eloquently and passionately spoken about \nnot their own needs but the needs for others, others who they don't \nknow but who they know exist, both today and tomorrow, those who suffer \nin some shape or form from some type of mental illness. No one can \nbring back a life that has been lost, but as those of us who have \nworked with our colleague Senator Smith and who have watched and who \nhave observed, he has helped teach us that through this process lives \ncan be saved.\n  It touches home to many of us. This particular bill addresses this \nsort of youth suicide, teen suicide. And those of us who have kids that \nage--my three boys are 18, 19, and 21 years of age--as Senator Smith \nmentioned, in that age group, suicide is the third leading cause of \ndeath. Thirty thousand people die each year as a result of suicide. \nThat is one person every 17 minutes. Suicide has touched Senator Smith \nand his family personally, other Members of this body. You don't \nrealize how many people it touches, as we have discussed before, until \nsomething tragic like this happens. But it touches people throughout \nthis body, indeed throughout the country.\n\n  This legislation helps turn those tragedies into direct assistance to \nthe benefit of others. This bill addresses suicide when it occurs at \nthe most tragic time of one's life. That is in those years where one is \nleaving, going through the teen years and adolescence and moving on to \nthose years of the prime of their life. We know, though, that with help \nand response, prevention occurs and lives are saved. There are early \ndetection, early prevention strategies, all of which this bill allows \nfor the first time in legislation to come alive. That is what the \nlegislation is all about. It is about helping those who are at risk, \nwho may or may not show symptoms or signs, but it helps bring those to \nthe surface with an appropriate response that will change the course \nthat has been so tragic in so many people's lives.\n  In closing, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act is a fitting tribute \nto Garrett Smith and the love his family has for him. Senator Smith has \nfought for its passage not only as a Senator but as a caring father. It \nhas passed this body unanimously, exactly as it should have.\n  I yield the floor, celebrating and in closing saying, happy birthday, \nGarrett Lee Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague from \nOregon, congratulations on turning a tragedy into a triumph. Garrett \nwould have been indeed proud of his father.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a kind of celebration. I \ncongratulate Senator Smith for his devotion to a cause. I also want \nSenator Smith to know how much Landra and I--and I say this without \nreservation--benefited from the funeral of their son. It is something \nLandra and I talked about because Gordon and Sharon, from the very \nbeginning, didn't hide the fact their son had taken his own life. I \nhave been to funerals where there have been suicides involved and that \nis something you don't talk about. They did it openly. Every speaker \nthere talked about Garrett, what a fine young man he was, and what a \nshame it was he took his own life. Our going to that funeral has \nbenefited us in so many different ways, because we grew spiritually as \na result of going to that funeral. There is nothing else we could have \ndone that day that was more important.\n  Let me say to my friend Gordon Smith, this is a time for celebration. \nBut I say that we have to continue to work on this issue. This is an \nauthorization bill. We need the appropriators to feel as we do and put \nmoney into this project. As good as this is--and we could never \nappropriate money unless we authorize it--this will be relatively \nmeaningless unless we can get the appropriators to put money into this \nprogram, so there can be grants and moneys to work for this dread \ndisease.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask that the Senate here assembled have a moment \nof silence, not only for Garrett Smith, which is the purpose of our \nbeing here tonight, but for the 31,000 people who during the last 12 \nmonths in America have taken their own lives. Garrett is the person who \nis a focal point of this calamity that is facing our country today. But \nbecause of the work of Gordon Smith, we are going to be able to move \nbeyond this. Hopefully, in the years to come, this will be a number \nthat won't be increasing but decreasing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate take a moment of silence at \nthis time on behalf of Garrett Smith and the thousands of people who \nhave died as a result of the taking of their own lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will observe a moment of silence.\n  [Moment of silence.]\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9023-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF NEVADA ``TOP COPS''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nto Officers Gary Casper, Clint Malburg, and Jim Mitchell and Sergeant \nRick Servoss on their selection for the National Association of Police \nOrganizations' Top Cops Awards.\n  The State of Nevada owes a great debt of gratitude to these brave \npolice officers, and to all other law enforcement officers who keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  On August 19, 2003, a sudden storm caused dangerous flash flooding in \nthe Las Vegas Valley. Sergeant Servoss and Officers Casper, Malburg and \nMitchell, all members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \nSearch and Rescue team, were deployed to help residents escape the \nflood waters.\n  Seven people were trapped in life-threatening situations, stranded on \ntop of their vehicles. Battling 60 mph winds and power lines, Sergeant \nServoss and Officer Casper maneuvered the team's helicopter only feet \nabove the roaring water. Suspended by a cable and winch operated by \nOfficer Mitchell, Officer Malburg retrieved the trapped individuals. \nThe team even saved four Las Vegas firefighters when rushing waters \novertook their fire engine.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Officers Casper and \nMitchell. That meeting reminded me how important it is to express our \nappreciation to police officers and other first responders. These \npeople put their lives on the line every day to protect our homes and \ncommunities. They will tell you that they are just doing their--jobs \nbut we must never forget that they are heroes.\n  When I attended law school, I worked as a U.S. Capitol Police officer \nto support my family. Today I still feel a bond with those who protect \nour communities. I am so grateful for the dedication and heroism of \nthese brave men.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9024-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n                          WAR ON PROLIFERATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the column ``An \nAll-Out War on Proliferation'' by Undersecretary of State John Bolton, \nwhich appeared in Tuesday's Financial Times of London, be printed in \nthe Record. This piece clearly articulates the Bush administration's \naggressive approach to stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The success of U.S.-led nonproliferation and \ncounterproliferation efforts over the last 4 years shows strong U.S. \nleadership on a global scale. It is also an illustration of just what \nwe are able to accomplish through U.S.-led multilateral, concrete \naction, rather than through inefficient bureaucracies and toothless \ntreaties.\n  I congratulate Undersecretary Bolton for his outstanding piece, and I \nstrongly recommend it to my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Sept. 7, 2004]\n\n                    An All-Out War on Proliferation\n\n                            (By John Bolton)\n\n       Some supporters of ``multi-lateralism'' prefer to talk \n     about its glories in the abstract rather than take action in \n     the here and now. The Bush administration's non-proliferation \n     policies fall into the latter category. Rather than rely on \n     cumbersome treaty-based bureaucracies, this administration \n     has launched initiatives that involve co-operative action \n     with other sovereign states to deny rogue nations and \n     terrorists access to the materials and knowhow needed to \n     develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Our policies show \n     that robust use of the sovereign authorities we and our \n     allies possess can produce real results.\n       The Bush administration is reinventing the non-\n     proliferation regime it inherited, crafting policies to fill \n     gaping holes, reinforcing earlier patchwork fixes, assembling \n     allies, creating precedents and changing perceived realities \n     and stilted legal thinking. The frontlines in our non-\n     proliferation strategy must extend beyond the well-known \n     rogue states to the trade routes and entities engaged in \n     supplying proliferant countries. This can properly be \n     described not as ``non-proliferation'', but as ``counter-\n     proliferation''. To accomplish this, we are making more \n     robust use of existing authorities, including sanctions, \n     interdiction and credible export controls. Most importantly, \n     we have taken significant steps to improve co-ordination \n     between sovereign states to act against proliferators.\n       As we learned from the unravelling of the clandestine \n     nuclear weapons network run by A.Q. Khan and from the Libyan \n     WMD programme, proliferators employ increasingly \n     sophisticated and aggressive measures to obtain WMD or \n     missile-related materials. They rely heavily on front \n     companies and illicit brokers in their quest for arms, \n     equipment, sensitive technology and dual-use goods.\n       In his September 2003 speech to the United Nations General \n     Assembly, George W. Bush proposed that the Security Council \n     pass a resolution calling on member states to criminalise WMD \n     proliferation, enact export controls and secure sensitive \n     materials within their borders. The resulting Security \n     Council Resolution 1540, unanimously adopted, achieved the \n     president's goals. Rather than requiring years negotiating \n     treaties and creating elaborate institutions, Resolution 1540 \n     rests on the notion that sovereign states are responsible for \n     writing and implementing laws closing the loopholes exploited \n     by black market WMD networks.\n       Among the most prominent of this administration's counter-\n     proliferation innovations is the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative (PSI). We say that PSI is ``an activity, not an \n     organization,'' in this case an activity designed to halt \n     trafficking in WMD, their delivery systems and related \n     materials. In developing PSI, our main goal has been a simple \n     one: to enable practical cooperation among states to help \n     navigate this increasingly challenging arena. The initiative \n     focuses on enhancing states' operational capabilities in the \n     intelligence, military and law enforcement arenas. More than \n     60 countries gathered in Poland just over a month ago to mark \n     PSI's one-year anniversary--and some notable successes. The \n     interception, in cooperation with the UK, Germany and Italy, \n     of the BBC China, a vessel loaded with nuclear-related \n     components, helped convince Libya that the days of \n     undisturbed accumulation of WMD were over, and helped unravel \n     A.Q. Khan's network.\n       Another important administration initiative is the Global \n     Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of \n     Mass Destruction, launched by the Group of Eight at its June \n     2002 summit. Here again, this effort relies on the \n     commitments of sovereign states acting separately and in \n     concert to secure sensitive materials. Like PSI, the Global \n     Partnership is an activity, not an organisation. The G8 \n     Leaders and 13 additional partners have pledged to raise up \n     to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) over 10 years for projects to \n     prevent dangerous weapons and materials from falling into the \n     wrong hands.\n       The US already has non-proliferation projects under way not \n     only in Russia but in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, \n     Georgia and other former Soviet states, as do other Global \n     Partnership countries. We recently began assistance in Iraq \n     and Libya and are encouraging our partners to undertake their \n     own projects in such states. At Sea Island this year, the G8 \n     agreed to use the Global Partnership to coordinate activities \n     in these areas.\n       This administration is working to make up for decades of \n     stillborn plans, wishful thinking and irresponsible \n     passivity. We're already late, but we are no longer \n     bystanders wringing our hands and hoping that somehow we will \n     find shelter from gathering threats. We are no longer lost in \n     endless international negotiations whose point seems to be \n     negotiation rather than decision, and no longer waiting \n     beneath the empty protection of a reluctant international \n     body while seeking grudging permission to take measures to \n     protect ourselves.\n       Mr. Bush has begun laying the foundation for a \n     comprehensive, root-and-branch approach to the mortal danger \n     of the proliferation of instruments intended for our \n     destruction. We are determined to use every resource at our \n     disposal--using diplomacy regularly, economic pressure when \n     it makes a difference, active law enforcement when \n     appropriate and military force when we must.\n       We are just at the beginning, but it is an extraordinary \n     beginning. Not only are we meeting this ultimate of threats \n     on the field, we are advancing on it, battling not only \n     aggressively, but successfully. And so we must, for the \n     outcome of this battle may hold nothing less than the chance \n     to survive.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9024-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9024-S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            BACK TO SCHOOL AND THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate returns from its August \nrecess this week, students, teachers, and school personnel across \nWisconsin and around the country are settling in for a new school year.\n  Each new school year brings with it the promise of things to come. \nStudents will embark on new educational paths, with new subjects and \nteachers and, in some instances, new classmates. Some students are \nentering school for the first time, while others are beginning their \nmiddle or high school careers. And some are embarking on their senior \nyears in high school and are preparing to make the transition into the \nnext phase of their lives. All of these students, and their parents, \nare facing new challenges and new opportunities. We owe it to them to \nprovide the resources promised by the Federal Government to support our \nStates and local school districts.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the education of our children has \nbeen viewed as a largely local and State responsibility, and the \nFederal Government has wisely left decisions affecting our children's \nday-to-day classroom experiences up to the schools, districts, school \nboards, and State education agencies that bear the responsibility for--\nand most of the cost of--educating our children. Historically, when the \nFederal Government has stepped in, it has been to ensure that children \nreceive an equal opportunity for a good education by protecting the \nrights of all children and by providing additional resources for \nschools and for such related activities as teacher training.\n  Impact Aid, which was enacted in 1950 and is one of the oldest \nFederal education programs, helps local school districts to defray the \ncosts of educating ``federally connected'' students, such as those who \nlive on Federal land, which is not included in the local property tax \nbase that funds elementary and secondary education. The National \nDefense Education Act of 1958, which was enacted in response to the \nSoviet launch of the Sputnik satellite, provided funding to improve \nmath, science, and foreign language instruction in our elementary and \nsecondary schools.\n  The landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, of which \nthe No Child Left Behind Act is the most recent reauthorization, \nprovided funding to support the education of disadvantaged students. \nThat same year, Congress enacted the Higher Education Act, which has \nhelped to provide millions of Americans with the assistance they need \nto pursue post-secondary education.\n  Also in 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity created ``Project \nHead Start,'' the predecessor of the current Head Start program, which \nis administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Since \nits inception, Head Start has improved opportunities for low-income \npreschool children and their families by providing a comprehensive \napproach to addressing the\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\neducational, nutritional, psychological, and other needs of these \nchildren and their families.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 mandates that \na free appropriate public education be provided to all children and \npromises that the Federal Government will pay 40 percent of the cost of \neducating children with special needs. Our public schools' efforts to \nserve students with disabilities are a hallmark of our national \ncommitment to a free public education for all children. Since IDEA was \nenacted, public schools have helped students with disabilities to \nbecome more self-sufficient, to prepare for employment, and to learn \nthe skills they will need to lead productive lives. America's public \nschools have led the way toward the full integration of individuals \nwith disabilities into our national life.\n  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting local and \nState governments in their effort to provide a high quality public \neducation for each child. I support these efforts, which rightly \nrespect the importance of maintaining local control of education. For \nthat reason, I opposed the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, which the \nPresident touts as one of his top domestic achievements.\n  While I think we all agree that schools should be held accountable \nfor results, I and many Wisconsinites oppose the testing-centered \nmandates in the NCLB. I support some aspects of this law, such as \nfunding for reading education and after-school programs. I opposed this \nlegislation, however, because it takes decisions regarding the \nfrequency of testing out of the hands of local school districts and \nstates and mandates that students be tested in reading and math in \ngrades 3-8 beginning with the 2005-2006 school year. This top-down, \none-size-fits-all approach to testing is not good for Wisconsin \nstudents or schools. Washington does not know best when it comes to \nmaking decisions such as this. And it is troubling that the results of \nthese tests are central to determining whether a school, district, or \nState is considered to be ``in need of improvement'' or ``failing'' \nacademically.\n  It is also troubling that the corresponding Federal sanctions for \nschools deemed to be ``in need of improvement'' or ``failing'' will \nactually take badly needed money from those very schools. And these \nsanctions are being imposed despite the fact that the Federal \nGovernment has not provided the resources to help these school succeed \nthat were promised by the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The President has called the No Child Left Behind Act ``the most \nimportant Federal education reform in history.'' I respectfully \ndisagree with the President's assessment of this law, the effects of \nwhich are beginning to reverberate throughout Wisconsin and throughout \nthe country. As I travel around Wisconsin each year to host listening \nsessions in each of our 72 counties, I hear time and again from \nfrustrated teachers, administrators, parents, and others about the \nnegative effect that NCLB is having on education in Wisconsin.\n  I began to hear such comments more than three years ago when the \nPresident first proposed his education initiative, and this drumbeat of \nconcern has increased as my constituents continue to learn first-hand \nwhat this new law means for them and for their students and children. \nWhile Wisconsinites support holding schools accountable for results, \nthey are concerned about the focus on testing that is the centerpiece \nof the President's approach.\n  In response to these concerns, I introduced with Senator Jeffords and \nothers the Student Testing Flexibility Act, which would allow States \nand school districts that are meeting their adequate yearly progress, \nAYP, goals to waive the additional layer of testing required by NCLB, \nthus allowing them to maintain their existing testing programs. In \naddition, this bill would allow States to keep the Federal money \nallocated for developing and administering these new tests and to use \nthat money to help those schools and districts that are not meeting \ntheir AYP goals. I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a \nwide range of Wisconsin and national education groups.\n  In addition, earlier this year I sent with some of my colleagues a \nletter to the chairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee requesting that the committee have a \nseries of hearings on how the ongoing implementation of the NCLB is \naffecting schools and districts. We asked that these hearings focus on \nissues that are being raised by our constituents, including: the unique \ncircumstances of rural and smaller school districts; the long-term \neffects that meeting the one-size-fits-all AYP provisions will have on \nstudents, schools, and school districts; the concern and likelihood \nthat nearly all public schools may not be able to meet the goal of 100 \npercent proficient scores on reading and math tests by the 2013-2014 \nschool year, even if those schools show a steady increase in student \nachievement each year; the NCLB sanctions structure; the effect that \nFederal funding that is well below the agreed-upon authorization levels \nfor crucial programs such as Title I and special education is having on \nschools' ability to meet NCLB and State standards; the need for \nadditional Federal funding for professional development, recruitment \nand retention, and for additional training for paraprofessionals, so \nthat States and school districts can comply with requirements for \nhaving highly qualified teachers and paraprofessionals; the toll that \npreparation for the new federally mandated tests is having on, and will \nhave on, the ability of teachers to spend time on innovative and \nexciting approaches to instruction and assessment, the instruction time \navailable for non-tested subjects, such as social studies, art, music, \nand physical education, the strength of State academic standards, and \nthe morale of students and educators; the ongoing efforts to align the \nNCLB and IDEA; the unique challenges that the accountability provisions \npose for students with limited English proficiency; and the \nimplementation of the supplemental services provisions, including \nimplications for Federal civil rights law.\n  It is critically important that we understand the practical effect of \nthe NCLB on the everyday classroom experiences of students and \nteachers. I have heard from many educators who are already seeing a \nnarrowing of curricula and increased teaching to the test in \npreparation for the federally mandated tests in reading and math. One \nof the purposes of public education is to ensure that students have a \nwell-rounded curriculum that gives them the skills that they need to \nsucceed in life. I remain concerned that the approach encapsulated in \nthe NCLB will produce a generation of students who know how to take \ntests, but who don't have the skills necessary to become successful \nadults. Test-taking has a place in public education, but it should not \nbe the role of the Federal Government to tell schools how and when to \nrequire tests.\n  As an editorial that appeared earlier this week in the Appleton Post-\nCrescent so correctly points out, ``the more testing schools must do, \nthe more time is taken from education that doesn't involve passing a \ntest. And the more testing schools have to do--in the name of no child \nbeing left behind--the greater the chance that your child could be left \nwith a less complete education.''\n  And, I am particularly disturbed that this appears to be only the tip \nof the testing iceberg. The President has said that he plans to propose \neven more federally mandated testing if he is reelected. Specifically, \nthe President said, ``[a]s we make progress, we will require a rigorous \nexam before graduation.'' If this proposal were to be enacted, it would \nmean that students would be taking federally mandated tests in 8 of \ntheir 13 years of their elementary and secondary years.\n  And that's not just 8 tests. Beginning next year, students in grades \n3-8 will take annual reading and math exams, which totals 12 tests over \na student's career. In addition, the Federal Government requires that \nstudents be tested in reading and math in one high school grade, which \nis two more tests, for a total of 14. Beginning in the 2007-2008 school \nyear, NCLB also requires that students be tested in science three times \nduring their school careers (once in each of grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-\n12). That's three more tests, for a new total of 17 federally mandated \ntests. And if the President's new plan for a mandatory high school exit \nexam is enacted,\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nyou can add one more test, bringing the total to 18 federally mandated \ntests over 13 years of school.\n\n  And this total does not include testing programs already in place at \nthe State level, many of which have been thrown into disarray as States \nstruggle to amend their existing tests to comply with the new NCLB \nrequirements. Wisconsin currently tests students in reading in grade \nthree through the Wisconsin Reading Comprehension Test, and in reading/\nlanguage arts, math, science, and social studies in grades four, eight, \nand ten with the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations. And \nthis is in addition to regular classroom tests and quizzes and tests \ngiven at the district level by many of the 426 school districts in my \nstate. And then, for those students hoping to go to college, there is \nthe pre-SAT, the SAT, the ACT, and on and on.\n  The Wisconsin Legislature enacted a requirement for a high school \ngraduation test in 1997. But that test, which was to be required of all \nstudents beginning with those in the graduating class of 2003, was \ndelayed for one year due to State budget constraints, and was \nsubsequently delayed for an additional 2 years for that same reason, \npushing the requirement from the class of 2003 to the class of 2006.\n  Last year, as part of the State's 2004-2005 budget, the Wisconsin \nLegislature repealed the State graduation test, which many parents and \neducators in my State opposed and vigorously fought against for many \nyears. Now it appears that the President wants to reinstate this \nrequirement on the students of my State--and to impose it on the other \n24 States that don't currently have such a test--over the will of the \nWisconsin Legislature. And with States still unsure of the actual cost \nof the NCLB-mandated testing and little in the way of Federal funds to \ndevelop and implement it, another Federal testing requirement could \nbend the already dire budget situations in many States and school \ndistricts to the breaking point.\n  According to a new report from the Center on Education Policy, CEP, \n20 States now require high school exit exams, and another five will \nrequire such tests by 2009. I support the right of State legislatures \nand local school districts to determine the frequency with which \nstudents are tested, including whether to require a high school exit \nexam. When I was a member of the Wisconsin legislature, I supported \nlegislation that created statewide tests for the students of my State. \nBut I opposed the extra layer of federally mandated tests piled onto \nstudents and teachers with the enactment of the No Child Left Behind \nAct, and I will oppose any proposal for a federally mandated high \nschool exit exam.\n  Students, teachers, and schools are more than a test score, and \neducation should be a well-rounded experience that is not narrowly \nfocused on students passing a test to help their schools avoid being \nsanctioned by the Federal Government. Standardized tests measure where \na particular student is at a particular day and time. These tests do \nnot make allowances for outside factors such as test anxiety, illness, \nworry about a troubled home situation, or the fact that the child \ntaking the test may not have eaten that day. To measure the performance \nof a school and its teachers and students on two test scores per grade \ndoes a disservice to these same students, teachers, and schools.\n  I will continue to monitor the effect of the No Child Left Behind Act \non Wisconsin students, and I hope that the debate on this law, both in \nmy State and nationally, will result in meaningful changes to this \ndeeply flawed law that will ensure that each child is given the \nopportunity to succeed and that each school has the resources necessary \nto give these students that opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced editorial in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Appleton Post-Crescent, Sept. 8, 2004]\n\n                Too Many Tests Mean Diminished Education\n\n       A quarter-million kids in Wisconsin will spend part of this \n     school year studying for and taking standardized tests.\n       In the next school year, that number will nearly double, as \n     tests mandated by state government--pushed by the federal No \n     Child Left Behind Act--expand to include more grade levels \n     and more subjects.\n       There will be more time needed to take tests, and to \n     prepare students to take the tests. And it's all being done \n     to test . . . the schools.\n       Sure, the kids are the ones taking the tests, but \n     ultimately it's the schools' performance that's being graded. \n     No school wants to be deficient in its test results because, \n     under No Child Left Behind, there may be consequences.\n       But with more testing on the way--and more classroom time \n     devoted to the tests--what's going to happen to our kids' \n     education? What won't our kids be learning because they'll be \n     studying for more tests?\n       This year, third-graders have reading tests and fourth-, \n     eighth- and 10th-graders have reading, language arts, math, \n     science and social studies tests. Next year, those tests will \n     remain, but third-graders will add a math test and fifth-, \n     sixth- and seventh-graders will have reading and math tests.\n       It can be argued that standardized tests show our children \n     are learning. But what are they learning? How to pass one \n     particular test, which tests one particular subject and is \n     geared toward one particular style of learning?\n       It also can be argued that schools must be accountable and \n     standardized tests are the best way--if flawed--to ensure \n     accountability. But, the more testing schools must do, the \n     more time is taken from education that doesn't involve \n     passing a test.\n       And the more testing schools have to do--in the name of no \n     child being left behind--the greater the chance that your \n     child could be left with a less complete education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9026-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RANDY JENSEN: NATIONAL SECONDARY PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nthat we need to do much more and do it much sooner to address the \nthreat posed by Avian influenza and other infectious diseases.\n  The Avian influenza outbreaks that occurred in late June 2004 \nindicate that the virus is becoming more pathogenic and more widespread \naccording to World Health Organization, WHO, officials. In addition, \nthis virus has crossed the species barrier, moving from infected \nchickens or ducks directly into humans in three documented outbreaks \nsince 1997.\n  I am most troubled, however, by a warning from WHO officials that the \nvirus may acquire the ability to spread easily from human to human, and \nthus, trigger a global influenza pandemic. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, an influenza pandemic could cause \nan estimated 89,000 to 207,000 deaths, 314,000 to 733,000 \nhospitalizations, and cost from $71-$167 billion in the United States \nalone. We cannot afford to take this threat lightly.\n  The so-called bird flu is deadly to humans. It killed 24 out of 35 \npeople who\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\ncontracted it from chickens in Thailand and Vietnam earlier this year. \nIn July an additional three were killed in Vietnam. This fatality rate \nis in the same range as the Ebola virus which is considered one of the \nmost virulent viral diseases known to man.\n  Lack of effective treatment options for Avian flu contribute to its \nlethality. Creating an effective vaccine for the Avian influenza virus \nis extremely difficult. The virus is so deadly that a vaccine cannot \neasily be grown in eggs, the usual method of production. Other vaccine \nproduction methods are being studied, but the required extensive safety \ntests for a new vaccine mean that large scale vaccine distribution is \nnot feasible in the near term.\n  Equally disturbing is that only one drug is currently believed \neffective to treat Avian flu, an antiviral medicine called Tamiflu \nwhich helps only if taken within one to two days of developing symptoms \nof the disease.\n  The WHO recently decided Tamiflu should be included in regional \nstockpiles to be distributed at the first sign of a new influenza virus \nspreading among humans. Unfortunately, if a pandemic of Avian flu were \nto occur now, the manufacturer of Tamiflu could not produce enough of \nthe drug to meet the huge demand that would occur, and there is no \ngeneric substitute.\n  In light of these very limited treatment options, we should heed the \nWHO's warning and take aggressive steps to prevent a pandemic from \noccurring while at the same time increasing our preparedness to respond \nto all public health emergencies by developing a global defense system \nagainst the outbreak of diseases, including those resulting from \nterrorist attacks.\n  On July 31, 2003, I introduced S. Res. 208 to address this concern. \nThe resolution seeks to improve American defenses against the spread of \ninfectious diseases by calling for improvements in global disease \nsurveillance capabilities because the early warning of a disease \noutbreak is key to its identification, the quick application of \ncountermeasures, and the development a cure.\n  The recent Presidential Directive 10, ``Biodefense for the 21st \nCentury,'' observes that many bioterror attacks could initially mimic \nnaturally occurring diseases and potentially delay recognition of an \nattack. This is another important reason why I believe that the United \nStates must strengthen its ability to detect diseases before they cross \nour borders. To pursue this initiative, I along with Senators Bingaman, \nDodd, Durbin, Feinstein, Inouye, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Murray, and \nSarbanes sent a letter to President Bush urging his support for global \nhealth issues at the 2004 Group of Eight, G-8, Summit. Our letter \nunderscored the need for better disease surveillance and reporting \nsystems which are inclusive of all public health emergencies of \ninternational concern.\n  I am pleased that the G-8 committed to take steps to expand and \ninitiate new biosurveillance capabilities to detect bioterror against \nhumans, animals, and crops; improve bioterrorism prevention and \nresponse capabilities; increase protection of the global food supply; \nand respond to, investigate, and mitigate the effects of alleged uses \nof biological weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease.\n  The administration followed the G-8 summit with the August release an \nupdated draft of the 1978 Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness \nPlan for 60 days of public comment. This plan outlines the \nadministration's proposed national strategy for preparing and \nresponding to an influenza pandemic. Developing a strategy is good and \nthe administration is to be commended for its concern, but far better \nwould be committing more resources now to programs that have already \nbeen identified as critical to our preparedness.\n  For example, the administration's fiscal year 2005 budget request, \nwhich cuts public health preparedness for State and local governments \nby more than $105 million and hospital preparedness funding at the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration by $39 million, seriously \ncalls into question the administration's commitment to ensuring that \nU.S. citizens are protected from bioterrorist events and other public \nhealth emergencies.\n\n  I commend the President and the G-8 for expressing support for global \nhealth issues, but words and plans are not enough. We need action and \nwe need action now. We must act together to reduce the grave threat \nthat biological weapons and naturally occurring infectious diseases \npose to the safety and security of the world.\n  Adoption of S. 427, the Agriculture Security Assistance Act, and S. \n430, the Agriculture Security Preparedness Act, which I introduced in \n2003 to help protect our Nation from an agroterror attack, would be a \ngood first step for the United States as we strive to live up to the \npromises made to our G-8 partners. S. 427 would assist states and \ncommunities in responding to threats to the agriculture industry by \nproviding funding for biosecurity grants to farmers and community \nplanning activities. S. 430 would enable better interagency \ncoordination within the federal government as it works to plan and \nrespond to a threat to American agriculture.\n  We should also ensure that the National Security Council, and the \nDepartments of State, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services \nhave the funding and support they need to fully implement the \ncommitments made at the 2004 G-8 summit. CDC's fiscal year 2005 budget \nrequest for global disease detection shows an increase of $27.5 million \nover the fiscal year 2004 budget. However, this funding increase comes \nat the expense of other important public health initiatives. We should \nnot be robbing Peter to pay Paul when it comes to the health and safety \nof our Nation.\n  We must take action to increase WHO's global disease surveillance \ncapability, including supporting their effort to revise the \nInternational Health Regulations by expanding the scope of required \ndisease reporting to include all public health emergencies of \ninternational concern. An April 2004 Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, report on emerging infectious diseases, ``Asian SARS Outbreak \nChallenged International and National Responses,'' GAO-04-564, noted \nthat the response by governments in SARS-affected countries was \nhindered by inadequate disease surveillance systems, poor \ncommunication, ineffective leadership, insufficient public health \ncapacity, and limited resources.\n  While the International Health Regulations provide the legal \nframework for global infectious disease control, WHO's Global Outbreak \nAlert and Response Network, GOARN, is the primary mechanism by which \nWHO mobilizes technical resources for the investigation of and response \nto disease outbreaks of international importance. The SARS outbreak was \nthe first time that the GOARN network was activated on such a large \nscale for an international outbreak of an unknown emerging infectious \ndisease. During the SARS outbreak, GOARN's human resources were \nstretched to capacity. GOARN experienced difficulty in sustaining the \nresponse to SARS over time and getting the appropriate experts out into \nthe field.\n  These difficulties in responding to and containing the SARS outbreak \ndemonstrate the urgent need to strengthen our ability to respond to \nglobal health emergencies. For example, the CDC reported that if the \nUnited States had experienced many SARS cases during the global \noutbreak, CDC might not have been able to make as many of their staff \navailable to assist GOARN. In light of this, the implications of a \nbioterror event or an influenza pandemic are chilling. The SARS \noutbreak sickened 8,089 people causing 774 deaths in 2003, and an \ninfluenza pandemic is estimated by CDC to affect 10 times as many \npeople.\n  CDC's fiscal year 2005 budget request for global disease detection is \n$50 million. This figure is not adequate when one considers that the \nSARS outbreak alone cost Asian economies $11 billion to $18 billion and \nresulted in losses of 0.5 percent to 2 percent of total output. If we \nmultiply that by 10 for an influenza pandemic, the numbers are \nstaggering. If we act now to increase funding for these programs, we \nhave a chance to help prevent such a tragic situation from happening. \nBy helping the world cope with infectious disease outbreaks we not only \nincrease global public health, but help ensure the health and safety of \nthe American people as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9028-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONGRATULATIONS TO BUDDY BUTLER AND NIKKI HENSLEY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

They \nwere recently picked to receive a ``Destination Wedding'' by viewers of \nNBC's Today Show. They competed for the free wedding package against \nthree other couples, and were selected to receive a celebrity wedding, \nwhich will be broadcast on television.\n  The couple met in June of 2003, however, soon after Buddy was shipped \noff for a six-month tour to Iraq.

The couple remained \nfaithful to each other during Buddy's deployment and decided to marry \nupon his return from Iraq.\n  Couples such as Buddy and Nikki are the basis for good family values \nin our country. I wish them luck with their celebrity wedding in \nNovember and hope for them a strong marriage in the future. Kentucky is \nproud of them and will be watching their big day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9028-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DR.

Dr. \nCecil L. ``Chip'' Murray, who is retiring after 37 years of \ndistinguished service with the First African Methodist Episcopal Church \nof Los Angeles.\n  Dr. Murray is a man of great passion and vision who has inspired his \ncongregation to go ``beyond the walls'' of the church to help the \nbroader community. Under his leadership, volunteers from First AME Los \nAngeles have changed thousands of lives for the better.\n  When Dr. Murray was first assigned to First AME in 1977, his new \nchurch family had 300 active members. Today the congregation has more \nthan 18,000 members. Led by Dr. Murray, the church ministry fills the \nsanctuary with an awe-inspiring spiritual worship service that draws \npeople of all faiths from far and wide.\n  While tending to his congregation's spiritual needs, Dr. Murray has \nalso led them to look beyond the walls of the church at those less \nfortunate than themselves. Each member of the congregation is asked to \njoin one of 40 task forces addressing community needs such as health, \nhomelessness, substance abuse, emergency food and clothing, general and \nspecialized housing, tutoring, employment services, and entrepreneurial \ntraining.\n  As he heads into a well-deserved retirement, Dr. Murray will receive \naccolades and appreciation from a grateful congregation and community. \nI wish to join them in expressing my deep appreciation for his great \nlife's work and my very best wishes for the future. I am sure that even \nin retirement, Dr. Murray will continue to work wonders and inspire \nothers for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9028-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, next week, September 12 through 18, \nis the tenth annual National Assisted Living Week. The theme this year \nis ``Caring for Our Heritage,'' and encourages residents, families, \nstaff and the community to share their heritage as a means of \nunderstanding the diverse backgrounds that form a community and our \nNation.\n  Beginning annually on Grandparents' Day, this honorary week \nspotlights the role played by assisted living professionals in caring \nfor the nearly one million of our Nation's elderly and disabled. \nAssisted living provides a home-like environment in which individuals \nwho do not need the level of care provided by nursing homes receive \nhelp in order to continue to live independently. The need for this \napproach will only grow as our Nation ages. I am pleased that my State \nof Oregon has been a leader in developing the assisted living concept. \nCaregivers in assisted living are central to this evolution in care and \nare key to assuring its success by providing support to both residents \nand families.\n  National Assisted Living Week was created in 1995 by the National \nCenter for Assisted Living. This year, for the first time, it is being \ncelebrated in conjunction with the American Association of Homes and \nServices for the Aging and the Assisted Living Federation of America. \nNational Assisted Living Week emphasizes the importance of this service \nwhich has grown 50 percent nationally in the last 5 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9028-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9028-S9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING RICHARD E. ``DICK'' KIPPER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Richard E. \n``Dick'' Kipper, an extraordinary leader in the fight against \nAlzheimer's disease. In November, Dick will complete his term as \nNational Board Chair of the Alzheimer's Association, a position he has \nheld for two years and which caps nearly a decade of commitment to the \ncause of creating a world without Alzheimer's disease.\n  Like so many others, Dick joined the fight against Alzheimer's after \nthe disease touched his family. Dick lost his beloved father to \nAlzheimer's. But because of his efforts, future generations will be \nbetter off.\n  Dick has played a vital part in helping the Alzheimer's Association \nachieve its strategic goals of advancing research, enhancing care and \nsupport and raising public awareness. He has logged thousands of miles \ntraveling across the country and devoted countless hours on behalf of \nthe Alzheimer's Association. Here are just a few of his \naccomplishments.\n  Dick Kipper first joined the Alzheimer's Association's National Board \nin 1996 and quickly rose through the ranks to assume significant \nleadership positions. He chaired the National Board's Development \nCommittee, was elected vice-chair of the National board, and served on \nthe board's Diversity and Inclusion, Finance and Chapter Committees. He \nalso spearheaded the effort to mobilize the board and chapters in \nsupport of the Association's ``billion dollar research goal.''\n  Under Dick's guidance, the Alzheimer's Association has led the fight \nfor increased research funding and launched a new campaign to change \nthe way people think about Alzheimer's disease. Last year, the \nAssociation dedicated nearly $16 million to its peer-reviewed research \ngrants program and initiated a ``Research Roundtable'' partnership with \npharmaceutical companies to develop strategies for generating and \nsharing new information designed to accelerate progress in research. In \nJuly of this year, the Alzheimer's Association sponsored the 9th \nInternational Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, \nthe largest gathering of Alzheimer researchers in history. More than \n4,200 scientists from around the world shared findings from 2,000 \nstudies showcasing the newest treatment advances in Alzheimer's disease \nand steps toward prevention. Dick's advocacy for increased research \nfunding has also brought him to Washington each spring for the last \nthree years to lobby Congress to increase federal funding for \nAlzheimer's research to $1 billion.\n  Helping caregivers and family members understand that they are not \nalone in the fight against Alzheimer's disease and that there is hope \non the horizon are other signature accomplishments of the Alzheimer's \nAssociation under Dick's leadership. In February, the Alzheimer's \nAssociation revealed a new brand identity, a redesigned website and its \n``Maintain Your Brain'' campaign to educate Americans about Alzheimer's \ndisease. The Association also established a new advisory council to \naddress critical issues related to prevention, diagnosis and imaging, \ndisease progression, and improved treatments. Dick's leadership was \ninstrumental in guiding the Alzheimer's Association through these \nprojects.\n  In addition to being an outstanding leader in the Alzheimer \ncommunity, Dick is also an accomplished businessman. In 1967 he co-\nfounded AFSA Data Corporation, a student loan servicing company. After \nFleet Financial Group acquired AFSA in 1986, Dick served as chairman of \nthe board and chief executive officer. At his retirement in 1990, the \ncompany employed more than 1,000 people and had annual revenues that \nexceeded $65 million. He also was co-owner, president and CEO of Major \nLegal Services, a multimillion-dollar\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\ndocument acquisition, process server and court reporting service \ncompany headquartered in San Francisco. And, he is a board member of \nThe Guggenheim Group, L.L.C., a venture capital and financial \nmanagement firm.\n  I salute Dick Kipper for his tireless efforts to help those with \nAlzheimer's and to create a brighter future without this \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9029-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GREEN MOUNTAIN AUDUBON NATURE CENTER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Saturday, the Green Mountain \nAudubon Nature Center in Huntington, VT will celebrate its 40th \nanniversary.\n  In 1964, Mrs. Christine Hires of Philadelphia, offered the 150-acre \nVermont farm she had owned since 1940, to the newly formed Green \nMountain Audubon Society. Mrs. Hires' dream was to keep the land open \nto visitors and in its natural condition. An open house was held on \nSeptember 19 and 20 of that year. The Green Mountain Audubon Nature \nCenter was established.\n  Since 1964, the center has grown to 255 acres of varied habitat \nincluding hardwood forest, cedar swamp, beaver pond, meadows, pristine \nstream and river edge. The original farmhouse and barn are currently \nused as office and program space for Audubon Vermont. The center also \nincludes a sugar house, the ``Clubhouse'' for summer camps and programs \nand a full-scale replica of an Abenaki longhouse.\n  Annually, nearly 15,000 visitors enjoy the nature trails, bird and \nother wildlife watching as well as a variety of environmental education \nprograms the center is known for. Some 4,500 children and adults take \npart in educational programs led by Audubon teacher-naturalists each \nyear.\n  I want to congratulate Green Mountain Audubon on 40 years of bringing \npeople closer to nature through environmental education, natural \nresources stewardship, its citizen science efforts and, of course, \nsound conservation advocacy. This weekend's celebration will honor the \noldest operating nature center in Vermont and the many individuals who \nhave contributed to its success. Well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9029-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GEORGIA'S 116TH AIR CONTROL WING\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Georgia's \n116th Air Control Wing (ACW) based at Robins Air Force Base. This week, \nthe wing will be awarded the Spaatz Trophy, which recognizes the \nNation's most outstanding Air National Guard unit.\n  For those of you who do not know, the Spaatz Trophy is named for \nGeneral Carl Spaatz, the first chief of staff of the independent Air \nForce and is presented annually to the overall outstanding Air National \nGuard flying unit. Selection of the winner is based on unit combat \nreadiness during the reporting year and the unit's performance with \nrespect to all other Air Guard flying units. More than 90 flying units \nfrom across the Nation are eligible to compete.\n  I would like to point out that this year's winner is no ordinary Air \nForce wing. The 116th ACW made history 2 years ago when it became the \nfirst blended unit ever in the Air Force--kicking off an historic \ntransformation of our fighting force. The wing is comprised of both Air \nNational Guardsmen members of the Active Duty Air Force, and is \ncommanded by a member of the Georgia Air Guard--General Tom Lynn.\n  Further, the 116th ACW is the only Air Force unit operating the E-8C \nJoint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, Joint STARS, which is \nthe most advanced airborne ground surveillance and battle management \nsystem in the world.\n  During 2003, the year for which this award is presented, the 116th \nACW completed the largest deployment in its history as it supported \nOperations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and flew more than 5,000 \ncombat hours. This outstanding achievement occurred just months after \nthe wing's historic transformation.\n  It is a great honor to win the Spaatz Trophy, and this award further \nillustrates the hard work taking place by the extremely talented \nmembers of the 116th ACW. I would like to extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to General Tom Lynn and all the members of the 116th \nAir Control Wing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9029-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, with an amendment:\n\n       S. 2634.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) JEM.--The term ``JEM'' means the Justice and Equality \n     Movement.\n       (3) SLA.--The term ``SLA'' means the Sudanese Liberation \n     Army.\n       (4) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as \n     envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), and \n     in the Machakos Protocol of 2002, is in grave jeopardy.\n       (2) Since 1989, the Government of Sudan has repeatedly \n     engaged in and sponsored orchestrated campaigns of attacking \n     and dislocating targeted civilian populations, disrupting \n     their ability to sustain themselves, and subsequently \n     restricting assistance to those displaced in a coordinated \n     policy of ethnic cleansing and Arabization that is most \n     recently evident in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (3) In response to 2 decades of civil conflict in Sudan, \n     the United States has helped to establish an internationally \n     supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to \n     the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan \n     signed June 5, 2004.\n       (4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was \n     negotiating for a final countrywide peace, enumerated in the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, \n     it refused to engage in any discussion with regard to its \n     ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region of Darfur.\n       (5) It was not until the international community expressed \n     its outrage, through high level visits by Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell and others, and through United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1556 of July 30, 2004, that the Government \n     of Sudan agreed to engage in talks to bring peace to the \n     Darfur region.\n       (6) According to the Government of the United States and \n     United Nations officials, the Government of Sudan has engaged \n     in an orchestrated campaign, with the assistance of its Arab \n     Sudanese proxy militia, the\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\n     Janjaweed, to remove a significant part of the ethnically \n     African population from North Darfur, West Darfur, and South \n     Darfur, Sudan.\n       (7) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     identified ``massive human rights violations in Darfur \n     perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, \n     which may constitute war crimes and/or crimes against \n     humanity''.\n       (8) Evidence collected by international observers in the \n     Darfur region between January 2003 and September 2004 \n     indicate a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese \n     civilians in a scorched earth policy, from both air and \n     ground, that has destroyed African Sudanese villages, killing \n     and driving away its people, while Arab Sudanese villages \n     have been left unscathed.\n       (9) As a result of this coordinated campaign, which \n     Congress has declared to be genocide, reports indicate tens \n     of thousands of African Sudanese civilians killed, the \n     systematic rape of thousands of women and girls, the \n     destruction of hundreds of Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa villages \n     and other ethnically African populations, including the \n     poisoning of their wells and the plunder of crops and cattle \n     upon which they sustain themselves.\n       (10) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, 1,400,000 people have been displaced in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan, of whom over 200,000 have been forced to \n     flee to Chad as refugees.\n       (11) The Government of Sudan conducted aerial attack \n     missions and deadly raids across the international border \n     between Sudan and Chad in an illegal effort to pursue \n     Sudanese civilians seeking refuge in Chad.\n       (12) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths \n     directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government \n     sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the \n     Government of Sudan has restricted humanitarian and human \n     rights workers' access to the Darfur area, primarily through \n     bureaucratic and administrative obstruction in an attempt to \n     inflict the most devastating harm on those displaced from \n     their villages and homes without any means of sustenance or \n     shelter.\n       (13) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the \n     Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, \n     shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region--\n       (A) is estimated to be causing 500 deaths each day; and\n       (B) is projected to escalate to 2,400 deaths each day by \n     December 2004, so that even a best-case scenario will likely \n     result in the death of more than 320,000 people between April \n     1, 2004 and December 31, 2004.\n       (14) The Government of Chad served an important role in \n     facilitating the Darfur humanitarian cease-fire (the \n     N'Djamena Agreement dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur \n     region between the Government of Sudan and the 2 opposition \n     rebel groups in Darfur (the JEM and the SLA) although both \n     sides have violated it repeatedly.\n       (15) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the \n     plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees even though such \n     assistance has adversely affected their own means of \n     livelihood.\n       (16) The cooperation and inclusion of all Sudanese is \n     essential to the establishment of peace and security \n     throughout all of Sudan.\n       (17) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in \n     regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the \n     crisis in Darfur, by convening talks between the parties and \n     deploying several hundred monitors and security forces to the \n     region, as well as by recognizing the need for a far larger \n     force with a broader mandate.\n       (18) Despite the threat of international action expressed \n     through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 of \n     July 30, 2004, the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct \n     and prevent efforts to reverse the catastrophic consequences \n     that loom over Darfur.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, \n                   SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Sudan Peace Act.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) remains relevant and \n     should be extended to include the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (b) Actions To Address the Conflict.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be \n     possible if the principles of the Machakos Protocol of 2002 \n     and the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in \n     the Sudan signed June 5, 2004, negotiated with the SPLM, \n     apply to all of Sudan and to all of the people of Sudan, \n     including the Darfur region;\n       (2) the parties to the N'Djamena Agreement (the Government \n     of Sudan, the SLA, and the JEM) must meet their obligations \n     under that Agreement to allow safe and immediate access of \n     all humanitarian assistance throughout the Darfur region and \n     must expedite the conclusion of a political agreement to end \n     the conflict in Darfur;\n       (3) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the \n     United States has access and, at the same time, develop a \n     plan similar to that described in section 10 of the Sudan \n     Peace Act to provide assistance to the areas of Sudan to \n     which United States access has been obstructed or denied;\n       (4) the international community, including African, Arab, \n     and Muslim nations, should immediately provide resources \n     necessary to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of \n     individuals at risk as a result of the Darfur crisis;\n       (5) the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes \n     should travel to Chad and the Darfur region immediately to \n     investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity to develop \n     a more accurate portrayal of the situation on the ground and \n     to better inform the report required in section 11(b) of the \n     Sudan Peace Act;\n       (6) the United States and the international community \n     should--\n       (A) provide all necessary means to assist in the immediate \n     deployment of a contingent of 4,200 African Union forces as \n     recommended by the United Nations and to sustain such forces; \n     and\n       (B) work to increase the authorized level and expand the \n     mandate of such forces commensurate with the gravity and \n     scope of the problem in a region the size of France;\n       (7) the President should use all means to facilitate a \n     comprehensive solution to the conflict in Sudan, including by \n     directing the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations to pursue a resolution of the United Nations \n     Security Council that--\n       (A) condemns the actions of the Government of Sudan in \n     engaging in an orchestrated campaign of ethnic cleansing in \n     Darfur;\n       (B) calls on the Government of Sudan to cease support of \n     ethnic cleansing and the killing of innocent civilians, \n     disarm the Janjaweed militias, prevent such militias from \n     harassing and killing civilians, and ensure immediate access \n     for all humanitarian assistance to all areas of Darfur;\n       (C) calls on all parties to the conflict in the Darfur \n     region to permit unimpeded delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance directly to Darfur, in particular to allow such \n     assistance to cross directly from countries that border \n     Sudan;\n       (D) calls on the Government of Sudan to provide all \n     assistance possible, including release of its strategic food \n     reserves, to respond to the Darfur crisis;\n       (E) calls on the international community, particularly \n     those countries with strong economic ties to Sudan, to \n     expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance to Darfur;\n       (F) authorizes the African Union Mission in Sudan (AUMIS) \n     now deploying to the Darfur region of Sudan, and calls for \n     the expansion of such force, and extension of the force's \n     mandate to include protection of civilians;\n       (G) establishes an international commission of inquiry to \n     examine the actions and accountability of those responsible \n     for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur \n     region; and\n       (H) confirms the right of all displaced Sudanese to return \n     to their villages under safe and secure conditions;\n       (8) an international commission of inquiry should be \n     established to conduct an investigation of atrocities in the \n     Darfur region and to preserve evidence of atrocities for use \n     in the prosecution of those responsible for war crimes and \n     crimes against humanity;\n       (9) sanctions should be imposed on the assets and \n     activities of those Sudanese Government officials and other \n     individuals that are involved in carrying out the policy of \n     ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region;\n       (10) the Government of the United States should not \n     normalize relations with Sudan, including through the lifting \n     of any sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to, \n     and takes demonstrable steps to implement, peace agreements \n     for all areas of Sudan, including Darfur;

Mr. President, today Senator Lugar and I, along with \nseveral other colleagues, introduce a bill that is designed to increase \npressure on the government of Sudan to stop its campaign of genocide in \nDarfur.\n  There is now--at least in the U.S. Government--no dispute that \ngenocide has occurred in Darfur. The Congress so stated by resolution \nin July. Today, in testimony to the Committee on Foreign Relations, the \nSecretary of State affirmed that ``genocide has been committed in \nDarfur'' and that the Government of Sudan and the janjaweed militia \nbear responsibility for it.\n  The situation in Darfur is dire. As many as 50,000 black Africans \nhave been killed. Sexual violence is routinely used as a weapon by the \nSudanese-sponsored janjaweed militia. Over a million people are \ndisplaced from their homes. And, because the Sudanese government \nrefused to allow unrestricted access to war-affected populations at the \nonset of this crisis--a crisis of the government's making--hundreds of \nthousands of people are likely to die by the end of the year.\n  Unless we act quickly and decisively to stop the violence in Darfur, \nhistory is going to judge us harshly for our lack of action. It may \nalready be too late to avoid the condemnation of future generations.\n  On July 30, following UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's visit to \nSudan, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1556. The \nresolution was, in my view, inadequate. It provided an arms embargo and \ntravel ban against the janjaweed, but did little to pressure the very \ngovernment sponsoring the militia. The resolution provided only a vague \nthreat to apply the sanctions to the government of Sudan if it failed \nto take certain steps, including ending all restrictions on \nhumanitarian workers, investigating and punishing human rights abuses, \nimmediately beginning disarmament of the janjaweed, and resuming talks \nwith the rebels. Sudan was given 30 days to comply.\n  Sudan has not satisfied the conditions for the resolution. On \nSeptember 2, the Secretary General's Special Representative to Sudan \nreported to the Security Council that the government of Sudan has not \ntaken any steps to disarm the janjaweed or improve security of \ninternally displaced persons.\n  The administration's response was to propose a new draft UN \nresolution yesterday. Unfortunately, this resolution only delays a \ndecision about whether or not to impose sanctions for another 30 days. \nIt does not label what is happening in Khartoum as genocide, although \nit does call upon the Secretary General to establish a commission of \ninquiry into violations of international humanitarian law and human \nrights. It does not call for a chapter 7 peacekeeping mission in \nDarfur, and it does not call for an expansion of the mandate of the \nAfrican Union Mission in Sudan.\n  I believe the Congress must do its part to pressure the government of \nSudan, and to provide additional tools to the Administration.\n  On July 21, Senator DeWine and I introduced S. 2705, which was aimed \nat pressuring the government of Sudan to fulfill commitments it made to \nthe UN. On July 22, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nSenator Lugar, also introduced a bill on Sudan, S. 2720. It had the \nsame objective, though its provisions were different from the Biden-\nDeWine bill in several respects.\n  Over the recess, the chairman and I worked together to develop a \njoint bill. I believe it is important that the committee speak with one \nvoice on the genocide in Darfur. I also recognize that this late in the \ncongressional session, most legislation will require unanimous consent \nto pass. So I hope our joint effort will prove successful.\n  The bill we introduce today authorizes $200 million in humanitarian \nassistance for Darfur. It holds out the promise of $100 million in \nassistance for Sudan in connection with a peace agreement between the \ngovernment and rebels in the south, but only if the President certifies \nthat Khartoum takes demonstrable steps that it has stopped attacking \ncivilians, disarmed the janjaweed and allowed unfettered access to \nDarfur for humanitarian workers. If the President cannot make this \ncertification within 120 days, the bill requires that the President \nblock the assets of senior members of the government of Khartoum.\n  The bill does not go as far as I would have liked. The Biden-DeWine \nbill provided additional resources to implement a north-south peace \nagreement as an incentive to the Khartoum government, and it provided \nfor additional sanctions, including those sanctions already set forth \nin the Sudan Peace Act. But I have agreed to join with the chairman to \ntake this intermediate action.\n  I want to make clear that this bill should only be considered a first \nstep. If the tragedy in Darfur continues, and if Khartoum continues to \nignore the demands of the international community that it cease the \nviolence in Darfur, I intend to introduce stronger legislation next \nyear.\n  Today the Secretary of State spoke clearly, for all the world to \nhear--genocide has occurred in western Sudan. Hundreds of thousands of \nlives are on the line. We cannot say we were not warned. We cannot say \nwe did not know. We cannot say that we lacked the means to respond. We \nare obligated, by the Genocide Convention and our collective \nconscience, to act to assist the people suffering and to prevent \nfurther violence. Immediate support for the African Union is necessary, \nbut\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nnot sufficient to respond to the situation in Darfur. In addition, we \nneed to press for a UN resolution that authorizes a multilateral force \nwith a mandate to protect civilians. We also should look outside Africa \nfor military and logistical assistance, rather than relying solely on \nthe African Union.\n  What is occurring in Darfur is a travesty. Our response has not been \ncommensurate with the suffering there. It is imperative that the United \nStates and the international community increase assistance to the \ndisplaced, and increase pressure on the government of Sudan to take \naction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2783. A bill to clarify conditions for the interceptions of \ncomputer trespass communications under the USA-PATRIOT Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Computer \nTrespass Clarification Act of 2004, which would amend and clarify \nsection 217 of the USA-PATRIOT Act. Section 217 addresses the \ninterception of computer trespass communications. This bill would \nmodify existing law to more accurately reflect the intent of the \nprovision, and also protect against invasions of privacy.\n  Section 217 was designed to permit law enforcement to assist computer \nowners who are subject to denial of service attacks or other episodes \nof hacking. The original Department of Justice draft of the bill that \nlater became the PATRIOT Act included this provision. A section-by-\nsection analysis provided by the Department on September 19, 2001, \nstated the following:\n       Current law may not allow victims of computer trespassing \n     to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring \n     unauthorized attacks as they occur. Because service providers \n     often lack the expertise, equipment, or financial resources \n     required to monitor attacks themselves as permitted under \n     current law, they often have no way to exercise their rights \n     to protect themselves from unauthorized attackers. Moreover, \n     such attackers can target critical infrastructures and engage \n     in cyberterrorism. To correct this problem, and help to \n     protect national security, the proposed amendments to the \n     wiretap statute would allow victims of computer attacks to \n     authorize persons ``acting under color of law'' to monitor \n     trespassers on their computer systems in a narrow class of \n     cases.\n\n  I strongly supported the goal of giving computer system owners the \nability to call in law enforcement to help defend themselves against \nhacking. Including such a provision in the PATRIOT Act made a lot of \nsense. Unfortunately, the drafters of the provision made it much \nbroader than necessary, and refused to amend it at the time we debated \nthe bill in 2001. As a result, the law now gives the government the \nauthority to intercept communications by people using computers owned \nby others as long as they have allegedly engaged in some unauthorized \nactivity on the computer, and the owner gives permission for the \ncomputer to be monitored.\n  Only people who have a ``contractual relationship'' with the owner \nallowing the use of a computer are exempt from the definition of a \ncomputer trespasser under section 217 of the PATRIOT Act. Many people--\nfor example, college students, patrons of libraries, Internet cafes or \nairport business lounges, and guests at hotels--use computers owned by \nothers with permission, but without a contractual relationship. They \ncould end up being the subject of government snooping if the owner of \nthe computer gives permission to law enforcement.\n  My bill would clarify that someone who has been given permission to \nuse a computer by the owner or operator of that computer is not a \ncomputer trespasser. It would bring the existing computer trespass \nprovision in line with the purpose of section 217 as expressed in the \nDepartment of Justice's initial explanation of the provision. Section \n217 was intended to target only a narrow class of people: unauthorized \ncyberhackers. It was not intended to give the government the \nopportunity to engage in widespread surveillance of computer users \nwithout a warrant.\n  We don't know, of course, whether such surveillance is taking place. \nUnless criminal charges are brought against someone as a result of such \nsurveillance, there would never be any notice at all that the \nsurveillance has taken place. The computer owner authorizes the \nsurveillance, and the FBI carries it out. There is no warrant, no court \nproceeding, no opportunity even for the subject of the surveillance to \nchallenge the assertion of the computer owner that some unauthorized \nuse of the computer has occurred.\n  The Computer Trespass Clarification Act would modify the computer \ntrespass provision to protect against abuse, while still maintaining \nits usefulness in cases of denial of service attacks and other forms of \nhacking.\n  First, it would require that the owner or operator of the protected \ncomputer authorizing the interception has been subject to \n``communications activity that threatens the integrity or operation of \nsuch computer.'' In other words, the owner has to be the target of some \nkind of hacking.\n  Second, the bill would clarify that to be excluded from the \ndefinition of computer trespasser, a person who has permission to use a \ncomputer does not need to have a contractual relationship granting that \npermission.\n  Third, the bill limits the length of warrant-less surveillance to 96 \nhours. This is twice as long as is allowed for an emergency wiretap. \nWith four days of surveillance, it should not be difficult for the \ngovernment to gather sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to obtain a \nwarrant if continued surveillance is necessary.\n  In addition, the bill would require the Attorney General to annually \nreport on the use of Section 217 to the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees. Section 217 is one of the provisions that is subject to the \nsunset provision in the PATRIOT Act and will expire at the end of 2005. \nWe in the Congress need to do more oversight of the use of this and \nother provisions of the PATRIOT Act in order to evaluate their \neffectiveness.\n  The computer trespass provision now in the law as a result of section \n217 of the PATRIOT Act leaves open the possibility for significant and \nunnecessary invasions of privacy. The reasonable and modest changes to \nthe provision contained in this bill preserve the usefulness of the \nprovision for investigations of cyberhacking, but reduce the \npossibility of abuse. We must continually seek to balance the need for \neffective tools to fight crime and terrorism and the civil liberties of \nour citizens. The Computer Trespass Clarification Act strikes the right \nbalance and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to \nprohibit the double taxation of telecommuters and others who work at \nhome; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, together with my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman, to introduce The Telecommuter Tax Fairness \nAct of 2004.\n  The Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act of 2004 will put an end to an \noutdated\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nlegal doctrine that unfairly penalizes thousands of workers in \nConnecticut and in other States throughout the country whose only \noffense is that they sometimes work from home.\n  Technology has changed the way business is conducted in America. With \nthe use of cell phones, lap-top computers, email, the Internet, mobile \nnetworking, and many other telecommunication advancements of the 21st \ncentury, Americans have a greater flexibility in where they can work \nwithout compromising productivity. Many citizens now choose to work \nfrom home or alternative offices when their physical presence is not \nnecessary at their primary place of work.\n  Telecommuting provides enormous benefits for businesses, families, \nand communities. It helps businesses lower costs and raise worker \nproductivity. It reduces congestion on our roads and rails, and in so \ndoing it lowers pollution. It helps workers better manage the demands \nof work and family. And last but not least, it can mean lower income \ntaxes.\n  Yet, the many benefits to workers of telecommuting are today placed \nin jeopardy because of current law in New York. Today, New York State \nrequires that workers pay income tax on income even if it is not earned \nin the State through their ``convenience of the employer'' rule. While \nthere are several States that have the ``convenience of the employer'' \nrule, no other State applies it with the same rigor as New York.\n  New York's ``convenience of the employer'' rule requires that by \nworking for a New York employer, all income earned from that employer \nmust be declared in New York so long as the worker ``could'' perform \nhis or her duties in New York. A worker for a New York employer who \nworks part-time from home in Connecticut or another State is still \nsubject to taxation by New York on 100 percent of his or her income. At \nthe same time, the work done by that worker in a State outside New York \nis subject to taxation by that State.\n  This unfairly subjects many workers who telecommute from their homes \nor from satellite offices outside of New York to a double tax on that \npart of the income earned from home. According to Connecticut's \nAttorney General, thousands of Connecticut residents alone are affected \nby this unfair double taxation.\n  This potential for double taxation is not only unfair, but it is an \nincentive for workers not to telecommute, when what we should be doing \nis providing an incentive to encourage telecommuting.\n  Legislation is needed to protect these honest workers who deserve \nfair and equitable treatment under the law. The Telecommuter Tax \nFairness Act of 2004 does this specifically by preventing a state from \nengaging in the current fiction of deeming a nonresident to be in the \ntaxing State when the nonresident is actually working in another State. \nIn doing so, it will eliminate the possibility that citizens will be \ndouble-taxed when telecommuting.\n  Establishing a ``physical presence'' test--as this legislation would \ndo--is the most logical basis for determining tax status. If a worker \nis in a State, and taking advantage of that State's infrastructure, the \nworker should pay taxes in that State.\n  Some suggest that the double-taxation quandary can easily be fixed by \nhaving other States provide a tax credit to those telecommuters. \nHowever, why should Connecticut, or any other State, be required to \nallow a credit on income actually earned in the State? If a worker is \nworking in Connecticut, he or she is benefiting from a range of \nservices paid for and maintained by Connecticut including roads, water, \npolice, fire protection, and communications services. It's only fair \nthat Connecticut ask that worker to help support the services that he \nor she uses.\n  This is not just an issue which deals with a small group of citizens \nfrom one small State. Rather, this is an issue which affects workers \nall over the country. It will only grow more pressing as people and \nbusinesses continue to seek to take advantage of new technologies that \naffect the way we live and work.\n  I hope our colleagues will favorably consider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of \nBrown v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, easily one of the \nmost significant legal decisions in American history. But today I want \nto talk about another anniversary that is rapidly approaching, and that \nis an anniversary that flows directly from the Brown decision. I am \nspeaking of the Little Rock Central High desegregation crisis which \noccurred in 1957. The 50th anniversary will be here in a couple of \nyears, 2\\1/2\\ years, in 2007.\n  I come to the floor today to speak on behalf of the so-called Little \nRock Nine and to share their story of determination and opportunity. I \ncome to the floor also to urge my colleagues to join me in this effort \nto help fully support the planned Little Rock Central High Museum and \nVisitors Center and get it back on track so it will be up and running \nto host the 50th anniversary of the Little Rock Central High crisis.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that it is just as important today that \nwe spend time understanding the civil rights struggle and the civil \nrights movement in this country as it was in 1957. I am thrilled to \nhave the support, the encouragement, and the assistance of the \nCongressional Black Caucus chairman, Elijah Cummings.\n  As you know, Brown did not erase the hatred and the prejudice that \nBlack families face in this country. One of the most dramatic examples \nof that occurred on September 24, 1957, when President Dwight \nEisenhower ordered Federal troops to Little Rock, AR, to allow nine \nBlack children to attend the all-White Little Rock Central High School.\n  In fact, if one looks back on 1957, the two largest world news \nstories that year were Sputnik and the events surrounding Central High \nSchool in Little Rock. The Little Rock Nine changed the course of \nAmerican history by claiming their right to receive an equal education.\n  These students were Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray \nKarlmark, Carlotta Walls Lanier, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Terrence \nRoberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair, and Melba Pattillo \nBeals.\n  Of her experience, Melba Pattillo Beals recalls:\n\n       I had to become a warrior. I had to learn not how to dress \n     the best, but how to get from that door to the end of the \n     hall without dying.\n  These are very serious times. Another one of the Little Rock Nine, \nErnest Green, explains why the Little Rock Nine sacrificed their \ninnocence for a chance at a better education. He said:\n\n       We wanted to widen options for ourselves and later for our \n     children.\n\n  Well, Mr. Green went on to become the first black student to graduate \nfrom Arkansas Central High. He later served as Assistant Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Affairs under President Jimmy Carter and as vice \npresident of Lehman Brothers.\n  Without his courage and determination and those of the Little Rock \nNine in 1957, those opportunities would never have been available to \nhim.\n  Turning opportunity into achievement is what civil rights pioneer \nDaisy Bates had in mind for the Little Rock Nine when she encouraged \nthem to do the unthinkable. As a story, Little Rock Central High has \nall the elements of a great story, starting with the premise in the \nDeclaration of Independence where it says all men are created equal.\n  Those words, penned by Thomas Jefferson, resonate throughout American \nhistory, but in 1954 the U.S. Supreme Court came down with the Brown \ndecision where it said that separate but equal is not constitutional, \nand we need to change our American educational system ``with all \ndeliberate speed.''\n  There was a Governor in my State who was committed to States rights, \nand he was determined to stop any changes at Little Rock Central. There \nwas a President who was seeing his duty as one of having to enforce \nFederal law even against a State's will. There was a nation torn apart \nby race and searching for a new and sound public policy and public \nphilosophy for civil rights for all Americans. There was a city, a \nState, and a region that got caught up in the events, and the emotions \nofttimes, and there were dozens of local leaders who were working at \nodds and at cross-purposes, many with their own personal and political \nagendas, some trying to build and some trying to destroy.\n  Then, of course, in the center of the hurricane there were the nine \nblack children, showing superhuman courage, facing incalculable odds \nbut striking a severe blow at one of the worst injustices in American \nhistory.\n  I recommend to my colleagues that if they want to read more about \nthis crisis, they can read Harry Ashmore's history of Arkansas, or Roy \nReed's ``Faubus.'' Both give an excellent coverage.\n  Little Rock Central High School today is a symbol. It at the same \ntime symbolizes the best and the worst in American history. It \nsimultaneously stands as a living monument to our dark past and to our \nbright future. It also stands for progress because Little Rock Central \nHigh School has been a remarkable school since 1957. It is consistently \nacknowledged as one of the best American high schools that we have in \nthis country today.\n  In fact, I had the privilege in the late 1970s of attending Little \nRock Central High School. I think I am the only Member of Congress who \nactually went to that school. I am very proud of being there and proud \nof all of the things that school stands for.\n  Little Rock Central High was designated as a unit of the National \nPark Service in 1998. In fact, in 2002 more than 24,000 people visited \nthis historic site. They expect probably 60,000 by the year 2007. \nUnfortunately, the interim visitors center is only 500 square feet. One \ncan slice it or dice it however they want to say it, but it is simply \ntoo small to house the significant history there and tell all the \nstories. In fact, if it was jam packed, it would only have room for \nabout 35 people.\n  I was there for the 40th anniversary of the Central High crisis when \nPresident Bill Clinton and Governor Mike Huckabee symbolically opened \nthe door for the Little Rock Nine. We are going to have another \ncommemoration in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the crisis. I want to \ninvite my colleagues to help join me in making sure we get the extra \n$5.8 million necessary to make this museum and visitors center a \nreality.\n  The last thing I would like to say is it took nine young high school \nstudents to prove to our Nation that all men are created equal and that \nthe rule of law is paramount in democracy of the United States. Today, \nchildren all over America have the right to learn because of the \ncourage and sacrifice the Little Rock Nine made, and I am here today \nasking for my colleagues to help us all recognize what\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nthe Little Rock Nine did and acknowledge them by allowing this visitors \ncenter to be built.\n  I am submitting a resolution as we speak, and I ask my colleagues to \nsign on if they would like to. Also, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Lincoln be added as the first original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 421--EXPRESSING OUTRAGE AT THE RECENT TERRORIST \n   ATROCITIES IN BESLAN, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AND CONDOLENCES TO THE \n                        FAMILIES OF THE FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McConnell, and \nMr. Lott) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n       Whereas on Wednesday, September 1, 2004, a group of \n     approximately 30 terrorists took control of School No. 1, \n     located in Beslan, North Ossetia, Russian Federation, and \n     held approximately 1,200 Russians hostage;\n       Whereas the terrorists reportedly infiltrated the school \n     and stockpiled weapons and explosives during the ongoing \n     renovation of the school;\n       Whereas the terrorists held the captives for more than 50 \n     hours, and denied the captives, including the children, \n     access to food, water, and medicine;\n       Whereas the terrorists rigged the school with explosives, \n     including a large bomb in the center of the gymnasium where \n     the hostages were being held, and strapped suicide bombs to \n     themselves;\n       Whereas children, parents, and teachers who attempted to \n     flee, or to assist the hostages that attempted to escape, \n     were shot by the terrorists;\n       Whereas on September 3, 2004, Russian troops and the Beslan \n     hostage-takers exchanged gun fire, a bomb exploded that \n     collapsed the roof of the school, the terrorists began \n     killing the hostages, and massive loss of life ensued;\n       Whereas this horrendous terrorist action left more than 300 \n     people dead, many of them children, as well as hundreds more \n     who are severely wounded or unaccounted for;\n       Whereas the Russian people, as a result of this and other \n     attacks in recent weeks, have experienced incredible loss and \n     are experiencing immense grief as they begin the process of \n     burying their loved ones killed by the actions of these \n     terrorists; and\n       Whereas the United States has sent medical supplies and has \n     offered its moral support to the Russian people in response \n     to the terrorist attack at School No. 1: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms this \n     despicable act;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the Russian people and in \n     particular to those families who lost loved ones in the \n     Beslan school tragedy; and\n       (3) commends the efforts of the United States Government to \n     provide humanitarian and medical assistance to the people of \n     the Russian Federation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9039-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3594.

Res. 421\n\n       Whereas on Wednesday, September 1, 2004, a group of \n     approximately 30 terrorists took control of School No. 1, \n     located in Beslan, North Ossetia, Russian Federation, and \n     held approximately 1,200 Russians hostage;\n       Whereas the terrorists reportedly infiltrated the school \n     and stockpiled weapons and explosives during the ongoing \n     renovation of the school;\n       Whereas the terrorists held the captives for more than 50 \n     hours, and denied the captives, including the children, \n     access to food, water, and medicine;\n       Whereas the terrorists rigged the school with explosives, \n     including a large bomb in the center of the gymnasium where \n     the hostages were being held, and strapped suicide bombs to \n     themselves;\n       Whereas children, parents, and teachers who attempted to \n     flee, or to assist the hostages that attempted to escape, \n     were shot by the terrorists;\n       Whereas on September 3, 2004, Russian troops and the Beslan \n     hostage-takers exchanged gun fire, a bomb exploded that \n     collapsed the roof of the school, the terrorists began \n     killing the hostages, and massive loss of life ensued;\n       Whereas this horrendous terrorist action left more than 300 \n     people dead, many of them children, as well as hundreds more \n     who are severely wounded or unaccounted for;\n       Whereas the Russian people, as a result of this and other \n     attacks in recent weeks, have experienced incredible loss and \n     are experiencing immense grief as they begin the process of \n     burying their loved ones killed by the actions of these \n     terrorists; and\n       Whereas the United States has sent medical supplies and has \n     offered its moral support to the Russian people in response \n     to the terrorist attack at School No. 1: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms this \n     despicable act;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the Russian people and in \n     particular to those families who lost loved ones in the \n     Beslan school tragedy; and\n       (3) commends the efforts of the United States Government to \n     provide humanitarian and medical assistance to the people of \n     the Russian Federation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may take a moment at this late hour, I \nreflect back on the relations between the Soviet Union and United \nStates. One day--I don't remember the exact day--they had a book out \nthere, and there was someone from the Russian Embassy here, and \nSenators walked out there and wrote their heartfelt feelings about what \nhad taken place in Russia. I was so moved by that. The man who was \nthere from the Embassy was speaking very broken English, but he was so \nglad we were there. I was so glad to be able to write in that book, \nrecognizing the tremendous progress that has been made between the \nUnited States and Russia.\n  I applaud the leader for submitting this resolution. We have come \nsuch a long way. We stand in this war on terror with former enemies who \nare now our friends. Again, I applaud and commend the leaders for \nbringing this forth. This will be sent to the Russian Government so \nthey will know the Senate's sentiments representing the United States, \nand that we speak for all Americans. We send our condolences for the \nbrutal acts of these evil men in taking the lives of children and many \nother innocent people.\n  Mr. FRIST. I very much appreciate the comments made by the assistant \nDemocratic leader, especially in light of the real tragedy that played \nout before our eyes not too long ago, several days ago.\n  The resolution we passed is a resolution that addresses the brutal \nterrorist attacks that occurred in Beslan, Russia. We all, through this \nresolution, offer our condolences to the families who have lost loved \nones, and the people of Russia who continue to mourn beside them.\n  It was only last week we all watched as terrorists took control of \nthat School No. 1 in Beslan, Russia, a small southern town near the \nChechen border, and the horror, the slaughter that went on, as 1,200 \nstudents, teachers, and parents--because it was the first day of \nschool--were held hostage and were denied food and medicine and water. \nIn the horrific video, we saw individuals trying desperately to escape \nand they were simply shot. During the final massacre itself--and it was \na massacre--we saw the fear and desperation in people's faces. It \ncaptured this war on terror that we talk about a lot; it captured the \nface of terrorism.\n  The Beslan massacre stands as the most monstrous, most despicable act \nof terrorism since the catastrophic events of 9/11. More than 300 \npeople, many of whom were children, were murdered, and, as we know, \nhundreds more were critically wounded and missing. If there was any \ndoubt, there is no doubt any more. Our enemy is willing to commit any \nbarbarity to achieve its twisted aims. Our enemy is capable of shooting \ntoddlers and destroying a schoolhouse, lacing it with bombs. As we saw \non 9/11, our enemy rejoiced in the murder of innocent people.\n  The purpose of the resolution is to express the ache in our hearts \nfor the Russian people, for those dark days they must endure, and it \nalso reflects the importance of us renewing our commitment to resolve \nto defeat these forces of terror and to strengthen our determination to \ncrush those who would bring calamity upon the civilized world.\n  I want to commend President Bush for his compassion and steadfastness \nas he reaches out to President Putin and the Russian people in their \nhour of need, providing appropriate assistance and moral support from \nall of us, from the American people, as the Russian people bury their \ndead and search for meaning amid what is incomprehensible horror. We \nstand by them as reflected in the resolution. America is with the \nRussian people, and together we will eventually defeat terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9043-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9043-S9044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AUTHORIZING PRESIDENT TO AWARD GOLD MEDAL TO MARTIN LUTHER KING AND \n                        WIDOW CORETTA SCOTT KING\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 361 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 361) to designate certain conduct by sports \n     agents relating to the signing of contracts with student \n     athletes as unfair and deceptive acts or practices to be \n     regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed by \nunanimous consent to pass H.R. 361, the Sports Agent Responsibility and \nTrust Act, SPARTA. The bill would help to protect amateur athletes from \nexploitation by sports agents. I commend Congressman Tom Osborne for \nhis tireless work on this legislation and his ongoing commitment to \nensuring that amateur athletes are treated with fairness and dignity.\n  This legislation is needed because State and Federal penalties for \nagents who engage in dishonest practices to lure athletes to sign \ncontracts are seen by many groups as weak. For example, misconduct such \nas secret payments to amateur athletes, undisclosed payments to family \nor friends of athletes, unrealistic promises, pressure placed on the \nathletes, and even blackmail often go unpunished despite the severe \ndamage that their practices cause to our country's amateur athletes.\n  Under SPARTA, sports agents would be prohibited from providing false \nor misleading information, making false promises, or providing anything \nof value to amateur athletes or their families. Each violation of \nSPARTA would be deemed an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the \nFederal Trade Commission Act, FTCA. SPARTA would authorize civil \nactions by the Federal Trade Commission, State attorneys general, and \neducational institutions against violators.\n  In addition, SPARTA would serve as a Federal backstop for an ongoing \neffort by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, college \ncoaches, university presidents, and athletic directors to promote at \nthe State-level legislation developed by the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws to regulate the business practices \nof sports agents. The legislation, titled the Uniform Athlete's Agent \nAct, UAAA, would require that sports agents be registered with the \nStates in which they operate, and provide uniform State laws addressing \ntheir conduct and practices. To date, the legislatures of 29 States and \ntwo territories have passed the UAAA, but no similar Federal standard \nexists.\n  We must protect our youth from the predatory practices of those who \ndo not share their best interests. This bill represents a positive step \ntoward protecting amateur athletes and I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport in its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 361) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/09/senate-section/article/S9044-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9044-S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
