Mr. President, when I was in Minnesota last week, I read \na very disturbing news report about the\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\ncost of prescription drugs in this country. The American Association of \nRetired Persons Public Policy Institute looked at the prices charged by \nthe manufacturers of 197 brand-name prescription drugs most widely \npurchased by Americans. Last year, their average price increase was 6.9 \npercent, over three times the overall inflation rate of just 2.2 \npercent. From December of 1999 to December of 2003, for 155 of those \ndrugs on the market during all 4 years, their prices increased by a \ncumulative average of 27.6 percent compared to the general inflation \nrate of just over 10 percent. That is a price increase of over 2.5 \ntimes the overall inflation rate during the past 4 years.\n  It is not as though those drug prices were low at the beginning. Last \nsummer, my staff compared the retail prices of 52 leading prescription \ndrugs in the United States and Canada. For exactly the same drug, same \namount, same strength, made by the same company, prices in Canada were \none-third, one-fifth, even one-eighth the prices in the United States. \nThat was after factoring out the different values of the U.S. and \nCanadian dollars. So in an apples-to-apples comparison, prices for the \nexact same medicines in the United States were three times, five times, \neven eight times higher than prices in Canada. My study shows that \nAmericans are being gouged by exorbitant prescription drug prices, and \nAARP's study shows that it is getting worse.\n  Those excessive and rapidly increasing prices afflict all Americans, \nnot only senior citizens. This year, almost 12 percent of all the money \nAmericans spend for their health care will go for prescription drugs. \nThat is almost one out of every eight health care dollars. Over the \npast 6 years, prescription drug costs have been the fastest growing \npart of total health care spending in this country.\n  So if Americans are getting ripped off by the drug companies, and if \nthe problem is getting worse, then certainly President Bush and \nCongress would do something about it, right? Well, last year, the \nPresident and a majority in the Senate and House did something, but \nthey made things worse, not better. Let me restate that. President Bush \nand a majority in Congress made sure prescription drug prices could \nkeep going higher and higher and hurt most Americans, which means more \nmoney and larger profits for the drug companies. President Bush and his \nfriends in Congress helped the rich get even richer, while making the \nrest of America poorer.\n  How did they do that? Well, on the prescription drug bill that was \npassed last year, the final version that most of my Democratic \ncolleagues and I voted against, Federal health care officials are \nexpressly prohibited from negotiating or in any way affecting the \nprices being charged for prescription drugs. When prescription drug \ncoverage, inadequate as it will be, fully begins in the year 2006, the \npeople on Medicare will be buying over half of all the prescription \ndrugs purchased in America. Most of those bills will be paid at least \nin part by the Federal Government with taxpayer money at whatever \nprices are charged.\n  Imagine if you had to pay whatever someone else decided to charge \nyou. You couldn't negotiate. You couldn't refuse to pay above a certain \nprice. You would have no say; you would just pay. And you would pay and \npay and pay.\n  No wonder a bill that was supposed to cost taxpayers $400 billion \nover the next 10 years is already projected to cost over $541 billion, \na $141 billion increase, and the program has not even begun yet. I \nguarantee the program's cost will run even higher than that, as long as \nthat prohibition against price negotiating is in law. It is a license \nto exploit Americans, all Americans, since all Americans will have to \npay those higher prices.\n  Conversely, if Federal officials negotiated lower prices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, some, most, or even all of that price reduction would \naffect the prices the rest of us have to pay for those medicines. Drug \ncompany lobbyists and their friends in Washington call this price \nfixing and claim the Federal Government would destroy profitability, \nend research and development, and even cause bankruptcies. Nonsense. \nThe Federal Government can't force any vendors to sell their products \nor services below prices acceptable to them. It can't legally--except \nin a national emergency--it doesn't try to, and it should not want to.\n\n  Take the Pentagon, which is often the only legal buyer of many of its \nproducts or services. It doesn't dictatorially set some price and \nrequire some company to make a product and sell it at that price. The \nPentagon or the service branch purchaser might put the contract out for \ncompetitive bids or, if there is only one suitable provider, the \nPentagon or military officials would sit down with the company \nofficials and they would negotiate, truly negotiate, a mutually agreed-\nupon price.\n  Is that price as high as the company might charge if the company \ncould set the price as high as it would like? No, probably not. Would \nthe company agree to a price so low as to be unprofitable? No, \ndefinitely not. Does the Pentagon even want that low price? No, because \nif that company doesn't make a profit, it won't be around to keep \nproducing that product or other products.\n  Those national defense projects frequently require extensive research \nand development, then testing, then modifications, and then more \ntesting, requiring often several years before the actual production and \nsales can begin. Those costs--research and development, testing--are \nmade part of the contract, usually paid in advance of production, and \noften revised upward if unforeseen circumstances develop. The Federal \nGovernment is a partner in those endeavors and vested in their positive \noutcomes while still being, hopefully, a responsible purchaser, \nassuring that taxpayers get their money's worth.\n  Would anybody here believe the Pentagon should be prohibited from \nnegotiating the prices it will pay for what it needs, that it should be \nrequired to pay whatever prices its suppliers decided to charge? That \nwould be ridiculous and scandalous, as it should also be for \nprescription drugs.\n  That part of the new law would be bad enough for most Americans just \nby itself. But the Bush administration and its congressional allies \nwere not done helping their friends in the pharmaceutical industry. In \nour economic system, if the price of something becomes too high, you \ncan shop around for a lower price elsewhere.\n  I come from a retail family. My great-grandfather opened a department \nstore in Minneapolis in 1903. My father and uncles and thousands of \nMinnesotans and other Americans built the company into Target \nCorporation, now the country's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart. \nRetailers, especially discount retailers, understand competition. They \nexpect their customers to be looking for lower prices, better deals, \nand higher value elsewhere. They don't go to the President or to \nCongress and say: Make Americans buy from us at whatever prices we \ncharge and prohibit them from buying anywhere else.\n  That is what the drug companies wanted. That is what President Bush \nand a majority in Congress gave them. They banned what is being called \ndrug reimportation, which is actually a bit of a misnomer because many \nprescription drugs are made outside of the United States and then \nimported into this country. In fact, over $14 billion worth of those \nprescription drugs were imported legally into the United States last \nyear and sold to us at the manufacturer's prices. Neither the FDA nor \nthe companies objected as long as that massive drug importation was \noccurring at their high prices. But many Americans objected to paying \nthose prices, and many other Americans couldn't even afford to pay \nthem.\n  So they want to do what Americans can do in almost every other \nsituation in our economy--shop around for lower prices and buy them \nwhere they can find them. Lower prescription drug prices can be found \nin Canada and in other countries. The prices are much lower in Canada, \nas I said earlier, for the same product made by the same company.\n  Some Americans can actually travel to Canada because they live near \nthe United States-Canadian border. I donate all but $1 of my Senate \nsalary to the Minnesota Senior Federation for bus trips into Canada to \nbuy those lower cost medicines.\n  The Canadian Government allows pharmacists in that country to fill\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nonly prescriptions signed by Canadian doctors, and that takes an \nappointment and time and then more time to get the prescription filled. \nThus, when I went on one bus trip from central Minnesota into Canada \nand back, the entire round trip took us 19 hours--from 7 o'clock in the \nmorning to 2 a.m. the following morning. That is what I call a long U-\nturn.\n  The average savings among the 40 seniors who were on the trip was \nover $250. Almost all of them bought more than one medicine, and most \nbought a 2 or 3-month supply so they would not have to make the trip so \noften. However, even a 19-hour round-trip bus ride is not an option for \nmost Minnesotans and other Americans who live too far from Canada and \nare not able to make such a trip. The Internet is their ticket, and \nmany more Americans are discovering that possibility. They are \ndiscovering they can save hundreds, even thousands, of dollars when \nbuying prescription drugs over the Internet. Thus, many Americans--\nespecially our senior citizens--can then afford to buy medicine they \nwould otherwise have to forego at the higher U.S. prices.\n  You would think our Federal Government--which, after all, is supposed \nto be a Government of, by, and for the people--you would think the \npeople elected, appointed, or hired to serve the people, and being paid \nby the people to do so, would want to help the people save lots of \nmoney. But, again, that would mean less profits for the drug \ncompanies--still very high profits, but less very high profits.\n  Yet, incredibly, inexcusably, for this administration and the \nmajority in this Congress, higher drug company profits are more \nimportant than everyone else in America. So they made it illegal to buy \nprescription drugs outside the U.S. and bring them into this country, \nunless the Secretary of Health and Human Services guarantees their \nsafety--which he already said he will not do. If the Secretary of \nTransportation had to guarantee in advance every commercial airplane \ntrip would be safe, it would put an end to air travel as well.\n  President Bush and Congress could have written the law to require the \nSecretary and his huge agency to help people make safe purchases over \nthe Internet, as, to his credit, the Governor of my State of Minnesota, \nTim Pawlenty, has instructed our State Department of Health to do. \nHopefully, he will not be arrested by the Federal Government for \nproviding that help. If he is, I promised to help him make the bail.\n  But with this administration and with the majority in this Congress, \nthere is no help for Americans with the overpriced prescription drug \ncosts, except for another drug discount card, which, in Minnesota, is \nnow a choice of 1 out of 48 possible cards for a discount on some drugs \nwe now learn from AARP have increased a total of over 27 percent in \nprice over the last 4 years, which means they can offer a discount and \nstill make more money.\n  When this bill was passed by a majority in the House and Senate last \nyear, after the Bush administration and the industry lobbyists had \nwritten a bill in conference committee so very different from the \nearlier Senate version--which I supported--I was left with two \nquestions:\n  First, how could people vote for a bill they knew did not represent \ntheir constituents' best interests? Secondly, how did they assume they \ncould do so and still get reelected?\n  Americans don't deserve the highest, by far, prescription drug prices \nin the world--allowed to go even higher and higher. Americans should \nnot be forced to pay those exorbitant prices and be prohibited from \nbuying their medicines at much lower prices elsewhere. America's senior \ncitizens don't need another 48 discount cards to choose from. They all \nneed, and deserve, to be able to go to their neighborhood pharmacies \neverywhere in their country and buy prescription medicines at prices \ncomparable to the rest of the world.\n  That is what governments of other countries assure for their \ncitizens. That is what our Government should do for our citizens. When \nGovernment officials don't serve the best interests of the people, they \nshould no longer be Government officials. That is why we have \nelections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Michigan is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Minnesota for his eloquent remarks today. I certainly agree with \nthe sentiments he has expressed. I personally thank him for his \npersonal commitment and willingness to help fund ways for people in \nMinnesota to be able to lower their prescription drug prices. I think \nthat speaks to his personal dedication and willingness to do whatever \nhe can to help.\n  Ronald Reagan asked the question back in 1980, ``Are you better off \nthan you were 4 years ago?'' When it comes to the issue of prescription \ndrugs and the cost of medicine today, certainly the answer to that is \nno.\n  I rise today to discuss the new Medicare Drug Card Program, as my \ncolleague and friend from Minnesota has done. Yesterday, Tuesday, was \nthe first day these cards could be used. But by any measure, this \nattempt to lower drug prices has been a complete failure. We can do \nmuch better. We can give our seniors real savings if we make the \ncommitment to do that. Simply put, when it comes to Medicare, we need \nto do it again and we need to get it right.\n  From the beginning, the drug card was designed for the pharmaceutical \ncompanies and not for our seniors. That is one of the reasons why there \nis an estimate that the drug companies will receive over 8 years $139 \nbillion in new profits because of the new Medicare law.\n  That doesn't add up if the purpose is to lower prices for our \nseniors. Obviously, $139 billion in new profits demonstrates this is \nnot about lowering prices. First, because the law provided no guarantee \nand no guaranteed savings for seniors, drug companies were free to \ninflate their prices before the discount cards were issued. Therefore, \ncompanies were free to raise their prices in the last year or two in \nexcess of any possible discount seniors might receive from these drug \ncards. In fact, the prices of 14 of the top 30 brand-name drugs rose \nmore than 5 times faster than the rate of inflation from 2003 to this \nyear, virtually wiping out any discount a senior might receive from one \nof these Medicare cards. That is like a department store taking up its \nprices 50 percent and then putting a sign out front that says 25 \npercent off. If you think about it, you are not going to save any \nmoney; you are actually paying more.\n  Second, the new law gives the companies that distribute the Medicare \ncards complete flexibility to change their prices every 7 days but \nforces seniors to lock into one card for an entire year. That means you \nmight pick a particular card because it offers you a lower price on \nmedications that you take, and then in 7 days, maybe even before you \nuse the card, the price of that drug has gone up or two or three of the \ndrugs you are taking have gone up. That might make the card absolutely \nuseless, even though seniors may have to pay up to $30 to sign up for \nthe card.\n\n  Also, we know that every 7 days the discounted drugs can be changed. \nSo you wade through all of these cards, over 70 cards, to figure out \nthe one that covers the most medicines you use and provides you some \nkind of help with lower prices. You purchase that card. You spend $30. \nYou purchase a card, you lock yourself in for a year, and then you find \nout 7 days later the drugs you use are no longer on the list. Who does \nthat benefit? Who is better off under this Medicare bill? Certainly not \nour seniors. We can do much better. We need to do it again and do it \nright. This new Medicare bill needs a complete overhaul.\n  There are two ways we can lower prescription drug prices for seniors \nand all Americans if we do this right. We have two ways right now we \ncan fix this situation. First, we simply need to pass bipartisan \nreimportation legislation supported by people on both sides of the \naisle in both the House and the Senate. We have a very strong \nbipartisan coalition to allow Americans to buy American-made FDA-\napproved drugs from other countries such as Canada. All of us could \nthen save much more on prescription drugs than the small savings from \nthe Medicare drug cards.\n  Second, we can and should allow Medicare to negotiate directly with \nthe\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\ndrug companies on behalf of our seniors and the disabled to get the \nlowest possible price.\n  Why on Earth wouldn't that be the first thing we would do? Right now \nStates, Fortune 500 companies, large pharmacy chains, and the Veterans' \nAdministration use their large bargaining clout to obtain low drug \nprices. Common sense says Medicare should be doing it.\n  Regrettably, the only entity in this country that cannot bargain for \nlower group prices is Medicare. Why? Who benefits from that? Who \nbenefits from locking in up to 40 million people forced to pay the \nhighest prices? Certainly not our seniors and the disabled.\n  Because the supporters of the drug industry in Congress at the \neleventh hour inserted into the final Medicare bill a special interest \nprovision that strictly prohibits Medicare from getting group \ndiscounts, our seniors are paying top dollar.\n  We know the drug companies are powerful. We know they have over six \nlobbyists for every one Member in the Senate. We can do better, and \npeople expect us to do better than this new law and these cards.\n  If we want, we can provide real savings for Americans. I wish to \npoint to charts to demonstrate with a couple of medications what the \ndifferences are.\n  Right now for Lipitor, which lowers cholesterol, if we were to do a \ngroup discount, such as the Veterans' Administration does, our seniors \nwould pay $40.55 for a month's supply. If we were to open the border to \nCanada and allow trade, as we do for everything else, back and forth \nbetween Canada and the United States, we would be able to get that \nprice down to $35, from $40.55 to $35.04. However, if we continue with \nthis current Medicare card, the low end is $64.67 up to $74.77. This \nmakes no sense.\n\n  Right now people are being told to go out and sign up for a Medicare \nprescription drug card that will require them to pay more than we could \nget for them if we simply negotiated group prices or open the border to \nCanada.\n  Another demonstration: Norvasc, which controls high blood pressure. \nAgain, with the VA, for a little over $25, you can get a month's \nsupply; Canada, $28. But under the so-called discount card, it is \nanywhere from $41 to $49. These numbers just do not add up, and the \nseniors of this country, as well as all Americans who would benefit by \nopening the border and allowing us to do business across the border, \nare saying to us: Do it again, and do it right.\n  One more example: Protonix, which treats ulcers and other stomach \nconditions. If we were to negotiate a group price, as does the VA, the \nindividual out of pocket would pay $26.83, and through Canada, $41.60. \nUnder these new cards, they would pay from $86 to $108. It just does \nnot add up. These numbers do not add up for our seniors or for anyone \nwho is struggling to purchase medicine or to keep up with the \nincredibly high and rising prices of their health insurance because we \nknow this is a major driver.\n  In conclusion, are you better off than you were 4 years ago under \nthis Medicare law? We need to change it, and we need to get it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something I \nhave tried to address many times before in this body, and that is the \nissue of market manipulation and energy contracts specifically by the \nEnron company that have gouged my constituents for millions of dollars.\n  We have seen in the last couple of days as my own home public \nutilities district, Snohomish County PUD, was successful at getting \naudiotapes from the Enron company that showed exactly what people \nthought was happening: That people were talking about market \nmanipulation, that people were talking about schemes, that people were \nmaking jokes about $250 megawatt costs and prices that were gouging my \nconstituents on energy prices. Now we know this company has already \nbeen cited by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as having \nmanipulated the markets; now we are hearing in their own voices, in \ntheir own words, among their own employees, that this manipulation was \ngoing on.\n  The question is, what are we going to do about the market \nmanipulation that has happened and for which my consumers have been \ngouged? My own home, my own personal utility has had a 50-percent rate \nincrease since the energy crisis took place. That means my constituents \nhave been paying higher energy costs on Enron-manipulated contracts and \nother contracts during this time period.\n  One would think that once market manipulation had been admitted, once \nmarket manipulation had been documented that we would do something \nabout the market manipulation. In fact, yesterday, the President said \nwe must pass the Energy bill and we must protect consumers. I have a \nmessage for the President: This Energy bill does not protect consumers. \nIn fact, it guarantees that the market manipulation which was done by \nEnron will continue because it basically says that manipulated \ncontracts can be the standard for today. I think that is absolutely \nwrong. My constituents, in reports and analyses by California, \nWashington, and Oregon economists, have probably lost 100,000 jobs \ndirectly and indirectly from the energy crisis. We have lost a big \npercentage of our GDP. And we have had a huge increase in rates \nthroughout the State.\n  So what does that mean? That means my constituents are still paying \non those Enron contracts, and when our utilities said they were not \ngoing to pay, what happened? Enron turned around and sued utilities in \nmy State. Enron is suing my consumers saying: You still have to pay on \nmanipulated contracts.\n  Well, here is my check to Enron. Here is my $370.00 check that will \nstill have to go to pay for that Enron contract in which they have \nadmitted market manipulation.\n  I have already personally paid them hundreds of dollars on \nmanipulated contracts. So have my constituents. The question is whether \nthis body and this administration are going to do anything about market \nmanipulation, whether they are going to stand up and say that the \nEnrons of the world have taken the consumer to the cleaners and are \ngoing to let my constituents out of these manipulated contracts.\n  So while the President would like to have an energy bill, I would \nlike to have an energy bill that protects consumers. I would like to \nhave an energy bill that passes both the House and the Senate where \nMembers of this body and the other body stand up and say market \nmanipulation is wrong and we do not condone any contract as just and \nreasonable or any contract as in the public interest if, in fact, it \nhas manipulated, schemed, and put people out of their homes at a huge \ncost to many of the consumers in my State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the weekend, the world witnessed \nthe\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\nhorrible hostage-taking situation in Saudi Arabia, where terrorists \nattacked foreign oil workers and their families. I think we all know \nthat foreign workers have been an integral part of the workforce that \nproduces oil and maintains the infrastructure for oil in Saudi Arabia. \nThese cowards did not attack refineries or terminals or pipelines this \ntime. Those hard assets are supposed to be well guarded and could be \nreplaced. I am not sure they are so well guarded. Instead, the \nterrorists chose human targets to cripple the world's access to oil \nsupply. Thank God that about 50 of the hostages were rescued, but we \nmourn the more than 20 lives lost in this terrorist attack.\n  In the short run, this attack on foreigners and office facilities \ndoes not affect physical supply, but it can harm future output and \nexpansion. Investment will be eroded if there is instability.\n  These terrorist attacks are a frightening warning that terrorists may \nbe only steps away from destroying significant Saudi or other Middle \nEast production facilities. I believe America should be more worried \nabout that than anything else affecting our economic well-being.\n  It is actually a shame that we sit around and talk and do nothing to \nmake America better prepared. Does anybody doubt that the terrorists, \nif they can get in and destroy an office full of people, are not \nprepared to do some real damage to the oil supply and the \ninfrastructure, the tankers, and all the other things? I believe they \nare.\n  Terrorists' actions intensify concerns about the vulnerability of oil \nmarkets to supply disruption. We saw the price jump $2.45 following the \nweekend attack, and there are indicators in the future market that \nthose who invest in that market are investing in it heavily, which \nmeans they are gambling in a forthright and intelligent way that oil \nwill go up even more.\n\n  Instead of oil coming down because of good economic realities, the \none thing that is happening is oil is going up. We saw that jump, and \nbefore the weekend attack, oil prices were back under $40, seemed to be \nmoving a bit down in anticipation of the OPEC meeting on June 3.\n  Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, \nremarked that the signs of increased OPEC production were calming the \nmarket, but the weekend attack has again increased a sense of risk and \nnervousness that has done so much to propel the prices to $40.\n  Fears and worries of terrorist sabotage attacks and political unrest \nhave translated into a risk premium of $7 to $10 per barrel. This so-\ncalled risk premium is one of the reasons why the prices are as high as \nthey are today.\n  Given that we live in a world of increased risk, particularly with \nmounting security worries in the Middle East, it is imperative that we \ntake responsible steps to ensure our energy security today and in the \nfuture. Today, our energy security requires an emergency supply of oil \nin the event of severe disruption. Saudi Arabia is the largest OPEC \nproducer and the OPEC country with the largest extra capacity to \nincrease supplies. A major disruption of Saudi oil that we cannot \nrespond to with the SPR would harm our energy security and the economy \nfar more than $40 a barrel of oil.\n  The President is right to preserve the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nfor times of dire need, not as a political gesture to abate high \nprices. And, yes, while prices are high today and they do hurt, today's \nprices are still below the energy prices America has borne in past \nyears.\n  The SPR is designated and designed to be a national security asset, a \nnational security blanket. It is not there to deal with supply and \ndemand imbalance, which is the true source of higher prices.\n  What we have today is a long-coming trend of tightening supply and \nincreasing demand. Changing our treatment of SPR cannot fix that \nproblem. I fear that changing SPR policy will actually end up hurting \nus. What do my colleagues think OPEC would do if we suddenly changed \nSPR policy? From their standpoint, they could easily solve that by \nchanging their output response. It would not take much, just a little \nbit, and they would negate any significant positiveness that comes from \nreleasing SPR oil.\n  We have 660 million barrels of oil in SPR. We import 11.5 million \nbarrels a day. About 5 million of those 11.5 million barrels a day are \nfrom OPEC. That means we have about 60 days' supply if there is a \ncomplete disruption to our imports and about 120 days' supply if only \nOPEC supplies were interrupted. SPR is not there just to deal with \npotential Middle East supply problems.\n  Weather forecasters predict an intense hurricane season for the \nAtlantic and gulf coasts, which would affect domestic and natural gas. \nAs I see it, it is a shame that we are not ready to produce an energy \nbill and that we are still debating what this Senator likes, what that \nSenator likes, what the Democrats like. We have tried very hard to \naccommodate, but we cannot. SPR is our insurance policy against natural \ndisasters as well as supply interruptions. We need SPR full and ready \nto serve in the event of an emergency. Past experience has taught us \nthat trying to use it as a price control does not work. The bottom line \nis that changing our treatment of SPR does not lead to quick fixes in \nthe market.\n  The energy bill that I have been fighting to pass in the Senate is \nabout future energy security. The energy bill is not about quick fixes \nto the oil and gasoline market; it is a policy plan to move us into the \nfuture with a broader portfolio of resources and improved supply and \ndemand balance. The energy bill will increase natural gas and domestic \noil production that helps balance supply with growing demand.\n  The Energy bill will remove the 2-percent oxygenate mandate, which \nwill make it easier to refine and easier for refineries to make \ngasoline that can be traded between regional markets. It is clearly \nvery positive for America.\n  The Energy bill addresses the proliferation of boutique fuels. There \nare a number of State-specific gasoline formulations that have made \nrefining more challenging and market efficiency poorer. The Energy bill \nwill promote further research in hydrogen power that is the potential \nfuture for transportation. We have to get started. The longer we wait, \nthe more we risk being blamed for an American disaster.\n  I will keep coming to the Senate floor to drive home the point that \nwe need to pass an energy bill. Someone called today's energy situation \n``a crude awakening.'' It is, indeed. It is time for us to wake up and \ndo something about it. The American public deserves action. They \ndeserve an energy policy that takes care of them today and in the \nfuture.\n  I believe there is a real probability that those who lead our country \ntoday, including the Senate--perhaps excluding those who have tried, \nthose who have voted for a new policy--but I believe there is a chance \nthat the leaders of today will be blamed for the disasters of tomorrow. \nThey will not be little disasters if, in fact, we cannot stop the \nterrorists from their activity. I believe the leaders of Iraq are \noptimistic, and I am glad because they want terrorists out of that \ncountry. But terrorists are everywhere. Believe you me, they are in \nSaudi Arabia. Believe you me, that is fragile. Believe you me, they are \nlooking at the fragileness of the Saudi situation. I believe they can \nalmost do what they like. They are close. I understand they know what \nis going on in the oil patch of Saudi Arabia. I am very worried. \nFrankly, I don't want to go down in history, when this event happens, \nand have it said we did nothing. I will continue to try. Many in this \nbody will continue to try to make America's energy portfolio more \ndiverse, with different uses so we can face the future with a little \nmore hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6303-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6303-S6305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NATO\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is hard to turn on the television \nwithout seeing the stirring images of the Allied landings on D-Day. I \nthink in the heart of every American there swells a pride in these \nscenes, and what was accomplished on that day truly stands as one of \nthe most historic achievements in recorded history. I think what was on \ndisplay on D-Day with our Allies was a commitment to freedom, a \ncommitment to the rule of law, a commitment to humankind that has made \nthis world a better place in which to live.\n  As I reflect on these images, which we will share with our European \nallies,\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nI am also, unfortunately, reminded of what I experienced this last \nweekend in Bratislava, Slovakia, at the NATO Parliamentary. It has been \nmy privilege since being a U.S. Senator to participate in many NATO \nParliamentaries. This time, the majority leader, Senator Frist, asked \nme to chair our trip to this important meeting. It is the first time I \nhave gone when I have been the only Senator in attendance. I hope that \ndoes not mean there is less of an interest in security. I think, \nunfortunately, what it means is the many claims on the time of Senators \nbegin to compete with what is increasingly becoming regarded as an \ninstitution of diminishing value. I think that is unfortunate.\n  Before I left, I read a book by Robert Kagan. It is a small book, but \nits message is powerful and important. The title is ``Of Paradise And \nPower: America and Europe in the New World Order.'' Basically, the \nmessage is that the values that bring NATO together in the first place, \nthe values that have held it together through the cold war, are values \nthat are changing now and stressing NATO in ways that many are \nunwilling to face up to.\n  For the Record, I would like to read the first paragraph. I think it \nsays very clearly the problem. Says Mr. Kagan:\n\n       It is time to stop pretending that Europeans and Americans \n     share a common view of the world, or even that they occupy \n     the same world. On the all-important question of power--the \n     efficacy of power, the morality of power, the desirability of \n     power--American and European perspectives are diverging. \n     Europe is turning away from power, or to put it a little \n     differently, it is moving beyond power into a self-contained \n     world of laws and rules and transnational negotiation and \n     cooperation. It is entering a post-historical paradise of \n     peace and relative prosperity, the realization of Immanuel \n     Kant's ``perpetual peace.'' Meanwhile, the United States \n     remains mired in history, exercising power in a anarchic \n     Hobbesian world where international laws and rules are \n     unreliable, and where true security and the defense and \n     promotion of a liberal order still depend on the possession \n     and use of military might. That is why on major strategic and \n     international questions today, Americans are from Mars and \n     Europeans are from Venus: They agree on little and understand \n     one another less and less. And this state of affairs is not \n     transitory--the product of one American election or one \n     catastrophic event. The reasons for the transatlantic divide \n     are deep, long in development, and likely to endure. When it \n     comes to setting national priorities, determining threats, \n     defining challenges, and fashioning and implementing foreign \n     and defense policies, the United States and Europe have \n     parted ways.\n\n  What we don't realize at an official level is how badly we have \nparted ways.\n  But what Mr. Kagan wrote, I observed in starkest and tragic relief in \nBratislava, Slovakia. It was not all bad. I would describe what I saw, \nin the language of that great Clint Eastwood western--I think the \nEuropeans would hate a reference to a western in a speech like this--\nbut that title was ``The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.''\n  There was much good. Let me tell you, for me, first and foremost was \nthe good that the British representatives did. I say thank God for the \nBrits and for a strong leader like Mr. Blair. They continue to provide \na bridge between an America and a Europe going in different directions. \nIt is sometimes difficult for them, but their hearts are stout and \ntheir backs are strong and they are great Allies. They were on D-Day \nand they are still on this day.\n  Second, another good: The first meeting I attended was about the \nNATO-Russia relationship. The Russians made a presentation. It was \ngreat to be in a room where we were talking about issues in which \nRussia, though out of NATO, was able to communicate with NATO, express \nits feelings, its concerns. But then, after they made their \npresentation, some of the things they said caused me to wince. I was \nabout to make a comment to contest a few of the points they had made, \nbut I didn't need to. An Estonian did it for me, then a Latvian, then a \nPole. They contested as equals--equals of Russia--things which they \nsaid were not the truth, not factual, not real, and certainly not the \nwhole story.\n  It was thrilling to see. I asked myself as I watched this, Why is \nthis happening? Why can an Estonian stand on equal ground with a \nRussian and debate as an equal? It occurred to me with great clarity: \nBecause of the U.S. military's marriage to NATO and because the U.S. \nmilitary continues today what it did from the founding, that visionary \nfounding by Congress and Harry Truman; that is, to put actual bullets \nin our budgets to provide an umbrella of security for Europe that was \ncredible to the Soviet Union. It was a thrilling thing to see.\n\n  I remember when I first came to the Senate and I was on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I was given an assignment to help pass the first \nexpansion of NATO, postfall of the Berlin Wall. Many of the questions \nraised were: What will this do to Russia coming out of communism, \ntrying to come into the Western world? What will it do to a fragile \ndemocracy they are trying to build? Isn't this just cold war? And yet \nsome of us said, while we respect those concerns, these new members--\nthe Poles, the Czechs, the Hungarians--are needed for new blood in NATO \nbecause we were getting stale and we needed their input. We needed \nsomeone in membership to understand what the boot of tyranny on the \nback of the neck was like, and they did, as we all know.\n  We won that debate. The vote was large. It was lopsided. But it took \na lot of work to make that argument successful. We did succeed and NATO \nwas expanded indeed through these countries, each of which had suffered \ngreatly under the Soviet Union at various times when they had uprises.\n  But now I have to say that what we promised would happen in these \ncountries has actually occurred. You have Slovakia, the Czech Republic, \nand Romania. These are not perfect democracies. But guess what they \nare. They are now democracies. They are pursuing the rule of law. They \nare allowing free enterprise. They are developing emerging middle \nclasses. They have become job magnets for European capital. They are \njoining the European Union. They are now part of the free world. And \nthe lever was NATO. But that is the good.\n  Now I have to tell you what I thought was bad.\n  Two reports were given on Saturday. They were not my reports. One was \nmade by a German and one was made by a Frenchman.\n  The first report was about the post-9/11 commitment that NATO had \nmade with respect to Afghanistan. You will remember the only time \narticle V has ever been invoked was after 9/11. We had been attacked. \nArticle V says if member countries are attacked, it is an attack on \nall.\n  In response to that attack and the issuance of article V, NATO was \nsupposed to go to work. And they made commitments, according to this \nreport, of things they would do in Afghanistan.\n  According to the report which I listened to, it was readily admitted \nthat a reasonable attempt was made at the first commitment and that the \nother three were not even attempted and were utter failures.\n  That is what their report said. That is what I heard.\n  They went on to cite the fact that helicopters were needed. Lift was \nneeded so their soldiers could actually participate, but that the \nmember countries of NATO wouldn't send any helicopters. The troops they \nwere sending came with such operational restrictions by their \ngovernments that all they could do was defensive work. They couldn't \nhelp in the war. They were restricted by their governments from making \na contribution.\n  Let us say the Americans were fired upon. They couldn't help. If they \nwere fired upon, they could fire back. That is what the report said. I \nwas stunned to hear it. But that is what I heard--four commitments; \nthree were utter failures and one attempt.\n\n  The next report was made by a Frenchman who talked about the exciting \ndevelopment in the European Union to develop a European defense \ninitiative in which they would develop rapid response forces that could \ndo what he described as ``St. Petersburg tasks.'' Lipservice was given \nthat this could be done with NATO. But when you consider what was \nsupposed to be done with NATO in fulfilling the earlier commitments, \nthese St. Petersburg tasks had nothing to do with that and were \ncompletely unrelated to what NATO needed them to do.\n  What I heard bad was there was soaring rhetoric, everybody there \ntalked about their superpower, and everybody knew their budgets. While \nthis rhetoric was going north, their budgets were heading south. It was \nscary.\n  I made the comment that if they were going to fail in their first \nresponsibility and divert limited resources to\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\na new initiative connected to the EU and leave NATO hollow, that would \nhave a serious negative impact on America's commitment to NATO--and it \ncertainly would to this Senator's commitment to NATO. There was just \nquiet when I responded in that fashion.\n  The French reporter who was making this report about the new European \ndefense initiative noted how critically poor America was at \npeacekeeping, and what a poor job we do at rebuilding a country. I \nnever thought that was true with Japan or Germany.\n  Then a Brit responded to him. She said she had recently been in \nBosnia and it is fact that NATO is going to turn over its operational \nresponsibilities in Bosnia to this European force. She said she heard \nthe Kosovars said, We don't trust the EU, we trust the Americans, which \ncertainly flies in the face of the charge that we are no good at \npeacekeeping. I thanked her for noting what I did not have to say. The \nKosovars and the Albanians believed their freedom came from American \nefforts--not European Union efforts.\n  Those are the bad things. Let me tell you about the ugly things.\n  When I left on Sunday to fly home, I reflected upon 9/11 and the \narticle V guarantee that had been issued and how the European Union had \nnot been able to, or our members in Europe had not able to, fulfill \ntheir Afghan responsibilities. I thought about how unfair it was to \nmothers of American troops, and we as a government have said credibly \nso that Estonians can talk to Russians as equals that if they are \nattacked we will go to war--thermonuclear war, if necessary. But if the \nUnited States is attacked, the response in Afghanistan--a NATO \ncommitment--has been we will apply defense for ourselves, and we will \nfall short of fulfilling our promises.\n  That is the first ugly thing--the first ugly realization I left with.\n  The second was this: I heard from country after country in Central \nand Eastern Europe how they were being pressured as new members of the \nEuropean Union not to be cooperative with America on security issues.\n  That makes me angry. I think that is really ugly.\n  I was reminded of the Commissar about a year ago when these new NATO \nmembers put an article in the Wall Street Journal saying they stood \nwith America on the war on terrorism and the President of the French \nRepublic fearing these new countries would be a Trojan horse for the \nAmericans and a challenge to the Franco-German leadership of Europe \nthat was opposing the American effort--that somehow they had not acted \n``well-born.'' Those are his words.\n  He went on to add, warning: I was sad to learn, that is being \nadministered in subtle but powerful ways to these new EU members. He \nsaid it could cost them membership in the EU. It has not done that.\n\n  Then Chirac said:\n\n       Beyond the somewhat amusing or childish aspects of the \n     matter [the matter being the letter of support in the Wall \n     Street Journal] . . . it was dangerous. It should not be \n     forgotten that a number of the EU countries will have to \n     ratify enlargement by referendum. And we already know that \n     public opinion, as always when it's a matter of something \n     new, have reservations about an enlargement, not really \n     seeing exactly what their interest is in approving it. \n     Obviously, then, [what the central Europeans have done] can \n     only reinforce hostile public opinion sentiments among the 15 \n     and especially those who will hold a referendum. Remember \n     that all it takes is for one country not to ratify the \n     referendum for [enlargement] not to happen. Thus, I would say \n     that these countries have been, let's be frank, both not very \n     well brought up and rather unconscious about the dangers that \n     too quick an alignment with the American position could have \n     for them.\n\n  I conclude with the words of Edmund Burke, that nations have no \npermanent friends, only permanent interests.

Mr. President, I will use leader time this morning to \ncomment about a number of matters.\n  I return, as most Members have, from our home States, and I feel a \nnew sense of optimism about what we can accomplish in America for the \nremaining months of this Congress.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with South Dakotans of all ages when I \nwas home. I was reminded during those conversations of the hope and \nresilience that characterize Americans, even in difficult times. The \npeople I talked with spoke frankly about the serious challenges we are \nfacing, but they also expressed a belief that together we can overcome \nthose challenges. And they are right. Their sense of resolve is a great \nreminder for us all.\n  When we left Washington for Memorial Day recess, the Senate had ended \n5 weeks of procedural wrangling that left many of us frustrated. We \naccomplished much less than we should have in those 5 weeks. What we \ndid accomplish, though important, took far too long. Remarkably, when \nwe finally did reach agreement on a couple of key issues, some \ninfluential voices actually complained. Why? Because bipartisan \nprogress does not suit their political strategy. They would actually \nprefer Congress do nothing between now and November because they want \nto blame Democrats for inaction.\n  When we left for the recess, I was seriously concerned that such \npolitical gamesmanship in the Senate could result in a lot of name-\ncalling and finger-pointing this summer but very little progress for \nthe American people. We owe our country more than that.\n  On Memorial Day, I spoke at a ceremony at a veterans cemetery in my \nhometown where my father is buried. There were veterans there from my \nfather's war, World War II, from Vietnam, Korea, and the Persian Gulf \nconflict. There were guests who have friends and family members today \nserving in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Yesterday I spoke to about 500 young men who were attending Boys \nState in South Dakota. This is the 35th anniversary of my own week at \nBoys State. The young men who are part of Boys State this weekend are \namong the best and brightest in my State. They are there because they \nare natural leaders. They care deeply about the future of our country. \nSome of them will no doubt join the military. From the oldest veterans \nat the cemetery to the youngest delegates at Boys State, the people I \ntalked with at home reminded me Americans have always done what was \nneeded to be done to make a better future.\n  Congress can do the same now. These are difficult times economically \nfor the middle class. The last time we found ourselves in the situation \nlike this was in 1992. Then, as now, the monthly bills were getting \nbigger but wages were not keeping up. Then, as now, we were told the \neconomy was getting better. But whatever ``recovery'' there was did not \nseem to be reaching the middle class. Then, as now, there was a feeling \nthat leadership was out of touch with what was going on in most of \nAmerica.\n  But then, over the next few years, the leadership in Washington, our \nGovernment, started putting the interests of the Nation ahead of \nspecial interests. We focused on creating jobs and reducing crime and \nbalancing the budget. With the help of the American people we did all \nthree.\n  Between 1992 and 2000, 22 million new jobs were created. We lowered \nthe crime rate and turned record deficits into surpluses. We restored \nstrength to America's economy and strengthened America's leadership \nposition in the world. We worked with our allies and NATO to confront a \nruthless dictator in Europe who was engaged in ethnic cleansing and \nended his brutal reign. A victory in Kosovo proved how successful we \ncan be with our friends when we work together and share the burden \nconfronting global threats.\n  The situation today may be a little tougher and the solutions may be \nmore complex, especially on the international front, but the \nfundamental truth remains. Americans still know we can work our way out \nof this. That is the sentiment I heard back in South Dakota. We have \ndone it before; we can do it again.\n  I am confident the American people will rise to the challenges of \ntoday as\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nwell. And we need to meet those challenges with them. We must make the \nneeds of hard-working Americans a higher priority than passing more tax \nbreaks. Congress must put the well-being of patients ahead of the \nprofits of HMOs and drug companies so we can finally address the health \ncare crisis in a meaningful way. We must return to a foreign policy \nthat recognizes the value of listening to military leaders and working \nwith all of our allies.\n  These are commitments the American people want from this Congress. In \nrecent weeks, we have gotten a glimpse of what we can accomplish if we \nput aside politics and focus on the larger task at hand.\n  Two weeks ago, for example, we had a promising bipartisan development \nregarding the transportation bill. After several disappointing \nexperiences with conference processes last year, we have reached a \ngood-faith agreement on how we can proceed with the transportation \nconference. I am hopeful we can get a good bill to the President soon.\n\n  There are some people who think Congress should do little or nothing \nmore of any consequence before we adjourn in October. They see \npolitical advantage in gridlock. We need to reject cynical calculations \nsuch as these. Doing nothing may be good for some people's political \ncampaigns, but it does not do good for America. It is not good for the \nmillions of middle-class families looking to Congress for help with \nreal and every-day needs. We cannot wait until the new Congress is \nsworn in next January. We need to be working together now.\n  Last week I participated in my fourth annual Technology Summit, which \nhas become now an annual event in Sioux Falls. Bill Gates and other \ntechnology industry leaders spoke. About 1,000 people came to hear how \nnew discoveries in science and technology can help solve even the most \nseemingly intractable problems.\n  One of the people at that summit was a brilliant 29-year-old \nneuroscience researcher who got his Ph.D. at the University of South \nDakota and is doing breakthrough work unlocking the secrets of the \nhuman mind. If he can learn how the human mind works, surely we can \nfind a way in this Senate to work together on the challenges facing \nAmerica.\n  If young people are willing to go to war for America, surely we can \nagree to call a political truce in the Senate for at least the next \nseveral months so we can deal with some of the real problems facing \nmiddle-class families.\n  As my fellow South Dakotans reminded me over and over again last \nweek, we have met the challenge of difficult times before. Together we \nmust do so again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6306-S6307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as we are waiting for some of \nthe deliberations on the Department of Defense authorization bill, I \nthought it might be worthwhile to call to the attention of the Senate \nan amendment I will be offering at a later time having to do with our \nNational Guard.\n  The National Guard has performed magnificently, heroically, and with \ngreat professional skill, as well as patriotism. When I wore the \nuniform of this country as a member of the U.S. Army Active-Duty back \nin the late 1960s, the National Guard was a much different creature. \nToday, as the Presiding Officer so well knows, the National Guard is, \nin many cases, as skilled as, if not even more skilled in particular \nskills, the regular Army. Thus, when we encounter a threat to the \ninterests of the United States and have to respond abroad, as we have \nboth in Afghanistan and Iraq--especially in Iraq but before that in the \nBalkans--the National Guard is called on to supply so many of those \ntroops.\n  My wife and I make it a point on holidays such as Thanksgiving to \nhave Thanksgiving dinner with troops in different parts of the world. \nOne time we found ourselves with our troops in Bosnia. At that \nparticular point in one of those camps out in the fields where we had \nthat Thanksgiving dinner, of that entire U.S. military force, which was \nour ninth year in Bosnia helping stabilize that place from the \nfratricide and killing that occurred there before, lo and behold, who \nwere those troops? Those troops were the National Guard. In that \nparticular case, it was the National Guard unit from Pennsylvania. They \nknew they had a 6-month tour of duty and then they would go home--\nremember, the National Guard members have their civilian jobs, and what \nthey signed up for also encompasses if there is an emergency in their \nState, they are under the control of their Governor.\n  Now we find that we have entered a new era in which we are stretched \nto the limit on our regular Army troops and almost as if it is an \nexpected thing of replacing regular Army with National Guard. Of \ncourse, something is going to have to change, and I think the head of \nthe National Guard and the head of the Reserves are addressing this \nbecause they are quite concerned that over time, they are going to see \npeople not reenlisting in the Reserves and the Guard, and in order to \ncompensate for that and encourage that, I think we are going to see our \nmilitary leadership is going to be setting forth an agenda where Guard \nand Reserves would have a more certain anticipation that within a \nperiod of years, say, 4 years, they would serve a number of months of \nactive duty. I hope that is going to solve some of the problems; \notherwise, people might be voting with their feet as they leave the \nNational Guard.\n  The thrust of my remarks is to tell about when the National Guard is \nactivated, as it has been very heroically from my State--the Florida \nNational Guard was, in fact, in Iraq before the war started. We went in \nthere with special operations troops, and they have performed \nmagnificently. Initially, they thought they were going for 6 months. \nThen they understood 12 months. But in some cases, they were extended \nto 14 and 15 months.\n  So in those long deployments, what happens back home? The families \nare anxious naturally. The families are usually without the primary \nbreadwinner in the family. The families--the remaining spouses and the \nchildren--are often facing a new kind of not only emotional problems \nbut financial problems, not even to speak of the question of the \nfinancial situation facing the employer back home.\n\n  What should we do? Talk to any National Guard commander and he will \ntell you that a most important support for those families is the Family \nAssistance Centers. We have them all over the country. They did not \nused to get nearly the attention they do today because when fully \nimplemented, when fully funded, when giving the attention to the \nfamilies back home while their loved ones are abroad, they are giving \nthem counseling, they are helping them get proper counseling on \nfinancial management, and they are serving as a center point for \nnetworking among the other National Guard families while their loved \nones are deployed overseas.\n  Thus, last year, when we had this very same bill on the Senate floor, \nthe Department of Defense authorization, I offered an amendment, and it \nwas accepted, providing $10 million for these Family Assistance \nCenters. This is $10 million out of a $400 billion-plus DOD \nauthorization bill. It was accepted. A lot of that $10 million has not \nbeen allocated in the last year. Lo and behold, we are seeing some \nresistance to doing the same thing.\n  I wanted to give notice to the Senate that coming up will be my \namendment authorizing $10 million for Family Assistance Centers for our \nNational Guard families at home. It is one of the least things we can \ndo because it has been so effective. It has been so effective over the \ncourse of the past year. But right now, they are anticipating that they \nare not going to have those resources because they are not in the \nNational Guard budget. I want to make sure it is going to be in the \nNational Guard budget.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, before we get started \ndiscussing the substance of the amendment, I think it is important that \nI make a comment about how the amendment came about, and that this is \nthe Daschle-Graham amendment. Senator Daschle has been gracious enough \nto let me offer the amendment, but the truth is, without his support it \nwould never have happened.\n  I have enjoyed tremendously working with him and others to try to \nfind some common ground in terms of helping our Guard and Reserve \ncommunities facing unprecedented problems from the war on terrorism. \nThey are doing a terrific job, just as are our active-duty troops. This \nhas been a bipartisan effort. We worked on this last year. Senator \nDaschle offered the amendment last year. We made some progress. There \nwas a compromise reached for the uninsured Guard and Reserve members to \nhave $400 million to allow them to have full-time health care through \nthe military health care system. That program was not implemented to my \nsatisfaction. I doubt if Senator Daschle was pleased, but at least we \ndid make some progress.\n  Chairman Warner has been very gracious in allowing us to offer this \namendment and has tried to work with us at every turn. Senator Clinton \nwas one of the original cosponsors, along with Senator DeWine. I could \nmake a fairly lengthy list of Republicans and Democrats who tried to \nfind some common ground when it comes to the Guard and Reserve \ncommunity and their participation in the war on terrorism. What we have \nbefore the Senate today is a result of that bipartisan effort.\n  I listened to Senator Daschle talk about his visit to South Dakota. I \nhad a similar visit in South Carolina when people kind of urged us to \nget our act together and do more in common, find some common ground up \nhere. I think we found that today.\n  Guard and Reserve members, most Americans would assume, are covered \nin terms of military health care, but they are not. I think most \nAmericans find it surprising that if you join the Guard or Reserve you \nare not entitled to military health care unless you are activated. The \ntruth is, if you are a Guard or Reserve member, you have to work at \nleast one weekend a month and 2 weeks a year. But the big joke among \nthe Guard and Reserve is, ``What a heck of a one weekend a month, 2 \nweeks a year job'' because so many of them have been called to active \nduty for extended periods.\n  By the end of this year, 40 percent of the people serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will be members of the Guard and Reserve, called to active \nduty for probably a year or more. The reason that is so is because the \nGuard and Reserve community possesses unique skills that are essential \nto winning the war on terror. Mr. President, 75 percent of the people \nflying the C-130 in Afghanistan and Iraq come from the Guard and \nReserve community. These air crews come from Air Guard units and Air \nReserve units.\n  The C-130 is an indispensable asset in the war on terrorism. It is a \nfour-engine prop plane. It was not the leading edge weapons system in \nthe cold war. But when it comes to the war on terrorism, it can land in \nshort spaces and take off in short spaces and haul people and cargo \nunder some pretty adverse conditions. When I toured Iraq last year with \nfellow Senators, we had nine C-130 flights going in and out of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. All nine flights were manned by Reserve crews.\n  Ninety percent of the people in the civil affairs component of the \nmilitary are Reserve or Guard members. What do the civil affairs folks \ndo? They are the ones who go around to Afghanistan and Iraq and teach \ndemocracy. They help local government organize at the equivalent of a \ncity or a county level. They are helping judicial systems start. They \nare civilian lawyers and judges and administrators who leave small \ntowns and big towns and they offer their service to the military. That \nservice is being offered in Afghanistan and Iraq and is completely \nindispensable. We will never win the war on terror unless we get some \ndemocratic principles in the Mideast, and the civil affairs units are \nthe leading edge folks providing that service.\n  Another group that is highly valuable that is heavily laden in terms \nof Guard and Reserve participation is military police. I know our \nPresiding Officer is a former member of the Reserve component, legal \nofficer. He probably has a lot of MPs from Alabama who have been called \nfrom active duty to go to Afghanistan and Iraq and Bosnia and perform \nthat function.\n  The military police force has a way to go. Major combat operations \nare over, but we know from our PC screens, what we read and hear from \nwhat is reported from our troops, Iraq and Afghanistan are very \ndangerous places. What we are trying to do is create order out of \nchaos. The military police are not only trained in combat skills but \npolicing skills. High numbers of the military police units that are \nbeing activated to thwart the war on terrorism come from the Guard and \nReserve communities. Most of them have civilian connection to law \nenforcement. They come from small towns all over America--from Alabama, \nSouth Dakota, and South Carolina. They are two of the five cops \ndeployed because they are military police Reserve or Guard units.\n  The point of this discussion is to try to inform the body that the \nreason the Guard and Reserve community is so heavily utilized is \nbecause it has unique assets and skills which are essential to win the \nwar on terror. The commitment from this group will continue to grow \nprobably over time--not less.\n  It is now time for the Senate, the House, and the administration to \nwork together to upgrade the benefits of the Guard and Reserve \ncommunity.\n  One of the big problems we find from the war on terror is about 25 \npercent of the people called to active duty from\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\nthe Guard and Reserve community are unable to go on active duty because \nof health care problems. That percent of the people in the Guard and \nReserve do not have health care insurance in the private sector.\n  In my State, our adjutant general, Stan Speers, who has done a \nwonderful job leading our National Guard, says about 50 percent of the \npeople in the National Guard in South Carolina have no health care in \nthe private sector. What happens when you are called up? You have \nrigorous military standards in terms of being activated and sent off to \nwar. The leading disqualifier for going onto active duty after being \ncalled from the Guard and Reserve is dental problems.\n  When you think about it, a lot of private health care plans have very \nlimited dental coverage.\n  What we have been working on for well over a year is to provide full-\ntime access to Guard and Reserve members and their families to military \nhealth care called TRICARE. If you are called to active duty from the \nGuard or Reserve, or if you join the Active-Duty services, you will \nbecame a member of TRICARE. Our chairman, Senator Warner, is the father \nof TRICARE. It was through his initiative that we created this large \nnetwork of hospitals and doctors that go beyond the limits of the base. \nWe signed up doctors and hospitals all over the country and the world \nto provide health care to our military members and their families. \nTRICARE is getting better every year. It is a free benefit.\n  But for those who serve in the military, you earn what you are \ngetting because nothing is really free. You are risking your life for \nour freedom. But there is no contribution required of Active-Duty \npersonnel.\n  What Senator Daschle, myself, and others have tried to do is cover \nthis problem for the Guard and Reserve community in a creative fashion. \nLet us allow them to enroll in TRICARE. What would be the benefit of \nthat for their country?\n  Number one, our Guard and Reserve would have continuity of health \ncare. They would be in a health care system that is providing quality \nhealth care. It would be a great recruiting tool. If you join the Guard \nor Reserve, you and your family would be eligible for military health \ncare. That would be a good attraction to get new people to come in. It \nwould be a great retention incentive for people to stay in who have \nalready signed up because they could get their health care through the \nmilitary. It would be a great relief to employers.\n\n  The unsung hero of this whole operation in terms of the Reserve \ncommunity is employers. If you go without your employer for a year or \ngreater, many employers pay the difference between active and civilian \npay.\n  More times than not, when a person is called to active duty, they get \na cut in pay. Their military pay is less than their civilian pay. Their \nfamilies suffer because the military members stand in harm's way. The \nsupport network for the Guard and Reserve is not nearly what it is for \nActive-Duty people. They get a cut in pay.\n  We are trying to lessen the effects on hardships on families. We are \ntrying to make it an incentive for Guard and Reserve participation.\n  Here is how the program would work. If you join the Guard or Reserve, \nyou and your family would be eligible to enroll in TRICARE, if you \nchose to. You would be asked to pay a premium. Unlike your Active-Duty \ncounterparts who receive this without any cost sharing, you would be \nasked to pay a premium. I think that is fair. The premiums we set up, \nmirror what Federal employees have to pay in terms of their match for \ntheir health care. It is a good deal for the Guard and Reserve members \nand their families. It lessens the cost. It would be a shared \nresponsibility, for the member would have to contribute and the \nGovernment would have to contribute.\n  I didn't know this until I got into this debate. If part-time Federal \nemployees work 16 hours a week for the Federal Government, they are \neligible for full-time participation in our health care plan. If you \nare a temporary employee, after a year you are eligible for full-time \nparticipation without a Government match. I think that is a good idea. \nI think this is fair and balanced for part-time Federal employees.\n  I think it would be a shame for a part-time citizen soldier not to at \nleast have that benefit. We are not talking about a normal job. \nEveryone who serves this country by working for the Government is doing \na good thing. People in the Guard and Reserve are not only serving \ntheir country in a positive way, but they are literally risking their \nlives. They take a cut in pay. They go from home into harm's way. Last \nmonth, the casualty rate among the Guard and Reserve community had a \ntremendous bite because there are more and more Guard and Reserve \npeople in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is going to stay the same or get \nworse over time because we can't win the war without these people.\n  This amendment would allow, if the members chose, a chance to join \nTRICARE for themselves and their families. They would pay a premium, \nand the Government would pick up the match.\n  The committee markup allows the Guard member to join and pay a \npremium. It requires the employer to pay the remaining amount of the \nTRICARE premium.\n  I appreciate that effort, but the reason I think that misses the mark \nis because a lot of Guard and Reserve members don't have a private \nhealth care plan with which to cost share. You are going to have a very \nconvoluted system. And at the end of the day, I feel very strongly we \nshould not outsource the health care needs of the Guard and Reserve \nfamily--to be shared by the military member and the private sector \nalone.\n\n  I think it is very important for us in the Senate and in the House to \nsay this is a government responsibility also, that it is fair to ask \nthe Guard and Reserve family and member to contribute. But I think it \nis incumbent upon us to also have the Government contribute.\n  I have yet to find a taxpayer who is upset with the idea that we are \ngoing to pick up some of the health care costs for our Guard and \nReserve members and their families for protecting our freedom.\n  The cost of the program: It depends on who you ask. But the latest \nCBO estimate is about $5.4 billion over a 5-year period. I think there \nare ways to lessen that cost, and I will be very openminded to that. \nBut we are talking about a $2.2 trillion budget, and a defense budget \napproaching $400 billion.\n  My question to the body is, Is that $1 billion a year a wise expense \nof money? The question is, Can we afford not to? This is about two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the entire military budget; 300,000 families \nwould be affected. These families are being called upon to do more as \nGuard and Reserve members than at any other time in the history of the \nNation. They don't have health care provided to them by the Government, \neven though they are fighting to make sure we are all free. That is an \ninequity we need to fix. A cost-sharing arrangement between the \nGovernment and the military member is the way to go. It would help our \nemployers greatly.\n  If you hire a Guard or Reserve member, and if they can sign up for \nmilitary health care, it is less expensive for you to hire them and \nthey became a more valuable employee. The employer community has \nsuffered greatly in this war. They have gone without key employees for \nwell over a year's time. They have been paying the bills as if the \nperson were still there, and they need some relief.\n  I hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, pass this amendment that \nSenator Daschle, myself, and others have worked on for well over a \nyear. This amendment, simply stated, would allow Guard and Reserve \nmembers and their families access to full-time military health care, so \nwhen they are called they will be fit to fight, that they will have the \nsecurity that continuous health care provides families, and they will \nnot be bouncing around from one group to the next.\n  This is what often happens. If you are in a health care plan in \ncivilian work, you are called to active duty, you leave that health \ncare plan to go into TRICARE. On one of the C-130 crews I was flying \nwith, there were two first-time dads on the crew. One of them had a \nprivate plan with Southwestern Bell that continued health care for the \nfamily voluntarily. They do not have to do that. The other was a \nrealtor who had private health insurance. When he was\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\ncalled to active duty, his wife had to change doctors and hospitals. \nThat was very traumatic.\n  We can lessen that trauma. We can give an option to the military \nmember and their family, the Guard and Reserve military member, to have \nthe same set of doctors and hospitals year round. They do not have to \nbounce from one group to another. When they are called off active duty, \nthey lose their TRICARE eligibility within less than 6 months and have \nto change doctors and hospitals twice. It creates a serious disruption. \nTwenty-five percent have no health care in the private sector. This \nwould solve that problem.\n  In terms of the money, it is the best deal you will ever find to \ndefend America. It will save money. If 25 percent of the people called \nto active duty cannot be utilized because of health care problems, a \nsmall investment in their health care makes good sense from a business \nequation.\n  If necessary, we will find offsets.\n  I hope the Senate today, in a bipartisan fashion, will extend TRICARE \nhealth care benefits to every Guard and Reserve member who chooses to \nsign up in a cost-sharing fashion to make sure those people are ready \nto go to war when called, that their families are better taken care of, \nand that the concerns of continuity of health care will finally be \naddressed forever.\n  This is affordable. It is the right thing to do. Our Guard and \nReserve families and members have earned it. They have earned this \nbenefit.\n  I yield for my colleague, Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. To frame what this debate is about, if I might ask my \ndistinguished leader to let me interject on my time period, there is no \nstronger proponent of Reserve benefits than this humble Senator from \nVirginia. I served in the Marine Corps Reserve for some 12 years. I \nhave some basic understanding of the tremendous and vital importance of \nour Reserve Forces and the need to try to give them as much possible \ncare. Our bill has gone a long way to do that.\n  I will go into the details of the $700 million--$300 million \nincreased expenditure by the administration on behalf of the Reserve \nand $400 million by the Senate Armed Services Committee. However, my \ndistinguished colleagues from South Carolina and South Dakota wish to \nadd into this bill a $700 million cost. It is not offset in any way. \nConsequently, if this amendment is adopted and we go to conference, we \nhave roughly $700 million already in the bill, which improves the life \nof the reservists, and on top of that, they are suggesting an \nadditional $700 for this fiscal year, but the outyear bills are just \nenormous. It would be $700 million in the fiscal year 2005 and $5.7 \nbillion over 5 years and $14.2 billion over 10 years. We are talking \nabout a very significant, permanent entitlement for the reservists \nwhich is extremely costly. From where do those dollars come? Out of \nreadiness, new equipment, and other needs of the Armed Forces.\n  Essentially, that would be my basis for the objection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of our \ndistinguished Chair and compliment him on his leadership and the effort \nhe has made to put this bill before the Senate. I will come to the \nreservations he has raised in a moment.\n  Let me begin by thanking my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham, for his tremendous leadership on this issue. It has been a true \npleasure for me to have had the opportunity to work with him these past \n18 months on this legislation. We come from quite different \nbackgrounds, different approaches and philosophies, but on this issue \nin particular, I have enjoyed immensely the opportunity to work with \nhim. I compliment him on his statement just now and on the remarkable \nwork he has done to date.\n  Let me also compliment and thank Senators Leahy and Clinton for their \nwork and role on our side, and certainly Senator DeWine and others on \nthe Republican side for their involvement.\n  As Senator Graham noted, this is a strong bipartisan effort involving \nmany Senators on both sides of the aisle. The votes that have been \ntaken already indicate the depth of support and enthusiasm for the \namendment Senator Graham and I are offering again this afternoon.\n  I am sure most of our colleagues had the same experience I did last \nMonday. We spoke at Memorial Day events. We recalled the sacrifices \nmade by our men and women in uniform now for more than 220 years. I am \nsure many of our colleagues in particular focused on the commitment \nmade by our men in uniform today. Now, more than 800 men and women have \nbeen killed in Iraq in recent years; 122 have lost their lives in \nAfghanistan; more than 5,000 have been injured.\n  I have been to Walter Reed Army Medical Center on numerous occasions \nto visit the injured who are from South Dakota. If my colleagues shared \nmy same experience, they were moved by the patriotism, by the depth of \nfeeling and support for our troops and our country as we gathered to \ncommemorate Memorial Day again this year.\n  Over and over again, I saw cars with bumper stickers proclaiming \n``support our troops.'' I propose that supporting our troops entails \nmore than expressions of support from the heart, as important as they \nare. We need to support our troops emotionally and rhetorically with \nour bumper stickers, but if we mean what we say, supporting our troops \nalso must go to supporting their needs.\n  That is what Senator Graham and I are again proposing with this \namendment: to support our troops in a realistic and meaningful way that \nmatters to them. That really is what this amendment does. It recognizes \na need.\n  It also recognizes today an inequity. As my colleague from South \nCarolina noted, 40 percent of those boots on the ground today in Iraq \nare reservists, members of the Guard and Reserves. Madam President, \nthere are 160,000 Reserve troops--1,200 from South Dakota--now on \nactive duty. That is a dramatic departure from past practice.\n  In the past, it was active duty personnel who performed these roles. \nIn the past, it was active duty personnel, augmented at times through \nhistory by the draft, who gave us the manpower we needed to do the job \nwherever it may have been required. But in the post-Cold War period, \nour military practices have changed dramatically. Now we are turning to \nour Guard and Reserves. We are saying: You need to fill the gap. You \nneed to defend your country.\n  Now it is more than just a weekend commitment each month. Now it is a \nyear, and in some cases 2 years of your life, giving up your job, \ngiving up your time with family, exposing yourself to life-threatening \ncircumstances. Now you are doing it.\n  Madam President, 40 percent on the ground--that is vastly different \nthan what it was just a few years ago. So this amendment attempts to \ndeal with the inequity of troops on the ground fighting for their \ncountry in Iraq: one troop sitting right here with full health \ninsurance for himself and his family; the other troop, right here, with \nabsolutely no health insurance coverage at all. How in the world today \ncould that be fair? And how in the world, in the name of supporting our \ntroops, can we accept that?\n  I want to see those ``Support Our Troops'' bumper stickers, but I \nwant it to mean something. I want it to mean what we say. We are \nsupporting our troops and their needs. And this is their greatest need.\n  I acknowledge the work done by the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the ranking member. They have addressed this issue. I \nacknowledge the support they have shown. We have come some way, some \ndistance in the last 12 months, but there are five crucial differences. \nFor the record and for the information of our colleagues, I want to \nwalk through those differences, if I can, just briefly, because it is \nour argument for why we need the amendment offered by Senator Graham \nand myself and others.\n  First is coverage. Under the committee bill, only those reservists \nwho can gain the consent of their employer will be allowed to \nparticipate. We believe the fate of reservists in the private sector \nshould not be determined by their employer's attitude.\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\n  Why should they have to get approval from their employer to get \nhealth insurance from their Government--fighting for their country, as \nthey now do in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world? To me, that \ndoes not connect. Employer support is helpful, but employer approval to \nget Government benefits does not seem, to me, to be the approach we \nwant to subscribe to, and I think it sets a very dangerous precedent.\n  The second is cost. The committee bill requires the reservist's \nprivate-sector employer to pick up 72 percent of the cost of the \nreservist's health care premium. So unless the reservist's employer is \nprepared to pay 72 percent of the premium for the reservist, that \nemployer is not going to sign off on the health care coverage. The \nemployer is going to say: I would love to do it, Joe, but I can't \nafford it. You are telling me to do something I would love to do.\n  My colleagues and I know how these things work. I have talked to a \nlot of awfully good employers, awfully good small employers, who \nvirtually break down when they tell me how it hurts for them to make a \ndecision between offering employment and offering benefits and \nrecognizing they cannot do both. We have thousands of employers in \nSouth Dakota who would give anything if they could offer benefits to \ntheir employees. But to tell those employers they are going to have to \npay 72 percent of the cost, I guarantee you, almost 100 percent of the \nemployers will say they can't do it or they would have done it by now.\n  Now, as it relates to cost, yes, the chairman is correct. The cost of \nthis program in the first year is $696 million. Madam President, $696 \nmillion sounds like a lot of money, and it is--$5.7 billion over 5 \nyears. But, as the Senator from South Carolina said so well, do you \nknow what that amounts to in terms of the percent of the defense \nbudget? In percentage terms, for the defense budget, this represents \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent. That is what we are talking about, two-tenths \nof 1 percent, to follow through with the commitment that we, as a \nnation, must make when we say: ``Support Our Troops.''\n  I think we can afford two-tenths of 1 percent. And, as Senator Graham \nsaid so well, we cannot afford not to. I will get to that in a moment.\n  The third difference is reimbursement. Under our amendment, if a \nreservist's family opts to retain their personal doctor rather than \nenroll in TRICARE when the reservist is activated, the family can do \nso. We want to give the family the option of choosing the best coverage \nfor themselves, and the Defense Department would simply pick up a \nportion of the family's private health care premium. That is all we do. \nYou choose. You are not going to be penalized for whatever choice you \nmake.\n  The fourth difference is the amount of the annual premium. Under our \namendment, an individual reservist can obtain health coverage for about \n$1.37 a day. The reservist with a family could obtain coverage for \nabout $4.90 a day. The committee bill does not specify how much a \nreservist would have to pay, and they leave it to DOD.\n  I think reservists will tell you: We like the certainty of knowing, \nas we make our choice, what it is going to cost. And $1.37 a day is \n$1.37 more a day than Active-Duty personnel pay. And $4.90 a day is \n$4.90 a day more than Active-Duty personnel pay for family coverage. So \nthe reservists are already paying more than what their counterparts \nright next to them in the line of battle are required to pay today, \neven though they are both defending this country.\n  Finally, the last difference has to do with deductibles and \ncopayments for doctor visits. Unlike the committee bill, we ensure that \nthe reservist would not face an annual deductible or copayment for \ndoctor visits. The committee bill does.\n  So those five specific differences are why we have come to the floor. \nWe acknowledge the commitment and the effort made by our chairman and \nranking member and others on the committee to address this issue. But I \nhave to say, for two-tenths of 1 percent of the entire defense budget, \nwe will be able to say to our reservists: We are not only going to \nsupport you rhetorically, we are going to support you with what you \nhave told us is your single greatest need and concern today.\n  There are three reasons I think we need to adopt this legislation: \nFirst, because it is the right thing to do. I don't know how you \nexplain, today, to a member of the Guard or the Reserves, who soon \ncould be stationed in Iraq for perhaps 2 years that even though he is \nrequired to pay for his health insurance and his Active-Duty \ncounterpart is not, that we are not even going to give him even that \nchance at coverage, but we want him to defend his country. I do not \nthink that is right. That is inequitable, that is unfair, and this \namendment addresses it.\n  The second is retention. Senator Graham mentioned this so well. We \nhave some very serious concerns about retention in our Guard and \nReserves, for good reason. For a lot of them, this is not what they \nbargained for; this is not what they were told. We have the best Guard \nand Reserves we have ever had, the best we have ever had in history. If \nwe do not want to go back to those bad old days, in my view, of the \ndraft--and we have a bill pending, S. 89. I get asked all the time: \nWill there be a draft?\n  I tell them: No, I don't think you have to worry about a draft. Why? \nBecause the volunteer Army has worked. Why? Because the Guard and \nReserves are filling that void, that gap that we used to call upon the \ndraft to do. But if we see the attrition and the erosion in support and \nthe reduction in the enrollment and re-enlistment, we are going to pay \na very heavy price. I cannot think of a better inducement for re-\nenlistment than this.\n  Finally, the third reason is simply the need. You can check the \ncategory, but across the board, one out of every five of our members of \nthe Guard and Reserves has absolutely no health insurance today. In the \nage groups below 30, it is even higher, almost 40 percent. So there is \na need that we need to address.\n  So I enthusiastically join my colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Graham, in asking our colleagues, once again, \nto do what they have done in the past: Support the effort to provide \nthis needed benefit. It is needed, not only for purposes of addressing \nan inequity that I think has been long overdue, but also real concerns \nabout retention and parity. If we are all going to do what we said we \nwere going to do last Monday, during our Memorial Day speeches--\n``support our troops''--let's do it more than with bumper stickers and \nrhetoric.\n  Let's do it immediately. Let's help them. Let's provide them the \nassistance they tell us would mean more than anything else we could do \nfor them right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues for no more than 2 \nminutes.\n  I listened intently to our distinguished Democratic leader as he \noutlined his proposal. Correct me if I am wrong, but I understood him \nto say that when a reservist goes on active duty, he has to worry about \nhis costs.\n  Could I direct the Senator to title 107(4)(a) entitled ``Medical and \nDental Care'' which explicitly says for anyone, reservist or guardsman, \non active duty for 30 days or less, they are entitled to it. There is \nno problem. They are treated exactly as the Active-Duty individual. So \nmay I ask the Senator to refer to that statute and review the remarks \nthat he made to the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if I may respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, I would simply say that he reads and interprets \nthe law correctly. He said it just as the law reads. While on active \nduty for that 30-day period, there is no difference. But what about \nbefore and after? What about the families and what about the \nopportunities accorded those families when the need arises? There isn't \nany accommodation. I think we have to take into account the universe of \nsupport we provide through health benefits for Active-Duty personnel.\n  I stand by my statement concerning the disparity that exists today. I \ndon't want to take anything away from Active-Duty personnel. They \ndeserve every dollar of support we provide them through good health \ninsurance. All I am saying is that today, given the dramatic change we \nhave seen in the makeup of our military and the role\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\nnow that the Guard and Reserves play, the Guard and Reserves, for a \npersonal commitment that I outlined in my remarks a moment ago--$1.37 a \nday for individuals, $4.90 a day for families--ought to be entitled to \nthat same level of confidence. Today the law denies that.\n  I thank the Senator for asking the question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I appreciate that the Senator at least \nclarified that point. I would like to point out also that in the \nexisting bill, we have added 6 months after demobilization in a \ntransition to civilian life. They are entitled to these same benefits. \nIt isn't as if we drop them the day they walk out of the gate, having \nserved with distinction in his or her service on active duty.\n  I think we are framing this debate correctly. We have to look at the \nassociated costs with this permanent entitlement program which is being \nproposed. Bear in mind, particularly to my colleagues who have had \nexperience in the military themselves, we are narrowing the gap between \nthe benefits for reservists and guardsmen and those who commit to \nenlistment for 5 years or those who aspire to be careerists for 20-plus \nyears. Pretty soon people are going to say, why should I become a \nregular member of the U.S. Army and sign up for commitments of many \nyears when I can stay in the Reserve and just about get all the same \nbenefits that a regular gets? Once we start that breakdown, I dare say, \nmy dear friends, we will have a lot of difficulty recruiting for the \nActive Forces and much less difficulty recruiting for the Reserve and \nthe Guard.\n  I believe the Senate is under an order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6312-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as to the points of the pending amendment \nthat the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from South Dakota \nhave spoken very eloquently about with regard to their amendment, I \nwill interject briefly my own observations and strong opposition \nbecause I believe that the Armed Services Committee structured a very \nadequate program for the Reserves.\n  I direct the attention of Members to page 135 and thereafter in the \nbill on each desk, which outlines what the committee did. Roughly, the \nPresident's bill had $300 million in allocations toward additional \nbenefits for the Reserve and Guard. The committee went beyond that and \nadded another $400 million, and now along comes this proposal which \nwould add on top of that another $700 million.\n  We are really beginning to face quite a severe dollar problem because \nunless this amendment is defeated, it would require the conference to \nseek out cuts in other military programs, all of those programs having \nbeen carefully evaluated by the two committees, the House and the \nSenate, and reduce them by some $700 million. That is the bottom line.\n  The other reason I feel very strongly about that this proposed \nlegislation is not in the best interest of the services, it really \nbegins to provide for the Reserve and Guard Forces in a manner that is \ncommensurate with the Active-Duty military personnel.\n  Stop and think. When a young person--and oftentimes that person now \nhas a family with a wife and vice versa as the case may be--sits down \nand evaluates their life and how they would like to make a commitment \nto service in uniform to this country, suddenly they look at the \nalternatives. Well, there is the Active and we get a certain degree of \nbenefits under the Active; then there is the Reserve or the Guard, and \nthey compare the benefits that they would get under that program. If \nthis legislation is passed, it is beginning to close the last gap \nbetween the benefits on the Active side and the benefits on the Reserve \nand Guard side.\n  Now, one might say, well, Senator, when the Reserves are called to \nactive duty, they perform just as the Active member, and that is \ncorrect; they take the same risk as the Active member, and that is \ncorrect; the family assumes much the same hardships as the Active \nmember, and that is correct. But when the Reserve completes his or her \nobligation of a callup, they return to the Reserve status, they return \nto their homes, they return to their civilian jobs and their life in \nthe civilian community with such obligations as their Reserve or Guard \nrequirements require.\n  The Active person perhaps finishes their overseas commitment, they go \nback to the training base, they are fully in the military, fully \nsubjected to the regimen of the military, fully subjected to going \nright back overseas on a very short turnaround basis. We have witnessed \nthat during this conflict period covering the AORs of Afghanistan and \nIraq. But the regular soldier, sailor, airman, and marine, when they \ncommit to a tour of duty of 3 or 4 years' obligated service, or the \nofficers accept their commissions and obligate themselves for 4 or 5 \nyears, whatever the case may be, they understand that, but it makes for \nequity and fairness that the Active rolls have some benefits that \ncompensate for the rigors, the constant risk, the constant disruption, \nthe constant moving of the Active-Duty Force, unlike the reservist who \nis called back for a period of time, then released to go back to their \ncivilian jobs and their homes. They could own that one home, whereas \nthe military soldier, the careerist on active duty, often has to get a \nhome, sell it, go get another one, sell it, move, move, sell, rent. \nThose are hardships for which I think through the years the Congress \nhas carefully balanced out an equitable formulation of the benefits for \nthe Active Force and the Guard and Reserve.\n\n  This amendment makes a very substantial closing of that gap, and I \nthink it will be an inducement for young people now to go into the \nReserve and Guard because they are going to have just about the same \nbenefits as the individual on active duty, but they can stay in their \nhomes, stay in their jobs, perform their weekends and 2 weeks in the \nsummer active field training. They can match both their civilian life \nand their Guard and Reserve life and balance it in such a way as to \nbasically stay home. That is not so with the regular force.\n  So when we reported out the bill S. 2400, we went further than the \nSenate has ever gone before to improve health care benefits for Reserve \nmembers, and it reflects our Nation's growing reliance on their \nservice. When a Reserve or Guard is called up, within 30 days--and I \nthink in a respectful way I brought this to the attention of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader--they are treated just as an active \nRegular once they go on that active duty. We have added permanent \nTRICARE coverage before and after mobilization and created a new option \nfor the Reserves and their families to participate in TRICARE while \nthey are enjoying the benefits of civilian life. They have an option \nbut they have to pay something for it.\n  The bottom line is we are dealing with the taxpayers' money. That is \nwhat we are dealing with, the taxpayers' money, and it is quite a \nconsiderable commitment under this amendment.\n  Our fundamental disagreement is how we achieve these goals. The \ndifference, again, is cost. The amendment would be $700 million for \nthis 1 fiscal year, $5.7 billion over the ensuing 5 years, and $14.2 \nbillion over a 10-year period from adoption. We are under stringent \nbudgets these days, and our military is very much in need of \nmodernization, new equipment, additional training, reconfiguration, \nparticularly the U.S. Army, and all those are costly\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nitems. If this amendment were adopted, it would draw down on that \nability of modernization.\n\n  Our statistics show the vast majority of reservists and their \nfamilies, at least 85 percent according to the Comptroller General, \nhave health coverage from their employers. Recruitment and retention \namong Reserves at the present time is not a crisis. So this is not a \nrecruiting tool.\n  So I ask my colleagues, why, then, should we respond to increasing \ncalls to the Reserve providing health care compensation in a civilian \ncapacity that is so costly as to guarantee erosion of funding needed \nfor readiness requirements of the other military branches? Under S. \n2400, all become eligible for TRICARE when they are mobilized in \nsupport of a contingency. All are eligible for 6 months additional \ncoverage after they are demobilized. Mr. President, $200 million is set \naside for a demonstration project to provide coverage for the \nunemployed and the uninsured.\n  In addition to these new benefits, let us not forget that all \nreservists and their families are eligible to enroll in the Reserve \ndental insurance program, in which the government pays 60 percent of \npremiums for reserve families whose sponsors are mobilized for more \nthan 30 days; and all reservists who retire with 20 years of creditable \nservice are eligible for TRICARE for life when they reach age 60.\n  Colleagues, the amendment will duplicate private insurance, handing a \nwindfall to the insurance companies who are now paying full premiums \nfor coverage of civilian-employed reservists. The amendment asks the \ntaxpayers to take the place of employers in providing health care \ncoverage for reserve members while they enjoy the benefits of civilian \nemployment and civilian life.\n  The underlying bill also includes authority for appointment of an \nindependent commission on the future roles and mission of the reserves. \nThis commission would examine all the proposals for enhancements to \ncompensation and benefits of Reserve members that have been proposed in \nlight of changes in current and future roles.\n  We should not more blindly into a permanent and costly government \nentitlement for reservists while, unlike their active duty \ncounterparts, they are enjoying the benefits of civilian life, and \nearning benefits in their civilian roles.\n  This is the fundamental basis for the reserve: an option, desirable \nto many, to maintain civilian employment and benefit status and \ncivilian lifestyles for the majority of their careers, while serving in \nreserve for the nation's active military components.\n  Let us not ignore the significant investment and improvements in the \nunderyling bill for reserve members and their families, which are \naffordable for this country, today and in the future.\n  So I think we have hit a very balanced program in the committee bill \nacted upon by all members of the committee. To the best of my knowledge \nit was voted out unanimously by committee. I hate to see this treatment \nof the hard work of the committee. They are entrusted, by virtue of \ntheir assignments on this committee, with making the tough decisions as \nto how best to balance the benefits given to the Guard and Reserve and \nthose in the Active Force. And I come back to the American taxpayer who \nhas to foot a very considerable permanent guarantee, the entitlement \nunder this program for many years.\n  At this time I yield the floor.\n  Would the Chair advise the Chamber with regard to the time remaining \nunder the control of the Senator from Virginia and the control of the \ntwo proponents of the measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time there is no pending time \nagreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the two managers of the bill and the \nproponent of the underlying amendment, together with Senator Daschle. \nThey would be willing to start a vote at 3:30. However, I don't think \nthere is that much more talk on this amendment. We will have a vote at \n3:30 for the convenience of some Senators. We could complete the debate \nfairly soon, within the next 10 or 15 minutes, and then if the Senator \nfrom Virginia wanted to lay down the $25 billion amendment, we could do \nthat and get started on that, and then we would stop at 3:30 and have \nour vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is a very good suggestion. We \nthen seek unanimous consent to vote, now, at 3:30, with the \nunderstanding that in the interim period we could set the amendment \naside, bring up another amendment, and then terminate debate on that \namendment at the established 3:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand we will soon be carefully scripted by our \nvery able staff.\n  Mr. REID. We can be carefully scripted, but the point is, what the \nintent of the manager of the bill is that we will vote at 3:30 on the \nDaschle-Graham amendment. Then prior to that time we would have a few \nminutes remaining on this amendment. Then we would go off this, go to, \nI believe it will be a bipartisan amendment of Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin about $25 billion, debate that for a while, vote, and \nthen go to the recognition time for the World War II veterans. Then, if \nthe leader decides to come back after all that is done, tonight we \nwould be on the $25 billion amendment and either vote on that tonight \nor some other time because under the order, as I understand it, that is \nnow entered, tomorrow morning we go to the Cantwell-Graham problem we \nhave.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as usual our distinguished colleague has \nstated the facts with accuracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending request is \nwithdrawn. Who seeks time? The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WARNER. Not on time yielding, as I understand it; whoever seeks \nrecognition. I have had a time to speak. As I understand it, my \ncolleague from Michigan----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I just have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, this is going to be a \nunanimous consent that is going to be entered formally, but it has not \nyet been entered; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The suggestion has \nbeen made.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I just need 10 minutes to speak on the \namendment.\n  Just to conclude this debate, this debate has been going on for a \nvery long time, more than a year, on how to best take care of the Guard \nand Reserve Forces in terms of their health care needs. It is an honest \ndebate, sincere debate. Mr. President, 85 Members of the Senate voted \nlast year on this very amendment. I think I understand why they voted \nto extend health care benefits to the Guard and Reserve, full time, and \nwith the premium to be paid for them. It makes sense for our military \nneeds. Forty percent of our people in Iraq and Afghanistan are going to \nbe Guard and Reserve members.\n  Let me explain as best as I can how this works. If you are a member \nof the Guard and Reserve today, while you are serving in that capacity \nyou have absolutely zero health care benefits offered to you from the \nmilitary. A part-time Federal Government employee, a temporary Federal \nGovernment employee receives health care benefits. So go home and \nexplain that one. You can be a part-time Federal employee, work in the \nSenate or the House, and you get health care. You can be a part-time \ncitizen soldier, training to defend America, and you get zip.\n  Now, it is true when you are called to active duty you get everything \nan Active-Duty person gets. The reason is because you are on active \nduty. That is not that great of a benefit, to pay you like somebody \nright next to you and to give you the same benefits because you are \ndoing the same job. The point we are trying to make is, there is a \nproblem in the Guard and Reserve community when it comes to health \ncare. Mr. President, 25 percent of the people called to active duty, as \nI stated before, from the Guard and Reserve community are unable to go \non active duty\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\nbecause of health care problems. I would argue that we need a better \nhealth care network covering our Guard and Reserve members and their \nfamilies, from a readiness point of view.\n  Let's talk a little bit about retention. The head of the Army Reserve \nsaid yesterday--and this is back in January--that the 205,000-soldier \nforce must guard against a potential crisis in its ability to retain \ntroops, saying serious problems were being masked temporarily because \nreservists are barred from leaving the military while the units are \nmobilized in Iraq.\n  In this prison abuse scandal what we found was that the MPs in that \njail, and some of their associates, were due to go home, but they \ncouldn't go back home because they were needed in Iraq, and they had \nthe rug pulled out from under them, causing tremendous morale problems.\n  ``This is the first extended duration war our Nation has fought with \nan all-volunteer force,'' said LTG James R. Henley, the head of the \nReserves. ``We must be sensitive to that and we must provide proactive, \npreventive measures to prevent a recruiting retention crisis.'' 1-21-\n04.\n  ``We got a real retention issue,'' said Republican Governor of South \nCarolina, Mark Sanford, our Governor and a member of the Air Force \nReserve. ``We are going to see it emptying when people's tickets are up \nand when Guardsmen are not stepping up to the plate.''\n  You know, I am not sure that is true. Patriotism is high. To prevent \nthem from getting out, we need to be thinking of what we can do to make \nit a more attractive job. But let's say you stay in. What can you do to \nhonor your service to our country? This Congress has spent $400 billion \non Medicare improvements. Let's talk about money for a minute. We are \ntrying to get every senior in the country to sign up for a discount \ncard because we want to help seniors. Great, good idea.\n\n  We are trying to spend $1 billion a year for 5 years to give Guard \nand Reserve members continuity of health care coverage, and we are \narguing about the money? We spent $20 billion of hard-earned taxpayer \nmoney in Iraq. We gave it to the Iraqi people, to build their \nhospitals, to build their schools, to build their roads, to build their \nfire departments, and their police stations, to train their army. Do \nyou know what. The money is needed.\n  I wanted to loan some of it because they are sitting on $1 trillion \nworth of oil. I like helping people but I want people to help \nthemselves. So when it came time to write this amendment we did strike \na balance. Here is the balance.\n  Right now, as a Guard and Reserve member, you are a part-time Federal \nemployee. Unlike every other part-time Federal employee, you get \nnothing. So here is what we are suggesting. If you want to, you can \nsign up for military health care year round. It will be eligible for \nyou and your family--you will be eligible for that program. But while \nyou are a Guard or Reserve member you are going to have to pay a \npremium like a Federal employee. I wish we could get the Iraqi people \nto help pay some of the money back, but we are not. So they are going \nto make a contribution. This is not a free deal. They have to pay like \nevery other part-time Federal employee. Put them in that same category. \nThey deserve to be in that category.\n  Here is the difference between an Active-Duty troop and a Guard and \nReserve member. No. 1, an Active-Duty troop is doing a great job, and \nwe should pay them more. Senator Warner has done a great job improving \nbenefits for Active-Duty people. Our Armed Services Committee in the \nSenate has been second to no one in trying to make a better life for \nthose who serve our country. My hat is off to them. We just have a \ndisagreement over this particular amendment. But we are daily improving \nthe benefit package of Active-Duty people. By God, they deserve it.\n  But here is why it will not affect recruiting. The Pentagon has \nstarted this argument. It is the most bogus argument I have ever heard. \nIt is that if you offer TRICARE eligibility for the military members \nwho would have to pay $1,800 a year for the benefit, as a premium for a \nfamily, that somehow that will hurt recruiting for active duty.\n  Here is your choice if you are going to pick between the two \nprograms. You have a Reserve job or a Guard job that allows you to work \none weekend a month, 2 weeks a year, and you get to retire when you are \n60. The Active-Duty person gets a full paycheck, gets full health care \nbenefits, gets a retirement after 20 years. There is no way that is \ngoing to compete and take people away from Active-Duty Forces. How are \nyou going to raise a family working 2 days a month? They are part-time \nemployees in a vital job, to defend America. Unlike every other part-\ntime Federal employee, they are not eligible for Federal Government \nhealth care, and they should be. We are asking them to pay a premium \nunless they are called to active duty.\n  That is a fiscally responsible balance. We spent $20 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money to make Iraq a better place. We spent $400 billion and \ncounting on a prescription drug program for our seniors. Here we are, \ntrying to get $5.4 billion over a 5-year period to cover 300,000 \nfamilies who have suffered beyond description, in terms of leaving \ntheir homes and their jobs for pay cuts. Most Guard and Reserve \nmembers, when called to active duty, leave obligations behind, greater \nthan the military paycheck. They make more money in the civilian world \nand when they are called to active duty they take a pay cut and we \ndon't make up the difference. But they know that going in.\n  There are small things that mean a lot to these people, and this is \ntruly small, in terms of money. It is two-tenths of 1 percent of the \nbudget. Mr. President, 25 percent of the people are unable to go on \nactive duty when called to the Guard and Reserve community because of \nhealth care problems. This amendment more than pays for itself. The \nmoney is well spent. It is affordable, and there are many programs in \nthis budget that cost more than $700 million that, if you ask the \ntaxpayer to choose, I think the Guard and Reserve community would win \nevery time.\n  How many bills do we pass every year that spend billions of dollars \non questionable programs? This is the one area upon which we can all \nagree. The Guard and Reserve community needs a better benefit package \nbecause they are being asked to do more than ever. They are dying at a \ngreater rate this year than last year. What has happened in the year \nwhen we first debated this? There are more of them and they are dying \nat a faster rate.\n  The father of TRICARE is Senator Warner.\n  This is why I object to committee markups. No. 1, the entire cost of \nTRICARE under the committee markup is borne by the employer community \nand the reservists. The Government doesn't contribute one penny to the \nhealth care needs of our Guard and Reserve members. That is wrong.\n  The unsung hero of this whole war effort, when it comes to the Guard \nand Reserve community, is the employer. Wouldn't it be nice if we could \ntake a load off of small businesses and large businesses which have \nguardsmen and reservists and share in the cost of health care along \nwith the Guard members themselves and take them off the payroll? It is \na small thing. It would mean a lot to employers.\n  Employers have paid the difference between active pay and civilian \npay voluntarily, and in huge numbers. We have done nothing to thank \nthem. Taking care of the health care needs of our Guard and Reserve \nForces is one less problem an employer has to worry about.\n  I ask the 85 Members of the Senate who voted last year for this very \nsame measure, which is now $300 million cheaper and going down every \nminute because we are trying to make it cheaper, to step to the plate \nand say to the Guard and Reserve community: We got it. We understand \nyour sacrifice. We understand your stress. We understand your family is \nhaving health care coverage problems. Twenty percent of them have no \nhealth care. They are bouncing from one group to the next, and we are \ngoing to fix that. We are going to give you an option. We are going to \nask you to pay some, but we are going to make your health care life \nbetter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport for this amendment from the National Guard Association of the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\nStates, the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, the \nReserve Enlisted Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, \nalong with the National Guard Association of the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 50,000 members of the \n     National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), I \n     want to thank you for doing so much for our membership in the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (NDAA \n     FY05). Your leadership, along with your colleagues, has given \n     our soldiers and airmen the much-needed opportunity to \n     participate in the TRICARE health program when not in a \n     mobilized status.\n       This health coverage will not only provide Guard members \n     and their families with continuity of care, but also with a \n     chance to positively contribute to the betterment of the \n     TRICARE program. As we all know, the system of care will \n     respond in a positive way to these additional beneficiaries, \n     especially in remote areas. The three new provider networks--\n     TriWest, Health Net, Humana--have made a commitment to ensure \n     TRICARE beneficiaries are satisfied with their health care. \n     Along with Congress, we will also be keeping an eye on the \n     path of transition from 11 TRICARE regions to three.\n       We recognize section 706 in the NDAA FY05 is an excellent \n     starting point to providing a health care program to our \n     Guardsmen as a measurement of the country's appreciation for \n     all they have done. We support the initial intent of S. 2035, \n     as sponsored by you and Senator Daschle, which was to have \n     the Department of Defense pay 72 percent of the premium cost, \n     thereby taking the burden off private and public employees \n     completely. The NGAUS fully understands the pressure of \n     budget constraints in the FY05 budget, but we are hopeful \n     that soon the burden will be taken off the employers and rest \n     fully in its intended, and rightful place, in the Department \n     of Defense.\n       The fashion in which the National Guard is being utilized \n     has forced America to take notice and recognize the full \n     worth of these exceptional men and women serving in harm's \n     way. Guardsmen are our neighbors, teachers, co-workers and \n     students. Once again, thank you for all you have done for the \n     soldiers and airmen in the National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Richard C. Alexander,\n\n                                        Major General (Ret.), AUS,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Reserve Enlisted Association,\n\n                                                     May 21, 2004.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Graham: The mobilizations \n     over the past three years since September 11th have once \n     again shown that the readiness of our reserve components has \n     been affected by medical issues. When called upon our \n     nation's citizen-soldiers need to be prepared to answer that \n     call, but without proper healthcare we cannot maintain a well \n     trained and ready reserve force.\n       The Reserve Enlisted Association supports Daschle-Graham \n     amendment to the Senate Armed Service Committee, FY2005, \n     National Defense Authorization Act, S.2400, requiring the \n     Department of Defense to assume responsibility for the \n     employer cost of a Reservist's healthcare under TRICARE.\n       REA is dedicated to making our nation stronger and our \n     military more prepared and look forward to working together \n     towards these goals. Please feel free to call me at 202-646-\n     7758 or via email at lburnett@reaus.org or our Legislative \n     Director, Seth Benge.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Lani Burnett,\n\n                                           CMSgt, USAFR (Retired),\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Air Force Sergeants Association,\n\n                                   Temple Hills, MD, May 15, 2003.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 136,000 members of \n     AFSA, I would like to offer our support of S. 1000. This \n     association has been on the leading edge of the effort to \n     lower the earliest Guard and Reserve retirement age. We feel \n     very strongly that the retirement age should be lowered at a \n     minimum to age 55, consistent with the retirement age of all \n     other federal retirees. Although the provisions contained \n     within S. 1000 addressing this issue fall short of what we \n     believe is fair, it is a step in the right direction.\n       Without question, reservists and their families will \n     benefit from the opportunity to receive health coverage \n     through TRICARE. So will DoD. Beyond recruitment and \n     retention, this program will improve readiness since nearly \n     20 percent of reserve component members do not currently have \n     health insurance. Maintaining a healthy force is absolutely \n     essential to maintaining a prepared force.\n       The success of our national defense is dependent on a \n     ``Total Force'' effort, and the availability of Guard and \n     Reserve members is critical. The various tax credits \n     contained in S. 1000 will encourage employee and citizen \n     participation in Guard and Reserve programs, thereby \n     facilitating the availability of these important \n     servicemembers when they are needed.\n       I thank you for taking the initiative to introduce such an \n     important piece of legislation. As always, I offer you this \n     association's support on this and other matters of mutual \n     concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James D. Staton,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Reserve Officers Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2004.\n     Senator Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Graham: It has been over a \n     decade since Desert Shield and Desert Storm occurred and \n     medical readiness problems were identified; yet the Reserve \n     Components face the same problems with medical and dental \n     fitness when mobilized for Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot \n     continue losing the service and experience of Reserve \n     Component members who cannot mobilize due to medical \n     readiness.\n       The Reserve Officers Association supports the Daschle-\n     Graham amendment to the Senate Armed Services Committee, \n     FY2005, National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2400, \n     requiring the Department of Defense to assume responsibility \n     for the employer cost of a Reservist's healthcare under \n     TRICARE.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Robert A. McIntosh,\n\n                                      Major General (Ret.), USAFR,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the men and women of the \n     National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), I \n     would like to personally thank you for your leadership in \n     helping ensure passage your amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorizations Act for fiscal year 2004 based off S. 1000 and \n     S. 852. This important amendment provides the opportunity for \n     Guardsmen to participate in the Tricare program on a cost-\n     share basis. As you know, this initiative to improve \n     healthcare readiness for members of the National Guard and \n     Reserve components and their families is at the forefront of \n     our priorities.\n       Your staff, especially Steve Flippin and Aleix Jarvis, has \n     put forth a tremendous effort toward this initiative. You \n     should be proud to have such an outstanding team.\n       Again, thank you for your continued support of a strong and \n     viable National Guard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Richard C. Alexander,\n\n                                        Major General (Ret.), AUS,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, these letters are not \njust words on paper. I challenge every member of the public and every \nSenator to go back home and spend a few minutes in a Guard and Reserve \nunit and ask about TRICARE for those who have been on active duty.\n  Does it work? Senator Warner deserves great praise because it is \nworking. Ask the question: If you could sign up for TRICARE year round \nand pay a premium, how many of you would do it? Hands would be raised. \nIt would be a great benefit to the 300,000 forces. It would be good for \ntheir families. It would be good for retention. It is affordable, and \nit is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, my colleagues have just heard an eloquent \nand extraordinarily persuasive case for the amendment offered by our \ncolleague from South Carolina. It illustrates yet again why it has been \nsuch a pleasure for me to work with him on this amendment. He has made \nthe case.\n  But for emphasis let me reiterate a couple of points which he made \nbetter than I could. First, with regard to cost, our distinguished \nChair this morning--and I think on other occasions--has raised an \nunderstandable concern. He correctly noted that the cost of this \namendment this year is about $696 million. The cost over 5 years is \n$5.7 billion. He correctly noted that there isn't any particular offset \nlisted for this benefit. Of course, what we haven't said is that is \nexactly the situation we will face with the amendment he is about to \noffer. The only difference is\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nhis is $25 million and ours is $696 million.\n  I said the only difference but there is another difference. The \namendment requested by the administration for our efforts in Iraq \nindirectly benefits the United States but directly benefits the people \nof Iraq. This amendment benefits directly 300,000 people--men and women \nwho are putting their lives on the line in support of their country's \nefforts in Iraq. It is two-tenths of 1 percent of the entire budget.\n  That is all we are asking--to say with an exclamation point that we \nsupport our troops. We support the efforts made by our members of the \nReserve, the Guard, and the extraordinary heroism, patriotism, and \ndedication they demonstrate each and every day on the job.\n  We give our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee credit and our \nthanks for making an effort to address this problem in the bill, but \nwith great respect and tremendous admiration for them. In particular, \nwe have indicated in the past our concern and, frankly, our opposition \nto the language--as well intended as it is--to require that employers \nand the guardsmen themselves shoulder 100 percent of the \nresponsibility, in light of the fact the colleagues they work next to \nevery single day on the job get that critical benefit; it is part of \ntheir package for serving in the military. That is wrong.\n\n  To give an employer veto power over whether this guardsman can access \nthe benefit is wrong. To say we are going to benefit our active-duty \npersonnel and not provide any help or appreciation for the \nextraordinary difficulties in accessing health care for guardsmen is \nwrong.\n  The 85 Senators who supported this legislation in the past need to \ndemonstrate once again that our commitment has not eroded and we will \ncontinue to press for parity, for fairness, for a recognition of the \ncommitment made by our members of the Guard and Reserves every single \nmonth, week, and year until this action becomes law.\n  My colleague from South Carolina has done it so well, laying out our \narguments and the persuasive case to be made. All that remains is, on a \nbipartisan basis, to again reiterate our strong support for the \nfairness represented in the Graham-Daschle amendment.\n  I thank him for his leadership. I thank our colleagues for their \nsupport. I hope we can send a clear message today, as we have said on \nso many occasions, that when we say we support our troops, we mean it \nwith more than our words. We intend to step up to the plate and show it \nwith our deeds. That is what this amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the committee for their hard work \non this bill. I am always impressed by how Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin manage this bill and for the excellent work of their staff. Their \ncontinued commitment to our troops, and to our Nation is evident in \nthis bill. It is especially important right now.\n  I also thank the committee for their very important inclusion of \nexpanded TRICARE coverage to several members of the Guard and Reserve. \nWhile limited, the Committee's inclusion of any extended health care \nbenefits to the reserve component is unprecedented. The committee's \nmark is an important step in the right direction, but the benefits \nincluded in the committee's mark simply aren't enough. They don't go \nfar enough to reach the folks we need to; the current provisions don't \nprovide the kind of coverage that we owe these individuals and their \nfamilies. They also don't recognize the continued sacrifice of the \nemployers of our Reservists and Guardsmen.\n  That is why I join my colleagues--Senator Lindsay Graham, Senator \nDaschle, and Senator Leahy--in support of this important amendment. \nUnfortunately, benefits for our Guard and Reserve simply have not kept \npace with the increasing role these folks are expected to play. With \nthe increasing demands we are placing on these individuals, it is the \nright thing to do. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nthroughout the coming months to make these important initiatives a \npermanent reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I would like to lay this \namendment aside and proceed with another matter, with the understanding \nthat prior to the vote, assuming we do establish the vote to be at \n3:30, there may be some desire by the proponents as well as the \nopponents to speak for a few minutes.\n  We will proceed at this time.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, is there any reason we cannot \nlock in a vote at 3:30 today?\n  Mr. WARNER. I now ask unanimous consent that following the granting \nof this consent, the pending amendment be temporarily set aside in \norder for the chairman to offer an amendment regarding a $25 billion \ncontingent fund. I further ask consent the vote in relation to the \npending TRICARE amendment occur at 3:45 today, with the 15 minutes \nprior to that vote equally divided in the usual form, with no second-\ndegree amendment in order prior to the vote. I further ask consent \nfollowing the vote, the Senate begin the 60-minute period during \nmorning business and provided for earlier. That will address the \nrecognition of the World War II veterans who are currently Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I amend one thing, if I may, from my reading, and that is at 20 \nminutes prior to the vote, I understand there is another speaker on my \nside who may wish to speak.\n  Mr. REID. That would interrupt the amendment you are going to lay \ndown.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And go back to TRICARE, 20 minutes before the vote on \nTRICARE?\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. Rather than 15 minutes, we have 20 minutes equally \ncontrolled between the 2 managers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, to clarify, is it 20 \nminutes on top of the 15 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. No, extending 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3260\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I now send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 3260.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that should say Senator Warner, for himself, Mr. \nLevin, and Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize appropriations for a contingent emergency \n          reserve fund for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 239, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1006.

The report for a month shall include in a separate \n     display for each of Iraq and Aghanistan, the activity for \n     which the funds were used, the purpose for which the funds \n     were used, the source of the funds used to carry out that \n     activity, and the account to which those expenditures were \n     charged.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Quickly, our colleagues are pretty well familiar with \nthis, but I will take a short few moments to address it.\n  When the administration presented its budget request for fiscal year \n2005 in February, the request did not include funding for costs \nassociated with the ongoing global war on terrorism. This is in keeping \nwith longstanding tradition of funding ongoing military operations \nthrough supplemental appropriations. At that time, the administration \nstated that it expected to request a supplemental to cover these costs, \nafter the start of calendar year 2005. Prior to the passage of a \nsupplemental, the administration planned to cover the cost of the war \nwith funds from other military accounts--a process commonly called \n``cash flowing.'' Administration officials stated in February and March \nthat ``cash flowing'' ongoing military operations presented acceptable \nand manageable risk.\n  On May 5, President Bush announced his intention to request a $25 \nbillion contingent reserve fund for fiscal year 2005 for United States \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President stated that, \n``While we do not know the precise costs for operations next year, \nrecent developments on the ground and increased demands on our troops \nindicate the need to plan for contingencies. We must make sure there is \nno disruption in funding and resources for our troops.'' In my \njudgment, this is a prudent course of action, and it has my strongest \nsupport.\n  It is important to note that, even with this reserve fund, the \nadministration will still request a full fiscal year 2005 supplemental \nafter the first of the year, when it can better estimate the costs of \nthe ongoing war on terror.\n  When the President made his announcement 3 weeks ago, the committee \nwas in the process of marking up the fiscal year 2005 national defense \nauthorization bill. At the request of Senator Byrd, the committee \ndeferred action on this request for additional funding until we could \nhold a hearing to receive more information on this request.\n  On Thursday, May 13, the committee held a hearing on the \nadministration's amended budget request. Committee staff then met with \nadministration and Defense Department officials to address concerns \nraised by committee members during that hearing. After careful study of \nthe administration's request and consultation on both sides of the \naisle, the committee supports inclusion of a $25 billion reserve, with \nsome additional restrictions and reporting requirements.\n  As proposed by the administration, this contingency reserve fund \nwould essentially have been a $25 billion transfer account. Many \nmembers expressed concern over this in our hearing. As drafted, the \namendment requires that $22 billion of the fund be spent on specific \naccounts. Only $3 billion would be in the form of a transfer account \nwhich could be spent only after prior consultation and notification.\n  Increased demands on our troops, particularly in Iraq, have led to \nconcerns that additional funding may be needed prior to the start of \ncalendar year 2005, thus the need for contingency funding. As proposed, \nthe contingent emergency reserve fund would act as a ``bridge'' between \nthe fiscal year 2005 budget request and the fiscal year 2005 \nsupplemental expected in February 2005.\n  Without a contingent reserve fund, to mitigate the risks, the \ndepartment may be forced to ``cash flow'' ongoing operations with other \nfunding sources until supplemental funds are appropriated, which could \nbe well into the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Ongoing \nprocurement programs, modernization efforts, and even training could be \nadversely affected from having to pay up front for ongoing military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I agree with the President that our first commitment must be to \nAmerica's security and that our troops ``have the resources they need, \nwhen they need them.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend my good friend, the \nchairman of our committee, for this amendment. This amendment is very \nmuch needed, first of all. We know we are going to need these funds for \nthe operations we are planning in the next fiscal year.\n  The budget that was submitted to us in January did not have the extra \nfunding which we knew would be required because of our operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Many Members pointed that out. Indeed, I wrote a \nletter to the Budget Committee on February 24th pointing out the budget \nrequest for Defense represented a reasonable estimate of the cost for \nsupporting the normal operations of the activities, but that the \nrequest does not include any request to support the incremental costs \nof our military forces for continuing operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  At that point, the administration indicated it would not seek any \nadditional funds, supplementally, to pay for these incremental costs \nthis calendar year. It was their intention at that time to wait until \nthe next calendar year to do that. I, and many others here, thought \nthat was not a responsible way to budget. There was a political tone to \nit because it delayed paying the piper for the costs of this war until \nafter the election, and there was no point in being that disingenuous \nabout what we all know is going to be required.\n  I very much support--and I think every Member of this body supports--\npaying for the needs of our troops, regardless of what one's position \nis as to how we got to Iraq, how we are doing in Iraq, whether we ought \nto be doing things differently in Iraq. Regardless of the difference of \nposition of Members of this body on those subjects, when it comes to \nthe support of the operations of our forces and their pay and benefits \nand needs, I think there is overwhelming if not total unanimous support \nfor funding those troops.\n  The recent approval by the Department of Defense of increased force \nlevels in Iraq has made this need even more urgent. Even before the \nDepartment approved the additional 30,000 troops, approximately, for \nIraq, there was an acknowledgement by the uniformed military leaders \nthat the additional costs of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \nare approximately $4 billion to $5 billion per month. So there was no \nreason, in terms of sound budgeting, for us to hide that fact from the \nAmerican people.\n  Just to give one example of that, a recent headline, which perhaps \nsays the whole thing, from the May 5 Washington Post read: ``138,000 \nTroops to Stay in Iraq Through 2005.'' Well, that kind of says it all. \nWe need this supplemental because we know there is going to be that \nmany troops--more than planned at the time this budget was submitted to \nus--staying in Iraq through 2005.\n  The fact that we do not know the exact, precise amount for the \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan is not an excuse to do nothing. Of \ncourse we do not know precisely the cost, but we know approximately the \ncost from our experience there. We have estimates of these costs from \nour uniformed and civilian leadership now that the civilian leadership \nis committed to this course of action.\n  One thing we do know for certain: We know, for certain, the amount in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nPresident's budget--which was zero--is the wrong number. We don't know \nwhether the right number is going to be $4.8 billion or $4.9 billion \nper month, but we know the approximate number, and we know what is $4 \nbillion to $5 billion short per month, which is what the President's \nbudget was.\n  Both the House and the Senate, in their budget resolutions, advanced \nthe ball on this issue. The Senate made $30 billion available on a \ncontingent basis if the President requested the additional funds, as he \nnow has. That was intended to be approximately half the year so we \nwould not have to use funds forward from accounts early in the year, \nleaving those accounts short later in the year.\n  It was my belief that if we added just 6 months of what we knew would \nbe the supplemental amount needed, that would be enough for us to then, \nearly next year, adopt a supplemental appropriations bill for the \nbalance. The amendment that Senator Warner and I and Senator Stevens \nare now offering authorizes the level requested by the President, which \nis $25 billion, which is within the Senate-passed level of $30 billion.\n  Again, we know this money is not going to be enough to cover all of \nfiscal year 2005, but it will cover at least, we expect, October 1--the \nbeginning of the fiscal year--through January 31. Since Congress is \nscheduled to be out of session during that entire period, we would not \nbe in a good position to act then. We are in a position to act now, and \nwe should do so.\n  The budget request from the President was really a blank check. We \nhave amended it, changed it, modified it in many ways. First of all, it \nis more detailed. We assign money from two various accounts, such as \noperation and maintenance, such as personnel.\n  The amendment we are offering also does not allow the administration \nto move money around as it wanted to with total flexibility. We have \nput limits on their ability to move money within that account, as we \nshould in terms of carrying out our responsibility as the appropriating \nand authorizing body.\n  This amendment is more structured, more stringent and, I believe, \nmore responsible from a legislative point of view than was the proposal \nthat was given to us by the administration. We allocate the $25 \nbillion: $14 billion, for instance, for operation and maintenance \narmor, which is the biggest chunk of money needed. And everybody \nacknowledged that was the biggest chunk. But the administration \nproposal provided that after we listed all these allocations between \nArmy, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and so forth, that--and this is \nwhat their proposal read:\n\n       In addition to the transfers authorized in the previous \n     proviso, after consultation with the director of Office of \n     Management and Budget, the Secretary of Defense may transfer \n     the funds provided herein to any appropriation or fund of the \n     Department of Defense or classified program.\n\n  So after looking as though it was allocating the $25 billion to \nvarious accounts, the language which was submitted to us, which we are \nnow deleting, would have in effect given the administration and the \nDepartment of Defense a blank check because it said, in addition to the \nnumbers enumerated, they can, after consulting with themselves--that \nis, the Department of Defense consulting with the OMB Director--move \nthe funds provided to any appropriation or fund of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Again, that was the definition of the blank check. We have eliminated \nthat language from the proposal that was submitted to us by the \nadministration. It was the responsible thing to do.\n  Our amendment basically reflected the same numbers that the \nadministration proposed. For instance, the Army's operating funds, \nwhich were the primary reason that we need these funds this year, are \nnow guaranteed, if we can, of course, get this passed in the Senate, \nget it passed in the House, signed by the President. This will be \nguaranteed to the Army for their operating cost this year. That will \navoid some of the real problems which we would have had otherwise in \nspending next year's money this year, borrowing huge amounts of money, \ndisrupting normal activities in the Army and the other services in \norder to cash-flow expenditures.\n  If we did not provide more funding when needed, there would have been \na very real chance that the Army, possibly the Marine Corps Special \nOperations Command, could be out of funds by the time the Congress \nwould be ready to act next February.\n  So this is the right thing to do, to act now for our men and women in \nIraq and Afghanistan who need and deserve the support, for those \nserving in the United States and in other locations around the world \nfrom whose budgets funds would have been borrowed to provide the \nsupport if we do not act.\n  Finally, the Secretary of Defense is now authorized the additional \n30,000 extra Army personnel. What this budget does is to recognize that \nfact. It was appropriate that the administration acknowledged that \nthose troops were going to remain in Iraq. That is a fact of life. And \nthat being a given--that is the reality--it seems to me we are now \ncarrying out our responsibility to our troops by reflecting that \nreality with the funds that we are hereby authorizing this year and not \nsimply delaying until next year when a number of undesirable effects \ncould have been felt and surely should be avoided. Our troops deserve a \nlot better than our stealing from next year's funds to pay their costs \nthis year, when we should be budgeting this year for this year's cost. \nThat is precisely what we are doing now.\n  I thank particularly our uniformed leadership. General Abizaid \nappeared in front of us. He was very direct when we asked him what the \nadditional funding needs were. He indicated that, after accounting for \nthe extra approximately 20,000 troops then, he expected the monthly \nrate of spending to be even higher than it had been up until then.\n  And it is because we were able to get such testimony from our uniform \nleadership that I think that spurred us on and encouraged us to insist \nthat we be responsible in the authorizing bill this year rather than \nsimply saying, well, we will steal from next year's funds and take up a \nsupplemental next year. We are going to need the money. This isn't the \nfinal answer. It is the first installment. Again, I emphasize this is \njust the first 5 or 6 months. There is going to have to be a \nsupplemental next year. But we will be able to pass that when we come \nback in the beginning of next year and not force our services to steal \nfrom future funding in order to pay for the needs that are going to \nexist at the end of this year.\n  So it is a foreseeable problem. We are acting now to avoid it. It is \nthe responsible way for this body to act. I commend Senator Warner, \nagain, for his leadership on this amendment, Senator Stevens, and the \nwillingness to put this together on a bipartisan basis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I wrote to Senators Nickles and \nConrad be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Dear Don and Kent: In accordance with your request, I am \n     forwarding my recommendations for the fiscal year 2005 budget \n     resolution.\n        I believe that the President's defense budget request for \n     $420.7 billion represents a reasonable estimate of the cost \n     of supporting the normal operations of the activities within \n     the national defense budget function for fiscal year 2005. \n     However, this request does not include any request to support \n     the incremental costs that our military forces will incur in \n     continuing operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. Administration \n     officials have further indicated that they do not intend to \n     seek any funds for a supplemental to pay for these \n     incremental costs this calendar year.\n        There are a number of potential military personnel \n     benefits issues that we will need to address in the \n     authorization and appropriations process to accommodate a \n     number of concerns. I believe, however, that having a budget \n     resolution total the same as that requested by the President \n     should provide sufficient funding to address these issues.\n        What it will not permit us to do is address the costs of \n     the ongoing war in a responsible manner. We should provide \n     for those costs that we can reasonably predict our forces \n     will incur. We should not force our armed forces to rob from \n     existing requirements to pay for these operations on a ``cash \n     flow'' basis.\n        Our nation's armed forces have been heavily stressed again \n     this year in supporting the war on terrorism and supporting \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. To that end, Congress \n     provided an extra $65 billion to support these operations \n     during the current fiscal year. There are concerns about \n     whether these funds will even be sufficient to cover all of \n     the incremental costs of the war until the end of fiscal year \n     2004. We should not be counting on excess carry-over funding \n     from\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\n     this previous supplemental to provide sufficient funding to \n     address these problems in fiscal year 2005 until a mid-year \n     supplemental can be enacted.\n        At hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     earlier this month, three of the chiefs of staff of the Armed \n     Services expressed concern about waiting until after the end \n     of calendar year 2004 to submit a supplemental budget \n     request. I believe that we should listen to those concerns. \n     We should not wait until some time during fiscal year 2005 to \n     submit a supplemental budget request as the Administration \n     did last year. Circumstances are different this year. Last \n     year, the war had not begun. Now, having U.S. troops on the \n     ground is a fact and recognizing this reality and paying for \n     it is the responsible thing to do.\n        While it is certainly true that no one can predict with \n     precision what these fiscal year 2005 costs will be, we could \n     certainly provide funds to cover likely requirements for some \n     period of the year. This would allow the Administration an \n     opportunity to submit a supplemental request to cover the \n     balance of these costs and for Congress to review and act on.\n        I suggest increasing the budget authority in the national \n     defense function by $30 billion in fiscal year 2005, \n     specifically to cover up to six months of the incremental \n     costs, at the current pace of operations, of the ongoing \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is the responsible \n     thing to do for our troops and for budget accuracy.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor to \nsupport the amendment offered by my good friend, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Warner from Virginia.\n  This amendment will authorize appropriations for a $25 billion \ncontingent emergency reserve fund. It is an amendment I am proud to \nsupport. It is not often, I might add, that the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee comes to the floor of the Senate to support \nan amendment from the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, but \nmaybe we will set a new trend this year and I will welcome his support \nwhen we get to the floor.\n  But, in any event, this amendment is in direct support of our ongoing \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is limited to that. \nIt should be adopted. It covers emergency concepts in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  It is important that the Congress act on the President's request for \nthis reserve fund. It will ensure that our men and women in uniform \ncontinue to have the resources they need. We have worked very hard to \nmake certain that was the case in the past. This serves as a clear, \nunambiguous signal that while our troops are deployed and in harm's \nway, they will have the unequivocal and unwavering support of the \nCongress.\n  I believe it is important to support the President's request. It is a \ndifferent type of concept. I want to be sure Members understand. It is \nnot a blank check. It is one that is well defined, in a request that \ncame to the Armed Services Committee and to the Appropriations \nCommittee. The Armed Services Committee held a hearing on this issue \nwith both civilian and military witnesses from the Department of \nDefense and the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nand the chairman is commended for holding that hearing. The bill now \nbefore us is the result of the Armed Services Committee's \nconsideration.\n  This morning, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee also held a \nhearing to fully consider the President's request for this contingency \nemergency reserve fund. I was pleased to point out to our committee \nthat this is a continuation of what we call the IFF that we created \nbefore both in 2003 and 2004.\n  This amendment is for the 2005 appropriations. We intend to include \nsome form of a reserve fund as part of our fiscal year 2005 Defense \nappropriations bill. Although this has come as a supplemental request, \nwe will add it to the 2005 appropriations bill, and our subcommittee \nhas agreed to that, in effect, this morning.\n  The exact form of the reserve fund is being reviewed by our \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, but I assure the Senate that \nour Appropriations subcommittee will provide our armed services the \nfunds they need, as requested by the President. Second, we will provide \nadequate and reasonable financial flexibility. Third, we will provide \nfor full and fair congressional oversight.\n  We have developed, I believe, bipartisan support for this request of \nthe President's this morning in our hearing before the Appropriations \nCommittee. Certainly, the developments on the ground in Iraq make it \nplain that there is an absolute need to plan for contingencies. Our \nmilitary commanders have prudent operational plans, but they must be \nprepared to respond to the dynamic events that are going forward now in \nIraq. We can expect nothing less of our military leadership, and the \nCongress must give them the tools they need. This reserve fund will do \nthat. It is a fund that is available for emergencies. They have funds \navailable for the predictable needs of the military. These funds are \nfor the unpredictable needs of the military over the period beginning \nin 2005.\n  The troops that are there are doing hard work. They must not find \nthat fiscal issues might impede their doing the job they have to do in \nIraq at this time. They should not be constrained in any way by the \navailability of money. The last thing I--and I believe all Senators--\nwould want would be for an operational commander to be concerned about \nwhether there is enough money to do the job he has to do in an \nemergency.\n  This is an emergency fund. It does not mean they can add to the money \nthey have automatically through regular appropriations without finding \nfirst--and the President must find--that there is an emergency for this \nmoney to be released. But it will be there. It will be a means where \nthe President, on request, can notify the Congress with 5 days' notice \nthat he intends to put some of this money to work.\n  I pointed out to our committee this morning, there have been 33 times \nthat IFS funds have been released by the Department of Defense before \non request of the President. Now we must provide this same kind of \ncontingency emergency reserve fund because the alternatives available \nare too risky. The alternative would be we would have to meet and pass \na separate bill, another supplemental. We want the reserve fund to be \nthere for emergencies that could occur. I point out to the Senate, it \nmay be that we would be out of session during that period. I hope we \nare out of session after the election. I have to stop and say that. I \ndo think the concepts of the past, whereby the President has used the \nfood and forage concept to dip into funds that were available for \ntraining for the next year or dip into funds for procurement, the \nPresident has that power. He can go to any fund that is available to \nmeet an emergency.\n  This is to foresee that, to foresee the interruption of plan \ndevelopment, plan utilization of our forces, training of forces in \norder to get moneys for an emergency.\n  That practice should be avoided. I don't say it is wrong, but to \nborrow money from the third and fourth quarters to pay for urgent bills \nof the first and second quarters is not the way to do business. We set \nup a fund and say, if there is an emergency, tell us what you are going \nto use the money for and use it, unless we say no.\n  I applaud the decision of the President to ask for these resources \nnow. I am one who went to the President and the administration and \nasked them not to send a supplemental for 2005 because I believe we \nshould not have that until the first quarter of the next year. We \nthought we had enough money to go through this calendar year, but \nbecause of the turn of events in Iraq, that is not the case. The \nPresident decided the option of waiting was too risky, and he has asked \nus to provide this fund as a reserve fund. The President made the right \nchoice. It was not an easy decision.\n  The people who have reviewed this so far in both committees, Armed \nServices and Appropriations, have agreed that the armed services need \nthis flexibility to have funds available in an emergency and for use \nonly in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a good concept. I applaud the \nSenator from Virginia in offering the amendment, and I urge the Senate \nto adopt his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and his colleagues for supporting this issue. \nAs he most eloquently stated, the purpose is clear. It is to avoid the \nrepetition of the past where we have gone into the forage fund to meet \ncontingencies. We know they exist today. It is best we face up to it \nand put it on record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Alaska is in the \nChamber, I thank the Senator for his work on the Appropriations \nCommittee relative to this subject. As I indicated, I think the \ntestimony before his committee indicated--I believe this morning--that \nwe know it is about $4.7 billion or $4.8 billion at the current level \nof spending that we will need above what was in the budgeted amount. \nThis provides that additional funding. It is the responsible thing to \ndo. It has strong support on this side of the aisle as well as his. \nThat is the way it should be when we have men and women in harm's way.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3258\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. At \nthis time, I suggest that we go off of the Warner amendment, which I \nask be laid aside, and return to the pending amendment by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, at which time I think a number of colleagues are \nanxious to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend Senator Graham of South Carolina, the so-called \nTRICARE amendment offered by himself and Senator Daschle. I have great \nrespect for both Senator Graham and Senator Daschle. I just oppose \ntheir amendment.\n  The amendment is very expensive. Their amendment costs billions and \nbillions of dollars. Their amendment, in my opinion, is a serious \nmistake. I can see where people would say: I want to vote for it. I \nwant to show my support for the National Guard.\n  I also want to show my support for the National Guard, but we do show \nour support for the National Guard in this bill. We take care of their \nhealth care. If they go on active duty, we take care of their health \ncare. That is a Government expense. They don't have copays. We take \ncare of them.\n  In fact, when they sign up and go into active duty, we take care of \nthem. But this is when they are on inactive status, when they basically \nshow up for 2 days a month.\n  I used to be in the Guard. I also used to be in the private sector. I \nwas in the private sector during the month, for 28 or 29 days of the \nmonth, and then in the National Guard for 2 days of the month. I think \nthe primary responsibility for health care should be on the employer \nfor the 28 or 29 days of the month, not on the Government because \nsomebody served for 2 days in a month.\n  Incidentally, if you are on Guard duty and you are injured, they are \ngoing to take care of you. If you are climbing hills, or practicing at \na gun-firing range, and you are injured, you will be taken care of. If \nyou are on 2-week duty during the summer and you have an injury, they \nare going to take care of that. Those expenses are covered.\n  So, basically, do we want to take care of an individual who happens \nto be in the Guard or Reserve and pay for their health care throughout \nthe year for thousands of dollars?\n  TRICARE costs $7,000 or $8,000 for a family. Should that be the \nFederal Government's responsibility if an individual is serving only 2 \ndays a month? Under the pending amendment, it would be the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility.\n  Eighty-some percent of Guard and Reserve members have health care. So \nthis would be a great motivation for people who may be in the private \nsector to say: Since you are in the Guard or Reserve, we don't have to \npay for you. Thank you very much, the Government will pay for yours--\neven though you work for this company or this organization for 28 days \na month and you work for the Government 2 days a month. Why should the \nFederal Government pick up 100 percent of that cost?\n  Then when you have the transfer from the private sector health care \ncoverage to the public, wow, it gets expensive. The cost was already \nmentioned. I think CBO estimated it at almost--I have one cost at $696 \nmillion for 2005, and $5.7 billion for 5 years, and $14.2 billion over \n10 years. So it adds to the bill. It either adds to the deficit or it \ncrowds out other defense spending. That other defense spending might be \nreplacement munitions or body armor or new technology for night \nvision--who knows. It is saying we want to take care of these \nindividuals' health care even when they are in inactive status. That is \na mistake.\n  Senator Warner's bill takes care of them when they are activated. \nThey are given physicals. We pay 100 percent of it. We take care of our \nActive-Duty men and women. If they are activated, we should take care \nof them. I believe Senator Warner's bill takes care of them for several \nmonths after Active-Duty status.\n  To say we want a new Federal entitlement saying if you sign up for \nthe Guard or Reserve, we are going to pay up to 72 percent of an \nindividual and their family's health care cost, at a cost estimated to \nbe $7,700 in benefits under the TRICARE program, with individuals \npaying 28 percent, this gets real expensive. It spends billions and \nbillions of dollars. It would be transferring money. This money has to \nbe appropriated. Defense is only going to get so much money. I am \nafraid we will be crowding out some of the money needed to protect our \nmen and women in the field. We protect our men and women in the field \nwho are on active duty. We give them the best quality health care we \ncan. They don't have to pay anything.\n\n  I don't believe the Federal Government should pay for an individual \nand/or their families' health care cost for a month because they do 2 \ndays a month of Guard duty.\n  I think it is a serious mistake, especially when the private sector \nalready provides it for over 80 percent of those individuals. You may \nbe able to score political points, but this is not money well spent. We \nshould use our money to maximize our defense capabilities. This will \nspend a lot of money, saying let's have the Federal Government pay for \nthe health care cost of Guard and Reserves, instead of having the \nprivate sector pay for it, even though they work for the private sector \n90 percent of the time during that month. I don't think we can afford \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to the so-called TRICARE \namendment at 3:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to our distinguished colleague \nfrom Alabama such time as he may require, to be followed by our \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma, with the understanding that the \nvote will commence, as described under the standing order, at 3:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 5\\1/2\\ minutes in \nopposition. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will seek additional time for my \ncolleagues if that becomes necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, in his concern over this TRICARE \namendment for our Guard and Reserve. I had 10 years in the Army \nReserve. My chief of staff is a retired lieutenant colonel. We have \ndiscussed these issues a lot--what we can do to help our Guard and \nReserve. But a $14 billion expenditure over 10 years for this one \nproject is not the best way to spend $14 billion to help the Guard and \nReserve.\n  I have met with top generals in command of our Guard and Reserve. As \na member of the Armed Services Committee, and as a person who cares \nabout improving the quality of life of our superb Guard and Reserve \nmembers, I care about it deeply. I want to make their lives better. I \nwant to make serving through retirement and beyond minimum retirement \ntime attractive for them. I want their lives to be happy and as \nfulfilling as possible. We need to reward them financially in every way \nwe possibly can.\n  To take $14 billion and in effect have it spent for a lot of people \nwho already\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nhave good health care insurance is not a smart way to do it. It is not \nthe right way.\n  I have asked the leadership of the Guard and Reserve and the \nDepartment of Defense to help us develop a package of bills that will \nbe beneficial to a broad-based number of our Guard and Reserve. They do \nterrific work.\n  When I was in the 1184th in Mobile, our drills and work got tougher \nand tougher every single year. More was demanded. That is why they are \nso excellent in performance today.\n  I really believe in what they do. The skill level is higher than it \nhas ever been. The training is better than it has ever been. They are \nbetter equipped than they have ever been. They are performing better in \ndifficult situations than we have ever seen before, and I am proud of \nthem, but this is not the best way to go about this.\n  I know there is a concern about this issue. I believe we can address \nit. I believe the chairman has come up with a way we can address this \nissue. That is what we need to do.\n  Let's listen to that. Let's not commit the funds for this one \nparticular problem for 20 percent of the Guard and Reserve, those who \ndo not have insurance today, and drain this large sum of money we could \nuse in another fashion.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I give my support for \nthe $25 billion supplemental. I believe it is the right thing to do. It \nwill allow our Defense Department to proceed. It will make sure our \nequipment that has been damaged in the course of this is repaired and \nmaintained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Alabama, as well as the senior \nSenator from Oklahoma, and now I am privileged to have the wisdom of \nthe junior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the time.\n  I think one thing the last three speakers, including myself, have in \ncommon is no one has been more highly supportive of the Guard and the \nReserve than Senator Nickles, Senator Sessions, and myself. In fact, I \ndaresay I probably have spent more time talking about the dilemma of \nthe Reserve component in all of the deployments as we continue this, \nand the reason we are having to do it is because we are, of course, at \nwar.\n  During the 1990s, we saw what happened to the military. It went down \nand consequently we had an end-strength problem. We are now talking \nabout maybe 30,000 more troops and we are going to have to do something \nto help the Reserve component. Most of these people are gainfully \nemployed. They have occupations. We cannot expect them to continuously \nbe deployed while at the same time the employer is letting them go. \nThat is the whole idea of a Reserve component.\n  So although I oppose this amendment, I have to qualify it by saying \nhow much I have always supported the Guard and the Reserve. I think all \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve, certainly in my State of Oklahoma, \nare aware of that.\n  I just returned from Afghanistan where the 45th is stationed. They \nare doing a great job training the ANA to fight their own battles. They \nare doing a tremendous job. The problem is this does not have to happen \nin a vacuum. If it happened in a vacuum and we were able to give them \nfull-time TRICARE, I would vote to do it in spite of the fact there \nwould be, as my senior Senator from Oklahoma stated, many people who \nwould go ahead and drop their coverage, saying the Government already \nsupplies it, and that would be a problem.\n\n  They talk about the costs being $11 billion, $12 billion, and as high \nas $18 billion. That is because we have yet to have any kind of a study \nto see how many people are out there who already have coverage or how \nmany people are out there who actually would want to even have this \ncoverage.\n  Our chairman and our committee did a great job--it has not been said \non the floor enough--because in this area of TRICARE, 90 days prior to \ndeployment they have coverage. For 6 months after coming back, they \nhave coverage. So it is not something we have not already looked at and \ndecided to be very fair. I think we have a good compromise that is in \nthe mark that is up for consideration on the floor today.\n  I say to my good friend from South Carolina, he has another amendment \nthat frankly I am very much for. It is one having to do with the \nmovement of nuclear waste. I think he is dead right on it. That was a \ngood policy until the National Resource Defense Council came in and \nfiled a lawsuit against the DOE. Before then, everything was going \nfine. This would rectify that problem. This amendment is being offered \nby Senator Graham of South Carolina. I am a strong supporter of that \nparticular amendment, but on this amendment one cannot assume this is \ngoing to happen and it is going to come out of nowhere.\n  We have to come up with $11 billion, $12 billion, $14 billion, or $18 \nbillion somewhere. It has to come out of Defense. This is the problem \nwe have. I served as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee all \nduring the 1990s, and I saw what was happening to our military, knowing \none day this day would come and we would have to make some decisions \nregarding end strength, modernization, and all of the other programs \nthat are bleeding today.\n  Now if the Senator from South Carolina wants that money to come out \nof the MOX, mixed oxide, fuel facility in South Carolina, $368 million \nis authorized in this bill, maybe he feels strongly enough about it he \nwould like to do that, or the waste incidental to reprocessing the WIR \nprogram, $350 million. These programs I am sure are worthwhile, but the \nmoney has to come from somewhere.\n  My fear is it will come out of the modernization account, and right \nnow I think we all know some of our potential enemies and adversaries \nout in the field are better equipped than we are. We have to correct \nthis thing. So the money has to come out of somewhere. It is going to \nhave to come out of some of the Defense accounts.\n  I feel sorry for our chairman, Senator Warner, who is going to have \nto lead us in making some decisions on where to make cuts if this \namendment passes. It is very serious.\n  Again, there is no stronger supporter of the Guard and Reserve than I \nam, but this is something that is more money spent and not directed \nproperly and it has to come out of some place where we have a very \nserious problem. There is nothing free in this bill. I do not know of \nany Guard and Reserve members from my State of Oklahoma who have talked \nto me about this and have offered places it should come out of or even \ncalled me up to support it.\n  It is an amendment that is going to have to be defeated. We need to \nsave all the money we can in order to keep our current authorization \nprogram. There is nothing we can cut, that I can think of right now, \nthat would be appropriate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman if I might \nhave 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I thank my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, \nas well as those we have just spoken. These are individuals who, like \nme, have first and foremost in their hearts the welfare of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces in every possible way, but we must also bear \nin mind the fiscal realities with which we are confronted, the equities \nbetween the balance of benefits to the Active Duty and Reserve and the \nGuard and the need at this time.\n  It is available should anyone want it, but it has to be on a shared-\ncost basis with the taxpayers of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 7 minutes \nremaining under the control of the proponents of the amendment. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the distinguished Senator from Vermont be given \nsuch time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I would like a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will be very brief so the Senator from South Carolina \ncan speak.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Armed\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nServices Committee. As he knows, I came from the funeral of a Guard \nmember in Vermont, and I might say to my distinguished friend, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, the widow of this Guard member was very \ntouched by a message the distinguished Senator from Virginia had \nexpressed to her via me, and I appreciate that. It was his typical \ngenerosity of spirit to do so. It tells me in the war on terror, our \nGuard and Reserves are a 21st century fighting force, but they have a \n20th century health insurance, and this partnership with Senator Graham \nof Florida, Senator Daschle, Senator Clinton, and others has been very \ngood. I hope it will help.\n  For the past 2 years, we have worked to expand the availability of \nhealth insurance to members of the 800,000-person National Guard and \nReserve. It is squarely and strongly in our national interest, as well \nas in the interests of our Guard and Reserve soldiers and their \nfamilies, to ensure that this force is strong, that our citizen-\nsoldiers are healthy, and that these proud men and women know that \nthere is an extensive benefit network to reward them for their \nsacrifice.\n  Two years ago, a GAO study found that almost 20 percent of the \nreserves, more than 150,000 citizen-soldiers, do not have access to \nadequate health insurance when they are on drilling status. The bulk of \nthe uninsured reside in the lower ranks, and the study reported that \nalmost 40 percent of the enlisted force in uninsured. In other words, \nmany of the men and women who are prepared to leave their full-time \njobs and their families at a moment's notice have no assurance of \nhaving access to basic health insurance.\n  Our Guard and the Reserves are doing more for us than ever before, \nboth at home and abroad. In fairness to them and their families, and in \nthe interest of military readiness, these health care upgrades should \nbe a high priority.\n  Last year, I was pleased to be part of a bipartisan coalition that \nworked and succeeded in enacting a strong program to allow members of \nthe Guard and Reserve, who are unemployed or do not have access to \nhealth insurance through their employers, to be able to buy into the \nmilitary's TRICARE program on a cost-share basis. This program \nguaranteed that every member of the Guard and Reserve would have \ninsurance access from some source, whether from their employers or \nthrough the military.\n  It was surprising and disappointing to me that the administration \nopposed this program last year, going so far as to threaten a veto of \nthe Defense bill. I am even more disappointed that the Department of \nDefense has still yet to put the TRICARE buy-in program for reservists \nin place. That sends a terrible signal to the members of the Guard and \nReserve who comprise a substantial portion of our forces deployed \nabroad and who stand ready to face other national emergencies as they \narise. We need to get this program going and to expand it even further, \nand without needless delay.\n  This amendment will open up the TRICARE cost-share program to every \nmember of the National Guard and Reserve, providing an affordable \nsource of insurance to every reservist. The amendment also allows the \nfamilies of activated reservists to maintain their civilian health \ninsurance, which will reduce some of the invariable turbulence from \ndeployments.\n  This amendment mirrors almost exactly what passed out of the Senate \n87 to 10 last year. Since then, the Guard and Reserve have been tapped \neven more heavily to carry out the military occupations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I urge the Senate to vote in favor of this critical readiness \ninitiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might be allowed one-quarter \nminute to reply to my colleague from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. My colleague very kindly referred to our conversation \nearlier today when he, as every Member of this Chamber, has taken time \nto attend funerals in their respective States for those who lost their \nlives in the conflicts now ongoing, principally in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  I mentioned to him a soldier's grave at the Battle of Normandy. It \nwas a British soldier, and he was killed in the invasion. As custom in \nthe British military, the families may put a brief inscription on the \ntombstones. On this tombstone is the phrase:\n\n       To the world he was known but as one. To his family he was \n     known as the world.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the proponents of \nthe amendment have 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, following those eloquent \nwords of the chairman, this is not about who cares about our military; \nwe all do. This is about priorities and what we are going to do when we \nsay we care.\n  The law of the country is such that, if you are a part-time Federal \nemployee working 16 hours, you are eligible for Federal Government \nhealth care. If you are a part-time citizen soldier training to defend \nyour country, answering calls for hurricanes and natural disasters in \nyour State and providing homeland security, you get zero. We need to \nfix that.\n  The committee bill puts a proposal on the table that goes as follows: \nThe guardsmen and reservists pay some; the employer pays the other 72 \npercent. Your Government doesn't contribute 1 penny to the health care \nneeds of the Guard and Reserve community. Mr. President, 25 percent of \nthe Guard and Reserve called to go on active duty can't go because of \ntheir lack of health care. We need to invest in their health care \nbecause they are keeping us free.\n  Medicare has a $400 billion prescription drug benefit that has just \nbeen passed. I voted no because I am worried about the explosive cost \nto the future and our grandchildren not being able to afford it. I got \noutvoted. It is a program that is in existence. You can sign up for a \ndiscount card today. You ought to look into it.\n  We gave $20 billion to the Iraqi people who are sitting on $1 \ntrillion worth of oil and we are not asking for 1 penny back in \npayment. We are going to build schools, roads, highways; we are going \nto spend $25 billion--more, probably, before the day is over--\nsupporting our troops to support Iraq.\n  Our bill allows Guard and Reserve families and Guard and Reserve \nmembers to be part of the military health care system year round. When \nthey are not called to active duty they have to pay a premium of $1,800 \na year for their family, just like a part-time Federal employee. People \nin Iraq are not paying anything back. It is a total gift.\n  Mr. President, $400 billion to provide discounts for every senior in \nAmerica--$400 billion. This costs $1 billion a year for 300,000 \nfamilies. There are bills in this Senate and this House where one \nbridge costs more than the health care program needs of 300,000 \nfamilies.\n\n  I will take a backseat to no one about trying to save taxpayer \ndollars. I would argue, if the taxpayers could be here today and if \nthey could vote to spend this $1 billion to make sure the citizen \nsoldier is treated as every other part-time Federal employee, they \nwould say: Here is my wallet, take what you need. This idea we can't \nafford it is bogus.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is there any job in the Federal Government where an \nindividual would work 2 days a month and receive $7,000 or $5,000 worth \nof benefits in health care?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. The way the program works, you can be a \ntemporary employee working 16 hours, work a year, then get health care, \nand you pay a premium. If you work 16 hours a week, you can get full-\ntime health care benefits paying a premium. What a Guard member does, \nhe works 2 days a month, 2 weeks a year, and 40 percent of the people \nin Afghanistan and Iraq come out of that pool. Now they are getting \nkilled. It is not an average, everyday part-time job. The people who \nare left behind, the families, take a pay cut. The average Guard and \nReserve member, when they get called to active duty their pay goes \ndown, but they don't complain. They go, I say with all due respect.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for additional question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes.\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. If somebody is activated and they go to Afghanistan or \nIraq, don't they receive full health care costs without paying the 28 \npercent?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. They do, and when they come back home \nbecause of what we did last year they get health care for 6 months. But \nafter that 6 months, 25 percent of them go back into the civilian world \nwhere they have no health care, zero. That is not right. That is not \nlike every other Federal employee who is part-time. That is not right \nand we cannot afford to let that continue to happen because we are \ngoing to be needing these men and women more than ever. Their families \nare stressed. This is a chance to spend a little bit of money on people \nwho are giving everything, including their lives and their limbs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Daschle \namendment which would provide TRICARE benefits for reservists and their \nfamily members while in a non-active status, and direct the DoD to pay \nprivate insurance premiums for reservists when ordered to active duty. \nUnder the Graham/Daschle proposal, if enrolled in TRICARE, Reserve \nmembers would pay 28 percent of the annual premium and the Department \nof Defense would pay the remaining 72 percent.\n  The benefit is cost prohibitive. CBO recently estimated the benefit \nwould cost $700 million in fiscal year 2005, $5.7 billion over 5 years; \nand $14.2 billion over 10 years.\n  The Department of Defense estimates are much higher, at $1.9 billion \nin fiscal year 2005 and $11.6 billion over 5 years.--About $2 billion a \nyear.\n  In future years, this enhanced benefit will carve out essential \nfunding that DoD needs to maintain readiness, meet procurement needs, \ntransform the Armed Forces and continue the Global War on Terrorism.\n  The Senate is already making significant investment in our Guard and \nReserve forces. In the fiscal year 2004 Defense Appropriation bill, we \nprovided: $15.1 billion for pay and allowances, $14.3 billion in \nOperation and Maintenance funding for training, education and support, \nand about $2.5 billion for National Guard and Reserve Equipment--in \ntotal, an investment of about $31.9 billion for the Guard and Reserve.\n  A substantial portion of this investment is within the active \ncomponent accounts for equipment and weapons that go directly to our \nGuard and Reserve forces. These items include: HUMMWVs, LITENING \nTargeting Pods for Aircraft, Construction Equipment, Heavy Trucks, and \nLarge Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures to defeat shoulder fired \nmissiles--LAIRCM.\n  If the proposed amendment is adopted, there should be great concern \nthat this enhanced entitlement program will come at the expense of \nother Guard and Reserve requirements for training and equipping the \nforce.\n  The chairman's bill already offers several permanent provisions to \nenhance the medical readiness and ensure continuity of care for reserve \nmembers and their families, including a provision that provides the \nopportunity for Reserve members and their employers to participate in \nTRICARE while the member is in a non-active duty status--a cost shared \nby the Reserve member and his or her employer.\n  The chairman's bill also provides for a demonstration program to \ndetermine the need for, and feasibility of providing TRICARE benefits \nto members of the Ready Reserve who are eligible for unemployment \ncompensation or ineligible for employer-provided health care coverage.\n  In a September 2003 report, GAO found that DoD data does not identify \na need to offer TRICARE to reservists and their families when members \nare not on active duty. Many of the unknown factors include: the effect \non recruiting and retention, the impact on active duty personnel, the \nimpact on the TRICARE system and the military treatment facilities, and \nthe number of reservists that might participate.\n  The proposed demonstration program and enhanced benefits included in \nthe chairman's bill will clearly enhance the medical readiness and \nensure continuity of care for reserve members and their families.\n  The Department of Defense and Congress should take the time to \nfurther study the appropriate level of health care benefits for our \nGuard and Reserve, and allow the enhanced benefits included in the \nchairman's bill to be implemented and studied before we commit to \nspending billions of dollars on a new entitlement program.\n  The Department is in the process of appointing an advisory committee \non military compensation to review these types of issues. I believe it \nis prudent to conduct these studies before Congress acts on this \nlegislation.\n  Due to the high cost of the proposal and because of the enhanced \nbenefits already contained in the chairman's bill, I must urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time for debate \nhas expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Res. 369\n\n       Whereas during the dark days of World War II, the United \n     States, the world, and the very future of freedom were \n     threatened by nazism, fascism, and tyranny;\n       Whereas a generation of Americans stepped forward to \n     confront this scourge, accepting the call to duty to fight \n     the Axis Powers, to defend freedom, and to put their lives on \n     the line so that future generations could live in peace and \n     freedom;\n       Whereas during World War II, the brave men and women of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States fought alongside allies \n     from more than 30 other nations to vanquish the tyranny and \n     oppression of the Axis Powers on the sea, on the land, and in \n     the air in distant lands in every part of the globe;\n       Whereas more than 16,000,000 Americans served in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States during World War II, hailing from \n     every corner of the United States and its territories;\n       Whereas more than 671,000 Americans were wounded and over \n     105,000 Americans were held as prisoners of war in that \n     terrible conflict;\n       Whereas more than 400,000 members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their \n     lives to defeat the evils of nazism, fascism, and tyranny, \n     and to preserve the United States and the ideals the people \n     of the United States hold true;\n       Whereas by the end of World War II, the members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States had become symbols of hope \n     for the victors, the liberated peoples of the world, and \n     their former adversaries;\n       Whereas the victory of the Allied Powers in World War II \n     paved the way for the growth of democracy and freedom in the \n     defeated nations of Germany and Japan, and laid the \n     foundation for the West to confront, and eventually defeat, \n     the threat of Communism;\n       Whereas the people of the United States can never fully \n     express their gratitude to all the members of the Armed \n     Services, including the ``Greatest Generation'' of World War \n     II, who have dedicated themselves to protecting the people of \n     the United States and to defending the ideals and principles \n     of our great country;\n       Whereas 114 veterans of World War II have served in the \n     Senate, including 6 who are currently serving: Senator Akaka \n     of Hawaii, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, Senator Inouye \n     of Hawaii, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, Senator Stevens \n     of Alaska, and Senator Warner of Virginia; and\n       Whereas the Senate, on the occasion of the dedication of \n     the World War II Memorial and the 60th Anniversary of the D-\n     day landings in Normandy, France, is proud to honor its \n     Members, past and present, who served in World War II: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its eternal appreciation for the veterans of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States who fought and toiled \n     to protect the United States and preserve the freedom and way \n     of life of the United States during World War II;\n       (2) honors the brave men and women who made the ultimate \n     sacrifice and gave their lives in defense of liberty and the \n     United States during that global conflict; and\n       (3) proudly commends the 108 former Members and 6 current \n     Members of the Senate who are veterans of World War II, \n     including Senator Akaka, Senator Hollings, Senator Inouye, \n     Senator Lautenberg, Senator Stevens, and Senator Warner, for \n     their leadership and service to the United States both in war \n     and in peace.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks and Senator Daschle's remarks, Senator Stevens be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the ``greatest \ngeneration''--the veterans of World War II who fought so valiantly to \nsave the world from tyranny. This weekend, thousands of veterans from \nWorld War II gathered on The Mall to witness the dedication of a \nmemorial to their heroism and to their sacrifice. Many of us had also \nthe opportunity to join them after the celebration, the recognition \nceremonies, with our families on that Mall in tribute to them at this \nwonderful memorial.\n  As President Bush said in his remarks to this remarkable group, \n``When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans showed the \nfinest qualities of our Nation and of our humanity.''\n  It is fitting that Saturday's event was the largest gathering of \nsurviving veterans in 60 years, and perhaps more than coincidental that \nthe spring weather cooperated so beautifully for this truly historic \nday.\n  Nearly 60 years have passed since the ``greatest generation'' won \nthat terrible war. It seems inevitable now that America would defeat \nthe forces of Naziism and fascism. Our enemies were wicked and freedom \nwas right. But as President Reagan put it so eloquently in his address \non the 40th anniversary of D-Day:\n\n       For four long years, much of Europe had been under a \n     terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in \n     the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was \n     enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue. Here, in \n     Normandy, the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought \n     against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human \n     history.\n\n  Those were the words of President Reagan. Sixteen million Americans \nserved in the Armed Forces during that great battle. They hailed from \nevery corner of the United States, from the countryside to city \nstreets, from high school graduation classes to suburban family homes.\n  Mr. President, 671,000 Americans were wounded and over 105,000 \nAmericans were held as prisoners of war. More than 400,000 gave their \nlives to defend America and to preserve our freedom.\n  The Senate is honored to have among us men who fought in that Great \nWar:\n  Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, who served in the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, including service on Saipan and Tinian;\n  Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, who served in the U.S. Army \nas an officer in the North African and European campaigns, receiving \nthe Bronze Star and seven campaign ribbons;\n  Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, whose battlefield heroism earned him \nthe highest award for military valor, the Medal of Honor, along with a \nBronze Star, Purple Heart with a cluster, and 12 other medals and \ncitations;\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who enlisted in the Army \nSignal Corps and served in Europe;\n  Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who was a pilot in the China-Burma-\nIndia theater, for which he earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses, \ntwo Air Medals, and the Yuan Hai Medal awarded by the Republic of \nChina;\n\n  Senator John Warner, who enlisted in the Navy in World War II and \nwent on to fight in the Korean war in the Marine Corps. Senator Warner \nserved as a Marine Corps reservist for 10 years and was promoted to the \nrank of captain.\n  As newsman and author Tom Brokaw wrote in his best selling book, \n``The Greatest Generation,''\n\n       They answered the call to save the world from the two most \n     powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, \n     instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They \n     faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. \n     They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved \n     the world.\n\n  A veteran at Saturday's dedication on The Mall was asked by a \nreporter\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nhow they did it. How did ordinary young men set aside their fear in the \nface of extraordinary odds against fierce and determined enemies? The \nveteran had been a machine gunner on a pair of bombers that \nsuccessfully outmaneuvered 12 Japanese fighter planes. He replied \nsimply:\n\n       There's nothing else you can do but do your best, and keep \n     firing until the ammunition runs out.\n\n  This afternoon, we salute these extraordinary Americans who did their \nbest and kept firing to save America. If they are the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' we are the ``grateful generation.'' Their honor, courage, \nand valor will never be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this last weekend, in the shadow of the \nLincoln Memorial, our Nation dedicated a new memorial to the generation \nof Americans who fought and won the Second World War. One cannot help \nbut imagine the look of respect and approval coming over the face of \nthe great emancipator, the man who ended slavery in our country, as he \nlooks upon a memorial to those who ended enslavement of an entire \ncontinent and gave the world a new birth of freedom.\n  While this honor is long overdue, we must acknowledge that no \nmemorial, no ceremony, no words could match the scope of this \ngeneration's achievement. The true monument to their efforts exists not \non the National Mall but in the hearts of the hundreds of millions in \nAmerica and billions more throughout the world who live in freedom \nthanks to their courage. We are the children of their sacrifice. We \nhave flourished in the Nation they came home to build. The debt we owe \nthem is without end.\n  The Senate family is blessed, as the majority leader noted, to serve \nalongside six men who fought for their Nation in World War II:\n  Senator John Warner enlisted in the Navy as a 17-year-old in 1945 and \nlater reenlisted in the Marines in the Korean war; Senator Frank \nLautenberg, who served so ably as an Army Signal Corps soldier in \nEurope; Senator Daniel Akaka, who served in the Army Corps of \nEngineers; Senator Fritz Hollings, who served as an Army officer in the \nNorth African and European campaigns, earning a Bronze Star; Senator \nTed Stevens, who served in the Air Force, earned two Distinguished \nFlying Crosses and two Air Medals as a member of the Flying Tigers; \nSenator Daniel Inouye, who saw the smoke rising from Pearl Harbor as a \n17-year-old growing up in Honolulu, and served in the Army's 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team, earning, among so many other high honors, the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, the highest award our Nation confers for \nvalor in battle.\n  Whatever debt these men owe their country, their service in a time of \nwar was paid in full. As so many of their generation, their service \ndidn't end when they took off their uniforms. They saw this Nation and \nindeed humanity at its very best. They saw an effort in which every \nlast person pitched in, every aircraft maker who made a fighter plane, \nevery woman who worked in a factory, every farmer who grew food for our \ntroops, every child who tended a victory garden. They saw with their \nown eyes the greatness that could be won when a nation of free men and \nfree women worked together to fight for the cause of liberty.\n  They dedicated their lives to carrying forward that spirit and \nleading our Nation to still greater heights. That spirit runs \nthroughout the careers of each of these six men, as it has for so many \nother World War II veterans who have served in this Chamber over the \nyears. Each of us who have had the honor to serve with them can attest \nthat they are distinguished not only by their service in war but by \ntheir tireless commitment to ensuring that each successive generation \nof Americans could enjoy the blessings our free Nation had to offer.\n  Thanks to their wisdom and leadership, generations of Americans have \ngrown up in peace and prosperity and have learned that in return for \ntheir blessings, they too have a duty to give something back to their \ncountry. Nowhere is that more clear than in the service of young \nAmericans fighting now in Iraq, whose courage echoes that of the men \nand women who wore the uniform of their country in generations past.\n  Ultimately, what we learn from their lifetime of service is the fight \nfor freedom is never finished. If we are to repay their debt to us, we \nmust receive the liberty they won not as a gift but as a challenge to \ntake up their work as our own. We could do our country no greater \nservice than to assume the spirit of unity and decency each has \nexemplified throughout their long careers. It is a great comfort and \njoy to know that should we falter or fall short, our friends are still \nbeside us, living monuments to remind us of our duty. Their \ncontributions to America continue undiminished, and they have the \nundying thanks of the Senate and the Nation it serves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am humbled to be among the Members who \nhave been mentioned by the leaders. I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing my remarks, items 1, 2, and 3 be printed in the Record. Item \n1 is a list of Senators known to have served in World War II. The \nsecond item is a list of the eight Senators who have received the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. On that list is the name of Danny Inouye, \nwho was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I will read once \nagain to the Senate the citations my friend received.\n\n       Citation from the President of the United States, \n     authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in \n     the name of the Congress the Medal of Honor to: Second \n     Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye, United States Army, for \n     conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life \n     above and beyond the call of duty:\n       Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself by \n     extraordinary heroism in action on 21 April 1945, in the \n     vicinity of San Terenzo, Italy. While attacking a defended \n     ridge guarding an important road junction, Second Lieutenant \n     Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail of \n     automatic weapon and small arms fire, in a swift enveloping \n     movement that resulted in the capture of an artillery and \n     mortar post and brought his men to within 40 yards of the \n     hostile force. Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the \n     enemy halted the advance with crossfire from three machine \n     guns. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second \n     Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope within \n     five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two \n     grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could \n     retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun \n     nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he continued to \n     engage other hostile positions at a close range until an \n     exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite intense \n     pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct his \n     platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were \n     again deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 \n     enemy soldiers were killed and eight others captured. By his \n     gallant, aggressive tactics and by his indomitable \n     leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to \n     advance through formidable resistance, and was instrumental \n     in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye's \n     extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping \n     with the highest traditions of the military service and \n     reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States \n     Army.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the third item being his citation of the \nMedal of Honor be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1, 2 and 3.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are few among us who deserve the honor the Senate \nis according us, and Daniel K. Inouye is the first.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Senate Historical Office, 2004]\n\n      United States Senators Known To Have Served in World War II\n\n       Abdnor, James (army); Akaka, Daniel (army); Allott, Gordon \n     (army air corps); Andrews, Mark (army); Bartlett, Dewey \n     (marines); Bass, Ross (air corps); Bentsen, Lloyd (army); \n     Boggs, James C.

Mr. President, we have a number of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle who desire to speak. I make a recommendation that we \nrotate back and forth between sides. On this side I ask each Senator to \ntry to speak for less than 5 minutes. I yield to each of them up to 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak following the remarks of Senator McConnell, and following that, \nSenator Dodd be our next speaker in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to our colleagues from the \ngreatest generation, it is very difficult to imagine how one could \nimprove upon the observations already made by the majority leader, the \nDemocratic leader, and the President pro tempore. We all stand in \nadmiration of their remarkable service.\n  America has sort of rediscovered World War II beginning in 1994 with \nSteven Ambrose's great book about D-day, followed up by his marvelous \nbook ``Citizen Soldiers,'' which was about the replacements that came \nafter D-day, one of whom was my dad.\n  I stand here today as a proud son of one of the greatest generation. \nI was unable to make the World War II Memorial opening the other day, \nbut I did have an opportunity to watch it on television. At the same \ntime, I was going through some old letters from my father to my mother \nfrom the theater, the most interesting of which was a letter dated at \nthe top ``VE Day, May 8, 1945, Pizen, Czechoslovakia.'' As one of the \nfoot soldiers in the Second Division, he had fought his way from March, \nApril, and May across Germany and met the Russians in Pizen. Now free \nto kind of express himself without fear of the mail being censored, he \nalluded to a pretty tough couple of months of fighting in Germany \nwithout any specifics, obviously--the members of the greatest \ngeneration never wanted to talk about the specifics--and made, I \nthought, a rather prophetic observation.\n  This was a regular foot soldier in Europe on the day the Germans \nsurrendered. He said: I hope we will not draw down the force too much, \nand I am really worried about the Russians.\n  He had had a chance to meet the Russians in Pizen when the two forces \ncame together.\n  So in addition to celebrating the marvelous service of our six \ncolleagues from the greatest generation, I thought I would take the \nopportunity to allude to my father who was also one of the 16 million \nAmericans who served in uniform during World War II. This generation \nhas made an enormous contribution to our country.\n  Tom Brokaw argued, and I think he was probably correct, this is \ncertainly the greatest generation probably since the generation of the \nFounding Fathers. All six Senators have our admiration and respect. We \nthank them not only for their service overseas but their service in the \nSenate in the ensuing years. They are, indeed, great Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was a little boy when the war ended, but \nwhere I am from, Searchlight, NV, we look at a person by the name of \nBill Nellis as the person we recognize as the epitome of the greatest \ngeneration. Here is a man who was not eligible for the draft. He had a \nfamily, but he decided to join at age 26 or 27. He went into the Army \nAir Corps, completed 68 missions, was through with his assigned \nmissions, and on his 69th mission agreed to volunteer for someone who \nwas unable to fly that day, and it was his last mission. He was shot \ndown over Belgium, where Bill Nellis still is buried. Of course, Nellis \nAir Force base is named after Bill Nellis of Searchlight, NV.\n  As has been said today, we have six patriots who serve in the Senate \nwho are examples to each one of us. Senator Danny Akaka has the unique \ndistinction of having been at Pearl Harbor and saw the smoke, fire, \ndeath, and destruction. He was there at the beginning of World War II, \nbut he was also stationed on the Island of Tinian when the Enola Gay \ntook off to end the war. Danny Akaka watched the Enola Gay take off \nfrom Tinian, where it really did end the war.\n\n  Senator Hollings is a person who was educated to be in the military. \nHe graduated from military school, the Citadel, in his hometown of \nCharleston. In 1942, he immediately became an officer, spent many years \nin North Africa, the European campaigns. In fact, he was awarded seven \ncampaign ribbons, meaning that he was involved in seven major battles \nin World War II.\n  He came back, of course, and has dedicated his adult life to public \nservice, which all of us are very sorry to see is going to end at the \nend of this term. What a great Senator he has been and what a great \nsoldier he has been, just like Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Stevens, and Senator Warner.\n  Senator Inouye is my friend. He is a friend of everyone who serves in \nthe Senate and thousands of others. His heroism, displayed in the \nVosges mountains, in France, is something that is a story to behold. As \nhas been related by Senator Stevens, he truly was an American hero and \nis an American hero.\n  But again for Senator Inouye, it is not only what he did in battle, \ncourageously, it is what he has done his entire life, courageously, in \nthe Halls of Congress. He is a role model for me as to how a Senator \nshould legislate and act.\n  Senator Lautenberg, son of immigrants, represents so well what the \nAmerican military should be. After he graduated from high school in New \nJersey, he enlisted and served in the Army Signal Corps. He spent most \nof World War II in Europe. When he returned home he had the GI Bill of \nRights--again, something that had never been around before. He took \nfull advantage of that and, after graduating, became one of the finest \nbusinesspeople America has ever known. He gave up that business career \nto serve in the U.S. Senate, and he has done that so well.\n  I have had the good fortune to travel on a congressional delegation \nthat was led by Senator Stevens and Senator Glenn. It was a wonderful \nexperience for me as a young Senator, to travel to Europe with these \ntwo fine Senators. I learned in our meetings we held with different \nleaders of nations during that time of their military careers. There is \nno better example of that than when we were in Czechoslovakia and \nSenator Stevens and Senator Glenn saw someone wearing an old World War \nII flight jacket, the same type of flight jackets they wore in World \nWar II. That evening we spent a lot of time listening to these two \nAmerican heroes talk about their experiences in World War II. It is \nsomething I will never forget. It was a wonderful evening I spent with \nthese two fine gentlemen.\n  Senator Stevens was a pilot, as we have learned, in World War II in \nthe China-Burma-India theaters, supporting the Flying Tigers of the \n14th Air Force. He received two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Air \nMedals, and the Yuan Hai medal, awarded by the Republic of China.\n  Senator Warner is someone who has dedicated his life to public \nservice. He started when he was 17 years old. As we have learned, he \nlater got out of the Navy, went into the Marines, and became Secretary \nof the Navy. He is a person who fulfilled, as have the other five, a \nrendezvous with destiny. These men kept that rendezvous. When history \ncalled, all six answered. Every one of them who is now a United States \nSenator displayed courage in the war, and, as I have said, they have \ndisplayed the same courage in their political careers. Four of these \nMembers are Democrats, members of the party I represent. Two are \nmembers of the Republican Party--on the other side of the aisle, as we \nsay. But without any equivocation, each of these men share a deep love \nof our country, and they have put the good of our great Nation above \npartisan politics on so many occasions.\n  I am proud to be a U.S. Senator. One reason for being proud is I am \nable to serve with six American patriots.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise to pay tribute and honor \nto our World War II colleagues here in the Senate: Senator Inouye, \nSenator Akaka, Senator Warner, Senator Hollings, Senator Lautenberg, \nand, of course, my friend, Senator Stevens. I\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nwould like to take a few minutes this afternoon to speak my heartfelt \nappreciation to my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Alaska, \nSenator Stevens.\n  I know words alone can never accurately reflect the tenacious spirit \nof our friend and decorated World War II veteran. Like so many veterans \nof the war, Senator Stevens downplays his role. He will tell you quite \nsimply he did what was expected. Yet it is something that must be told \ntime and time again to realize how much this one humble servant has \ndone and continues to do, both for the country and for the State of \nAlaska.\n  Prior to going into the war, Senator Stevens made a promise to his \naunt with whom he was living at the time. He made a promise that he was \nnot going to enlist until he could do so without her consent. So he \nstayed in college until he was 19, and then he immediately put the \nwheels in motion to enlist. But he didn't pass that first flight \nphysical. His eyes apparently were not up to par. I think my colleagues \nin this Chamber who know Senator Stevens, especially those of them who \nmight play tennis with him, know that this setback was not something \nthat was going to keep Senator Stevens down. He was determined to \nfulfill his commitment. He went out and did eye exercises for a couple \nof months and passed that next flight physical.\n  During World War II, Senator Stevens flew C-46s and C-47s in the \nChina-Burma-India theater, supporting the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air \nForce. He received two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Air Medals, \nand the Yuan Hai medal, awarded by the Republic of China, a truly \nhonorable and amazing tour of duty.\n  But this was not enough action for Senator Stevens. It was on his way \nhome from China that he gained an interest, I guess, in politics. \nDuring the war, he had done his job. He flew every mission that was \nrequested of him and volunteered for more. He volunteered to drive the \nBurma Road with a convoy of trucks because they needed officers.\n  But afterward, the keen interest in politics, in terms of why the \nUnited States was involved in the war, kicked in, and Alaska and the \nNation have benefited ever since. He finished his undergraduate \neducation at UCLA, earned his juris doctorate from Harvard, and served \nin a number of Government and elected positions before coming here to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  To Senator Stevens, Senators Inouye, Akaka, Warner, Hollings, and \nLautenberg, I join with my colleagues in thanking you for your \ndistinguished service to our country and to this legislative body, not \nonly because you helped to protect and defend our freedoms but also \nbecause you continue to support those who now serve to protect and \ndefend our beloved America. You are the living history of the greatest \ngeneration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commend our two distinguished leaders--\nmajority leader Senator Frist and Democratic leader Senator Daschle--\nfor their very eloquent remarks which I think capture the spirit of all \nof us as we gather today.\n  I want to take a few moments to recognize six of our colleagues for \ntheir wonderful contribution who were part of this remarkable \ngeneration which we have talked about so frequently over the last \nnumber of days, and to thank them immensely for their contribution not \nonly during that great conflict but also for their continuing service \nto this country.\n  I think all of us witnessed one way or another this past weekend the \nremarkable gathering on the great Mall of our capital city for the \ninauguration and dedication of the national World War II Memorial.\n  We are recognizing six of our colleagues today, but having watched \nthat event, two individuals I must say I couldn't take my eyes off. One \nwas our former majority leader Bob Dole. Without his leadership, the \nnew memorial would not have been constructed. He is not with us any \nlonger as a part of this body but was for some years and played such an \nimportant role in seeing to it that this memorial would be built in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I am stunned to know that about 1,000 of our 6 colleagues' fellow \nveterans who served in World War II are lost every single day. So this \nmonument could not be built soon enough.\n  The other one I was watching was former President George Bush, a \nremarkable hero of that great conflict in his own right. He has a \nwonderful sense of humility, and rarely discusses his tremendous \nservice as a combat pilot. In fact, I find one thing common about these \n6 colleagues of ours, Democrats and Republicans alike. They have a \nwonderful sense of humility. Every time this subject matter comes up, \nall of them show a reluctance to talk about their own individual \ncontributions. I admire them for that.\n  As for my other heroes, I don't want to make all of them feel very \nold. But my good friend from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, just said ``Happy \nbirthday'' to me the other day. He asked, How old are you? I hesitate \nto tell you that I was 6 years old when D-Day occurred. I turned 60 the \nother day. That makes me feel old. But it must make those who were part \nof that great conflict a bit older as we gather here today.\n  But it is not an exaggeration to say we would not, in my view, be \nenjoying the freedoms which we do as Americans and as so many other \npeople do--all over the world--today if it had not been for the \nremarkable contribution of those who gave so much, particularly the \n400,000 who never came home. Of the 16 million who served, 400,000 gave \ntheir lives on the battlefields of Europe, Africa and the Pacific \nislands.\n  We can never find the adequate words to express our gratitude to them \nand to their families--the wonderful people who made a contribution \nobviously on the home front as well producing the materials necessary \nto successfully prosecute the war.\n  In recent times, we have had a number of debates over what \nconstitutes a ``just war.'' There is no such debate about World War II. \nWorld War II was truly a defining moment--not only for our Nation, but \nfor the entire world. It was not merely a clash of armies. It was one \nof values. It was a time when those nations of the world that stood for \nfreedom, tolerance, equality and opportunity took on, and defeated, the \nforces of tyranny, oppression and genocide. World War II was literally \na fight for the future of humanity. It is no exaggeration to say that \nhad the outcome of World War II been different, the institution in \nwhich we serve might very well not be in existence today.\n  Each and every one of us today owes his or her freedom, in a very \nreal way, to the men and women who gave of themselves during the war--\nthose who served overseas, as well as those who contributed on the \nhomefront. I would like to especially recognize the tremendous \ncontributions of those from my own State of Connecticut. About 210,000 \nmen and women from Connecticut served in the Second World War. \nConnecticut's civilians also played an enormous part in the war effort \nby helping supply our troops with planes, firearms, and other weapons \nand technologies that were so vital to our victory.\n  I want to be an additional voice here today to say, Thank you. It is \nrather remarkable that in a body of 100 people we have 6 veterans of \nWorld War II among us. We are very grateful to all of you for your \nwonderful contribution and to have you as wonderful friends--Frank \nLautenberg, Daniel Akaka, Daniel Inouye, two Senators from the same \nState, a rather remarkable distinction. I think it is special to have 2 \nSenators from the same State who are veterans. Fritz Hollings--I know I \nam in violation of Senate rules a bit. But I noticed someone in the \ngallery and wanted to pay tribute to Peatsy Hollings. I know there are \na lot of spouses and others who went through a lot as well.\n  In addition to my great friend from South Carolina and his lovely \nwife, Ted Stevens, who I care so much about and admire immensely; John \nWarner, one of my dearest friends in the world. I thank all of you for \nyour wonderful contributions.\n  I am very proud to serve with you, and I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I feel truly honored to be able to join \nwith my colleagues in recognizing today six of our own who are part of \nthe ``greatest generation'' and who made a tremendous contribution to \nthe freedom--\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nnot just of our country but to the world.\n  A lot has been said about Senators Inouye, Akaka, Hollings, \nLautenberg, Stevens, and Warner. I endorse almost everything said about \nall of them. I consider all of them good friends. I have stories on a \nfew of them, but I will not tell the stories if they will not \nreciprocate and tell stories on me.\n  But these are, as has just been said, very humble men who did \nabsolutely amazing things, who made tremendous contributions, and yet \nthey walk among us today with one foot in front of the other. You don't \nknow it when you deal with them.\n  I have had the privilege in recent times visiting some of the \nbattlefields in Europe--the battlefield of Bastogne with Senator \nHollings. My wife and I have been to Normandy beaches--Utah Beach, \nOmaha Beach, Sainte Mere Eglise--places where absolutely remarkable \nthings were done.\n  These are tremendous monuments. Unfortunately, I am not going to be \nable to go to D-Day. But I urge my colleagues to visit these locations \nwhen you have an opportunity and see the living memorials which are set \nup there and the movies that were taken of the events. When you see the \nconflicts they faced and the bravery, you think: Why on Earth would \nsomebody ever try to do that? There were literally hundreds--and \nprobably thousands--of undertakings that were seemingly impossible \nwhich the brave soldiers of the U.S. forces undertook on D-Day.\n  I join with my colleague from Connecticut, who mentioned two other \ngreat heroes, the former leader of this body, Bob Dole, and former \nPresident George Bush, who made tremendous contributions. These people \ndeserve our greatest admiration and our thanks, along with all of the \nother veterans, and the families of all of these men deserve special \nthanks.\n  I note that I think one Beth Stevens is watching close by, daughter \nof this good Senator from Alaska. I know how proud these young people \nare of their parents.\n  I do not know how many of you saw the movie, ``Ike: Countdown to D-\nDay.'' It was a fabulous movie, telling about all of the problems and \nthe hassles that went into the planning of D-Day. Getting ready to lead \nan invasion of 130,000 troops, 5,000 ships, 11,000 aircraft, you see \nhow many things could go wrong, not the least of which was when \nEisenhower told his Chief of Staff, General Beetle Smith, We are \nsurrounded by some of the biggest swelled heads in history, and my job \nis to keep them pulling together.\n  We had uncommon leadership from people who were ordinary human \nbeings, but we had uncommon valor from so many of the 16 million people \nwho served there. We say to all, Our sincerest thanks, our deepest \nrespect. We congratulate and thank them. Having watched that D-Day \nmovie, I can only say how lucky General Eisenhower was when there was \nnot 24-hour television coverage. If you were watching every day the \nkinds of problems and the hassles that General Eisenhower had to \nendure, with the media we now have they would probably call for the \nfiring of General Eisenhower and the impeachment of the President \nbecause lots of things went wrong. But these brave people, these brave \nmen persevered, and we owe them our heartfelt thanks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I thank you.\n  Akaka, Hollings, Inouye, Lautenberg--veterans of World War II. \nStevens, U.S. Army Air Corps, a veteran of World War II; Warner, Navy \nveteran of World War II. All unique men, men of decency, men of \ncharacter, plainspoken, humble and generous in spirit, noble in \npurpose.\n  Their lives have been about hope. They transformed a world and framed \nthe future. This institution and the world have been touched by each \none. We in the Senate watch them. We key off of them. We have learned \nmuch from these six distinguished Americans.\n\n  These men are not angels. We are not here to canonize them, but we \nare here to recognize one of the most unique times in the history of \nman. That time was not squandered by unique individuals who understood \nthe great purpose and challenge of their time.\n  I am connected to this generation, as millions of Americans, not just \nbecause I had the privilege of serving with them in the Senate, my \nfather was a veteran of World War II with the Army Air Corps in the \nSouth Pacific, the 13th Army Air Corps. He was a radio operator \ntailgunner on a B-25. He spent almost 3 years overseas.\n  If he were alive today, I don't know if he would have found a prouder \nmoment than what happened in Washington last weekend and what is \nhappening in the Senate today as we honor these unique Americans.\n  They lifted us up. They continue to lift us up. Yet they never asked \nfor anything in return for their service. I congratulate and thank our \ndistinguished colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, if I may take just a few minutes to \nrespond to the comments of our colleagues, to our majority leader, \nSenator Frist, and Tom Daschle, our Democratic leader, and other \ncolleagues, including Senator Reid, Senator Bond, and Senator Warner, \nwho is kind of a member of this clan of ours--to be with colleagues \nlike Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Hollings, and Senator \nAkaka, all serving together at the same time, it is hard to believe it \nwas as many years ago as it was.\n  Senator Hagel, I thank him for his comments, as well, and Senator \nDodd.\n  But it was a long time ago, and those who now are approaching 50 \nyears of age remember serving when we were just kids. I enlisted in \n1942 when my father was on his death bed with cancer. He was 42 in the \nyear 1942. It was a duty that I felt keenly and I enlisted, even as my \nfather was on his death bed. My mother was 36 years old.\n  I cannot remember any of my contemporaries who did not serve or who \nwere not going to serve. There were 16 million in uniform. It was quite \nan assembly of Americans of all cultures and religions. We had one \nmission and that was to protect this world of ours from becoming a \nproduct of fascism.\n  While it was so many years ago, it is wonderful to be able to recall \nwe were there. When I look at the actions of Danny Inouye, who among us \nis at the top, given the Congressional Medal of Honor, that is a \ndistinction that is given to so few people. As I recall my many \ndiscussions with Senator Inouye--I hope my memory is accurate--he had \nbeen hit by fire, even as he got up to lead his platoon further on. \nThat is bravery as few have it. He knew his duties had to continue \nbecause he had the responsibility of others he was in charge of.\n\n  Danny Inouye, as we all know, is modest to the core. He never brags, \nwould never talk about his performance. Danny will always stand for \nwhat is right, but he never is in a position where he brags about his \nincredible service.\n  Fritz Hollings, similarly, got his stars, his clusters for his duty \nin so many different combat areas.\n  Mine was different. I was not in a combat unit. I, like so many \nothers, performed my duties in a different place. Most of what I saw of \nWorld War II was from the top of a telephone pole. I was a pole \nlineman. My mission was to make sure the connections between those who \nwere serving at the front and those who were issuing the orders from \nway back at command headquarters were clearly transmitted. I took my \nresponsibilities seriously. Even as we were being bombed by B-1's and \nB-2's--for those who are not old enough to remember, one was a jet bomb \nand another was a rocket bomb. That was like a time bomb because you \nnever saw it coming. It went off and did whatever damage it did.\n  The first jet airplane I ever saw in the sky was German. They were \noutdistancing our fighter pilots in minutes. They would just pull away. \nThey would drop bombs wherever they could. This was my service \nprimarily in Belgium.\n  When I visited the World War II Memorial--and, unfortunately, I was \nnot there at the ceremony; I could not be, as I had longstanding plans, \nand I had to maintain those appointments--I visited with Senator Dole \nand Senator Inouye, Senator Hollings and Senator Warner, and Senator \nAkaka was there,\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nas well. Not to be critical, but I did not see anything that indicated \nhow many died in different places, what were the regiments that fought \nthese battles, what were the divisions, what were those who served on \nthe seas doing at the time when the bombs were falling or the torpedoes \nwere being sent.\n  It took my unit 3 days to cross the channel from England to France \nbecause they could not get the convoy stabilized enough to carry on.\n  I hope they will make some adjustments at the memorial to reflect the \nsacrifices that were made, other than in artistic terms. There is a \nwall of gold stars, each representing 100 deaths. Using quick \nmultiplication, you could figure out 400,000 people died in combat or \ncombat-related activities. We see New Jersey, we see New York, we see \nVirginia, and the other States; columns of granite, but not one \nindication of how many people came from the then-48 States and 6 \nterritories. Did 10,000 die from the State of New Jersey? It is just a \nguess.\n  It would be important if we knew what happened. The memorial has a \ncertain beauty. It is a tranquil beauty, however, and it does not talk \nto the smashing victories we had on D-Day or in the Belgium Bulge.\n  I was in Belgium at the time. I was not at the front line. The \nweather was abominable. It was gray and snowy and our troops were \ngetting licked badly and we were moving back.\n  I was taken down to the railroad station, given ammunition, and they \nsaid: OK, Lautenberg, you and your unit have to go up there. \nFortunately, with prayers supporting it, the sun came out and the Air \nForce got up into the sky, and they smashed the German line and moved \nit all back. It was the turning point in that stage of the war, \nDecember 1944.\n  We are all grateful to have survived, to be here, to be able to \nserve, to continue our service in this great body. I say to my \ncolleagues, I am grateful to each one of you--each one of you who \nserved, each one of you who made a difference in how this world of ours \nturned out, and each one of you who continues to serve. Even though we \nmight have different opinions about quite how we do it, the fact is, we \nare here because we want to continue to serve our country. We are lucky \nto be in America.\n  I thank all of you, my colleagues, for the work you do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, last weekend thousands of Americans \nflocked to our National Mall to pay tribute to the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' It was the dedication, as we all know, of the World War \nII Memorial.\n  It has now been 59 years since the end of the Second World War, and \nat long last our Nation has a place that honors the 16 million who \nserved in our Armed Forces, the more than 400,000 who died, and the \nmillions who supported the war effort here at home.\n  I was touched that those who served at home also were honored because \nthat war brought our Nation together as we had never seen before, and \nperhaps since.\n  I can think of no more appropriate honor than to recognize their \ncommitment, dedication, and sacrifice with a permanent memorial to the \nmen and women who fought to secure our freedom and stamp out Nazi \ntyranny.\n  Today we are honoring those Members of this esteemed body who fought \nfor our freedoms in World War II. Of the 114 Senators who have served \nin the war, I have been privileged to serve with 15 of them. Six are \nhere with me today.\n  Danny Akaka served in World War II with the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers as a welder-mechanic.\n  Ernest Hollings graduated from The Citadel in 1942 and received a \ncommission from the U.S. Army. He served as an officer in the North \nAfrican and European campaigns in World War II, receiving the Bronze \nStar and seven campaign ribbons.\n  Frank Lautenberg enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and \nserved in the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II.\n  Ted Stevens, during World War II, was a pilot in the China-Burma-\nIndia theater, supporting the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force. He \nreceived two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Air Medals, and a medal \nawarded from the Republic of China. Today he is chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Committee.\n  John Warner entered the Navy at age 17, and served on active duty in \nWorld War II. He went on to serve as a marine in the Korean War, and \nserved in the Department of Defense for 5 years during the Vietnam war. \nLater, he served our country as Secretary of the Navy, and now serves \nas the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the \nSenate.\n  Danny Inouye served in combat with the legendary ``Go for Broke'' \nunit in World War II, achieving the rank of captain and earning the \nNation's very highest award for military service, the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. He also earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart with \ncluster. He is the ranking member on the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Two of Texas' recent Senators, Lloyd Bentsen and John Tower, were \nboth proud Texans and veterans of World War II.\n  Three of our Nation's Commanders in Chief, who served in the Senate--\nPresidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon--also fought as part of the \n``greatest generation.''\n  For anyone who has read Tom Brokaw's book ``The Greatest \nGeneration,'' the stories of those who fought the bitter and brutal \nfight and then returned home to their families and went about their \nlives as if it were no big deal are today still sources of great \ninspiration to all of us because they had the commitment to do what was \nright, to answer the call to duty, to return without a complaint, with \nno second guessing, no protests. That was the mark of the ``greatest \ngeneration.''\n\n  Some of them went back to the factories and the fields, and back to \ntheir desks, and they did not even expect praise or admiration. Some \nwent into public service. Those we have mentioned today did and are \ndoing a wonderful job carrying the mantle of public service. They \nbrought with them the scars of war, and they carry the mantle of \nfreedom.\n  Bob Dole, with whom all of us served as well, what a great leader and \nwhat a great hero of World War II.\n  Strom Thurmond, once chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nserved, at the age of 40, in World War II and had to miss the 50th \nanniversary of D-day because his son was graduating from high school. \nWhat a legend.\n  I am honored to stand here and look around this fabulous room, these \nhallowed halls, and pay tribute to every one of you who gave me the \nright to stand here, and who will be forever in my heart because you \nare continuing to do so much for our country. I want you to know I \nbelieve without the great leadership you provided, neither my children \nnor I would know the freedom we know today. We do stand on the \nshoulders of giants, and we salute you.\n  Madam President, my distinguished colleague, the Senator who is the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, said I forgot President \nGeorge Bush, who also was a hero in World War II. That is certainly a \nhuge omission, and I apologize, and thank you, I say to the Senator, \nfor letting me set the record straight.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this past week has been a very memorable \nand inspirational and overdue time for all of us to come together as a \nnation and dedicate the World War II Memorial and recognize the efforts \nof our Nation's veterans in one of the fiercest wars in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  As we did, many of us took a moment to remember the events of those \ndays and how they affected us and, more importantly, how they affected \nthe people in our lives who played an important part in that war \neffort.\n  I had a special opportunity to remember my dad, Elmer Enzi, who \nserved in the war, and my uncle Edward Curtis and my uncle Edmund Wally \nEnzi who played a part in that war.\n  For many of us, those days are forever etched in our minds because \nthey had an impact on us and our families and friends that will never \nbe erased or forgotten. But it is nothing like the memory of those who \nactually participated.\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\n  We have the opportunity to honor the Senators who are with us today \nin this great body who played a part in that war. We have mentioned \nthem, their achievements.\n  I want to refer to a piece that was on Channel 1, which is an \neducational channel that goes to the schools every morning. They have \nseen these World War II events being dedicated and the people who came \nto those events. Each time there is one of those events, the people who \ncome are a little bit older. They found out the kids of this country \nwere getting kind of a false impression of who fought the war, so they \nput out a special piece that would be dedicated to these great men who \nserve in our Chamber. The title of it was: ``The Kids Who Saved the \nWorld.'' They showed the people coming to the reunions, but then they \nshifted back to the pictures of these people as they served. It made a \nmuch greater identification for the kids across this country that the \npatriots, the ones who put their lives on the line, were not much older \nthan the kids in school watching this Channel 1.\n  I thank Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator Fritz Hollings, Senator Daniel \nInouye, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Ted Stevens, and Senator John \nWarner for being those ``kids who saved the world'' and allowing us to \nbe here in this forum today.\n  For us, as Americans, our World War II story begins on December 7, \n1941, a date President Franklin D. Roosevelt told us would live in \ninfamy, as Japan suddenly and deliberately attacked the United States \nof America.\n  The next day, the President reassured a fearful nation that the \nattack on Pearl Harbor would not stand and that all our resources would \nbe brought to bear on ridding the world of the terrible menace that was \nthreatening the future peace and security of the United States and \nEurope.\n  In the years that followed, the United States put forth an effort to \ncombat evil that had never been seen before. Sixteen million served in \nour Armed Forces and a united America gladly did everything that could \npossibly be done to support the war effort back home. The United States \nwas fully committed to the cause at hand and no price was too great, no \nsacrifice too burdensome, and no hardship too severe, if it meant \nvictory overseas.\n  The World War II Memorial on the Mall commemorates the sacrifices of \nthose 16 million veterans who served with pride and patriotism during \nWorld War II. It also honors and recognizes the millions more who \nsupported the war cause back home. For without the efforts of our \ntroops on the front lines, and the support and encouragement of family \nand friends back home, we would have never been successful. Thanks to \nall of them, we succeeded beyond our greatest expectations. This was \ntruly a time when we knew there was no option but complete and total \nvictory and we refused to consider any other option--regardless of the \ncost.\n  When President Roosevelt made the call for recruits it was answered \nin unprecedented fashion. The 16 million Americans who reported for \nduty made it clear that they would pay any price to defend the freedoms \nand liberties of our own Nation. They also committed themselves to the \nliberation of Europe and the preservation of liberty there and in many \nother parts of the world.\n\n  They were just average Americans from small towns and large, from \nsmall States and large, who were caught up in a cause greater than \nthemselves. They soon showed themselves to be the greatest weapon ever \nknown in the history of warfare--the American Armed Forces. They were \nsent to far away places with strange sounding names, as the song goes, \nand they probably never imagined there was anything special about them. \nHeroes? They probably never thought of themselves that way, but for \nthose who read about their exploits, and for those of us who now live \nwith the freedom that their blood, sweat and tears provided, we cannot \nthink of them any other way.\n  They were young men and women, called to attempt the impossible, \nknowing the odds were against them, and still they tried, because they \nbelieved in our country and the principles we hold dear as a nation.\n  We have several World War II veterans serving with us here in the \nSenate, with several more serving in the House. Their commitment to \ncountry and duty which began so many years ago continues today in the \nCongress.\n  Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator Fritz Hollings, Senator Daniel Inouye, \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Ted Stevens, and Senator John Warner \nrepresent in a special way all of those who served with distinction and \nhonor during those days. They are our link with the past, a past that \nhas made our present possible.\n  What they achieved, along with all those who served with them, is \nbest seen in the words that have been posted on several Internet sites, \nattributed by some to Father Denis Edward O'Brien, USMC:\n\n     It is the soldier, not the reporter Who has given us freedom \n           of the press.\n\n     It is the soldier, not the poet, Who has given us freedom of \n           speech.\n\n     It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, Who has given us \n           freedom to demonstrate.\n\n     It is the soldier, not the lawyer, Who has given us freedom \n           of the right to a fair trial.\n\n     It is the soldier who salutes the flag, Who serves under the \n           flag and\n\n     Whose coffin is draped by the flag,\n     Who allows the protester to burn the flag.\n\n  This is the legacy our veterans have left us and it reflects the debt \nwe owe them all. They are--and they always have been--the force that \nguarantees our Bill of Rights. They are--and have been--the force that \nstands guard around the world, vigilant and watchful, while we sleep. \nThey are the ones for whom love of country are not just words, they are \na way of life.\n  In the years to come, the Memorial on the Mall will serve as a \nconstant reminder that freedom isn't free and that it comes at a great \nprice. More than 400,000 American lives were lost in World War II and \nmany more were wounded in battles all over the world. They will be \nremembered there. The memorial will also serve as a symbol of the \nheartfelt dedication and total commitment that was needed to put an end \nto the tyranny that threatened to ensnare the world around us. It was \nan effort that we pray will never have to be duplicated.\n  We take great pride in our Nation's veterans because they are our \ngreatest American heroes. They were as one, willing to sacrifice all \ntheir tomorrows to ensure we would live in freedom today. Our way of \nlife is their legacy, their gift to us all. God bless them all, our \nNation's heroes, our Nation's veterans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this past weekend President Bush dedicated \nthe World War II Memorial before an audience of several hundred \nthousand attendees and a national television audience of millions.\n  The memorial honors the 16 million who served in our Armed Forces \nduring World War II, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions \nwho supported the war effort from home.\n  Symbolic of the defining event of the 20th Century, the memorial is a \nmonument to the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the American \npeople to the common defense of the Nation and to the broader causes of \npeace and freedom from tyranny throughout the world.\n  It is my belief that it will inspire future generations of Americans, \ndeepening their appreciation of what the World War II generation \naccomplished in securing freedom and democracy.\n  Above all, the memorial stands as an important symbol of American \nnational unity, a timeless reminder of the moral strength and awesome \npower that can flow when a free people are at once united and bonded \ntogether in a common and just cause.\n  The dedication of the World War II monument reminded me of a story \nthat not many are familiar with. This story is about a young man whose \nexperiences throughout the Pacific during World War II helped mold him \ninto the compassionate, reasoned, and fiercely patriotic gentleman he \nis today.\n  In December of 1941, that young man was a high school student in \nHawaii. And on the morning of December 7th, he and his schoolmates \nwatched from the hillside in horror as the Japanese planes carried out \ntheir surprise attack on the Naval fleet in Pearl Harbor.\n  After finishing high school, this young patriot joined the United \nStates Army and was assigned to the Corps of Engineers. He sailed \nthroughout the Pacific, and participated in the invasions of the \nJapanese-held islands of Saipan and Tinian. In fact, when he\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nwas on Tinian he watched the Enola Gay lift off on her historic mission \nto the Japanese mainland.\n  Young Daniel K. Akaka had witnessed the beginning of World War II, \nand was fortunate enough to witness its conclusion.\n  Many years have passed since then. Now, Senator Akaka can look back \non a remarkable life. In addition to his Army exploits, he was a \nwelder, a school teacher and principal, Congressman and is currently a \nU.S. Senator representing the good people of Hawaii.\n  It is in his current capacity that I know him best. As a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and ranking member on the Readiness \nand Management Support Subcommittee, we have worked together overseeing \nmilitary readiness issues including training and exercises, logistics, \nand industrial operations, depots and shipyards, military construction, \nenvironmental programs, as well as policies and procedures related to \nreform of management practices at the Department of Defense.\n  I have the utmost respect and admiration for my colleague. Today I \nwant to say thank you to my friend, Daniel Akaka.\n  The United States of America is the leader of the free world and the \ngreatest Nation in history because you and your comrades, the greatest \ngeneration, served and sacrificed.\n  We have not forgotten how you helped save the world from tyranny, nor \ndo we take for granted the price you paid for the freedom we cherish \ntoday.\n  You served our country with honor and commitment during one of the \ndarkest times in modern history.\n  This Nation is as grateful, if not more, for you today, than we were \nin the days following your liberation of the world.\n  History has taught us how heroic and courageous you truly were. So it \nis only fitting that on this day, at this time, on behalf of a grateful \nnation I say, thank you. God bless you, Daniel.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise this week to commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of the World War II Allied invasion of Normandy and to \nhonor the courageous members of our Armed Forces, especially those from \nNew Jersey, who participated in that decisive battle.\n  In the waning days of 1943, the Allied Command, led by General Dwight \nDavid Eisenhower, developed a plan to cross the English Channel and \ngain a foothold on France's Normandy coast. This bold strategy breached \nHitler's western defenses and began the liberation of France and the \nrest of Nazi-occupied Europe.\n  The invasion known as Operation Overlord was to become the largest \nair, land and sea operation any military force had ever undertaken. \nAfter months of planning, training and preparation by the Allies, June \n6, 1944 was selected as the invasion date, or D-Day.\n  Moving and fighting under stormy skies, the invasion force, led by \nthe United States, Great Britain and Canada, and including Free French \nand Free Polish units, consisted of over 1 million service personnel. \nThe American contingent included tens of thousands of ground combat \ntroops who assaulted over Omaha and Utah beaches, airborne units which \nlanded behind enemy lines, U.S. Navy sailors, Army logisticians and \nother specialists, and Army Air Corps aviators and ground crews who \nsupported the landings.\n  The dangers were grave, and the stakes almost incalculable. Our \ntroops' skill and determination won our Nation a world-changing \nsuccess, a military victory which today remains a keystone of the \nliberties and security Americans and their partners still enjoy. The \nsoldiers who fought their way ashore in Normandy and who there dropped \ninto battle under heavy fire demonstrated unsurpassed tenacity and \nvalor. Their superb performance and their sacrifices in the cause of \nfreedom and democracy will always be remembered and appreciated by a \ngrateful nation. May our D-Day veterans' memory and deeds be a constant \nreminder of Americans' courage, resolve and devotion to duty in World \nWar II.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor America's veterans \nof World War II.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank the millions of \nAmericans who served our Nation during the Second World War. World War \nII marks the greatest triumph of the United States in the 20th Century. \nThe war has become a symbol of the power of a nation united and a \nturning point in the history of the world.\n  It is important to note that the service of men and women of the \nWorld War II generation went far beyond their sacrifices on the \nbattlefields of Africa, Europe, and the Pacific. After winning the war, \nthey returned home to create a strong, prosperous nation and helped \nshape America into the beacon of liberty that it is today.\n  I am honored to work along side six World War II veterans here in the \nSenate. Our colleagues Senators Inouye, Stevens, Warner, Hollings, \nLautenberg, and Akaka each answered their Nation's call to duty. I \nthank them for their service in the military during World War II and \nfor their continued service and leadership in the Senate.\n  I was extremely touched by this past weekend's emotional dedication \nceremony of the National World War II Memorial and the opportunity it \nprovided for our nation to honor our World War II veterans. While \nbelated, this memorial provides all Americans with a place to express \ntheir appreciation for the men and women who fought in the war and to \nreflect on the sacrifices of those who died to defeat the evils of \ntyranny and oppression. Though it is the newest of our war memorials, I \nbelieve it has already become a national treasure.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the \nveterans of D-Day. Next week marks the 60th anniversary of the allied \nlanding at Normandy, France. On June 6, 1941, the largest fleet of \nships in the history of the world left ports in Great Britain for the \ncoast of France. Aboard these ships were thousands of young Americans \nwho fought and died to gain a foothold on Europe and to help free those \nwho had fallen under the dark shadow of Hitler's forces. These young \nmen were the spearhead of one of the greatest military forces ever \nassembled and deserve special recognition for their sacrifices.\n  Like so many Americans, members of my own family proudly served in \nWorld War II. Both my father and father-in-law served in the military \nduring World War II. I want to thank them and to join with my Senate \ncolleagues in expressing my gratitude to all the veterans of World War \nII. We are proud and thankful for all that they have done and continue \nto do in service to the United States of America.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the United \nStates Senate's World War II veterans--soldiers then, statesmen now. \nThey each have unique personal histories and paths from wearing the \nuniform to serving in this body, yet they share that common badge of \nhonor. They took up arms in a war for the life of all free nations, and \nfor the survival of deliberative democracy embodied by the Chamber in \nwhich they serve today.\n  The dedication of the World War II Memorial this past weekend freshly \nreminded all of us that individuals like Senators Warner, Stevens, \nAkaka, Hollings and Inouye devoted their youth to the greatest cause \nour Nation has ever undertaken. During that ceremony on Sunday, the sea \nof former soldiers, and sailors and airmen on the National Mall was a \nmoving testament to the unique, lasting place all veterans have in \ntheir hearts for fallen comrades. Years have not diminished the meaning \nof sacrifice that they know best.\n  Where often our prayers and thoughts focus on the blessings of \nliberty, we were also recently reminded by Memorial Day of the costs of \nthe liberty--the loss of those who in Lincoln's words gave the ``last, \nfull measure of devotion.'' It is only fitting that, on the heels of \nMemorial Day and the dedication of the World War II Memorial, we take a \nmoment to recognize our friends and colleagues who served in the Armed \nForces during the Second World War.\n  In the Senate, we are all privileged to serve with five colleagues \nwho wore the uniform during a time freedom and civilization itself \ndepend upon young soldiers like them.\n  Senator John Warner, now at the helm of the Armed Services Committee, \nvolunteered for the U.S. Navy at the young age of 17, and later would\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nenlist in the U.S. Marine Corps in Korea.\n  Senator Ted Stevens carved out a decorated war record as a pilot in \nthe China-Burma-India theater, supporting the Flying Tigers of the 14th \nAir Force. His bravery earned him two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two \nAir Medals, and the Yuan Hai medal award by the Republic of China.\n\n  Senator Daniel Akaka, now a leader on the Armed Services Committee, \nwas once a young Hawaii welder and mechanic serving with the Army Corps \nof Engineers in the Marianas, from 1945 to 1947.\n  Senator Fritz Hollings, schooled at the Citadel, began his service in \n1942 as a commissioned officer in the North African and European \nfronts, where he would receive the Bronze Star and seven campaign \nribbons.\n  Senator Daniel Inouye had known the horror of Pearl Harbor, where he \nvolunteered as head of a first-aid team, and in 1943, he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental combat Team. Senator Inouye has \nchronicled his World War II experiences in ``Go for Broke,'' the story \nof his famed group of Japanese-American soldiers.\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps fresh from \nhigh school. He served until 1946 in Signal Corps Battalion 3185 and as \na communications specialist attached to British 21st Army Group.\n  These five colleagues remind us of the high calling to which the \nGreatest Generation responded--prepared to give all, to protect all. \nThey served beside 400,000 American comrades who would never leave the \nshores and soil of Europe, the islands of the Pacific and the desert of \nNorth Africa.\n  On the ``Freedom Wall'' of the new World War II Memorial shine 4,000 \ngold stars--with each star representing 100 lives lost. Just as that \nhuman toll approaches the unfathomable, so too do we struggle to truly \ncomprehend the extent to which the heroes of World War II--all with \ntheir own unique lives and stories and dreams that would never be \nfulfilled--collectively turned the course of history away from darkness \nand toward liberty and light. As their loss to their family and country \nwas permanent, let us also never forget that what they achieved for \nhumankind will stand for all nations, for all time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on May 29, 2004 the National World War II \nMemorial was formally dedicated on the National Mall.\n  A number of Rhode Islanders of whom our State is particularly proud \nplayed important roles in the design and construction of this \nstrikingly beautiful monument.\n  Credit for the overall vision of the monument is owed to Providence's \nFriedrich St. Florian, whose architectural design was chosen from over \n400 competing entries.\n  As to the great results of the construction, I am proud to mention \nNorth Kingstown's Anthony Ramos, the founder and president of New \nEngland Stone, whose company was responsible for quarrying and \nfabricating all granite use in the memorial. Nick and John Benson of \nthe John Stephens Shop in Newport were the principal stone carvers of \nthe project; through their work they turned hulks of granite into works \nof art. Finally, I am pleased to honor Lawrence Rebel and all members \nof the Gilbane Building Company of Providence for their contributions \nas construction managers, selected by the General Services \nAdministration's public buildings division.\n  This memorial is a deserving tribute to the sacrifices made by the \nmen and women of the United States during the Second World War, and I \nam proud of Rhode Island's contributions to the effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise with deep humility and honor. The \nwords of my colleagues and friends have touched me greatly. I am most \ngrateful. But in listening to their words, I must suggest that wars are \nnot won by soldiers alone. It takes a united nation to do that.\n  The war that we were privileged and honored to serve in was a war \nthat a united America carried out. Husbands went to war, but their \nwives stayed home and worked in the factories. Some worked in the \nfields. There were mothers who were in anguish every day while their \nsons were away, but they gave us hope. They gave us courage. Little \nkids went around collecting pennies to buy bonds.\n  Yes, it took a nation to win this war. The memorial testifies to \nthat. It does not just honor those who served in battle, but it honors \nthose wives and sweethearts who worked in the factories, the little \nstudents who collected scrap metal and pennies.\n  Yes, we were young. But we knew what was going on. I have been asked \nmany times: If given the chance, would I do it again? I think I speak \nfor all of my colleagues: Certainly, because it was the right thing to \ndo. It was the American thing to do. And what we did I am certain all \nother Americans would have done.\n  We all received medals. It is unfortunate that all Americans could \nnot receive those medals. Well, I can tell you that my mother deserved \na medal. She had to look at the little flag that flew over her window. \nThere were three stars on it. My two brothers served in the Korean war. \nIt must have been a difficult time for her. I am certain that all \nmothers have gone through this.\n  So I thank all of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me also acknowledge the fact that \nmy mother, too, had three stars in the window. I had one brother in the \nPacific, one in the Mideast, and myself in Africa and Europe.\n  Senator Stevens, Senator Warner, and a bunch of us went down to the \nWorld War II Memorial with our friend Senator Dole who chaired that \nparticular memorial. It was a rather blowy day, and all that wind was \nblowing those fountains all over us. We veterans, in visiting with our \ngood friend Bob Dole, renamed the memorial Viagra Falls after Bob Dole.\n  But the truth of the matter is, if you go down on the right-hand \nside, there is a saying by Roosevelt in 1942 dedicating a good part of \nthat memorial and the thought of that memorial to Rosie the Riveter.\n  That brings to mind the fact that we all had an easy time. We are \nlucky to be here, as we know. We had an easy time when we came back. It \nmakes me think of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel. \nHe fought in the war in Vietnam, where the soldiers came back facing \nhardships. And that is the big difference.\n  We really honor our friend Daniel Inouye, because he had to fight his \ncountry in order to fight his country's enemy. He struggled for a year \nand a half. He was in the military at the time of Pearl Harbor, but \nbeing a nisei of Japanese descent, it wasn't until we were very short \nof troops in Italy, that we first committed the full 442nd combat team \ninto the lost battalion, into the Rhone Valley and then into Italy. And \nGod bless him, he deserves a Medal of Honor, not only for the courage \nin battle but the determination against an ungrateful nation that would \nnot even allow him to fight.\n  Now, what is the point? The point is that we know how to fight a war, \nbut we don't know when to start one. That is why I particularly wanted \nto thank the majority and minority leaders, in addition to all the \nSenators, too, who have had these laudatory remarks. We are all very \ngrateful. And we welcome, incidentally, our distinguished former \ncolleague, the Senator from Maryland, Joseph D. Tydings. He is still \nready to fight. This is the first time he has been on the floor of the \nSenate in 30 years. But I had the pleasure and distinction of serving \nwith him as a junior Senator. And then, of course, our colleague from \nArkansas, Dale Bumpers, went to fight that war.\n  We had, as Senator Tydings and I just remembered, that Gulf of \nTonkin. I had to sit in the chair. I got two Golden Gavel Awards; 200 \nhours listening to Wayne Morse, whom I thought was a little looney at \nthe time because I was from South Carolina. We were committed in \nVietnam. I found out later that I was the one who was looney, and Wayne \nMorse was right. He was debating Bill Fulbright on the Gulf of Tonkin.\n  This is not political. We know now why we are not into Iraq. We know \nspecifically that there wasn't any al-Qaida. The Department of State \nput out a listing of 45 countries that had al-Qaida ties on 9/11, and \nit did not have Iraq listed. We know it wasn't the\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nmatter of Saddam being any threat. Retired General Zinni said the other \nday that his army was a decaying force. He used that word. If you read \nDick Clarke's book ``Against All Enemies,'' you will find Paul \nWolfowitz, and Clarke and none other than John McLaughlin, of the CIA \nare talking about going into Iraq. Wolfowitz, who is a friend of mine, \nsays, what about Iraq? He says, there is no evidence, no intelligence \nwhatever of any terrorism against the United States in the last 10 \nyears. Isn't that right, John? And John confirms that.\n  Let me make a sort of harsh comment, but take it advisedly because we \nwere just talking earlier today with respect to the McCarthy days. I \nwant to talk about intelligence. I served in the McCarthy days 50 years \nago. Doolittle had made a study that was a whitewash. So they came back \nand the Congress said: Let's give President Herbert Hoover, the \ncommission on the reorganization of the executive branch. I was one of \nthe six members on the Hoover commission task force investigating the \nintelligence activities. In the Senate, I served 8 years on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. So I speak with some experience when I say \nright now our intelligence is one grand charade.\n  I say it with all due respect. You cannot find any finer people than \nthose on the 911 Commission--Governor Kean, Lee Hamilton, John Lehman, \nwho is a good friend. There is nobody I respect more. The individuals \nare doing the job. But the idea that we somehow lacked intelligence is \nout of the whole cloth. Why? Because our best friend in the Mideast, \nIsrael, has the best of the best of intelligence. Their survival \ndepends on their intelligence. Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, Senator \nStevens, Senator Warner, and Senator Lautenberg, in the 1980s, Israel \nhad to go into Iraq to take out its nuclear facility. They could not \nhave a U.N. meeting or whatever to discuss the situation. They had to \ndestroy the plant for their own survival, and that is what they did.\n  This Senator thought at the time the United States went into Iraq it \nwas because we faced clear evidence of peril. That is what the \nPresident told us. He said we cannot wait until the smoking gun is a \nmushroom cloud. So the lesson to learn is not just the heroism of the \ngreatest generation but the mistakes.\n  We have to be awfully cautious. All six of us World War II vets say \nnobody wants to cut and run from Iraq. We hope yesterday's news was \ngood, with this new council. It seems as if they have some support of \nthe U.N. If President Bush can get that resolution out of the United \nNations, we still have a chance to win in Iraq. That is still my hope.\n  I will conclude with the prayer to the fallen comrade:\n\n       Lord, lest I go my complacent way, Help me to remember that \n     a man died for me today. So long as there be war, I must ask \n     and answer, Am I worth dying for?\n\n  That is the test of this ``greatest generation'' still.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise in the spirit of thanksgiving and \npride as I stand in the Chamber with others who have served in World \nWar II. I thank this body for the honor they have given all of us. But \nI say thanksgiving because I thank God. I thank God for being here. I \nthank God for being a part of this body. I thank my ma and my pa for \nbringing me into this world. I thank my wife Millie and my family for \nthe support they have given me. I thank my buddies who served with me \nand trained with me in World War II.\n  I thank God for setting a new course not only for me but for our \ncountry. Because of World War II, we saw our country changing itself \nfrom being very prejudicial to being forgiving, and setting a new \ncourse not only for our country but for the world.\n  When I think of what helped me after I left the Army, I used the GI \nBill of Rights program. That was, for me, one of the greatest programs. \nI would say that each of us here have benefited by using that to go to \ncollege. As a result of that, we were able to set our professions and \neventually be elected to the Senate. But things have changed not only \nin our lives but in our country and the world. When I think of our \ncountry and how it has benefited from World War II, other countries, \nsuch as Germany, have also benefited from World War II. Japan has \nbenefited from World War II. It has really changed the world.\n  So I thank God, my family, my buddies, and my colleagues here \nespecially for the kind words and sentiments that have been given \ntonight. I feel proud to be part of this esteemed body. I thank my \ncolleagues again and our leadership for this recognition. I want them \nto know that I am proud to have served our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think it is appropriate that I am the \nlast veteran of World War II in the Senate to rise because I am the \nyoungest. I say that only because it reflects on my very modest career \nin World War II. I was but 17 in January 1945. The Navy called me and I \nserved in training commands. All of our generation went in. It is hard \nto remember back, but everybody wanted to go. The Battle of the Bulge \nhad just occurred, where my distinguished colleague here served. All of \nour high school class suddenly recognized that from this great and \npowerful Nation, for those 3 weeks of the Battle of the Bulge, there \nwas an element as to when we would eventually have the victory for \nwhich we all prayed. It was no big deal. It was exciting.\n  I have always looked back on my modest service of less than 2 years \nbecause the war ended rather unexpectedly. We were all trained to go \ninto the Pacific as the war in Europe had stopped. We were prepared to \ngo aboard our ships as replacements for those who endured months and, \nin most instances, years of service. We talk about the youngsters who \nwent off for 6 months today, or even for a year. But in those days, it \nwas not unusual to be gone for 3 years and never go back home. We were \nall prepared as youngsters to go and were quite willing, well-trained, \nbeautifully educated in our respective responsibilities. I was a radio-\nradar technician.\n  That was the spirit of America, which was totally unified behind us. \nMy colleague paid homage, most appropriately, to the home front. I \nthink Senator Inouye said the Nation won the war, which is true. Behind \nall of the military people were hundreds of thousands at home.\n  What beautiful eloquence here today. It has been an enriching \nexperience. Yes, I, too, think the medals should have gone to our \nparents, as Senator Inouye said. My mother and my father died. He \nserved in World War I in the trenches as a doctor, wounded and \ndecorated. I was brought up knowing he and my mother had been \nassociated with the Red Cross and tended the wounded. They would have \nexpected their son to go, as did all parents in those days.\n  I served later in the Marines--that time as a staff officer in combat \nzones, but always in support of those in combat arms and in the air. I \nnever claimed the title of a combat soldier. I am proud to have served \nwith the distinguished men who did. They have been my big brothers. \nThere have been 114 who served this body from World War II. I expect \nthat in my 26 years, I served with half of them. I had a younger \nbrother but never a big brother. Now I have had all these wonderful \nveterans who trained me. I would not be in the Senate had it not been \nfor the discipline, sense of mission, self-reliance, and the sense that \nyou owe a debt to your buddies in the military and others who helped \nyou in life.\n  Lastly, the GI bill was the greatest investment ever made by this \nNation for a generation. How proud all of us in this Chamber are today \nthat we have continued that educational program, such that the current \nmen and women in the Armed Forces are able to get those benefits, as \ndid we, and hopefully they can have the careers we have had.\n\n  This is such a magnificent nation in which we live and we are so \ngrateful. I am deeply humbled to be the youngest, the most \ninconspicuous, and the most modest in terms of military service, of all \nto participate on this memorable day. I express our appreciation first \nand foremost to God Almighty who for one reason or another spared those \nwho have come to this Chamber, having served in World War II, to our \nparents, and to our buddies, fellow sailors, airmen, and marines with \nwhom we served. I am grateful to our leaders who had the concept to \nbring this\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nmemorable hour for all of us to share in and express our deepest \ngratitude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6336-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6336-S6338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005--Continued\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3260, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we had a very important meeting between \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd. As a result of their \nconsultation and advice to the distinguished Senator from Michigan and \nmyself, I send to the desk a modified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3260), as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize appropriations for a contingent emergency \n          reserve fund for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 239, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1006.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I know my good friend from Virginia is \ngoing to have to leave the Chamber in a moment, but before I make some \nremarks in general about our colleagues who are World War II veterans, \nwhile he is here I want to say what a privilege it has been for me, for \n26 years now almost, to serve with John Warner of Virginia. I cannot \nthink of a person who is more decent, civil, and gentlemanly, and the \nway in which he runs our committee is truly a model. He is part of a \ngreat tradition of committee chairmen whom he has noted many times whom \nhe and I have served with, and whom he knew long before I did. He \nserves as chairman of the committee that represents our Armed Forces in \nthis country and he does it with extraordinary diplomacy.\n  So even though it is not the Foreign Relations Committee, it is the \ncommittee of our Armed Forces. He is noted for his gentleness and \ncivility. I am sure he learned some of this modesty as a member of the \n``greatest generation,'' because they do not talk about what they did \nin World War II. As a matter of fact, this last Memorial Day I spent a \nlot of time with our veterans, their kids, their grandkids, and their \ngreat-grandkids, urging those kids and grandkids to get those veterans \nto share their histories because they are not going to volunteer it. \nThey are not going to initiate any discussion about the events of World \nWar II; they are too modest.\n  I do not know whether that is where my dear friend from Virginia got \nthat wonderful modesty of his, that self-effacement, but from wherever \nhe got it, it is treasured by every Member of this body and on this \noccasion I address him as a World War II veteran. Before I make my \nremarks about all of our other colleagues, I want to tell him what a \ntreasured relationship this has been, and I thank him for his service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I thank my dear friend. I do not in any way deserve \nwhat he said, but he and I do reflect often on how we got where we are \nand that is because of men such as Jackson, Stennis, Goldwater, and \nTower, and the greats whom we have served under as chairmen of this \ncommittee.\n  The Senator from Michigan has been chairman of the committee. I have \nbeen chairman of the committee. We were trained by the best and we \nlearned so much of what we practice today from those great teachers, \nSenators, of towering strength and wisdom. I thank my friend for \nsharing his thoughts with me. In every sense, he emulates those titans \nand giants who have run this committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  I want to add one other thing, and that is the way in which he was \nable to modify the amendment is typical of the way Senator Warner \nworks. I will not go into the details because it is probably not even \nappropriate, but there were some differences on the wording of this \namendment. He worked with some real giants in this Senate--Senator \nByrd, Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye--to find a way to work through \nthis difference. To the outside world, it would look like a very minor \nmodification and in the scheme of things it probably is a modest \nmodification, but it took some real effort, some real diplomacy, and \nsome real willingness to look for the path through the bramble, and the \nSenator from Virginia found it. It was very typical. He sent an \namendment to the desk and in about 4 seconds it is done, but it took a \nlot more than 4 seconds. It took the special character and the special \napproach of my dear friend from Virginia.\n  I thank him for his service as a World War II veteran, as well as all \nof our other colleagues.\n   This past weekend, the Memorial Day weekend, the Nation paused to \ndedicate the newly completed World War II Memorial and pay a long \noverdue tribute to the 16 million Americans who served in the Armed \nForces During World War II, the more than 400,000 who died, and the \nmillions who supported the war effort here at home.\n   The World War II Memorial is inscribed with many poignant quotes, \nincluding the words of President Harry S Truman: ``Our debt to the \nheroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be \nrepaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never \nforget their sacrifices.'' These words reflect the sentiments of \ncountless Americans. All of us owe a tremendous debt to this ``greatest \ngeneration'' which sacrificed so much to protect our freedom and \nliberty.\n   Over this past weekend, I was privileged to meet with hundreds of \nthese\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\nveterans and their families who made the journey to Washington, D.C., \nfrom Michigan for the dedication of the monument. I heard many \ninspiring personal stories of these men and women. Nearly all spoke of \nthe memory of those who did not return.\n  Those who were in Washington represented thousands and thousands of \nveterans who died in war, and those who were unable to make this \njourney and those who did not live to see the memorial constructed.\n  It was particularly moving to witness the pride that the sons and \ndaughters, and the grandchildren, of these veterans took in their \nservice. America will remember.\n  We in Michigan, in particular, are also mindful of the tremendous \neffort made ``back home'' by those who supported the war effort. Our \nState became known as the ``Arsenal of Democracy''. From jeeps to tanks \nto bombers to artillery, and even ambulances, the industrial strength \nof Michigan turned to production of the tools needed by those on the \nfront lines. As National Geographical Magazine noted in 1944: ``It does \nnot take long, in Michigan, to realize you are on a real battle front. \nThe industrial sections roar with machinery.''\n  We, in the Senate, are fortunate to serve with six of these heroic \nveterans. These are my friends and colleagues and I value each of them \nfor the many important contributions they have made to the Nation in \nthis body. But, today, I salute them for their courage and for their \nsacrifice as young men in World War II and because they collectively \nrepresent millions of Americans who did their duty in their Nation's \nhour of need. Senator Akaka of Hawaii, Senator Hollings of South \nCarolina, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, \nSenator Stevens of Alaska, and Senator John Warner of Virginia--you \nhave my admiration, my respect and my thanks.\n  We cannot ever repay the debt we owe to those who fought in our \ndefense during World War II and those who supported their efforts on \nthe homefront. This week, we have taken an important step in assuring \nthat America will never forget their valor and their sacrifice. And, \neven as we do so, we think of and we honor the courage and commitment \nof our armed forces today in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting the enemies \nof freedom and democracy. These men and women, too, like the millions \nof Americans before them, have answered the call.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on May 12, 2004, the President sent to \nCongress an amendment to his fiscal year 2005 budget request that would \nadd $25 billion for the cost of the ongoing wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The President's request amounted to a blank check: There \nwere virtually no strings at all on how those funds could be used.\n  Senator Warner, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, held a \nhearing, at my request, on the day after this $25 billion request was \nsent to Congress. Members of the committee were nearly unanimous that \nCongress should not sign away its power of the purse by giving a \nrubberstamp approval to the President's proposal.\n  After reviewing the President's request, I developed several \nproposals to strengthen congressional oversight over the President's \nrequest. The funds should be authorized in discrete appropriations \naccounts for the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reasonable limits \nshould be placed on transfer authority, so that this budget request \nwould not become a blank check. Needed funding for the Coast Guard \noperations in the Persian Gulf should be included in the $25 billion \nrequested by the President.\n  Senator Warner, Senator Stevens, Senator Levin, and Senator Inouye \nworked diligently to include my proposals in the amendment that is now \nbefore the Senate. Funds have been placed in regular appropriations \naccounts in order to promote oversight. The amount of funds that can be \ntransferred to other accounts has been reduced from 100 percent to a \nreasonable 10 percent. Anticipated costs for Coast Guard operations \nhave been funded.\n  I commend Senator Warner and Senator Stevens for their work on this \namendment. I thank Senator Levin and Senator Inouye for their steadfast \nefforts in working to provide the necessary funding for our troops \nwhile preserving the power of the purse. I would also like to thank \nSenator Reid for his work in bringing this bipartisan amendment to a \nvote.\n  Approval of a this amendment is but one step in providing the \nnecessary support to our troops in a manner that promotes \naccountability and oversight by the Congress. In the coming days, the \nAppropriations Committee will take up the Defense Appropriations bill. \nThe Senate should build on its work here to insure that the \nappropriations bill includes similar provisions that preserve the power \nof the purse that resides with Congress. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on that bill, in the same bipartisan manner as we did \ntoday, to support our troops and protect the Constitution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since 2002, I have raised serious concerns \nabout this administration's policy on Iraq, including the President's \nfailure to plan for post-war Iraq and his inability to convince much of \nthe world to share the burden by providing troops and funding.\n  However, I will support the President's request for $25 billion to \nsupport our military men and women who are serving so bravely under \nextremely difficult conditions.\n  When the President initially requested this additional funding on May \n12, it was a blank check. It allowed the President to spend funds on \nany account within the DoD for any purpose having to do with Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Because of the good work of many in this Chamber, on both \nsides of the aisle, the Warner amendment is a significant improvement \non the President's initial request.\n  The Warner amendment ensures that $20 billion of the $25 billion \nrequest will be spent on the operation and maintenance accounts of the \nArmed Forces and that $2 billion will be dedicated solely to the \nmilitary personnel accounts. This is vastly different from the \nPresident's request, which would have given him the authority to spend \nthe $25 billion in any manner in which he thought appropriate.\n  The Warner amendment also contains an important provision that \nrequires a monthly report to Congress on the use of this $25 billion \nauthority. With this reporting requirement, Congress can ensure that \nevery penny is being used for the well-being of our military men and \nwomen who are serving this country with great honor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr. William \nHoughton on his selection by the Small Business Administration as the \n2004 Nevada Small Business Person of the Year. It is my honor to \nrecognize Mr. Houghton's achievement, as well as the hard work and \ningenuity he has displayed in building his own business over the past \n12 years.\n  The story actually begins in 1987, when Mr. Houghton got a job with a \nLas Vegas company that distributed business forms. His pay was just $5 \nan hour but he set his sights much higher.\n  In 1992 he became a partner with his former boss, and they formed \ntheir own firm called Horizon Business Systems. They started with one \nemployee and did about $500,000 worth of business the first year.\n  Mr. Houghton eventually bought out his partner, and took on the \nchallenge of overseeing the company's transition through the rapid \ntechnological developments of the late 1990s. His good business sense \nand strong leadership helped the business grow, and today it employs 12 \nworkers and logs more than $2.2 million in sales.\n  Small businesses such as Horizon Business Systems are the engine that \npowers our Nation's economy, representing 99.7 percent of all \nemployers, employing more than half our Nation's private sector \nworkers, and creating up to 80 percent of all net new jobs annually.\n  In this spirit, the SBA's Small Business Person of the Year award \nseeks to acknowledge the critical role of small businesses in creating \njobs and spurring economic growth, and the successes of individual \nsmall business owners throughout the country.\n  Please join me in congratulating Mr. William Houghton on the \nremarkable success of his business and on his selection as the 2004 \nNevada Small Business Person of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6338-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JESSICA BARIS\n\n  Mr. REID.

She has given generously of \nher time to many worthy causes, including serving more than 350 hours \nas a student tutor for young children in her community.\n  She also has helped organize several charitable events, including a \nfundraiser for Share Our Strength, an organization that fights hunger \nand poverty throughout the world.\n  Jessica also organized a clothing drive for needy children abroad. \nMost of the clothing was sent to U.S. serviceman in the Philippines, \nwho distributed the items to local children. Her efforts not only \nhelped those children, but also afforded our soldiers with a great \nopportunity to build goodwill in an important part of the world.\n  Jessica also received a grant from the United Way to create a ``Wall \nof Peace'' for Make a Difference Day. By organizing 20 teams of \nstudents to produce murals, the project spread awareness of the \nimportance of tolerance and kindness in her school and community. \nJessica wrote an essay on this project for the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities' Idea of America contest that was recognized by First \nLady Laura Bush at a White House ceremony.\n  She also participated in an essay contest sponsored by the Sons of \nthe American Revolution, winning an award for her essay on the \ncontributions of the unsung heroes of our Armed Forces.\n  Jessica's hard work and dedication to service culminated this year in \nher selection for a $25,000 college scholarship from AXA Financial \nServices.

Wiesemann\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who went to \nhigh school in North Judson, IN. SP Michael J. Wiesemann, 20 years old, \ndied at the Forward Operating Base Q-West, Quyarrah Air Base, Iraq, on \nMay 29, 2004.\n  Michael graduated from North Judson-San Pierre High School in 2002 \nand joined the Army as a steppingstone to college and a better life, \naccording to his mother. After joining the Army, Michael became a \ncavalry scout and was assigned to the Army's 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry \nRegiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, out of Fort Lewis, WA. \nWith his entire life before him, Michael chose to risk everything to \nfight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  Michael was the 28th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his mother, Karen; his stepfather, Robert; and his fiancee, Abby \nTrusty, whom he met in high school.\n  Today, I join Michael's family, his friends, and the entire North \nJudson community in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our \nsorrow over his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, \nbravely fighting to make the world a safer place. During his dedicated \nmilitary service, Michael earned the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal and an Expeditionary Medal. It is his courage and strength of \ncharacter that people will remember when they think of Michael, a \nmemory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict \nand grief.\n  When looking back on the life of her former student, Michael's high \nschool English teacher, Carolyn Wyller told the Indianapolis Star that \nMichael ``was artistic and had a good sense of humor.'' Family and \nfriends say Michael was known for his love of laughter and his big \nheart. Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Michael's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Michael's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Michael J. Wiesemann in the \nofficial Record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nMichael's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Michael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6339-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6339-S6340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have never supported a bill that would \nallow for the importation of prescription drugs--until today.\n  I have decided to cosponsor Senator Gregg's bill to permit the \ncarefully regulated importation of drugs approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The bill also would regulate the dispensing of \nmedications by Internet pharmacies and strengthen the laws and \nregulations that protect Americans from the dangers of counterfeit \ndrugs.\n  I have long opposed drug importation on the grounds that current \nlaws, regulations, and practices are insufficient to allow for the safe \nopening of our currently closed drug distribution system. I have said \nthat I could not support any plan to legalize drug importation that \ndoes not ensure that the drugs that are imported are safe, effective, \nand will not compromise the integrity of our Nation's prescription drug \nsupply or our world-leading pharmaceutical research.\n  With that in mind, Senator Gregg's bill is the first piece of \nlegislation I have seen that would craft an importation system with the \nappropriate safeguards and limitations necessary to protect the public \nhealth. Senator Gregg's bill would allow importation of FDA-approved \ndrugs manufactured in FDA-inspected facilities only. His bill would \npermit the importation of drugs from Canada only, with the possibility \nthat the FDA could approve importation from other countries in the \nfuture. His bill would also provide additional tools and resources for \nthe FDA to use to protect American citizens from tainted or counterfeit \ndrugs, and from scam artists selling medications on the Internet.\n  Senator Gregg has introduced a strong bill that addresses my concerns \nabout the safety of drug importation and Internet pharmacies, and it's \nthe only bill I've yet seen that I could support.\n  My main outstanding concern is that Senator Gregg's bill does not \naddress the liability that sellers, distributors, and manufacturers of \nprescription drugs may face even under a regulated system of drug \nimportation.\n  Our jurisdiction over foreign companies or individuals in the chain \nof drug distribution is limited at best. Irresponsible actions on their \npart could put responsible American companies and individuals at risk \nof substantial monetary liability. Without liability protection, \nAmerican companies and individuals may choose not to participate in \ndrug importation, which would defeat the purpose of enacting this \nlegislation in the first place.\n  As this legislation moves in the Senate, I look forward to working \nwith Senator Gregg, the other cosponsors of his bill, and other \ninterested Members to address these concerns through sensible liability \nprotections for sellers,\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\ndistributors, and manufacturers of prescription drugs.\n  I want to be clear on an important point: importing prescription \ndrugs from other countries will not solve the problem of rising drug \nprices. Our market for prescription drugs is so large that we can not \nimport enough lower-priced medications from other countries to make a \nsignificant impact on prices here.\n  There are many other ways that Congress is helping Americans afford \ntheir prescription medications. Just yesterday, for instance, the new \nMedicare drug discount cards went into effect. The cards offer savings \nof 10 to 25 percent or more off the current retail prices seniors pay, \nand seniors with low incomes also qualify for a $1,200 credit over the \nnext 18 months to help pay for prescriptions.\n  Nevertheless, millions of Americans are still buying prescription \ndrugs in Canada and other countries, or purchasing drugs from Internet \npharmacies that operate outside the United States. Despite the fact \nthat importing prescription drugs is against the law today, these \nAmericans are taking their lives in their hands by going outside our \nclosed drug distribution system and obtaining their prescription \nmedicines from pharmacies and Internet sites that do not meet the high \nstandards that we require domestically.\n  Right now, the Federal Government and State governments are looking \nthe other way, crossing our fingers and hoping that no one gets hurt. \nSo I am cosponsoring Senator Gregg's bill to put a strong and \nenforceable system in place to protect Americans against the dangers \ninherent in importing drugs from other countries. I also intend to work \nwith Senator Gregg to oppose any election-year political maneuvering \nthat would weaken the critical safety components of his legislation as \nwe consider the bill in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, and on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6340-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ENACTMENT OF THE STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION ADVANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the House of \nRepresentatives has now passed the Standards Development Organization \nAdvancement Act, an important piece of legislation on which both \nparties and both Chambers have been able to reach accord. It is now on \nits way to the President's desk, and I am confident that he will sign \nit into law.\n  In April of this year, Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator DeWine, \nand I worked to craft a bipartisan, fair version of this bill that will \npromote the development of technical standards while preserving \nantitrust laws that enhance competition. It has been rare during this \nCongress to achieve the type of consensus generated by our bill, and it \nillustrates what we can accomplish when both parties work together. \nThis is an example of how Congress should function. I must also express \nmy gratitude to Chairman Sensenbrenner for all his efforts in the House \nof Representatives, not only for his critical role in shaping this \nlegislation but also for the expeditious way he shepherded the bill \nthrough the House.\n  As I have noted many times, technical standards serve a vital if \nunseen role in allowing for interoperability of products and making \nsure that the goods we buy are safe and effective. Whether for airbags \nor for fire retardant materials, without technical standards, consumers \nwould be less likely to make the purchases that fuel the engine of the \nU.S. economy. Even more important, aspects of our lives that we \nconsider routine--perhaps even mundane--would take on added dangers \nwithout standards that allow consumers to feel confident that a given \nproduct is safe and reliable.\n  There is, however, an unavoidable tension between the antitrust laws \nthat prohibit businesses from colluding and the development of \ntechnical standards, which require competitors to reach agreement on \nbasic design elements. The Standards Development Organization \nAdvancement Act eases this tension, allowing standards development \norganizations to continue their important work while preserving our \nantitrust laws that enhance competition and protect American consumers.\n  Without creating an antitrust exemption, the Standards Development \nOrganization Advancement Act will allow standards development \norganizations to seek review of their standards by the Department of \nJustice or the Federal Trade Commission prior to implementation. This \n``screening'' phase will not let a standards development organization \nescape penalty for a regulation that a court later rules is in \nviolation of antitrust laws, but it will limit the organization's \nliability to single damages rather than the treble damages levied under \ncurrent law.\n  Additionally, the bill amends the National Cooperative Research and \nProduction Act of 1993, by directing courts to apply a ``rule of \nreason'' standard to standards development organizations and the \nguidelines they produce. Under existing law, standards may be deemed \nanticompetitive by a court even if they have the effect of better \nserving consumers. This legislation gives our courts the needed ability \nto balance the competing interests of safety and efficiency against any \nanticompetitive effect--it is a capability our courts need in order to \nfairly administer justice. Back in the 103rd Congress, I introduced the \nSenate version of the National Cooperative Production Amendments Act of \n1993, and I am glad that we can today build on our earlier successes.\n  Title II of the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act \nalso addresses several areas of our antitrust laws that merit updating, \nas our experience with the actual practice in the world has shown. Most \nimportantly, it will eliminate the disparity between the treatment of \ncriminal white collar offenses and antitrust criminal violations--a \nprovision Senator Hatch and I had introduced in S. 1080, the Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 2003--and it will update and improve the Justice \nDepartment's amnesty program in the criminal antitrust context. It will \nalso make some practical adjustments to the language of the Tunney Act. \nFinally, it will allow a judge to order publication of the comments \nreceived in a Tunney Act proceeding by electronic or other means. This \nprovision will make these documents more accessible to the public while \nsaving taxpayers the costs of paper publication.\n  I am glad that we can send to the President this bill that makes so \nmany useful, fair, and bipartisan changes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6340-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6340-S6341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA'S FARMERS AND OBESITY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, more than 2,000 \nfarmers--including over 600 from Kansas, the most from any State--have \nsigned a petition that will be sent to ABC News and TIME magazine today \nor tomorrow. The signers of this petition are to be commended.\n  Their request is simple. They want to ensure that their voices are \nheard in an upcoming summit on obesity sponsored by the two news \noutlets. At this summit, and in subsequent media coverage, ``experts'' \nwill attempt to link Federal support for America's farmers to the \ncountry's obesity epidemic.\n  The individuals who signed the petition are frustrated, and \nrightfully so. This summit is a follow-up to the December news special, \n``How to Get Fat Without Really Trying,'' where ABC dedicated more than \n15 minutes of airtime to bash Federal support for farmers.\n  Unfortunately, no one from the agricultural community was afforded \nthe opportunity to defend farming families or the policies on which \nthey depend. And don't expect too many farmers to be on hand to defend \nthemselves at the upcoming summit either, not with a $2,000 \nregistration fee.\n  The agriculture community is not alone in its frustration. I am \nfrustrated, too. So are many of my colleagues, like Senators Burns and \nLincoln, who have also been vocal in their opposition to those who \nwould blame farmers for America's bulging waistlines.\n  In the December special, Peter Jennings claimed ``not many people in \nthe government have made the connection between subsidies to \nagriculture and obesity.'' At least ABC got one thing right. We haven't \nmade that connection, because there is no connection to be made.\n  Consider this: federal farm support has been in place since the \n1930s. Yet,\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\nobesity is only a recent problem. Other nations that don't have obesity \nproblems provide subsidies to their farmers to produce many of the same \ncommodities grown in the U.S. The European Union, for example, doles \nout six times the subsidies that we do, yet obesity is less of a \nproblem in the EU than here in America. Federal support is not causing \ndrastically higher levels of production, as some suggest. In fact, \nAmerica produced more wheat 20 years ago than today. Corn harvested for \nhuman consumption has only seen moderate increases from 10 years \nearlier. And soybeans--another commodity unfairly linked to obesity--\nexperienced supply issues over the past year. According to USDA \nconsumption statistics, Americans consume much less wheat than \nconsumers in other countries that don't suffer widespread obesity \nproblems. Data from the Centers for Disease Control indicate that in \nthe past 20 years, the calorie intake of American kids has risen only \nabout 1 percent, an increase that's in keeping with their increased \nheights. The big change is that they now get 13 percent less exercise.\n  Bottom line: America needs farmers. And farmers need a strong Federal \nfarm policy.\n  America's farmers deserve our praise. They deserve our thanks. What \nthey don't deserve is to be blamed for America's obesity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6341-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMISSION TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL CREATION OF A NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE \n                 AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITY ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Memorial Day recess, I joined \nwith Senators Hatch, Bingaman, and Hutchison in introducing the \nCommission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of the \nAmerican Latino Community Act of 2004.\n  This legislation would create a national commission to study and plan \nfor a National Museum of the American Latino, possibly in Washington, \nDC. Congressman Xavier Becerra and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus \nhave sponsored companion legislation in the House.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, Latinos have enriched our culture \nand economy, and contributed to our national defense. In every American \nwar and conflict, Latinos have served honorably next to their fellow \nAmericans. It is time for our Nation's history and public institutions \nto fully recognize and celebrate our Latino community.\n  Though Latinos have been the largest ethnic minority group in \nCalifornia for some time, the Census Bureau recently reported that \nLatinos are now the largest minority group in the country and have \ngrown in population in every region. As of July 2002, there were 38.8 \nmillion Latinos in the United States. One out of every three of these \nLatinos is under the age of 18. Also, the southern states other than \nTexas have seen the population of Latinos double between 1990 and 2000. \nThe size, youth, and growth of this population ensure that American \nLatinos will continue to play a critical role in every region of the \ncountry and in every aspect of American life. As a result, a greater \nunderstanding of this population and its history will benefit all \nAmericans.\n  The American Latino experience in the United States has a history as \nlong as the Nation is old. From families with Puerto Rican and \nDominican origins in New York to those with Cuban blood in Miami to the \ngiant Mexican American and Central American communities in California \nand numerous other communities in every region of the country--American \nLatinos share a host of common values and similar experiences. A \nNational Museum of the American Latino would help the larger American \nfamily celebrate this community's history and diversity.\n  The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum and \nresearch complex, with 16 museums in the District of Columbia and New \nYork City. The Smithsonian Institution museums, especially those on the \nNational Mall, play a unique and important role in educating visitors \nto the Nation's capital about America's history, arts, and culture. The \nAmerican people and international visitors recognize the Smithsonian \nInstitution as the premier American museum, representing the vast \ndiversity of cultural history of the United States. It is worth \nexamining the potential for adding a National Museum of the American \nLatino to the Smithsonian family.\n  After extensive dialogue, conferences, and collaboration among \neducators, scholars, and community leaders as well as museums, \nuniversities, cultural, and public institutions, a task force appointed \nto examine the Smithsonian Institution's representation of American \nLatinos in its permanent exhibits and other public programs published \n``Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Latinos'' in \nMay 1994 and ``Toward a Shared Vision: U.S. Latinos and the Smithsonian \nInstitution'' in October 1997. The reports indicate that the \nSmithsonian historically had a poor record of representing Latinos. \nThis criticism led to the creation of the Smithsonian's Center for \nLatino Initiatives in 1998.\n  The Center for Latino Initiatives has increased the profile of Latino \narts and culture and deserves credit for promoting diversity and \nunderstanding of American Latino culture among the Smithsonian's \nvisitors. The Center's short history has shown that American Latino \nexhibits and programs are well received by the public and by the Latino \ncommunity, which benefits from having some representation at the \nSmithsonian. Still, the level of representation at the Smithsonian of \nthe Latino community is far from where it should be given the American \nLatino history, demography, and contributions to the American cultural \nlandscape.\n  I thank Senators Hatch, Bingaman, and Hutchison for joining with me \nin introducing this bill. I look forward to working with them to pass \nthis legislation, and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6341-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6341-S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ROMA STILL WAITING FOR THEIR ``BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, 2 years ago, the United States Helsinki \nCommission, which I co-chair, held its third hearing on the human \nrights problems faced by Roma. At that time, we gave particular \nattention to the barriers Roma face in the field of education. As the \nOSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities said in his very helpful \nreport on Roma in OSCE region, ``exclusion of Roma extends to every \nsphere of social life, perhaps nowhere with more far-reaching and \nharmful effect than in respect of schooling.''\n  In other words, ensuring equal access for Roma in the fields of \neducation is an essential element for their integration in other areas \nof life. The World Bank and United Nations Development Program have \nalso emphasized, in their reports, that integration in education is an \nessential ingredient for improving the overall conditions in which Roma \nlive.\n  Last month, as our own country was commemorating the Supreme Court's \nhistoric decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the European Roma \nRights Center issued a report entitled ``Stigmata: Segregated Schooling \nof Roma in Central and Eastern Europe.'' This report evaluates \npractices and policies in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, \nRomania, and Slovakia and describes the most common ways of segregating \nRomani children from non-Roma: channeling Roma into so-called ``special \nschools'' for children with developmental disabilities; the de facto \nsegregation that goes hand-in-hand with Romani ghettos; having mixed \npopulation schools where Romani children are segregated into all-Romani \nclasses; and the refusal of some local authorities to enroll Romani \nchildren in mainstream schools.\n  The European Roma Rights Center report concludes that, unfortunately, \n``with the exception of Hungary, concrete government action aimed at \ndesegregating the school system has not been initiated to date.'' It is \nsurely not a coincidence that Hungary is also the only country in \nEurope where the mainstream political parties have started to compete \nfor the Romani vote--both developments which reflect meaningful steps \ntowards the real integration of Roma in that country.\n  As the European Roma Rights Center notes, segregated schooling is the \nresult of many factors which conspire together--not the least of which \nis the\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\npernicious stereotype that Romani culture is somehow incompatible with \neducation. This fiction continues to be widely held and disseminated by \nthe media, by government officials and public leaders, and sometimes \neven by the representatives of respected international organizations. \nFrankly, this myth needs to be debunked.\n  In reality, before World War II, there was no country in Europe that \nallowed Roma to attend school and maintain their language and cultural \nidentity at the same time. Formal schooling, by definition, meant \nforced assimilation. It is amazing testimony to the strength of Romani \nculture that--after centuries as a dispersed people in Europe, after \nslavery in Romania and Moldova, after forced assimilation campaigns, \nand after the Holocaust--Romani identity has survived.\n  For most Roma in Europe, concentrated in countries that fell behind \nthe Iron Curtain, it is only the context of a post-communist world, a \nEurope which has now recognized the rights of ethnic and linguistic \nminorities, that the theoretical opportunity to be educated without \nhaving to hide or surrender one's Romani identity is within grasp. Kids \nlike Elvis Hajdar, the Romani-Macedonian computer whiz-kid the \nChristian Science Monitor profiled in April, embrace this opportunity.\n  For many other Roma, however, educational opportunities remain only \ndistant and only theoretical. And, contrary to popular mythology, it is \nnot Romani culture that holds them back, but crushing poverty and \nentrenched racism.\n  Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and it is no \nsurprise that Romani organizations across Europe have made access to \neducation one of their principle demands. Moreover, the ``Action Plan \non Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area,'' \nadopted at the Maastricht Ministerial last December, the OSCE \nparticipating states outlined a variety of concrete measures states \nmight undertake to achieve this goal. But desegregation will not just \nhappen on its own. It will take leadership and political will and--as \nwe know from our own experiences after the Brown decision--it may still \ntake many years. The time to get started is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6342-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OREGON'S DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit ruled to uphold the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. \nThis ruling is the latest rebuff to U.S. Attorney General John \nAshcroft's efforts to overturn Oregon law. The ruling makes clear that \ncontrary to Attorney General Ashcroft's viewpoint, the Controlled \nSubstance Act does not override the constitutional right of a state to \nregulate medical practice, including the choice of the citizenry to \ndetermine whether they want to allow physicians to aid terminally ill \npatients.\n  Oregon voters first approved a physician-assisted suicide ballot \nmeasure in 1994, but the Oregon legislature did not agree with their \ndecision and put the matter on the ballot a second time. In 1997, \nOregon voters overwhelmingly voted once more to allow physician-\nassisted suicide.\n  Almost immediately, however, federal politicians 3,000 miles away \nbegan efforts to deny Oregon citizens their long recognized right to \nchoose their own course. Over the course of several Congresses, the \nattempts to overturn Oregon law and the wishes of Oregon voters through \ngeneral legislation also failed.\n  Having failed in Congress, I predicted in December 2000, that \nPresident Bush would instruct his Attorney General to reinterpret \nfederal law in an effort to invalidate the will of Oregon's voters. The \nrecent ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to preserve \nthe Oregon vote is the second setback to the Attorney General's \nattempts to reinterpret federal law.\n  Since I was first elected to the United State Senate, I have not \nwavered in my defense of the choice of the citizens of Oregon. If \nothers see this ruling as an invitation once again to attempt to \noverturn Oregon law through federal legislation, I will be there again \nto stand up for my state. Therefore, I want to notify my colleagues \nthat I will be reviewing every piece of legislation that may come \nbefore the Senate and will not grant my consent to consider any measure \nor matter that contains provisions that would overturn the Oregon Death \nwith Dignity Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6342-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH EDITION OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues a special event taking place next month, \nwhen the National Fire Protection Association, NFPA, headquartered in \nQuincy, MA, will publish the 50th edition of the National Electrical \nCode.\n  First published in 1897, the code provides a blueprint for \nsafeguarding schools, hospitals, homes, and workplaces from the \npotential dangers of electricity. The code is recognized throughout the \nUnited States and is used extensively in other nations. In many \nrespects, it is the most widely accepted building construction code in \nthe world. According to Bob Vila, the well-known home improvement \npersonality, the code ``. . . not only promotes best practices, it is \nalso a nearly universal document which helps everyone in the business \nachieve the safest possible results.''\n  The wide acceptance of the code as a public safety document is a \ntribute to the success of the National Fire Protection Association's \nvoluntary consensus process, which is used by the Association to \ndevelop many other safety codes and standards as well. The process is \naccredited by the American National Standards Institute and is the same \nvoluntary consensus process mandated for Federal agencies by Congress \nin the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995.\n  The National Electrical Code is currently updated every 3 years and \nis the result of thousands of hours of work by more than 450 \nrepresentatives of the enforcement community, the construction \nindustry, organized labor, the manufacturing sector, suppliers, and the \ninsurance industry. Before a new edition of the code is published, \nmembers of the public are invited to provide input. Upon completion of \nthat process, the document is then voted on for adoption by the entire \nmembership of the Association. By continually updating the code to \naddress new emerging technologies and construction methods, the \nassociation has enabled Americans to enjoy an unparalleled level of \nsafety against electrical hazards.\n  I congratulate the association and the many volunteers who have spent \nso many hours to make the 50th edition of the National Electrical Code \na reality. They deserve the Nation's gratitude for their skill and \ndedication in providing this extraordinary public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6342-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BIRTH OF ELIZABETH MERRELL LUGAR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, this year marks the 20th \nanniversary of the Urban Scholars Program of the University of \nMassachusetts Boston. The program was created to provide academically \ntalented students in urban middle and high schools the skills and \nmotivation to achieve their full potential. In 1984, UMass Boston and \nthe Boston Public Schools formed a partnership that helped the first 15 \nstudents and the program has grown increasingly ever since. Today, the \nprogram lists hundreds of graduates who have gone on to earn \nundergraduate and advanced degrees.\n  The Urban Scholars Program is a year-round enterprise featuring \nrigorous after-school classes, seminars, tutoring and supervised study. \nIn the summer, the program offers a 7-week institute in which students \nare immersed in science, technology, and humanities courses not offered \nat their high schools, and many earn college credit for their work. \nStudents and their families make sacrifices to participate, but they \nwork hard, and the results are remarkable.\n  A study showed that participants in the Urban Scholars Program \nimproved attendance and academic achievement. And over the past 20 \nyears, 100 percent of the Urban Scholars have been accepted at colleges \nacross the country. They have an 85 percent college retention rate, \ncompared to the 50 percent national rate. Investing early in these \ntalented young men and women pays off for the students and the entire \ncommunity.\n  UMass Boston deserves great credit for its commitment to this \noutstanding program, and I especially commend Adaline Mirabal, the \ndirector of the program, and Joan Becker, its administrator. Their \nskillful work and dedication has transformed the lives of these young \nstudents, and has demonstrated the immense possibilities of early \nintervention in bringing a first-class education within reach of every \nchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6343-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HECTOR BARRETO, SR.\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing \nof a great businessman and a pioneer in the Hispanic community, Mr. \nHector Barreto, Sr. The story of his life and his accomplishments are \ntruly inspiring, and his leadership will be sorely missed.\n  Hector Barreto, Sr. was born in Mexico City and raised in \nGuadalajara, Mexico. In his early twenties, he immigrated to Kansas \nCity, MO, where he met and married his wife, Maria Luisa. He started \nout digging potatoes on a farm near Corning, MO, for 80 cents an hour. \nAfter saving money from years of work, he was able to start his own \nrestaurant, Mexico Lindo, which means ``Beautiful Mexico.'' Though \nMexican restaurants were rare in Kansas City in the 1950s, Hector's \nbusiness thrived, and its success allowed him to open a second and \nthird restaurant as well as an import company and a construction firm.\n  In 1979, Hector founded the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce along \nwith several other Hispanic business leaders. For the last 25 years, \nthe Hispanic Chamber has represented the interests of the Nation's more \nthan 1.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses and harnessed the vast \neconomic potential of Hispanic Americans. Also in 1979, Hector decided \nto delve into politics, supporting Ronald Reagan's successful \nPresidential bid and eventually working on his transition team. \nPresident Reagan addressed the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 1983, \nbecoming the first sitting President to address such a conference.\n  Hector was also quite proud of his son, Hector Barreto, Jr., who like \nhis father has made a name for himself in both business and politics. \nHector Jr. delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention \nnominating George W. Bush for President, and President Bush later \nappointed him the administrator of the Small Business Administration.\n  Hector leaves behind Maria Luisa, his wife of 43 years, his children \nHector Jr., Anna, Gloria, Rosa, and Mary, and 12 grandchildren. His \nefforts opened doors for millions of Hispanics and other Americans, and \nhis legacy as a successful entrepreneur who lived the American Dream \nwill live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6343-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE GLENN CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on the night of Tuesday, May 25, \n2004, New Jersey lost one of its most dedicated public servants, Jersey \nCity Mayor and State Senator Glenn Cunningham. It was a terrible \ntragedy and terrible loss to the people of Jersey City and New Jersey.\n  Mayor Cunningham was a compassionate public official who was deeply \ncommitted to his city, his State, and his country, serving 4 years in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps before returning home and beginning a life-long \ncareer rooted in his pride in Jersey City and his caring for his fellow \ncitizens.\n  He was a police officer, Hudson County freeholder, Jersey City \ncouncilman, and U.S. marshal. He distinguished himself further as a \nfierce and aggressive fighter for Jersey City as the city's mayor and \nState senator. His voice was strong and his love for his city \nboundless.\n  He worked every day to bring his diverse community together, to unite \nrather than divide. As the State's first African-American U.S. marshal \nand Jersey City's first African-American mayor, Glenn Cunningham plowed \na path of excellence for others to follow.\n  Sadly, his tenure as mayor was far too short, and he will be missed \nby those he served. As Annette McMillian of Jersey City told the Jersey \nJournal last week, ``He was fair and decent and honest.'' Terry Suarez \nof Union City added poignantly, ``A light has been darkened by the \nsilence of death.''\n  I join those who will miss Mayor Cunninghams great energy, \ncreativity, and perspectives on government and public service. On \nbehalf of the people of New Jersey, I extend my deepest condolences to \nthe mayor's widow, Sandra Bolden-Cunningham, and my prayers are with \nhis family and his beloved community of Jersey City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6343-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING THE CAREER OF FRANCES PRESTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Frances Preston, the president and \nchief executive officer of BMI announced in April that she is stepping \ndown from her leadership role at BMI. Though I know she will continue \nto play a role at BMI, I take this opportunity to commend her for \ndistinguished and dedicated service to the writers, composers, and \npublisher of BMI, as well as to the broader creative community.\n  For many years, Mrs. Preston has successfully guided BMI to a \nposition of international leadership in the entertainment industry. She \nis one of the industry's most widely admired executives. Fortune \nmagazine has called her ``one of the true powerhouses of the pop music \nbusiness.''\n  In large part as a result of her business and creative acumen, BMI \ntoday represents legendary artists ranging from Sting to Paul Simon to \nShania Twain. And, in the world of public policy, Mrs. Preston has been \na strong voice for creators' rights. She also maintains a passionate \ndedication to a number of charities and serves in a volunteer capacity \nas the president of the largest medical charity, the T.J. Martell \nFoundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research.\n  The list of awards Mrs. Preston has received for excellence in \nindustry and public service is too long to list here. They range from \nbeing the first non-performing woman invited to join New York's \nprestigious Friar's Club in 1993 to the American Women in Radio and \nTelevision's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1998 to induction in the \nBroadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame in 1999. More recent honors include \nthe Touchstone Advocate Award from Women in Music in October 2003 and \nthe NARAS Heroes Award from the New York Chapter of the Recording \nAcademy in December 2003.\n  Frances Preston has been successful in business, a leader in her \ncommunity, and generous in her service. She leaves a lasting legacy of \nleadership and excellence.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6344-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6344-S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n  FIFTH GRADE STUDENTS WRITE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND AMERICA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this year thousands of fifth \ngraders across the United States competed in a writing contest on \nimmigration sponsored by the American Immigrant Law Foundation and the \nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association. The students responded to the \nquestion, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.''\n  I had the privilege of serving as one of the judges for the \ncompetition, and I was impressed with the students' responses. They \nradiate with pride for the diversity of America and our immigrant \nheritage. Many students told personal stories of their families and \nfriends and their immigration to the United States.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Audrey Kidwell of Clayton, MO. \nIn her essay, ``The Garden of America,'' she explains how immigrants' \nnew roots become ``entwined'' with the roots of others helping us to \n``incorporate their strong points into our ever-growing garden.'' The \nUnited States has often been compared to a melting pot or a colorful \npatchwork quilt, and Audrey's eloquent essay adds a new vision of a \ngarden ``watered with kindness and friendship causing us to grow and to \nflourish.''\n  Other students honored for their exceptional writing are Camille \nAllamel of Indianapolis, Sarah Mesterton-Gibbons of Tallahassee, Daniel \nPietryla of Chicago, and Sam Sanson of Bay Village, OH. I congratulate \nthese students on their outstanding achievement.\n  These award-winning essays will be of interest to all of us in the \nSenate, and I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                         The Garden of America\n\n  (By Audrey Kidwell, Wilson School, Clayton, MO, Grand Prize Winner)\n\n       Many people have said that America is like a melting pot or \n     stew, but I think our country is more of a garden. In a \n     melting pot, all of the ingredients blend together into mush. \n     When you make stew, it all becomes one flavor and nothing \n     stands out. Try as I might, I can't think of any food that is \n     truly able to be associated with America. But a garden is \n     different.\n       When an immigrant first comes to America, he or she puts \n     out new, young roots into the soil of our heritage. These \n     roots become entwined, almost connected you might say, to \n     other root systems, holding the soil together. With the soil \n     held together, we are saved from erosion. We learn of the \n     ways these people have suffered in their countries, so we \n     know which mistakes not to make. It is good this way because \n     when we learn about other nations, we can incorporate their \n     strong points into our ever-growing garden. For this reason, \n     the sun of freedom always shines over our garden.\n       Even though we are all different, we all originated as \n     seeds. Some of us are violets or mums, some ferns or vines, \n     but none of us are weeds. We are all beautiful. This is \n     wonderful because in many other places, no one accepts \n     differences. In our garden we all help each other because our \n     roots hold the soil together. Our garden is watered with \n     kindness and friendship causing us to grow and to flourish. \n     These things are good because in other places, the soil \n     crumbles; the plants dry up, but not in America.\n       I love America because it has so many good qualities. We \n     offer a home to immigrants so that they can be happy. They, \n     in turn, make our nation stronger and help it to thrive. They \n     pass on new traditions to us and enrich our culture. I can't \n     imagine what our garden would be like without immigrants. It \n     would be similar to a garden with only roses. Roses are nice, \n     but I think variety and diversity is better. We are all lucky \n     and should be thankful to be rooted in the garden of America.\n\n                          America, the Mosaic\n\n(By Camille Allamel, International School of Indiana, Indianapolis, IN, \n                               Runner-Up)\n\n     Over time, America has become,\n     A gorgeous mosaic made of precious, living stones.\n     The jade stands for Asian immigrants,\n     Who brought mysterious China Towns and fireworks,\n     Along with sweet and sour chicken.\n     The ruby symbolizes the Hispanics,\n     With their juicy burritos and tacos,\n     Fiestas, mariachis, and pinatas!\n     The sapphire represents the French,\n     Down to Louisiana,\n     Right to Cajun Land,\n     With jambalaya, gumbo, and zydeco.\n     The emerald stone is for Italians,\n     Who have brought pasta and pizza along.\n     Now, the diamond,\n     Who is dedicated to this special group,\n     Forced to make it here,\n     Because of slavery,\n     When finally free,\n     Deciding to stay,\n     They are the African Americans!\n     Let's not forget the native turquoise,\n     Made for the Indians the immigrants have found,\n     Who have introduced and shared this beautiful land\n     That we today call America.\n     There are so many other stones,\n     Too many to name them all,\n     These immigrants who brought their history,\n     Their customs and their ministries,\n     Together create this grand mosaic,\n     Making all these people,\n     United to form America,\n     In a unique melting pot!!!\n\n          Why I Am Glad That America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n (By Sarah Mesterton-Gibbons, Home School, Tallahassee, FL, Runner-Up)\n\n       You might not be able to tell from looking at me, that I \n     come from a family of many immigrants. My friends might think \n     that I look ``American,'' but they don't realize that each \n     part of me reflects the characteristics of my ancestors. For \n     example, I got my blonde hair from my Swedish relatives, my \n     green eyes from my Northern Spanish relatives, my fair skin \n     and freckles from my Irish relatives, my short height from my \n     Puerto Rican relatives, and my facial shape from my Finnish \n     relatives.\n       Immigration is common in my family, and many of my \n     relatives have married people from different countries, \n     faiths and backgrounds. Two of my grandparents and all of my \n     great-grandparents immigrated from different countries, and \n     many of my great-great-grandparents were immigrants, too. My \n     father immigrated here from England. His parents went to \n     England from Ireland. We all have different accents than our \n     looks. And different interests and celebrations.\n       My friends think it's unusual that we celebrate different \n     holidays and eat different foods, but they also find it \n     interesting. We celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve as they \n     do in Europe, and also Santa Lucia Day and Midsommar as they \n     do in Sweden. We'd much rather eat rice and beans, chapattis, \n     spanikopita, Cornish pasties and ratatouille than typical \n     American dishes. My sister and I have even learned to cook \n     the dishes ourselves. When we listen to music, we listen to \n     everything from Irish jigs, to Swedish polkas, to Spanish \n     sambas to English folk songs. Our house is filled with \n     furniture and articles from all over the world. Our lifestyle \n     reflects our many nationalities. Even our very best friends \n     are from many countries.\n       Even though I look typically American--but am not--I AM a \n     typical American, because we are all immigrants or \n     descendants of immigrants. And that is wonderful, because it \n     means it is easy to find the food, decorations and costumes \n     to celebrate holidays as my ancestors have done.\n       This varied cultural background has enriched my life. The \n     people I love have taught me about their religions, customs, \n     food and celebrations. No matter who I'm with, or what \n     country I'm in, I feel very much at home. Thanks to my Dad, I \n     feel especially at home in England.\n       Being exposed to so many different opinions has made me \n     look at America's problems in new ways. I often find that \n     other countries have handled similar problems in better ways \n     than we have and I hope I'm open-minded enough to learn from \n     them. I would like to convince my country to consider many \n     world views before making decisions. And I hope my fellow \n     immigrants try their very best to do the same. Maybe if we \n     remember that we are all immigrants, then we can continue to \n     make America a better place to live.\n\n           Why I Am Glad That America Is a Land of Immigrants\n\n   (By Daniel Pietryla, St. Christina School, Chicago, IL, Runner-Up)\n\n       Dedicated to my parents, grandparents and to all immigrants \n     who have endured personal hardships for the sake of their \n     children. Leaving their homelands and bravely entering a \n     foreign country with hopes and dreams of freedom, happiness \n     and prosperity. The gift of America, a gift of immigrants!)\n\n     My ancestors are from Poland, Where life was hard and long, \n           Their future was in a new land, America is where they \n           belong.\n\n     The dirt floor, wooden shack, Beds of feathers and straw, The \n           privy around back, Was the last thing they saw.\n\n     They turned and gazed, For one last look, The home where they \n           were raised, Is the memory they took.\n\n     Over the Atlantic by ship, many hardships were endured, \n           Herbal tea they would sip, their senses were blurred. \n           Days and nights of wondering, Frightened and alone were \n           they, Deep doubts were pondering, Through this long, \n           long way.\n\n     Two weeks of seasickness, Unsure of their choice, America \n           came in darkness, No one did rejoice.\n\n     They boarded a train, Never understanding the words, \n           Lightning and rain, Were all that they heard.\n\n     The train's wheels were squealing, The sudden stop that they \n           felt, Nervous stomachs were feeling, And hearts about \n           to melt.\n\n     Streetlights and cars Intensifying the fear, And heard from \n           afar, A familiar voice so clear.\n\n     ``Welcome, Welcome, You're finally here!''

JOHN H. HOPPS, JR.\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat educator and champion of science and technology, who recently \npassed away.\n  Dr. John Hopps was a true public servant who most recently furthered \nthe cause of our national security as deputy director of defense \nresearch and engineering and deputy under secretary of defense for \nlaboratories and basic science at the Department of Defense. As \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats \nand Capabilities, I had the privilege of knowing John and witnessing \nfirst-hand his support of programs, projects and personnel in the \ndefense laboratories.\n  Prior to his position with the Department of Defense, Dr. Hopps \nworked to encourage our Nation's youth in their pursuit of academic \nexcellence, especially in this fields of physics and chemistry. As \nprovost and senior vice president for academic affairs and professor of \nphysics at Morehouse College, John was in a position to guide young \nminds and manage academic departments and multi disciplinary programs.\n  Immediately before joining Morehouse College, John Hopps served as \ndirector of materials research at the National Science Foundation. \nDuring his tenure with Draper Laboratory, which began in 1977, John was \nmanager of energy program development, manager of the laboratory's \nfault-tolerant systems technology research program, and education \ndirector for the laboratory.\n  During his tenure as deputy director of defense research and \nengineering, Dr. Hopps made great strides in reaching out to the \nscientific and academic communities and in working to ensure the \ntechnological superiority of the defense laboratories and workforce who \ndevelop the tools, protective equipment and weapons that are so \nimportant to the U.S. warfighter of today and tomorrow. Under his \nleadership, the Department increased the National Defense Science and \nEngineering Fellowship Program and pursued a program and structure--\nMaterials World Modules--he developed to connect students of all ages \nto the excitement and value of science.\n  This year's defense authorization bill contains a provision that \nauthorizes the Department to establish a pilot science, mathematics and \nengineering scholarship program that will continue much of the work \nchampioned by John in his efforts for the Department of Defense and in \nhis other positions both inside and outside the Federal Government. \nJohn's academic background combined with service in the Federal \nGovernment gave him a unique perspective on the importance of basic \nresearch for future technological advances, linkages he helped us all \nto make.\n  John Hopps' patient, deliberative manner, keen sense of humor, and \ncompassionate approach to life and work will be missed by the many \nstudents, educators and public servants, whose lives he has touched. My \ndeepest sympathies go out to Dr. Hopps' wife, family and friends, and \nto all who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6345-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SERGEANT JIM MULLEN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, on June 4th hundreds of talented, \nmotivated young men and women will meet in Boston to celebrate the 15th \nAnniversary of City Year. In 1989 the first group of young people \ncompleted a year of service to their community, inspiring what would \nbecome AmeriCorps. Now, 15 years later, City Year will hold its annual \nmeeting in the city where it began. Since then, thirteen additional \ncities have welcomed the young idealists in red jackets and Timberland \nboots who, in their own words, ``are young enough to want to change the \nworld and old enough to do it.''\n   City Year recruits start each day with ``PT,'' a trademark exercise \nroutine to wake up the mind and spirit to take on the challenges of the \nday. They move on to challenge the apathy in the communities they \nserve. They spend each day tackling illiteracy, tutoring, refurbishing \nbuildings, improving access to health care, and changing lives in many \nother ways.\n   City Year participants also work tirelessly to encourage others to \nserve, attracting volunteers through Serve-a-thons and special service \ndays that focus community efforts on a particular project. They spread \ntheir love of service and highlight local problems that can be solved \nby working together.\n   ``Cyzygy,'' their annual meeting, is a time when they celebrate \nservice and discuss strategies to improve recruitment, retention and \nthe quality of service. Just as they work to improve communities, they \nwork to improve the way communities address their problems, and engage \nothers in the search for effective solutions.\n   When they launched City Year in the 1980's, Alan Khazei and Michael \nBrown had a noble vision that spending a year in service to community \ncould become the norm. They foresaw a domestic Peace Corps that could \ntransform lives and rebuild communities. At the time, many thought they \nwere impractical dreamers. Today we know they were practical \nvisionaries and we are all proud to witness the results of their \nvision.

Mr. President, the State of Ohio is home to \nOhio University, the first public institution of higher learning in the \nold Northwest Territory. This institution, my alma mater, celebrates \nthe 200th anniversary of its founding this year.\n  On March 1, 1803, Ohio became the Nation's 17th State. Less than a \nyear later, on February 18, 1804, the Ohio General Assembly approved \nOhio University's charter.\n  Ohio University is the realization of the Jeffersonian ideals of \neducating broadly and cultivating minds and ideas so that people can \nreason out their differences. Officially established in 1804, the \nuniversity opened in 1808 with three students. In 1815, Ohio University \naward its first two bachelor's\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\ndegrees. By the end of the Civil War, the university had graduated a \ntotal of 145 students. By 1920, the student population was 1,072, but \nit was not until after World War II that the university began to \napproach its present size.\n  In the 1950s, the student population grew from 4,600 to 8,000, and \nthe 1960s saw enrollment burgeon from about 10,000 to some 18,000 \nstudents on the Athens campus. Today, the Athens campus is comprised of \nmore than 200 buildings on 1,800 acres, including state-of-the-art \nfacilities featuring the latest in educational technology. Reinforcing \nthe university's ongoing commitment to diversity, the Athens campus \nserves approximately 20,000 students hailing from all 50 States and \nabout 100 nations.

A bill to establish a program within the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard to \nhelp identify, assess, reduce, and prevent marine debris and its \nadverse impacts on the marine environment and navigation safety, in \ncoordination with non-Federal entities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Marine \nDebris Research and Reduction Act. From the shore, our oceans seem vast \nand limitless, but I fear that we often overlook the impacts our \nactions have on the sea and its resources. The Act that I am \nintroducing today with my friends and colleagues, Senators Ted Stevens, \nFritz Hollings, and Maria Cantwell focuses on one particular impact \nthat goes unnoticed by many: marine debris.\n  In a high-tech era of radiation, carcinogenic chemicals, and human-\ninduced climate change, the problem of the trash produced by ocean-\ngoing vessels and dumped at sea must seem old-fashioned by comparison. \nSea garbage would seem to be a simple issue that surely cannot rise to \nthe priority level of the stresses our 21st century civilization places \non the natural environment.\n  Regrettably, that perception is wrong. While marine debris includes \nconventional ``trash,'' it also includes a vast array of additional \nmaterials. It is discarded fishing nets and gear. It is cargo washed \noverboard. It is abandoned equipment from our commercial fleets. Nor \ndoes the ``low-tech'' nature of solid refuse diminish its deadly impact \non the creatures of the sea. Dead is dead--whether an animal dies from \nan immune system weakened by toxic chemicals, or drowns entangled in a \ndiscarded fishing net.\n  Global warming, disease, and toxic contamination of our seas has \nalready stressed these fragile ecosystems. These threats have been \ndescribed in the draft report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, \nwhich also dedicated an entire chapter to the threats posed by marine \ndebris. The bill we introduce today adopts the measures recommended by \nthe Commission to help remove man-made marine debris from the list of \nocean threats. It also follows the recommendations of the International \nMarine Debris Conference held in my home State of Hawaii in 2000.\n  The bill establishes a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program \nwithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, \ndirects the U.S. Coast Guard to improve enforcement of laws designed to \nprevent ship-based pollution from plastics and other garbage, re-\ninvigorates an interagency committee on marine debris, and improves our \nresearch and information on marine debris sources, threats, and \nprevention.\n  In Hawaii, we are able to see the impacts of marine debris more \nclearly than most because of the convergence caused by the North \nPacific Tropical High. Atmospheric forces cause ocean surface currents \nto converge on Hawaii, bringing with them the vast amount of debris \nfloating throughout the Pacific. In 2003 alone, 122 tons of debris were \nremoved from coral reefs in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which is \nalso home to many endangered marine species.\n  I am pleased that the coordinated approach taken to address the \nthreats posed by marine debris in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands has \nprovided a model for the Nation. NOAA's Pacific Islands Region \nFisheries Science Center is leading this interagency partnership, which \nalso includes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii's business and \nuniversity communities, and conservation groups. Not only have we \nremoved debris that poses harm to endangered species, but with the help \nof donated services, we have recycled the abandoned nets into energy to \npower residential homes.\n  We have learned that our best path to success lies in partnering with \none another to share resources, and it is my hope that others may adapt \nour project to their own shores through the partnership and funding \nopportunities set forth in this bill. This is why the bill establishes \nan Interagency Committee on Marine Debris to coordinate marine debris \nprevention and removal efforts among federal agencies, state \ngovernments, universities, and non-governmental organizations.\n  We must also bear in mind that no matter how zealously we reform our \npractices, the ultimate solution lies in international cooperation. The \noceans connect the coastal nations of the world, and we must work \ntogether to reduce this increasing threat to our seas and shores. The \nMarine Debris Research and Reduction Act will provide the United States \nwith the tools to develop effective marine debris prevention and \nremoval programs on a worldwide basis, including reporting and \ninformation requirements that will assist in the creation of an \ninternational marine debris database.\n  I hope you will join me in supporting enactment of the Marine Debris \nResearch and Reduction Act. This bill will provide the United States \nwith the programs and resources necessary to protect our most valuable \nresources, our oceans. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2488\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The oceans, which comprise nearly three quarters of the \n     Earth's surface, are an important source of food and provide \n     a wealth of other natural products that are important to the \n     economy of the United States and the world.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal areas are regions of remarkably high \n     biological productivity, are of considerable importance for a \n     variety of recreational and commercial activities, and \n     provide a vital means of transportation.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are limited and susceptible \n     to change as a direct and indirect result of human \n     activities, and such changes can impact the ability of the \n     ocean to provide the benefits upon which the Nation depends.\n       (4) Marine debris, including plastics, derelict fishing \n     gear, and a wide variety of other objects, has a harmful and \n     persistent effect on marine flora and fauna and can have \n     adverse impacts on human health and navigation safety.\n       (5) Marine debris is also a hazard to navigation, putting \n     mariners and rescuers, their vessels, and consequently the \n     marine environment at risk, and can cause economic loss due \n     to entanglement of vessel systems.\n       (6) Modern plastic materials persist for decades in the \n     marine environment and therefore pose the greatest potential \n     for long-term damage to the marine environment.\n       (7) Lack of knowledge and data on the source, movement, and \n     effects of plastics and other marine debris in marine \n     ecosystems has hampered efforts to develop effective \n     approaches for addressing marine debris.\n       (8) Lack of resources, priority attention to this issue, \n     and coordination at the Federal level has undermined the \n     development and implementation of a Federal program to \n     address marine debris, both domestically and internationally.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish programs within the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard \n     to help identify, assess, reduce, and prevent marine debris \n     and its adverse impacts on the marine environment and \n     navigation safety, in coordination with other Federal and \n     non-Federal entities;\n       (2) to re-establish the Inter-agency Marine Debris \n     Coordinating Committee to ensure a coordinated government \n     response across Federal agencies;\n       (3) to develop a Federal information clearinghouse to \n     enable researchers to study the scale and impact of marine \n     debris more efficiently; and\n       (4) to take appropriate action in the international \n     community to prevent marine debris and reduce concentrations \n     of existing debris on a global scale.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PREVENTION AND REMOVAL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--There is established, within \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marine \n     Debris Prevention and Removal Program to reduce and prevent \n     the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the \n     marine environment and navigation safety.\n       (b) Program Components.--Through the Program, the Under \n     Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere (Under Secretary) shall \n     carry out the following activities:\n       (1) Mapping, identification, impacts, removal, and \n     prevention.--The Under Secretary shall, in consultation with \n     relevant Federal agencies, undertake marine debris mapping, \n     identification, impact assessment, prevention, and removal \n     efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing a threat to \n     living marine resources (particularly endangered or protected \n     species) and navigation safety, including--\n       (A) the establishment of a process for cataloguing and \n     maintaining an inventory of marine debris and its impacts \n     found in the United States navigable waters and the United \n     States exclusive economic zone, including location, material, \n     size, age, and origin, and impacts on habitat, living marine \n     resources, human health, and navigation safety;\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\n       (B) measures to identify the origin, location, and \n     projected movement of marine debris within the United States \n     navigable waters and the United States exclusive economic \n     zone, including the use of oceanographic, atmospheric, \n     satellite, and remote sensing data; and\n       (C) development and implementation of strategies, methods, \n     priorities, and a plan, for removing marine debris from \n     United States navigable waters and within the United States \n     exclusive economic zone, including development of local or \n     regional protocols for removal of derelict fishing gear.\n       (2) Reducing and preventing loss of gear.--The Under \n     Secretary shall improve efforts and actively seek to prevent \n     and reduce commercial fishing gear losses, as well as to \n     reduce adverse impacts of such gear on living marine \n     resources and navigation safety, including--\n       (A) research and development of alternatives to gear posing \n     threats to the marine environment, and methods for marking \n     gear used in specific fisheries to enhance the tracking and \n     identification of lost gear; and\n       (B) development of voluntary or mandatory management \n     measures to reduce the loss and discard of commercial fishing \n     gear, such as incentive programs, observer programs, toll-\n     free reporting hotlines, and computer-based notification \n     forms.\n       (3) Outreach.--The Under Secretary shall undertake outreach \n     and education of stakeholders, including the fishing, gear \n     manufacturers, and other marine-dependent industries, on \n     threats associated with marine debris and approaches to \n     identify, prevent, mitigate, monitor, and remove marine \n     debris, including outreach and education activities through \n     public-private initiatives.

A bill to establish a program within the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration to integrate Federal coastal and ocean \nmapping activities; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Coastal and Ocean \nMapping Integration Act of 2004. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nGregg and Hollings, who are original cosponsors of the bill. The \njurisdiction of the United States extends 200 miles beyond its \ncoastline and includes the U.S. Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic \nZone, or ``EEZ.'' Regrettably, nearly 90 percent of this expanse \nremains unmapped by modern technologies, meaning that we have almost no \ninformation about a swath of ocean as large as the terra firma of the \nentire United States.\n  There was a time in the history of our Nation when our best efforts \nto map the seas meant lowering weights tied to piano wire over the side \nof a vessel, and measuring how deep they went. These efforts led to the \ndevelopment of rudimentary nautical charts designed to help mariners \nnavigate safely. The rapidly increasing uses of our coastal and ocean \nwaters, however, call for development of a new generation of ecosystem-\noriented mapping and assessment products and services.\n  The technologies of today create richly layered mapping products that \nexpand far beyond just charting for safe navigation. Now, by combining \nsuch information as mineral surveys of the U.S. Geological Service, \nhabitat characterizations of the National Oceanic Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA), and watershed assessments of the Environmental \nProtection Agency into a single product, map users are able to consider \nthe impacts of their actions on multiple facets of the marine \nenvironment.\n  The recent draft report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy has \nhighlighted the urgent need to modernize, improve, expand, and \nintegrate Federal mapping efforts to improve navigation, safety and \nresource management decisionmaking. By employing integrated mapping \napproaches, urban and residential growth can be directed away from \nareas of high risk from ocean-based threats such as tsunami and tidal \nsurge. The risks of maritime activities can be minimized by identifying \nhazards that could impact on sensitive ecosystems, and devising \nappropriate mitigation plans. Living marine resource managers can also \ngauge where and how best to focus their efforts to restore essential \nmarine habitats.\n  The bill I am introducing today will lay the foundation for producing \nthe ocean maps of the 21st century. It mandates coordination among the \nmany Federal agencies with mapping missions with NOAA as the lead in \ndeveloping national mapping priorities and strategies. The bill would \nalso establish national hydrographic centers to manage comprehensively \nthe mapping data produced by the Federal Government, encourage \ninnovation in technologies, and authorize the funding necessary to \nimplement this comprehensive effort.\n  Perhaps the most important lesson that comprehensive, integrated \nmapping can afford is an awareness of a web of human marine communities \nas rich and varied as the ocean itself. From awareness grows \nunderstanding, respect, and cooperation. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this measure that will, in turn,\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nsupport the development of healthy coastal communities across the \nnation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2489\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act of 1990 to establish vessel ballast water \nmanagement requirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ballast \nWater Management Act of 2004. I am joined by my friend and colleague, \nSenator Ted Stevens. For some time, we have recognized the impacts of \nland-based invasive species. In Hawaii, the impacts of such alien \nspecies on native species have been among the most significant in the \ncountry.\n  While not as visible, invasive species pose an equally great threat. \nOne of the major ways that aquatic invasives make their way around the \nglobe is through the ballast water used by vessels.\n  Modern maritime commerce depends on ships stabilized by the uptake \nand discharge of huge volumes of ocean water for ballast. Regrettably, \nships do not transport such water alone--but also the plants and \nanimals, as well as human diseases such as cholera, that it contains. \nAn estimated 10,000 aquatic organisms travel around the globe each day \nin the ballast water of cargo vessels. Over 2 billion gallons of \nballast water are discharged into waters of the United States each \nyear.\n  From the zebra mussel fouling the facilities and shores of the Great \nLakes, to the noxious algae that choke the coral reefs of Hawaii, \naquatic invasive species pose a serious threat to delicate marine \necosystems and human health. The economic costs are also staggering--\nthe direct and indirect costs of aquatic invasive species to the \neconomy of the United States amount to billions of dollars each year.\n  We must find an effective solution to this problem, while at the same \ntime ensuring that our maritime industry can continue to operate in a \ncost-effective manner. We will need to rely on the steady collaborative \nefforts of industry, science, government, and coastal communities as we \nmove forward.\n  The bill I introduce today lays the foundation for such progress. It \nestablishes standards for ballast water treatment that will be \neffective but on a schedule that our maritime fleet can realistically \nachieve. It recognizes safety as a paramount concern, and allows \nflexibility in ballast exchange practices to safeguard vessels and \ntheir passengers and crew. Looking to the future, my bill will also \nencourage the development and adoption of new ballast water treatment \ntechnologies, as well as innovative technologies to address other \nvessel sources of invasives such as hull fouling, through a grant \nprogram.\n  The bill closely tracks and is consistent with an agreement recently \nnegotiated in the International Maritime Organization. It would phase-\nin ballast water treatment requirements on the same schedule as that \nadopted by the IMO agreement, and require ballast water exchange to be \nused until treatment systems are in place. Importantly, the \ninternational agreement includes a provision assuring that parties can \nadopt more stringent measures than those included in the agreement. \nThis provision was sought by the United States and is important to \nassure the sovereignty of nations in addressing their needs while \nstriving for international cooperation. In light of this provision, the \nbill includes a standard for treatment that is more effective than that \nadopted by the international community to ensure that the impacts in \nthe United States are adequately prevented.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ballast Water Management Act \n     of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The introduction of aquatic invasive species into the \n     Nation's waters is one of the most urgent issues facing the \n     marine environment in the United States.\n       (2) The direct and indirect costs of aquatic invasive \n     species to the economy of the United States amount to \n     billions of dollars per year.\n       (3) Invasive species are thought to have been involved in \n     70 percent of the last century's extinctions of native \n     aquatic species.\n       (4) Invasive aquatic species are a significant problem in \n     all regions of the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, \n     San Francisco Bay, the Great Lakes, the Southeast, and the \n     Chesapeake Bay.\n       (5) Ballast water from ships is one of the largest pathways \n     for the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species.\n       (6) It has been estimated that some 10,000 non-indigenous \n     aquatic organisms travel around the globe each day in the \n     ballast water of cargo ships.\n       (7) Over 2 billion gallons of ballast water are discharged \n     in United States waters each year. Ballast water may be the \n     source of the largest volume of foreign organisms released on \n     a daily basis into American ecosystems.\n       (8) Ballast water has been found to transport not only \n     invasive plants and animals but human diseases as well, such \n     as cholera.\n       (9) Invasive aquatic species may originate in other \n     countries, or from distinct regions in the United States.\n       (10) An average of 72 percent of all fish species \n     introduced in the Southeast have become established, many of \n     which are native to the United States but transplanted \n     outside their native ranges.\n       (11) The introduction of non-indigenous species has been \n     closely correlated with the disappearance of indigenous \n     species in Hawaii and other islands.\n       (12) Despite the efforts of more than 20 State, Federal, \n     and private agencies, unwanted alien pests are entering \n     Hawaii at an alarming rate----about 2 million times more \n     rapid than the natural rate.\n       (13) Current Federal programs are insufficient to \n     effectively address this growing problem.\n       (14) Preventing aquatic invasive species from being \n     introduced is the most cost-effective approach for addressing \n     this issue, because once established, they are costly and \n     sometimes impossible to control.\n\n     SEC. 3. BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1101 of the Nonindigenous Aquatic \n     Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4711) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1101.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote and \nimprove the allied health professors; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the well-being of the U.S. population \ndepends to a considerable extent on having access to high quality \nhealth care which, in turn, requires the presence of an adequate supply \nof health care professionals. The Congress and the President recognized \nthis need when we passed, and President Bush signed, the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the 107th Congress. Just as with nurses, we must \nalso insure an adequate supply of well-prepared allied health \nprofessionals. That is why, today, I am introducing the Allied Health \nReinvestment Act with my good colleagues, Senator Bingaman of New \nMexico and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut.\n  The allied health professions are many. Those recognized in the act \ninclude professionals in the areas of: dental hygiene, dietetics/\nnutrition, emergency medical services, health information management, \nclinical laboratory sciences/medical technology, cytotechnology, \noccupational therapy, physical therapy, radiologic technology, nuclear \nmedical technology, rehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and \nspeech-language pathology/audiology. This is not an exhaustive list, as \nthe act will leave to the discretion of the Secretary of HHS additional \nprofessions deemed eligible.\n  Today, many allied health professions are characterized by existing \nworkforce shortages, declining enrollments in academic institutions, or \na\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\ncombination of both factors. The American Hospital Association (AHA) \nreports vacancy rates of 18 percent among radiology technicians, ten \npercent among laboratory technologists, 15.3 percent among imaging \ntechnicians, and 12.7 percent among pharmacy technicians. In addition, \nthe AHA indicates that hospitals are having increasing difficulties \nrecruiting these same professionals over the preceding two-year period.\n  In my own State of Washington, the Washington State Hospital \nAssociation reports vacancy rates of 14.3 percent among ultrasound \ntechnologists, 11.3 percent among radiology technicians, and 10.9 \npercent among nuclear medicine technologists. These vacancy rates have \na real effect on the hospitals in my State. When I meet with hospital \nofficials back home, they always tell me how the lack of technicians \naffects patient care.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that in the period 1998-\n2008, the United States would need a total of 93,000 new professionals \nin clinical laboratory science by creating 53,000 new positions and \nfilling the 40,000 existing vacancies. That averages 9,000 openings per \nyear for technicians, and yet academic institutions are producing only \n4,990 graduates annually. If these numbers stay constant, we will be \nshort by 43,100 needed technicians in 2008.\n  According to the American Hospital Association, declining enrollment \nin health education programs contributes to the critical shortages of \nhealth care professionals. Similarly, data from a November 2002 study \nof 90 institutions by the Association of Schools of Allied Health \nProfessionals (ASAHP) shows a three-year period of decline in \nenrollment in cardiovascular perfusion technology, cytotechnology, \ndietetics, emergency medical sciences, health administration, health \ninformation management, medical technology, occupational therapy, \nrehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and respiratory therapy \ntechnician programs. As an indication of a worsening situation, data \nfrom the 2002-2003 academic year, alone, show that dental hygiene, \nphysician assistant, and speech-language pathology and audiology should \nbe added to this list.\n\n  While having an adequate number of health professionals in our \ncountry is key to ensuring access to health care for all of us, \ncertainly one of the key populations for whom a healthy supply of \nhealth professionals is vitally important for is our senior population.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau reports that rapid growth of the population \nage 65 and over will begin in 2011 when the first of the baby boom \ngeneration reaches age 65 and will continue for many years. From 1900 \nto 2000, the proportion of persons 65 and over tripled, going from 4.1 \npercent to 12.4 percent.\n  The baby-boom generation's movement into middle age, a period when \nthe incidence of heart attack and stroke increases, will produce a \nhigher demand for therapeutic services. Medical advances now enable \nmore patients with critical problems to survive, but in order to do so \nand maintain a high quality of life, these patients may need extensive \ntherapy.\n  Along with the aging of the population came an increase in the number \nof Americans living with one, and often more than one, chronic \ncondition. Today, it is estimated that 125 million Americans live with \na chronic condition, and by 2020 as the population ages, that number \nwill increase to an estimated 157 million, with 81 million of them \nhaving two or more chronic conditions. Twenty-five percent of \nindividuals with chronic conditions have some type of activity \nlimitations. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries with \nfive or more chronic conditions.\n  Many individuals with chronic conditions rely on family caregivers. \nApproximately nine million Americans provide such services, and on the \naverage, they spend 24 hours a week doing so. Caregivers aged 65-74 \nprovide an average of 30.7 hours of care per week and individuals aged \n75 and older provide an average of 34.5 hours per week.\n  Women are more likely than men to have chronic conditions, in part \nbecause they have longer life expectancies. These same women are \ncaregivers to other chronically ill persons. In addition, 65 percent of \ncaregivers are female, and of all caregivers, nearly 40 percent are 55 \nyears of age and older.\n  Physicians report that their training does not adequately prepare \nthem to care for this type of patient by providing education and \noffering effective nutritional guidance. Those aspects of care can be \nprovided by allied health professionals, but many of them need better \npreparation to treat and coordinate care for patients with chronic \nconditions. While much emphasis is placed on curative forms of care, \nadditional efforts must be devoted to slowing the progression of \ndisease and its effects.\n  One example of the effectiveness of allied health interventions may \nbe illustrated by a study funded by the National Institute on Aging, \nthe National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and the Agency \nfor Health Care Policy and Research (since renamed the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality). The investigation showed that \nsignificant benefits resulted from a nine-month occupational therapy \nintervention intended to reduce health-related declines among urban, \nmultiethnic, independent-living older adults. The majority of study \nparticipants, 73 percent, lived alone and 26 percent reported at least \none disability. Important health-related benefits attributable to the \nintervention continued over a six-month interval in the absence of \nfurther treatment.\n\n  The bill I and my colleagues introduce today, like the Nurse \nReinvestment Act in the 107th Congress, is intended to provide \nincentives for individuals to seek and complete high quality allied \nhealth education and training. Furthermore, the bill will provide \nadditional funding to ensure that such education and training can be \nprovided to allied health students so that the U.S. healthcare industry \nwill have a supply of allied health professionals needed to support the \nnation's health care system in this decade and beyond.\n  The bill offers allied health education, practice, and retention \ngrants. Education grants will be used to expand the enrollment in \nallied health education programs, especially by underrepresented racial \nand ethnic minority students, and provide educational opportunities \nthrough new technologies and methods, including distance-learning. \nPractice grants are intended to establish or expand allied health \npractice arrangements in non-institutional settings to demonstrate \nmethods that will improve access to primary health care in rural areas \nand other medically underserved communities. Retention grants are \nintended to promote career advancement for allied health personnel.\n  Grants will also be made available to health care facilities to \nenable them to carry out demonstrations of models and best practices in \nallied health for the purpose of developing innovative strategies or \napproaches for retention of allied health professionals. These grants \nwill be awarded to a variety of geographic regions, and to a range of \ndifferent types and sizes of facilities, including facilities located \nin rural, urban, and suburban areas.\n  Furthermore, this bill will give the Secretary of HHS, acting through \nthe Administrator of HRSA, the authority to enter into an agreement \nwith any institution that offers an eligible allied health education \nprogram to establish and operate a faculty loan fund to increase the \nnumber of qualified allied health faculty. Loans may be granted to \nfaculty who are pursuing a full-time course of study or, at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary, a part-time course of study in an advanced \ndegree program.\n  I am especially proud of the provisions of this legislation regarding \nthe National Health Service Corps program, the brain child of Senator \nWarren Magnuson of Washington. The NHSC program, of course, encourages \nstudents in the health professions such as doctors and dentists to \nserve in underserved areas throughout our Nation in return for loan \nrepayment assistance. And, like the NHSC program, this Allied Health \nReinvestment Act will establish a scholarship program that provides \nscholarships to individuals seeking allied health education in exchange \nfor service by those individuals in rural and other medically \nunderserved areas with allied health personnel shortages.\n  There are a number of organizations supporting this bill, and I thank \nthem for that support. Among them, the list includes, but is not \nlimited to:\n\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\n\n     Washington State Hospital Association\n     Health Work Force Institute (Seattle, WA)\n     American Association for Respiratory Care\n     American Association of Community Colleges\n     American Clinical Laboratory Association\n     American Dental Hygienists' Association\n     American Dietetic Association\n     American Health Information Management Association\n     American Physical Therapy Association\n     American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science\n     American Society for Clinical Pathology\n     American Society of Radiologic Technologists\n     Association of Academic Health Centers\n     College of Health Deans\n     Midwest Regional Deans Group\n     Myositis Association\n     National Association of EMS Educators\n     National Cancer Registrars Association\n     National Network of Health Career Programs in Two-Year \n         Colleges\n     Northeast Regional Deans Group\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for reimbursement of certified midwife services and to provide \nfor more equitable reimbursement rates for certified nurse-midwife \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Improving \nAccess to Nurse-Midwife Care Act of 2004. For too many years, certified \nnurse midwives (CNMs) have not received adequate reimbursement under \nthe Medicare program. My legislation takes important steps to improve \nreimbursement for CNMs.\n  There are approximately 2 million disabled women on Medicare who are \nof childbearing age; however, if they choose to utilize a CNM for \n``well women'' services, the CNM is only reimbursed at 65 percent of \nthe physician fee schedule. In practical terms, the typical well-woman \nvisit costs, on average, $50. But Medicare currently reimburses CNMs in \nrural areas only $14 for this visit, which could include a pap smear, \nmammogram, and other pre-cancer screenings. CNMs administer the same \ntests and incur the same costs as physicians but receive only 65 \npercent of the physician fee schedule for these services. Other non-\nphysician providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants are reimbursed at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule. \nThis reduced payment is unfair and does not adequately reflect the \nservices CNMs provide to beneficiaries. At this incredibly low rate of \nreimbursement, the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) agrees \nthat a CNM simply cannot afford to provide services to Medicare \npatients.\n  In June of 2002, MedPAC issued a report titled, ``Medicare Payment to \nAdvance Practice Nurses and Physician Assistants.'' In a 14-0 vote, \nMedPAC recommended to Congress that the percentage of reimbursement for \nCNM services be increased. Moreover, because practice expenses are much \nhigher for CNMs--liability coverage costs for CNMs are 10-fold higher \nthan for other non-physician providers--MedPAC signaled that CNMs \nshould be paid more than 85 percent. My legislation would increase the \nlevel of reimbursement to 95 percent of the physician fee schedule, \nwhich more adequately reflects the cost of providing midwifery \nservices.\n  My legislation would also make several technical changes to current \nMedicare provisions that limit the ability of\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nmidwives to effectively serve the Medicare-eligible population. In \nparticular, CNMs serve as faculty members of medical schools. For over \n20 years, they have supervised and trained interns and residents. The \nbill guarantees payment for graduate medical education and includes \ntechnical corrections that will clarify the reassignment of billing \nrights for CNMs who are employed by others. Finally, my bill would \nestablish recognition for a certified midwife (CM) to provide services \nunder Medicare. Despite the fact that CNMs and CMs provide the same \nservices, Medicare has yet to recognize CNs as eligible providers. My \nbill would change this.\n  This bill will enhance access to ``well woman'' care for thousands of \nwomen in underserved communities and make several needed changes to \nimprove access to midwives. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 369--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN HONORING \nTHE SERVICE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 369\n\n       Whereas during the dark days of World War II, the United \n     States, the world, and the very future of freedom were \n     threatened by nazism, fascism, and tyranny;\n       Whereas a generation of Americans stepped forward to \n     confront this scourge, accepting the call to duty to fight \n     the Axis Powers, to defend freedom, and to put their lives on \n     the line so that future generations could live in peace and \n     freedom;\n       Whereas during World War II, the brave men and women of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States fought alongside allies \n     from more than 30 other nations to vanquish the tyranny and \n     oppression of the Axis Powers on the sea, on the land, and in \n     the air in distant lands in every part of the globe;\n       Whereas more than 16,000,000 Americans served in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States during World War II, hailing from \n     every corner of the United States and its territories;\n       Whereas more than 671,000 Americans were wounded and over \n     105,000 Americans were held as prisoners of war in that \n     terrible conflict;\n       Whereas more than 400,000 members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their \n     lives to defeat the evils of nazism, fascism, and tyranny, \n     and to preserve the United States and the ideals the people \n     of the United States hold true;\n       Whereas by the end of World War II, the members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States had become symbols of hope \n     for the victors, the liberated peoples of the world, and \n     their former adversaries;\n       Whereas the victory of the Allied Powers in World War II \n     paved the way for the growth of democracy and freedom in the \n     defeated nations of Germany and Japan, and laid the \n     foundation for the West to confront, and eventually defeat, \n     the threat of Communism;\n       Whereas the people of the United States can never fully \n     express their gratitude to all the members of the Armed \n     Services, including the ``Greatest Generation'' of World War \n     II, who have dedicated themselves to protecting the people of \n     the United States and to defending the ideals and principles \n     of our great country;\n       Whereas 114 veterans of World War II have served in the \n     Senate, including 6 who are currently serving: Senator Akaka \n     of Hawaii, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, Senator Inouye \n     of Hawaii, Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, Senator Stevens \n     of Alaska, and Senator Warner of Virginia; and\n       Whereas the Senate, on the occasion of the dedication of \n     the World War II Memorial and the 60th Anniversary of the D-\n     day landings in Normandy, France, is proud to honor its \n     Members, past and present, who served in World War II: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its eternal appreciation for the veterans of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States who fought and toiled \n     to protect the United States and preserve the freedom and way \n     of life of the United States during World War II;\n       (2) honors the brave men and women who made the ultimate \n     sacrifice and gave their lives in defense of liberty and the \n     United States during that global conflict; and\n       (3) proudly commends the 108 former Members and 6 current \n     Members of the Senate who are veterans of World War II, \n     including Senator Akaka, Senator Hollings, Senator Inouye, \n     Senator Lautenberg, Senator Stevens, and Senator Warner, for \n     their leadership and service to the United States both in war \n     and in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/02/senate-section/article/S6363-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3257.
