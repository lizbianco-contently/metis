If Senators do wish to introduce legislation or make \nstatements, I encourage them to do so this morning.\n  We were able to complete the budget resolution about 9 hours ago, at \n1 in the morning, or shortly after that. I thank all of my colleagues \nfor their willingness to stay very late last night and into the early \nhours of the morning in order to complete our business.\n  Truthfully, it was a very busy week, but the fact we were able to \npass this budget resolution with reconciliation, the fact we were able \nto do a couple judges early this morning and finish business on a \nnumber of nominations, I think should bring us all a great deal of \nsatisfaction. It is very important for us in these busy times to \ncontinue to govern, and govern well. I think yesterday represented just \nthat.\n  As I look over yesterday, we completed 19 rollcall votes throughout \nthe day and evening. We had very few breaks. Chairman Nickles and \nRanking Member Conrad did a tremendous job in processing the amendments \nand bringing the resolution to completion. I thank them for their \nefforts.\n  As a reminder, the next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, March \n23. I will have more to say on the upcoming schedule at the close of \nbusiness today.\n  Mr. President, I have several unanimous consent requests. Would the \nDemocratic leader like to comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3915, which is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3915) to provide for an additional temporary \n     extension of programs under the Small Business Act and the \n     Small Business Investment Act of 1958 through April 2, 2004, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the approval of \nH.R. 3915, a bill adopted by the House yesterday to provide a short-\nterm extension of the Small Business Administration, SBA, and all of \nits programs. In particular, it ensures the continuation of the SBA's \n504 loan program, a vital program for small businesses. The bill \nextends the authorization for the 504 loan program through May 21, \n2004, and extends the authorization for other SBA programs, such as the \nPreferred Surety Bond Program, and Small Disadvantaged Business \nProgram, and the SBA's cosponsorship authority, through April 2, 2004.\n  On September 26, 2003, the Senate unanimously approved the Small \nBusiness Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, \nS. 1375, which I introduced as the chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness. That bill provides for the 3-year reauthorization of the SBA \nand its small business programs, including the 504 loan program.\n  The reauthorization bill will continue the SBA's role in assisting \nAmerican small businesses to thrive and grow, through the agency's \nlending and other programs and services. Most importantly, it will \nenable the agency to help small businesses continue creating new jobs \nfor our economy. According to the SBA, reauthorizing the agency will \nresult in an estimated 3.3 million jobs created or retained over the \nnext 5 years.\n  While the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act provides for the continuation of these programs, \nthe other body continues to be delayed in its consideration of \nlegislation to reauthorize the agency. The SBA's programs that rely on \nappropriations have continued since the Commerce, Justice, State and \nthe Judiciary appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2004 was \nenacted. However, several of the SBA's programs and activities, such as \nthe 504 loan program, do not rely on appropriations. As a result, they \nare in jeopardy of shutting down without the bill before us today, and \nthat's a result America's small businesses simply cannot afford.\n  I am confident that we can enact legislation to reauthorize the SBA \nonce the other body has completed work on its version of the bill. In \nthe interim, we must ensure that the SBA can continue to offer the \nentire range of its programs to our Nation's small businesses, which \nare the driving force behind our current economic recovery.\n  The 504 loan program, one of the agency's flagship lending programs, \nallows small businesses to obtain long-term, fixed-rate financing to \npurchase land, buildings, or equipment. In the past 4 fiscal years, the \nSBA has provided guarantees for more than 20,000 loans through the 504 \nloan program, for a total of approximately $8.6 billion, and these \nloans have allowed small businesses to create or retain more than \n445,000 jobs.\n  The 504 program relies on fees charged to the program participants, \nrather than on Federal appropriations charged to the taxpayers, to fund \ntheir operation. Because the program relies on Federal funds, the SBA \nneeds legislative authorization to collect the fees that operate the \nprograms and ensure that they function at a zero subsidy rate.\n  I am also extremely concerned about the SBA's section 7(a) business \nloan program. I strongly believe that we must act to ensure that the \n7(a) program remains a source of long-term capital for small \nbusinesses, including those small businesses that need large loans. The \n7(a) program is currently suffering from a funding shortfall, as demand \nfor loans has exceeded the available appropriations this year, as it \nhas four times in the last 10 years.\n  In that regard, yesterday I introduced the Small Business Loan \nRevitalization Act, S. 2193. I was pleased to be joined in sponsoring \nthat act by my colleagues, Mr. Bond, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Coleman. With \nthe improvements contained in that act, I am confident that we can soon \nhelp the 7(a) program to once again provide the financing that small \nbusinesses so desperately need.\n  We must act today to ensure that the SBA and its programs continue. \nThe bill before us achieves that goal by extending the authorization \nfor the 504 program through May 21, 2004, and for the agency and its \nother programs through April 2, 2004. That will provide time for the \nother body to pass its legislation, for us to reconcile the \ndifferences, and for the President to sign a long-term reauthorization \nbill for the SBA.\n  This legislation is absolutely necessary for America's small \nbusinesses. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thereby \nensure that the SBA, and in particular the 504 loan program, will \ncontinue to serve small businesses and enable small businesses to \nobtain the financing they need, as they contribute so greatly to the \nrevitalization of our national economy.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about \nH.R. 3915 that will be considered by the Senate today. This bill \ncontains two temporary extensions of authority. One that is general, \nkeeping the Small Business Administration and its programs operating \nthrough April 2, 2004, and another that is specific to the SBA's 504 \nLoan Guarantee Program, keeping it operational through May 21, 2004.\n  I support this bill, and am relieved the 504 Loan Guarantee Program \nwill not lose its authority to keep making loans to small businesses \nthat are growing, creating jobs and helping our communities. However, \nthere are other serious problems concerning the SBA's 7(a) Loan \nGuarantee Program and Women's Business Centers that are urgent and \nshould be addressed before the Senate recesses tonight for a week. I \nintroduced a bill earlier this week, S. 2186, the SBA Emergency \nAuthorization Extension Act of 2004, which sets forth workable \nsolutions for those issues. At that time I urged my colleagues to take \nimmediate action and consider it. Senator Snowe also introduced a bill \nthis week, S. 2196, which addressed the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program \nfunding shortfall, which I support and would have supported as an \namendment to this extension. Like the small business community, I am \ndisappointed that the bigger solution for small business lending is \nbeing delayed another couple of weeks.\n  Some people think a couple of weeks can do no harm. But in the 7(a) \nLoan Guarantee Program, small businesses caught in the middle of the \nadministration's funding schemes might not make it. And the funding \nproblems will fester because it will operate at a more expensive cost \nthan if we enacted the temporary program changes that the lending and \nsmall business communities support and are strongly urging the Congress \nto adopt. Two weeks could mean about half a billion in lending. I \ndisagree with the administration's tactics and I hope that during\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nthis next brief extension they will work with the Senate and House \ncommittees to pass program changes that resolve these issues fairly, \neffectively and expeditiously. Their plan does not work and the small \nbusiness and lending communities are opposed to it. We need a plan that \ndoes.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve this as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3915) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2757-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 7 THROUGH MARCH 13, 2004, AS ``NATIONAL \n                    PATIENT SAFETY AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 320, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Graham of Florida, Snowe, Gregg, and others.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the resolution \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 320) designating the week of March 7 \n     through 13, 2004, as ``National Patient Safety Awareness \n     Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce \na resolution to recognize the week of March 7-March 14 as ``National \nPatient Safety Awareness Week'' with my colleagues and friends Senator \nSnowe, Senator Gregg, Senator Dodd and Senator Jeffords.\n  We know that patient safety is a paramount health care issue today: a \n1998 Institute of Medicine study shocked us with the fact that nearly \n100,000 Americans die each year from medical errors in our clinical \nsettings alone, which highlights both the gravity and emotion \nassociated with this complex challenge.\n  Some of us have experienced the tragedy of medical error, either \ndirectly or through a family member or friend. We are not unique; \nestimates show that about one in every 5 Americans has experienced a \nmedical error or has a family member who has experienced a medical \nerror.\n  In addition to the profound emotional cost of these errors, the added \nburden placed on an already overburdened health care system is equally \nprofound. The cost of medical care provided to correct an error, and \nthe lost wages for those whose recoveries are extended because of \nmedical errors is significant. The Institute of Medicine put a price \ntag of between $17 and $29 billion per year on the overall costs to our \neconomy and our citizens due to medical errors.\n  We can do better; indeed, we must do better. We can strengthen our \nefforts to apply proven safety techniques from other sectors and \nindustries that have developed a culture of safety, like the aviation \nindustry. By focusing on system changes, significant progress can be \nachieved in making our health care system safer.\n  As legislators, we have drafted a range of proposals to address and \nimprove the systems factors that lead to medical errors. As we think \nabout ways to create a safer health care system, we must continue to \nwork with healthcare professionals, patients and their families to \nensure our healthcare systems place an absolute premium on the safety \nof its patients. In this regard, Senator Snowe and I have introduced a \nbill to reduce medication errors in hospitals and skilled nursing \nfacilities. Other cosponsors of this resolution have supported \nlegislation that would create a voluntary reporting system. As we \nconsider these pieces of legislation, it is important to remember that \nmedical errors are a multifaceted problem to which there are multiple \nsolutions.\n  This resolution addresses another key element in our quest to make \nour health care system safer: that being to fuel the ``power of \npartnership'' between patients, families and healthcare professionals. \nThe ``power of partnership'' is the theme of this year's Patient Safety \nAwareness Week, sponsored by the National Patient Safety Foundation. \nOur recognition of National Patient Safety Awareness Week is an \nimportant addition to our efforts to create a safer health care system \nby promoting increased patient education and highlighting the \nimportance of partnership between healthcare providers and patients.\n\n  ``Patient Safety Awareness Week'' deserves the support of the United \nStates Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support this Senate \nResolution. While Patient Safety Awareness Week will not solve all the \nchallenges associated with medical errors, it does launch us on a path \nof progress, and brings us one step closer.\n  Through a bipartisan partnership we can highlight the importance of \npatient safety and the role of the patient and their families in \nachieving a safer health care system.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record as if read, without intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 320) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 320\n\n       Whereas patient safety is an issue of significant \n     importance to the United States;\n       Whereas 1 in every 5 citizens of the United States has \n     experienced a medical error or has a family member who has \n     experienced a medical error;\n       Whereas medical errors often have serious and profound \n     consequences;\n       Whereas it is estimated that injuries from preventable \n     medical errors cost the United States economy between \n     $17,000,000,000 and $29,000,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas more people die annually from medical errors than \n     from automobile accidents, breast cancer, and AIDS;\n       Whereas increased patient and provider education and \n     collaboration can help avoid medical errors;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine has stated that a \n     ``critical component of a comprehensive strategy to improve \n     patient safety is to create an environment that encourages \n     organizations to identify errors, evaluate causes and take \n     appropriate actions to improve performance in the future,'' \n     and further, that ``a more conducive environment is needed to \n     encourage health care professionals and organizations to \n     identify, analyze, and report errors without threat of \n     litigation and without compromising patients' legal rights'';\n       Whereas better systems can be implemented to reduce the \n     factors that lead to medical errors;\n       Whereas innovative educational and research programs are \n     being conducted by the National Patient Safety Foundation as \n     well as by other public and private entities to develop \n     methods for avoiding preventable injuries and to assess the \n     effectiveness of new techniques to increase patient safety; \n     and\n       Whereas education of the public on medical errors and the \n     factors that typically lead to medical errors empowers \n     patients to be more effective partners with health care \n     providers in the battle against preventable injuries from \n     medical errors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of March 7 through March 13, 2004, \n     as ``National Patient Safety Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2757-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2757-S2758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 309\n\n       Whereas today's youth are vital to the preservation of our \n     country and will be the future bearers of the bright torch of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas youth need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences such as child abuse, substance abuse and crime, \n     and they need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     Nation's youth;\n       Whereas the Safe Place Program is committed to protecting \n     our Nation's most valuable asset, our youth, by offering \n     short term ``safe places'' at neighborhood locations where \n     trained volunteers are available to counsel and advise youth \n     seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas the Safe Place Program combines the efforts of the \n     private sector and nonprofit organizations uniting to reach \n     youth in the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas the Safe Place Program provides a direct way to \n     assist programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach and community relations, as set forth in the Federal \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth Act guidelines;\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youth;\n       Whereas more than 700 communities in 42 States and more \n     than 14,000 locations have established Safe Place Programs;\n       Whereas more than 68,000 young people have gone to Safe \n     Place locations to get help when faced with crisis \n     situations;\n       Whereas through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the country each year more than one-half million \n     students learn that Safe Place is a resource if abusive or \n     neglectful situations exist; and\n       Whereas increased awareness of the program's existence will \n     encourage communities to establish Safe Places for the \n     Nation's youth throughout the country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of March 14 through March 20, 2004, \n     as ``National Safe Place Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to promote awareness of and volunteer involvement in \n     the Safe Place Programs, and to observe the week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2758-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STAR PRINT--REPORT 108-225\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this article describes ongoing political \nviolence and intimidation in Cambodia against democracy and human \nrights advocates and the oppressive environment in which these \ncourageous individuals work. Kem Sokha, Sam Rainsy, and all champions \nof freedom, have my respect and my support.\n  While I recognize their bravery and selflessness, I also hear their \nconcerns for their own safety. Tragically, the body count of peaceful \nadvocates murdered in the line of duty continues to grow. Alliance of \nDemocrats spokesman Sam Ung Bung-Ang is right on the mark in saying:\n\n       It's not a bloody step forward when we go from 1 million \n     dead [under the Khmer Rouge regime] to 200. Life is life, and \n     one murder is too many.\n\n  Caretaker Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party \nhave failed to uphold the rule of law or to create conditions conducive \nto the growth of democracy and prosperity. I add my voice to those \ncalling for new leadership in Cambodia.\n  Let me close by recognizing the work of the International Republican \nInstitute in Cambodia. For over a decade, through grenade attacks, a \ncoup d'etat, and several flawed elections, the institute has stood \nshoulder to shoulder with those struggling for freedom.\n  In such a hostile environment and witness to countless injustices, \nthe institute's Cambodia director, Jackson Cox, is right to ask of the \ninternational community: Where's the outrage?\n  It is past time the world's democracies stood up to champion liberty \nin Cambodia. While Cambodia may seem small and unworthy of the world's \nattention, we should not forget terrorism thrives in lawless and \nchaotic conditions, the very kind we find in Cambodia today. It is a \nwarning and a plea. I urge my colleagues to support reform in this \ntroubled land.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 29, 2004]\n\nCambodia's Rights Movement Faces Peril; Recent Slayings Renew Old Fears\n\n                         (By Rafael D. Frankel)\n\n       Phnom Penh, Cambodia.--On a recent trip to a village along \n     the banks of the Mekong River, Kem Sokha brought along not \n     only his trusted bodyguard but also a private American \n     security specialist.\n       Kem Sokha is not a politician, a big businessman, or a \n     diplomat, but a leader in Cambodia's fledgling human rights \n     movement. And he believes his life is in danger.\n       The recent brazen killings of a prominent labor organizer, \n     Chea Vichea, and several others affiliated with an opposition \n     political group have heightened the sense of lawfulness in \n     Cambodia, where murder is seen as a common political tool--\n     and the rich and powerful seem above the law.\n       The nation's police, judiciary, and elections institutions \n     are controlled by the ruling party, led by Prime Minister Hun \n     Sen, and many Cambodians and foreign aid workers have little \n     confidence that justice can be served.\n       ``I fear the killing fields in Cambodia are still open,'' \n     said Kem Sokha, president of the Cambodia Center for Human \n     Rights, referring to the place the genocidal Khmer Rouge \n     regime would kill its victims of torture from 1975 to 1979.\n       Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge member who deserted the \n     regime and joined the resistance, has maintained his grip on \n     power in one form or another for nearly two decades through \n     collaboration with Vietnam, military coups, and elections \n     deemed by international observers as lacking ``free and \n     fair'' standards.\n       The most recent elections, in July, saw the ruling \n     Cambodian People's Party win a majority of seats in \n     Parliament, but not the two-thirds required to form a \n     government. Since then, a tense political drama has heated up \n     between the CPP and the Democratic Alliance, made up of two \n     opposition parties. Although both sides talk of reaching a \n     settlement soon, the stalemate persists.\n       The government crisis has coincided with a wave of high-\n     profile murders the past few months.\n       Chea Vichea, 36, who was affiliated with the opposition Sam \n     Rainsy Party, was killed Jan. 22 in broad daylight in a \n     driveby shooting in Phnom Penh. A radio journalist, a famous \n     actress, and her mother--all associated with the Democratic \n     Alliance--were gunned down in a similar fashion.\n       Human rights workers and opposition leaders have seized on \n     what they called a questionable investigation into Chea \n     Vichea's killing, saying it shows the history of impunity \n     that has plagued Cambodia for decades is still prevalent. Two \n     suspects are being held; one accused police of beating him to \n     force a confession.\n       Accusations have been leveled by the opposition and \n     democracy organizations that the killings were intended as a \n     warning to opposition leaders to join the prime minister in a \n     government.\n       A ruling-party spokesman, Khieu Kanharith, rejected any \n     idea that the killings were ordered by members of his party, \n     saying the allegations were political ploys. ``If we wanted \n     to use violence, why wouldn't we have hit someone higher up \n     in the party?'' he said.\n       But outside of the government, the killings have raised \n     alarms.\n       ``They certainly appear to be politically motivated,'' said \n     Jackson Cox, the Cambodia director of the International \n     Republican Institute, an American organization that promotes \n     democracy around the world. ``The political situation here is \n     tense, and members of the opposition, both high and low, are \n     being murdered.''\n       The recent killings have foreign relief workers and many \n     Cambodian wondering whether Cambodia's development as a \n     democracy has foundered after making great strides since the \n     United Nations launched a $2 billion relief effort in 1992.\n       The government points out that Cambodia was rebuilding from \n     total disaster. While many problems remain, the political \n     situation is much less violent than in the past, Khieu \n     Kanharith said.\n       The opposition rejects such reasoning. ``It's not a bloody \n     step forward when we go from 1 million dead to 200,'' said \n     Sam Ung Bung-Ang, a spokesman for the Democratic Alliance. \n     ``Life is life, and one murder is too many.''\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\n       Development statistics paint a picture of slow progress. A \n     2003 UN report said Cambodia is still ranked 130 of 173 \n     countries on the Human Development Index. Other than Laos, \n     Cambodia has the lowest life expectancy and literacy rates in \n     the region, and the highest mortality rates for mothers and \n     young children.\n       ``With the economy now, state assets are war spoils, and \n     what we call `corruption' . . . is simply [the government] \n     running the country like a family business,'' said Sam \n     Rainsy, the main opposition party leader. ``If we continue \n     like that, we will go down the drain.''\n       Asked about the pace of Cambodia's development and human \n     rights record under the current government, the government \n     spokesman said more time and money were needed. (Cambodia \n     receives about $500 million annually from foreign donors.) He \n     also said Cambodia was being held to a higher standard of \n     democracy than its neighbors.\n       ``We don't have enough human resources,'' Khieu Kanharith \n     said. ``We've had a lot of assistance from donor countries. \n     If you want to blame someone, blame them.''\n       Many are now looking for the international community to \n     increase the pressure on the government. Although some U.S. \n     senators have criticized the government, reaction from most \n     foreign governments and development institutions, many of \n     whom provide the funding for Cambodia to function, has been \n     muted.\n       ``Where is the outrage?'' asked Cox, from the International \n     Republican Institute.\n       Meanwhile, the political stalemate had delayed the \n     convening of the long-awaited Khmer Rouge war-crimes \n     tribunal. Government and opposition politicians say the \n     tribunal would go forward once a government was formed.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is very \nclose to my heart, having spent most of my professional career fighting \nheart disease. I will start with a couple of facts people may or may \nnot know, and then make several points in terms of the importance of \nprevention.\n  Fact No. 1, as I travel around the country and talk, whether it is in \nthe field of medicine or as a policymaker, is that more women will die \nof heart disease this year than men. I say that and it is surprising to \nmany people because historically people thought because of the \ndifference in gender and hormonal conditions women would be protected \nfrom heart disease. But, again, more women will die of heart disease \nthan men. Indeed, each year 500,000 women--half a million people--die \nof heart disease in this country.\n  Heart disease is a big spectrum, and heart attack is about one-half \nof those deaths, a heart attack where there is blockage of blood flow \nto a part of a heart. That means more than one-quarter of a million \nwomen in the United States each year are struck down by this one \ndisease. In fact, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in this \ncountry.\n  Heart disease is at the top of the list--it is No. 1--and kills more \nwomen than the next seven causes of death combined. So we have the top \neight causes of death, with heart disease as the No. 1 diagnosis, and \nif we add up all the other seven, we still do not have as many as those \nwho die of heart disease.\n  As I speak right now, about 8 million women are living with some \nelement of heart disease, a potentially fatal condition. In my home \nState of Tennessee, nearly 200,000 women suffer with heart disease \nwhich has proved that heart disease affects all age groups. Mr. \nPresident, 73,000 women in Tennessee are living with heart disease \nunder the age of 64. So it is not just our elderly with heart disease.\n  This is an area in medicine that can respond to education, to public \ninformation, but there are few people today who are aware of how \nwidespread and how devastating heart disease is among women. We know it \nis among men, and we have seen the old images and the warning signs of \na clenched fist, centralized pain as if an elephant is stepping on your \nchest, and if we look at the old pictures used in public education, \nhealth education, programs and posters, almost always it is a man with \na clenched fist or grabbing both fists.\n  That imagery is played over to the point that most people do not \nrealize how serious this disease is in women. It is imperative that we \nget the word out, and I want to use this pulpit over the next 2 or 3 \nminutes to do just that.\n  I encourage people to learn what the causes of heart disease are, \nwhat the consequences of heart disease are, and what steps can be taken \nin order to lower the risk in terms of prevention because we know what \nthe risk factors are. We know there are certain things that can be \ndone, and if they are done, it minimizes the risk either of being \ndebilitated by heart disease or dying of heart disease.\n  The obvious things--again they need to be stressed because they are \nsimple to do, but you have to do them--are improving one's diet, taking \nregular, consistent, and moderate exercise. One does not have to overdo \nit, but it is regular, consistent, moderate exercise.\n  The addiction of smoking has so many people locked in its grasp. Some \nof our young people do start smoking, and then if they do start smoking \nthey have to work very hard to break that addiction. I say that again \nas a heart surgeon.\n  So many people I operate on--there are hundreds and hundreds of \npeople I speak to and educate who are not in the Senate, but being in \nthe operating room, opening up people's chests, taking veins out of the \nleg or from underneath the breast bone and hooking them on to the heart \nbecause of heart disease, that is strongly related to smoking. So if \none stops smoking, it is less likely they will have that heart disease, \nand less likely that they will have the heart surgery.\n  Preventive screening: There are preventive screening tests, things \nsuch as putting a blood pressure cup on the arm. In our recent Medicare \nbill that we passed 2 months ago, for the first time in Medicare we \nhave a routine physical exam so things such as hypertension can be \ndetected.\n  It is amazing in Medicare, the great program that we have today--but \none that needs to continue to be improved--that we did not have that \nbasic entry level physical exam, where heart disease can be detected, \nuntil under President Bush's leadership we passed this recent Medicare \nbill.\n  Sometimes heart disease strikes seemingly healthy women who may not \nhave ever had symptoms, who have no history of either being sick or in \npoor health in some way, who have those risk factors. It attacks people \nwho have not smoked as well.\n  That is what happened to a Memphis mother of three, Kathy Kastan, who \nat the age of 42 suffered a heart attack. She tells her story this way:\n\n       At 42 years old, I considered myself a healthy, optimistic \n     woman blessed with three healthy boys, a wonderful husband \n     and devoted friends. I have always been less than average \n     weight, a nonsmoker and have exercised my entire life. But \n     then I noticed that during exertion like biking or running or \n     swimming, that I would get strange symptoms like nausea, \n     turning pale, having shortness of breath. On occasion I would \n     get a tingling down my left arm and left sided shoulder pain. \n     But never once did I consider that I could have heart \n     problems. And then one day, in a blink of an eye my life \n     changed forever.\n\n  As it turned out, Kathy had a condition known as vasospasm, or vessel \nspasm, which is exactly what it says, where the vessels go into spasm \nand they squeeze down; therefore, not as much blood can get through \nthat vessel because of a contraction of coronary arteries. Coronary \narteries are the vessels that feed the heart. The heart needs to get \nthat blood, that nutrient, that oxygen because if there is obstruction \nof the blood flow going to the heart, the heart muscle does not work, \nand that is what we call a heart attack.\n\n  Kathy went through five procedures where stints were inserted in \nthese vessels. They are almost like a straw. If you can imagine, like a \nstraw the vessel is squished down, and the stint is put in to keep the \nvessel open so it cannot squeeze down even when it goes into vasospasm.\n  Then she underwent what is called a coronary artery bypass operation \nwhich does require opening the chest and taking a vein from the leg or \nan artery called internal mammary artery and hooking it on to the heart \nto bypass those vessels which contract down.\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  For 8 months, Kathy says she simply could not believe what was \nhappening to her. Remember, 42 years old, optimistic, healthy woman who \nhad been struck by this disease. She was young, she was active at the \ntime, and I quote:\n\n       When I had chest pain, I even began to doubt myself and \n     thought that maybe I was going insane.\n\n  Happily, Kathy is recovering and getting her life back to normal, and \nshe credits her family, her close friends, her doctor, and the \nprofessionals at WomenHeart, which is a national organization devoted \nto educating, advocating, and supporting women with heart disease. It \nhas been a tough road. There were days she could not even move from \nroom to room in her own house without suffering these crushing, \nexcruciating chest pains. She is getting the treatment she needs and \nagain, in her words:\n\n       I am back to being a mother who can take almost anything my \n     kids dish out.\n\n  Well, Kathy is one of millions of sufferers and, like Kathy, before \nthe heart attack many women do not even know they have a heart problem. \nThey only find it out when it becomes severe.\n  As majority leader of the Senate, and as a physician, as one who has \nspent his professional life studying that human heart and working in \nprograms of prevention as well as treatment of heart disease, I joined \nwith the President of the United States, President Bush, and First Lady \nLaura Bush, and other congressional leaders to launch what is called \nthe Heart Truth Campaign. It is vital that we raise awareness so women \nget the treatment they need and that they take the proper precautions \nso they never have to have that later treatment.\n  I encourage my fellow Senators to get the word out, to share \ninformation among themselves and among their own families, among their \nown communities and among their constituents back home to participate \nin educating the public about this very serious health issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night just before we closed I noted \nthe absence of our distinguished assistant Democratic leader, Senator \nReid. He was attending the funeral of one of his closest personal \nfriends. I come to the floor this morning just to talk for a couple of \nminutes about this remarkable individual.\n  Of course I am talking about a true American patriot and hero, \nMichael O'Callaghan. While we all mourn Governor O'Callaghan's passing, \nI am heartened that we here in this Chamber will continue to feel the \nimpact of this great man through the service of his protege and former \nstudent, Harry Reid.\n  The essence of Governor O'Callaghan's contribution is perhaps best \ncaptured by an effort he undertook in Nicaragua in 1996. He was in that \nwar-torn country to observe the elections that would mark its first \never peaceful transition of power between democratically elected \npresidents.\n  At 66, Governor O'Callaghan could have asked to observe elections in \nthe nation's capital or its second city, but he insisted on going north \nto the Honduran border to observe elections among some of the most \nmarginalized people in a country of marginalized people. He had to go \nthere--in a battered truck over rained-out roads--because, he said, \nthese were his people whom he had gotten to know in the 1980s, and he \nwanted to be there with them as they celebrated the democracy they had \nearned.\n  That determination and generosity of spirit marked Governor \nO'Callaghan's life. He was highly decorated, with the Purple Heart, the \nBronze Star with a V for valor, and the Silver Star, in the Korean war, \nduring which he lost a leg.\n  Aware of that bravery and personal strength, Sargent Shriver reached \nout to Michael O'Callaghan to make him a point man in President \nKennedy's and President Johnson's fight against poverty.\n  Also aware of that bravery and strength of character, the people of \nNevada made him their Governor from 1971 to 1979.\n  It was Harry Reid's awareness of O'Callaghan's bravery and character \nthat led me, with great pride, to recommend him just last month to \nserve on the Veterans Benefit Commission.\n  Governor O'Callaghan died last Friday morning doing what he did each \nand every morning of his life--attending daily mass before he went to \nwork at the Las Vegas Sun. He also fought for the poor and \ndisenfranchised--from Korea to Nicaragua to Nevada--each and every day \nof his life.\n  While we are saddened by the loss of Michael O'Callaghan, we can take \ncomfort in the knowledge that his generosity of spirit, his strength of \ncharacter, and his devotion to his State and country will not soon be \nforgotten, and that his values and commitment to public service live on \nin our colleague and his close friend, Harry Reid.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chaffee).

MARK McCLELLAN AND THE REIMPORTATION OF FDA-\n                      APPROVED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have finished our work on the budget \nresolution early this morning, I guess at 1:30 or so this morning. One \nof the last items of business that was conducted by the Senate this \nmorning was the clearing of the nomination of Dr. Mark McClellan. I \nwant to talk, just for a moment, about that issue.\n  As you know, I had put a hold on his nomination. I want to explain \nthe background of that hold and what happened last evening that allowed \nme to withdraw my hold on the nomination and allow his confirmation to \noccur.\n  First of all, Dr. McClellan is the head of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and he has been nominated by the President to run the \norganization that administers the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. It is \na very important position. It is an important position that he held as \nhead of the FDA, and the new position is also very important.\n  We had asked Dr. McClellan for some months to come to the Senate \nCommerce Committee and testify. The reason we did that is we have a \nvery significant debate in this country, and especially in this \nCongress, about the subject of the cost of prescription drugs.\n  We have had an abiding, lengthy debate here in the Congress about the \nprospect of importing prescription drugs: Medicines from Canada, for \nexample, are the same prescription drugs sold in this country--same \npill, put in the same bottle, made by the same company. The only \ndifference is that they are sold for a substantial discount in Canada \ncompared to the price U.S. consumers pay in this country.\n  The U.S. consumer pays the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs, so many pharmacists and individuals have a desire \nto import that identical drug for a lesser price from other countries. \nThey do this in Europe all the time. It is called parallel trading. If \nyou are in Spain and want to buy a prescription drug from Germany, you \norder it. If you are in Italy and want to buy a prescription drug from \nFrance, that is not a problem. So the trade in prescription drugs \nbetween countries in Europe occurs regularly. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee has heard testimony about it. There are no safety issues.\n  We have run into a problem because Dr. McClellan as head of the FDA \ndecided to wage an aggressive campaign to try to prevent the re-\nimportation of prescription drugs and to prevent the enactment of \nlegislation in Congress that would allow for the re-importation of \nprescription drugs. We asked Dr. McClellan to come to the Senate\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nCommerce Committee to discuss this issue, and he was also asked \nrepeatedly to testify in the House of Representatives. He repeatedly \nrefused to do so.\n  As a result, I put a hold on his nomination. It was not acceptable to \nme to move Dr. McClellan's nomination unless he was willing to come and \ntestify before the Congress on these issues.\n  Yesterday, Dr. McClellan did testify before the Commerce Committee. I \nand others, including Senator McCain, asked him a substantial number of \nquestions about these issues.\n  I had a long telephone conversation with Dr. McClellan last evening. \nI also had a conversation with the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices about these same issues. A couple of things happened as a \nresult.\n  No. 1, Dr. McClellan has given me a commitment that in his new \nposition, when he is asked to testify before the Congress, he is going \nto testify. That is an important principle for this Congress. We ought \nnot say to people: We will promote you even though you stiff us.\n  I use the term ``stiff,'' which is a term Senator McCain used \nyesterday at the hearing. That is exactly what had happened. Dr. \nMcClellan said he has learned from his confirmation experience and when \nasked to testify before relevant committees of Congress in the future, \nhe intends to do so. That is No. 1. That is an important step.\n  No. 2, when Dr. McClellan's name was cleared last evening, Senator \nFrist put this statement in the Senate Record:\n\n       Mr. President, I announce for the information of my \n     colleagues that, in consultation with the chairman of the \n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n     Senator Dorgan, Senator Stabenow, Senator McCain, Senator \n     Cochran, and other interested Senators, the Senate will begin \n     a process for developing proposals that would allow for the \n     safe reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.\n\n  What is the import of that? The majority leader of the Senate, for \nthe first time, has made a commitment: He wants to put together a group \nthat will develop proposals that will allow for the safe re-importation \nof prescription drugs. That is a change.\n  The question now is not whether we have some mechanism by which we \ncan import prescription drugs and, therefore, have access to the \nreduced prices. Instead, the question is how can we do that. The \nmajority leader used the word ``allow.'' ``Developing a process that \nwill allow for the safe reimportation of FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs.'' That is a significant change and a significant commitment. We \nwill no longer fight about whether this ought to happen. We will fight \nabout, perhaps, the mechanics of how to make it happen. And that is OK \nwith me.\n  I appreciate Senator Frist's statement and his commitment. Senator \nFrist and I spoke four or five times last evening about this before he \nput his statement in the Record.\n\n  Again, the majority leader has said that he commits to beginning a \nprocess that will develop proposals that will allow for the safe \nimportation of approved prescription drugs. That is a significant \nchange and a significant commitment. I appreciate the words and the \ncommitment of the majority leader.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, has also worked on this issue \nfor some long while. Senator Daschle is a supporter of re-importation \ndone under conditions that would provide for safety and also for \nsavings for American consumers.\n  Based on those two things--a commitment from Dr. McClellan that when \nasked to testify, he will testify, and also the commitment by Senator \nFrist to move towards developing proposals that will allow for the re-\nimportation of FDA-approved drugs--I lifted my hold and Dr. McClellan \nwas approved.\n  What we have accomplished in the last few days--Senator McCain, \nmyself, Senator Snowe, Senator Stabenow, and others--is a significant \nshift, and it will inevitably lead to a change in public policy that \nwill allow for the safe reimportation of FDA-approved drugs that will \nallow the American people to get them at a lower price. That is the \ngoal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his tireless efforts and for the success he has \nnow described. Without his persistent leadership, and the effort he has \nmade over the last couple of days, we would not be in the position we \nare today. I know I speak for senior citizens and certainly for the \nmembers of our caucus and many others who care deeply about this issue. \nHe has moved the process forward in quite a dramatic way in the last 48 \nhours. Were it not for his persistence and the leverage he had with \nregard to this nomination, we would not be in the position we are. I am \ngrateful to him for the work he has done.\n  As he has just noted, this definitely moves the ball forward. This is \na significant development that will once again allow the Senate the \nopportunity to consider the issue of drug reimportation in a meaningful \nway.\n  I have absolutely no doubt there is growing support for the efforts \nof the Senator from North Dakota and others who have been advocating \nfor drug reimportation. In the last couple of days, the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Lott, announced his change of position, and for good \nreason. I talked with him last night about his desire to be supportive \nof the effort. He, too, is troubled by the pharmaceutical rip-off that \nis now going on and the determination among drug companies to hold \nsenior citizens captive to high prices for prescription drugs. On a \nbipartisan basis, Senator Lott, and Republicans and Democrats alike, \nhave joined Senator Dorgan. This allows us, once again, to look at ways \nwith which to address the issue.\n  I commend the Senator for his success and applaud him for keeping the \nSenate's focus where it belongs: on bringing lower drug prices to \nseniors.\n  I also acknowledge his role in moving the McClellan nomination \nforward. This was a controversial nomination in some ways. I have been \nworking with the majority leader over the last couple of days to \nconsider the ramifications of either holding up the nomination or \nmoving it forward. I will have more to say in a moment about another \nvery disturbing bit of news that has just been released this morning.\n  But I think because of the extraordinary responsibilities that go to \nthe office of CMS Administrator, filling that position is something \nthat is important. I supported the effort to try to move this \nnomination forward in spite of some of the misgivings I have, as \ndescribed so well by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Let me say, though, that when we come back from the recess, I will \ncome to the floor to talk more specifically about nominations and the \nprocess that is currently being employed with regard to the \nconsideration of other nominees from this administration. Last night, I \nspoke with the distinguished majority leader about some of the concerns \nI have. There are now over a dozen Democratic nominees, some of whom \nhave been held for months by the administration. Their refusal to send \nthe nominations to the Senate has caused many of us to be concerned \nabout the fairness with which this process has been implemented. It \nwill be very difficult for us to move forward on nominees in the future \nif this matter is not resolved.\n  I have indicated to the majority leader that I will be providing him \nwith the names of those people who have not been given fair \nconsideration and whose names have been withheld. And whether it is in \nregard to judges or with regard to other executive appointments, there \nhas to be a reciprocal treatment of nominees.\n  If we are not able to move these nominees in the future, I think it \nwould be very difficult for us to at least consider all of those who \nare being given to us by the administration with an expectation that \nthey will be voted upon until this matter is resolved.\n  We will have more to say about that when we return from the week \nrecess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2761-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2761-S2762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MEDICARE DRUG BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to call attention to another \nmatter that just came to our attention this morning. There was a story \nfiled by the Knight Ridder news organization in the Miami Herald, by \nTony Pugh. The Miami Herald and other papers have had this story now on \nthe Internet. I wanted to read a piece of it:\n\n       The government's top expert on Medicare costs was warned \n     that he would be fired if he\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\n     told key lawmakers about a series of Bush administration cost \n     estimates that could have torpedoed congressional passage of \n     the White House-backed Medicare prescription drug plan.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota was just addressing this issue. \nObviously, the reimportation plan was part of the Medicare legislation, \nand had we been able to pass a meaningful reimportation provision, we \ncould have brought down costs.\n  Again, quoting from a report copyrighted by the Miami Herald:\n\n       When the House of Representatives passed the controversial \n     benefit by five votes last November, the White House was \n     embracing an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that \n     it would cost $395 billion in the first 10 years. But for \n     months the administration's own analysts in the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services had concluded repeatedly that \n     the drug benefit could cost upward of $100 billion more than \n     that.\n       Withholding the higher cost projections was important \n     because the White House was facing a revolt from 13 \n     conservative House Republicans who had vowed to vote against \n     the bill if it cost more than $400 billion.\n       Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina, one of the 13 \n     Republicans, said she was ``very upset'' when she learned of \n     the higher estimate.\n       ``I think a lot of people probably would have reconsidered \n     [voting for the bill] because we said that $400 billion was \n     our top of the line,'' Myrick said.\n       Five months before the November House vote, the \n     government's chief Medicare actuary had estimated that a \n     similar plan the Senate was considering would cost $551 \n     billion over 10 years. Two months after Congress approved the \n     new benefit, White House Budget Director Joshua Bolten \n     disclosed that he expected it to cost $534 billion.\n       Richard Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, which produced the $551 \n     billion estimate, told colleagues last June that he would be \n     fired if he revealed numbers relating to the higher estimate \n     to lawmakers.\n       ``This whole episode, which has now gone on for 3 weeks, \n     has been pretty nightmarish,'' Foster wrote in an e-mail to \n     some of his colleagues June 26, just before the first \n     congressional vote on the drug bill. ``I'm perhaps no longer \n     in grave danger of being fired, but there remains a strong \n     likelihood that I will have to resign in protest of the \n     withholding of important technical information from key \n     policymakers for political reasons.''\n       Cybele Bjorklund, the Democratic staff director for the \n     House Ways and Means health subcommittee, which worked on the \n     drug benefit, said Thomas Scully--then the director of the \n     Medicare office--told her that he ordered Foster to withhold \n     information and that Foster would be fired for \n     insubordination if he disobeyed.\n  The vote on this Medicare legislation was one of the most critical \ndecisions Congress had made in 40 years on Medicare. We are talking \nabout a difference of more than $150 billion. What this article states \nis that key members of the administration were told they would be fired \nif they told Congress the truth. I think this is one of the most \nreprehensible actions that I have seen since coming to Congress.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how such irresponsible \nbehavior could be condoned, could be allowed. We will get to the bottom \nof this. But I think it calls into question how laws are made. It \ncertainly calls into question what efforts may now be made by the \nadministration to keep information on other issues from Congress, \nbefore we make critical decisions.\n  I think we ought to bring this bill back for another vote. I think \nthe House and the Senate deserve to have a vote based on all of the \ninformation, not just part of it. If this and perhaps other information \nwas withheld, Members of Congress were called to vote under false \npretenses. They were called to vote without having the truth. On an \nissue with these repercussions, we have no other choice but to revote \nthis issue.\n  Already, the Congress has tried to offer corrections to the bill. \nBills have been offered and amendments suggested to try to correct many \nof the problems created by this bill. But now we know, based on the \ninformation provided in this article, that not only are there \nsignificant policy questions, but the very issues provided to Congress \nas fact before were, in fact, untruthful misrepresentations upon which \nCongress voted mistakenly.\n  So we are going to have to review the available options that we have, \nwith regard to how this happened and what ought to be done. I think an \ninvestigation of some kind is certainly warranted. Whether this is \ncriminal or not is a matter that we will certainly want to clarify. But \nif not criminal, it is certainly unethical.\n  I think we need to know the facts. How did this happen? Why did it \nhappen? Are there precedents for things like this happening for which \nthe situation called for another vote? As close as that vote was, in \nthe dead of night, I think we owe it to the American people, we owe it \nto seniors, to reconsider these votes and question whether or not we \ncan put in place some absolute guarantee that this will never happen \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, following the comments of my colleague, \nthis is a shameful thing to have had happen and to read about. It \nbreaks the bonds of trust that exist in this town. This is a political \ntown, so we expect politics, but not in the context of information \ngiven us by agencies that are inherently nonpolitical and are supposed \nto give us good information with which to make public judgments and \npolicy. I agree fully with my colleague. This not only breaks the bonds \nof trust, but it is a shameful and disgusting thing to read in a paper \nthis morning. My hope is that it is fully investigated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2762-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2762-S2763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM TESCHER\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on another subject, I will now make some \ncomments about a North Dakotan who has died. I want to do this for a \nvery special reason. I think his passing needs to be noted by us.\n  Willie Nelson has a song called ``My Heroes Have Always Been \nCowboys.'' Out in my part of the country--I grew up in western North \nDakota--we understand Willie Nelson's music and lyrics and what his \nsongs mean. Willie Nelson really gave voice, with ``My Heroes Have \nAlways Been Cowboys'' to a way of life--about rodeos, ranch life, 10-\ngallon hats, pickup trucks, sweet clover, wild horses, newborn calves, \ngoing to town on Saturday night, good neighbors, strong families, and \nliving free.\n  I grew up in a small area of western North Dakota. My dad was a good \nhorseman. He raised horses. When I was a young boy, we went to rodeos. \nWe did not have professional sports. We did not have Major League \nBaseball or the National Football League. We went to rodeos.\n  I recall as a young boy going to the rodeos in all the small towns in \nNorth Dakota, but also going to the National Western Livestock Show in \nthe coliseum in Denver, CO. Cy Tallon was the announcer, one of the \ngreat rodeo announcers in our country. He would announce, ``Coming out \nof chute No. 2, Jim Tescher from North Dakota.''\n  We had cowboys who were the best in the world--Jim Tescher, Tom \nTescher, Alvin Nelson, Duane Howard, Dean Armstrong--tops in the world. \nI remember how proud I had been hearing these North Dakotans being \nintroduced at the National Western Livestock Show--saddle-bronc riders, \nbareback riders, and bull riders. They were the best in the world--\ntough, good people and champions.\n  Last month, one of them died. In a cemetery in the Badlands of North \nDakota up on a hill, his casket sat to be buried. His name was Jim \nTescher. He came from a ranch in the Badlands of North Dakota. He rode \nin rodeos in Madison Square Garden, the Boston Garden, and the Cow \nPalace. He won the saddle-bronc riding in the National Finals Rodeo \ntwice. He was a real champion. He went for 2 years at one stretch as a \nprofessional RCA cowboy without being bucked off a saddle-bronc horse. \nThink of that: 2 years without being bucked off a saddle bronc riding \nin rodeos.\n  His first love was the ranch, the cows, and the horses, so he rodeoed \nwhen he could. He didn't rodeo as much as some of the others, but when \nhe did, he was a winner. After a long rodeo career, he returned to his \nranch to live in the Badlands.\n  Last summer, he was driving a little four-wheeler out in the Badlands \nto check on some cattle and it tipped, fell down a cliff, and pinned \nhim and paralyzed him from the neck down. I went to visit him at \nThanksgiving time in the hospital in Mandan, ND. Jim was lying in his \nhospital room paralyzed. He said to me that what he really wanted to do \nwas try to get back to the ranch and the Badlands and look out\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nthe picture window and see his cattle once again.\n  On December 23, they put Jim in a wheelchair and wheeled him down to \nthe front door of the hospital wrapped in a blanket. Unbeknownst to \nhim, his daughter had fetched his horse Bonner, a horse just over 20 \nyears old. Bonner had been with Jim all of his life. She brought his \nhorse Bonner in from 180 miles away. She hauled him in a horse trailer.\n  His daughter had Bonner standing behind a tree. They wheeled Jim out \nin a wheelchair and led Bonner out from behind the tree. This horse had \nnot seen his master for about 5, 6 months. Jim could not lift his \nhands, but he made that clicking sound with his mouth that cowboys make \nto their horse, and Bonner walked over and nuzzled him on the nose. He \nstill knew Jim after 6 months in the hospital. Jim had tears in his \neyes that day.\n  About 4 days later, Jim died, and on January 3, a group gathered in \nthe cemetery in the Badlands to bury him. This picture which was in the \nCowboy Chronicle in North Dakota shows a man named Brad Gjermundson, \nalso a North Dakotan, a four-time world saddle bronc champion rider. He \nrode to that cemetery following the hearse leading Jim's horse Bonner. \nAs Jim was to be buried that day in a coffin decorated with his well-\nworn cowboy boots, some spurs, a rope, and some cedar from the \nBadlands, the cowboys from North Dakota gathered around to pay their \nlast respects.\n  This picture shows a lonely horse watching his master being put away. \nWhen I saw that picture in the Cowboy Chronicle, I knew I wanted to \nshare with my colleagues the fact that this country has lost a really \ngreat champion, a champion rodeo rider, but also a champion human \nbeing.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once lived in those Badlands, and Teddy Roosevelt \nonce said: Cowboys don't walk real well; that's because they do most of \ntheir work in the saddle. He could have said: Cowboys don't talk much \neither; they just love their country, they honor family values, and \nthey live free. And that describes Jim Tescher's life. He, in my \njudgment, is one of those real American heroes, a North Dakota \nchampion, and our State will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Next Monday, March 15, the Senate will be in recess. As \nJulius Caesar could tell you, the Ides of March is a good day to be far \nfrom the Senate Chamber, but this Ides of March the Senate family has \nsomething to celebrate: the 25th anniversary of Marty Paone's service \nto the Senate Chamber.\n  The Senate is not the simplest of institutions. The rules and \ntraditions that govern our work can seem baffling even to the most \nexperienced legislator. Marty has the most comprehensive understanding \nof the rules and procedures of the Senate of anyone I have ever known.\n  We may lose an issue because we do not have the votes, but in my time \nin the Senate we have never lost an issue on procedural grounds. In \nfact, we have even won a few, and when we do, it is thanks to Marty's \nextraordinary knowledge and unerring counsel.\n  He not only knows what the rules are, but how they serve the greater \npurpose of maintaining the Senate's unique role within our democracy. \nThis innate understanding has come as a result of a quarter century of \ndedicated service to the Senate and our Nation.\n  Marty was born in Everett, MA, and is a graduate of Boston College. \nAfter graduation, he made his way to Washington to attend graduate \nschool at Georgetown University. It was while working on his master's \ndegree in Russian studies that he first came to Capitol Hill. While \nattending school, he worked in the House post office and later moved to \nthe Senate parking office. In 1979, Marty joined the staff of the \nSenate Democratic cloakroom. A few years later he joined the Senate \nDemocratic floor staff, and in 1991 became assistant secretary for the \nminority. In 1995, he was elected by the Democratic Caucus to the \nposition he holds today, secretary for the minority.\n  Each of us knows that the Senate has its own peculiar schedule that \nis unpredictable at best, but no one knows that better than Marty. \nTwenty-one years ago, while planning his wedding, he and his fiancee \nRuby, who is also a member of the Senate family, pored over the \ncalendar looking for a date that they could be certain the Senate would \nbe out of session. They chose Veterans Day and made their plans.\n  Perhaps predictably, the Senate held a rare Veterans Day session that \nyear, and Marty did what he has seldom done in his 25 years, he \nactually missed a day of work. Fortunately, the Senate adjourned early \nenough for Marty's colleagues to share in his and Ruby's joy that day \nand make the wedding.\n  Fitting one's family life around the peculiar schedule of the Senate \nis never easy. It takes a lot of patience, a good sense of humor, \nqualities that Marty has in abundance. We are grateful to him, his \nfamily, his wife Ruby, and their children Alexander, Stephanie, and \nT.J., for sharing their husband and father with us.\n  During his time in the Senate, Marty has shown unequaled dedication \nand loyalty to our institution and to the men and women who serve here. \nAs a result, he has won the trust of every Senator and every staff \nperson who has ever had the honor of working with him.\n  Thanks to his experience, every Senator is better able to serve his \nor her constituents and the Senate is better able to serve the needs of \nthe American people. We owe him an extraordinary debt of gratitude. \nThere is no one I know who has more respect and affection for the \nSenate as an institution than Marty. On behalf of the entire Democratic \nCaucus, I thank him for his service of 25 years.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on February 27, I spoke on the floor \nabout the administration's new policy on landmines. It is a policy that \nsome in the administration had leaked to the press the day before it \nwas to be announced. And many believed it was being done to give it the \nmost positive spin possible.\n  The reason I want to take some time to discuss it just prior to this \nrecess is some Senator may be asked about it. I want them to know what \nthe policy does and what it does not do.\n  The centerpiece of the policy is the administration's announcement \nthat they will eliminate, in 6 years, all persistent or ``dumb'' \nlandmines that remain lethal indefinitely.\n  First, let me say that any decision by this or any other \nadministration to eliminate any type of landmine is a positive step. I \nconcur with the administration on this. These indiscriminate weapons do \nnot belong in the arsenal of the world's only superpower. Actually, \nthey do not belong in the arsenal of any civilized nation. They do not \ndifferentiate between a child and a soldier. They are inhumane. They \nshould be banned.\n  I have traveled to many parts of the world, sometimes in places where \nwe use the Leahy War Victims Fund. I have seen those who have been \ncrippled and disfigured by landmines.\n  My wife is a nurse. Before she retired, she was on a medical surgical \nunit. She has gone into some of the surgery wards in these countries \nwhere a child had a limb blown off, and it had to be reamputated to fit \na prosthesis. It is terrible. And while there are military people on \neither side who are injured or killed, it is usually civilians. The \nvast number are civilians.\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\n  So the fact that the administration is pledging to get rid of these \nso-called dumb mines, including anti-vehicle dumb mines--albeit not \nuntil 2010--that is constructive. It sets a good example.\n  But what was not said in the press release, of course, is that the \nUnited States has not used this type of landmine for decades. We have \nnot even used them in Korea along the demilitarized zone.\n  We have stockpiles of these mines around the world, but they are \nwidely recognized by our military as posing not only an unacceptable \ndanger to civilians, but also to our own troops. Once these mines are \nin the ground, they impede the mobility of our own forces. I cannot \nimagine any combat officer--certainly none trained by the United \nStates--who would support using these indiscriminate weapons in this \nday and age.\n  So the bottom line is that the administration is saying: Since we do \nnot use these mines, have not used these mines for decades, we will get \nrid of them, and we want the world to credit us for that.\n  Well, that is sort of like saying we are going to stop using leaded \ngasoline in the United States to reduce air pollution. Of course, we \nhave not used leaded gasoline for years, so it really is not an issue.\n  What the administration says is that its new policy will ``help \nreduce humanitarian risk and save the lives of U.S. military personnel \nand civilians.'' But insofar as we do not use these mines, and have not \nused them for years, the claim is meaningful only to the extent that we \ncan convince other nations to stop using them.\n  Now, to do that, the administration says it will seek a worldwide ban \non the sale or export of dumb landmines. That is a positive \nannouncement. But is it realistic?\n  We tried this back in 1994. We got nowhere because other nations \nrefused to even discuss giving up their mines if we refused to give up \nours. I have yet to hear anybody say why they believe the reaction of \nother nations, such as China, Russia, Pakistan, and India, is going to \nbe any different this time.\n  After 2 years of reviewing the landmine policy, we say we are going \nto eliminate the mines we no longer use. But what the administration \nglosses over is that it has abandoned the key pledges the Pentagon made \n6 years ago to phase out all antipersonnel mines outside of Korea by \n2003, and in Korea by 2006. That would mean all the mines would be gone \nnow, outside of Korea; and in Korea, the year after next. That used to \nbe U.S. policy, until February 27.\n  That commitment included not only dumb mines but also self-\ndestructing mines. And the commitment to find suitable alternatives to \nreplace these self-destructing mines was painstakingly negotiated in \n1998 between myself and the White House and the Pentagon.\n  The administration now defends its decision to abandon the pledge to \nphase out these weapons on the grounds that ``after they are no longer \nneeded on the battle field, [these mines] detonate or turn themselves \noff, eliminating the threat to civilians.'' They say ``self-destructing \nlandmines have been rigorously tested and have never failed to destroy \nthemselves or become inert within a set time.''\n  Now, these self-destructing mines, these mines with timers, do pose \nless of a danger to civilians. If the world only used this type of \nmine, we would still have casualties of civilians, but there would be \nfar fewer.\n  But it is not that simple. For one thing, the mines are also dumb. \nOnce activated, they cannot distinguish between an enemy soldier and a \nfleeing refugee or a child trying to get out of harm's way any better \nthan any other dumb mine.\n  If they are touched, they will explode. You could be the farmer \ntrying to get his animals out of harm's way because a war is going on. \nThese mines cannot distinguish between the farmer and an enemy gunner.\n  Secondly, we have only used this type of mine once and that was in \nthe first Gulf War. We used them there because we had assurances from \nthe Pentagon that they had been well tested and they would self-\ndestruct so we did not have to worry about them.\n  Guess what. After that war, U.S. and British deminers discovered \nthousands of these mines that had not self-destructed as designed. They \nstill needed to be disarmed. In fact, I had one leader in combat in the \nfirst gulf war who said: We did use them.\n  I said: Did you trust them to self-destruct?\n  He said: Heck no. Neither I nor anybody under my command would dare \nsend our troops across a field where we have been told all these mines \nhad self-destructed because we knew that a certain number of them would \nnot.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, by insisting we will continue to use \nour more expensive self-destructing mines, which the administration \ndoes, we give other nations an excuse to continue to use their cheap \ndumb mines. I don't know how many times I have talked to officials of \nother nations. I have said: Why don't you stop using land mines?\n  They have asked me: How can you, the most powerful nation history has \never known, tell us we should give up our land mines when you say you \ncan't give up yours?\n  There is no answer to that.\n  There was strong opposition in the Pentagon when we passed my \namendment--finally, in the end, every single Senator voted for it--\nwhich banned the export of anti-personnel land mines. Now the Pentagon \nand everybody else brags about the step forward we took in banning the \nexport of land mines. It was a good step. But when we had a chance to \njoin the Ottawa process to ban these mines once and for all, we stepped \nback from it. And because of that, we made it easy for Russia and \nChina, other countries, to do so.\n  In fact, I believe in our hemisphere there are only two countries \nthat don't ban land mines--the United States and Cuba. Everybody else \nhas. In fact, 150 nations, including every member of NATO except the \nUnited States, has joined the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel \nmines.\n  It is arrogance for our country to take such a unilateral attitude, \nfor us to say: We know it is for your own good, get rid of land mines, \nbut we won't.\n  Many times on this floor I have talked about flying in a helicopter \nalong the Honduras-Nicaragua border at the height of the contra war. I \nstopped at a hospital on the Honduras side, an area carved out of the \njungle. It was a very rudimentary hospital, with a small, separate unit \nfor an operating room that was air-conditioned and sterile. The \nhospital part had a dirt floor, barracks, row after row of cots, in the \ncorner, just some blankets.\n  A young boy stayed there, 12 years old or so. He had been living \nthere for years since he lost his leg. He hobbled around on a homemade \ncrutch. He was a peasant child who could not go to work in the jungle \nand help his family to get food because he was not up to it. He \ncouldn't climb the steep trails. He had been out looking for food when \nhe stepped on a land mine.\n  I asked him whether it was put there by the Sandinistas or the \ncontras. He didn't know who they were. He didn't even know there was \nanother country just over the mountains called Nicaragua. But he did \nknow his life was changed. Unlike those of us who are privileged to \nserve in this body where, if we lost a leg we could continue to do our \nwork, be paid the same, there would be some inconveniences, but we \nwould make it. Not he. If he didn't have the floor of the hospital \ndormitory and if he didn't have the medics to give him some food, he \nhad no place to go. There are thousands of people--thousands of \nchildren--like that.\n  After that, we started the Leahy war veterans fund, which to the \ncredit of our Nation, does use $12 million a year to buy artificial \nlimbs, wheelchairs, and other assistance for war victims. We have \npassed a law to ban the export of land mines.\n\n  But it is like trying to stop a flood. As long as people continue to \nmake them, continue to use them, they are out there. We can't bring \nmore pressure on China, one of the big makers and exporters of land \nmines, because they say, rightly so, the U.S. still uses them.\n  It is so frustrating. I come from a beautiful State, as does the \nPresiding Officer. I have hundreds of acres of my tree farm, wonderful \nfields and hills and mountain trails on which I can walk. My children \nand grandchildren do. It is so much fun. All you worry about is that \nyou might trip and skin\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nyour knee. You don't have to worry about a land mine.\n  Somebody said to me in one of these countries, when they were asking \nabout land mines and why we didn't do more in the United States to get \nrid of them: How long would it take you in the United States to ban \nthem if your children had to go to schools where they were told, you \nwalk exactly between these two lines because, if you step over it, you \nmight have your legs blown off? Or if you are like the teenage girl in \nBosnia whose family sent her away at the beginning of the war so she \nwould be safe and finally got word to her that it is safe to come back \nand she was running to her family and stepped on a mine. Her legs were \nblown off. I saw that young woman and talked with her in a hospital \nwhere the Doctors Without Borders and the Leahy War Victims Fund were \nhelping her and other mine victims.\n  If this was happening in Washington down on The Mall, if this was \nhappening on the playgrounds of America, we would be rising up and \nsaying: Get rid of these things.\n  I have talked about this so many times that I am like a broken \nrecord. But I will keep talking about it as long as I am in the Senate. \nI will keep pushing and I will keep traveling around the world working \nwith people who want to get rid of landmines. I will keep raising money \nfor landmine victims, and I will keep trying to get rid of landmines.\n  I hope someday this wonderful country of ours, which I love and every \none of us loves so much, will stand up and say: Enough. We will, by our \nown example--not by unilateral arrogance saying you get rid of them, \nbut we won't--use the moral suasion of our Nation and get rid of \nlandmines. Maybe then others will, too.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2765-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be wrapping up here in about 15 or \n20 minutes.\n  Seeing the Presiding Officer, who is from Tennessee, I want to pull \nout something which I find remarkable. It doesn't have anything to do \nwith Senate business, but it does have something to do with the State \nwhich the Presiding Officer represents and which I represent. In fact, \nit is a historic sort of message. The bottom line is very simple. It \nhas to do with saying ``thank you'' and the thoughtfulness of saying \n``thank you.'' I will take a very few minutes to recount this \nfascinating story.\n\n  In the 2003 annual report of Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated, a \nreport that was released to shareholders on Saturday, March 6, there \nwas a fascinating item that piqued my interest. Berkshire Hathaway is \nthe $42 billion dollar firm led by someone who is considered to be the \ngreatest stock market investor of all times, Warren E. Buffet. I call \nthe annual report to your attention because it contains an unusual \nstory involving 40 students and a professor from the University of \nTennessee.\n  For the last 5 years, Professor Auxier has led his finance class on a \nfield trip from Knoxville, TN to Nebraska to meet that legendary oracle \nof Omaha, as Mr. Buffet is known. The meetings there would last as long \nas 2 hours as students would have and took advantage of that \nopportunity of peppering the investor with questions on everything, \neverything from finance to life lessons, to mentors, to instances or \noccurrences or events that shaped his life. At the end of each meeting, \nthe group presents Mr. Buffet with a gift of appreciation, a gift of \nthank you for taking the time to share his thoughts with them.\n  Professor Auxier tells my office his pupils always leave, as we might \nexpect, exhilarated and inspired. At last year's meeting, the Tennessee \ngroup presented Mr. Buffet with an autobiography of Knoxville home \nbuilder Jim Clayton. The book made sense. It was from their hometown of \nKnoxville, TN, where the University of Tennessee is located. They left \nthis as a thank you.\n  This would not be particularly noteworthy except for the fact Mr. \nBuffet became so interested in Jim Clayton's story and his successful \nventure--Jim Clayton's successful venture called Clayton Homes--that \nMr. Buffet turned around and bought the Knoxville company for $1.7 \nbillion. He closed that deal last October.\n  Now the story gets even better. Mr. Buffet was so appreciative of the \nstudents who had come to visit him to share his thoughts with them, \nputting him on to Clayton Homes investment through this very simple \ngift, so this past October he presented each of them with a share of \nclass B stock in his company. The shares are now worth roughly $3,100 \neach. He also gave the professor a share of his class A stock which was \nworth, as of yesterday, $94,700. Professor Auxier tells my office when \nMr. Buffet unveiled these surprise gifts, everyone was simply, using \nhis words, flabbergasted.\n  All of this is recounted in Mr. Buffet's annual report to his \nshareholders. Those shareholders now include those 40 very lucky \nstudents and a tremendously appreciative professor from the University \nof Tennessee.\n  I believe there are two lessons to be learned from this delightful \nstory. The first is to be interested in other people. We all, no matter \nhow busy we are, should take advantage of that opportunity to share \nexperiences with others. It also shows Mr. Buffet was interested in \nother people, the fact that he took this book and he actually read it. \nIt was an autobiography of a fellow businessman, indeed, a long way \nfrom his home. He was so impressed he turned around and ended up buying \nthe company for $1.7 billion.\n  The students took that opportunity--it is not always easy to go all \nthe way from Tennessee out to Nebraska--to avail themselves of meeting \nthe world's renowned expert in the field. They had the good fortune of \ngetting his advice. What they did not expect is to get that additional \nper person $3,100. Now they are that much richer for the experience.\n  That brings me to the second lesson and then I will close, and that \nis what I opened with. Make sure you always give a thoughtful thank-you \npresent. It is the right thing to do. You never, ever know where it \nmight lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2765-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2765-S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONFIRMATION OF DR. McCLELLAN, MEDICARE AND DRUG REIMPORTATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, early this morning, in fact, a little over \n12 hours ago in the Senate, Dr. Mark McClellan became administrator for \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their cooperation over the course of that whole week, \nthis past week, in order to facilitate the confirmation of Dr. Mark \nMcClellan.\n  I say that because the responsibilities of the CMS--again, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services--are that of being the \nGovernment organization responsible for Medicare and Medicaid in this \ncountry. These responsibilities are crucial. The administrator oversees \nthe program that provides health care coverage for over 70 million \npeople, including seniors, as we know, including individuals with \ndisabilities, with low-income children, with pregnant women--a huge \nresponsibility.\n\n  This becomes critically important because the challenges facing CMS \ntoday are greater than at any time in this agency's history. I say that \nbecause the head of that agency, now Dr. McClellan, will be charged \nwith implementing the Medicare Modernization Act and, in a very short \nperiod of time, educating seniors about the benefits of the new law, \nabout the advantages of the new law, and how they best can take \nadvantage of these new benefits.\n  It is going to take a strong and steady hand to get the job done. I \nam confident, and I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nexpressed that strong confidence, in Dr. McClellan. He has the skills, \nhe has the commitment, he has the temperament, he has the judgment, he \nhas the leadership abilities, all of which have been demonstrated in \nGovernment. He has served under both President Bush and President \nClinton in Government, and\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nalso in the private sector as a physician. President Bush nominated \nexactly the right person for this point in time.\n  I think the Medicare bill is a tremendous bill. It has tremendous \npotential to modernize Medicare, on a voluntary basis, where if people \nwant to take advantage of this newer, more modern, more up-to-date \nMedicare, they can or they can keep exactly what they have.\n  The legislation was bipartisan. It was signed by the President of the \nUnited States last year. If you just back away from it, it does--bottom \nline--what we know we have needed to do for a long time; that is, to \ngive seniors and individuals with disabilities better access to the \nmost powerful tool in American medicine today: prescription drugs, at \nlower out-of-pocket costs. That is it. And it is voluntary.\n  Beginning in a few months--this is, in part, a segue from Dr. \nMcClellan--seniors will be eligible for the savings of 10 to 25 \npercent, and low-income seniors will receive an additional $600 in \nvalue in additional assistance through the Medicare-endorsed \nprescription drug cards.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet this week with a number of outside \norganizations, including the AARP, where we have talked about the \nimportance of educating seniors appropriately so they can take \nadvantage of these new expanded benefits.\n  There is a whole range of other benefits in this new, modernized \nMedicare Program--and we talked a lot about it on the floor--including \ndisease management; chronic disease management; improving preventive \ncare, so we can make the diagnosis of things such as hypertension for \npeople who come of Medicare age; improving the efficiency and safety of \nMedicare through electronic prescribing, to eliminate the potential of \nso many errors that can be made through so many steps that currently \nthe prescription of medicines travel; significant regulatory relief.\n  You put those two together--with Mark McClellan as the person who \nwill be responsible for implementation, with what is a complex system \nbut one that takes action now--and I think we will have a very \neffective laying out of the benefits so people can take advantage of \nit.\n  Mark McClellan's background as a physician, as a doctor, I think will \nbe enormously helpful in translating these legislative reforms into \nlasting improvements that will give our seniors better health care \nsecurity. That, again, is sort of the bottom line. You want to be able \nto look seniors in the eye and say: You will be more secure in terms of \nyour health care with this bill. We know that is the case, but now it \nhas to be implemented. So I look forward to working with Dr. McClellan \nas he works to implement this new Medicare law. We build on what truly \nwas historic legislation to provide affordable, high-quality care to \nour seniors.\n\n  On the floor earlier today, and last night, and in some hearings with \nDr. McClellan yesterday, the whole issue of prescription drug \nreimportation has arisen, has been discussed, has been talked about. It \nis a very important issue, an issue that, as majority leader, I can \ntell you we will address. It deserves to be addressed.\n  We addressed it in the past by saying reimportation, under certain \nprescriptions and limitations. Reimportation is fine, but it is fine \nonly if we can demonstrate and guarantee safety; that is, we can tell a \nsenior, yes, you can have reimportation, say, from Canada, but you can \nsay that and allow it to happen only if you can look that senior in the \neye and say: You are going to be OK. The medicine you get will be \nexactly what is prescribed, with the same sort of safety certification, \nsafety guarantees you get with medicines that are manufactured in the \nUnited States.\n  Some of it--in fact a lot of it--is being driven by the fact we have \nthese skyrocketing costs in health care, which we have to address, we \nshould address, and it is our responsibility to address because they \ncannot be tolerated long term--whether it is by an individual who is \ntaking care of themselves or their children or their family members or \na business with skyrocketing health care costs which are driving the \ncost of doing business so high they no longer are competitive against \nother businesses in this country or businesses in other countries.\n  In fact, it ties to other discussions we have about outsourcing and \ninsourcing and jobs going overseas, because if the cost of doing \nbusiness gets so high here, and it is not high in other countries, you \nsimply are not going to be able to grow businesses here and people will \nshift businesses overseas. So we must address it. And we will address \nit.\n  Many people believe part of the skyrocketing costs can be addressed \nby addressing the reimportation of drugs. Indeed, in the Medicare law I \nwas just speaking to, we began to address this issue head on. We, in \nthat bill--a lot of people do not realize it--asked the administration \nto prepare a comprehensive report that would come back to us in the \nCongress to identify the myriad of critical issues that are raised by \nreimportation, including, first and foremost, patient safety.\n  As a physician, I am going to keep coming back to the patient's \nsafety, because unless we can look people in the eye and guarantee they \nare going to be safe through obtaining drugs from overseas, we cannot--\nwe just should not--proceed down that path.\n  Well, in response to the Medicare legislation, the administration has \nalready set up a task force. That task force has begun the process. We \nlook forward to receiving the findings from that task force.\n  Indeed, the public hearings will begin this coming week while we are \nin recess. I believe the first meetings are with outside consumer \ngroups that will come in and report to that task force. Then the task \nforce will report back to us.\n  I also believe the Senate can best--or should best--address this \nthrough the committee of jurisdiction. As majority leader, I have tried \nto focus on appropriate jurisdiction for the committees, and the \ncommittee for that is the committee that the Presiding Officer has \ntaken such a leading role on; that is, the HELP Committee, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, that is led by Chairman Judd \nGregg.\n  Through that committee of jurisdiction, we will begin to examine what \nbarriers do exist--and the safety barrier is one--to reimportation and \ndetermine, first, whether there are ways you can reduce those barriers, \nbut how you can reduce those barriers, how we should address those in a \nlegislative fashion, and then reduce those barriers legislatively, if \nwe need to.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Judd Gregg, chairman of the \nHELP Committee, and to reaching out broadly to all my colleagues--\nSenator Dorgan, who has taken a real lead on this; Senator McCain; \nSenator Stabenow; and Senator Thad Cochran, who has been the author of \nthe amendment we have used and addressed on the Senate floor, has been \na real leader in this field--on both sides of the aisle to address this \nvery important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2766-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2766-S2768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            S. CON. RES. 95\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this morning, an amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Ohio was accepted by voice vote. At the \ntime, I withheld from speaking on this amendment in order to expedite \nconsideration of the budget resolution, but I would now like to take a \nmoment to give my full statement.\n  This amendment addresses a serious shortfall in the President's \nforeign affairs budget: funding for international health programs.\n  I commend Senator DeWine for his leadership on these key humanitarian \nissues. Compared to some of the other amendments offered today, it is \nnot a large amount of money. But, it means life and death to literally \nmillions of people.\n  This amendment provides $330 million for the Child Survival and \nHealth Programs Fund. It is fully offset by reducing the amount that \nthe Federal Government spends on administrative expenses by $330 \nmillion.\n  This reduction will not be painful. We do not micro-manage the \nprocess, and leave it to the administration to determine where to make \nthese cuts. But, I can think of some places that the Administration \nmight want to start.\n  For example, next year the administration plans to spend $5.5 billion \non ``transportation of things''; $21.1 billion on ``supplies and \nmaterials'' for federal agencies--not including the Department of \nDefense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security; and about a billion \ndollars on printing costs.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  If you want specifics on how to pay for this, one could come up with \nthis scenario.\n  The administration is planning to increase the amount spent on \n``supplies and materials'' for the Departments of Agriculture, \nCommerce, Education, Energy, and Interior and the FDIC. Simply \nmaintaining the FY04 levels for these agencies yields $158 million. \nFreezing certain non-defense agencies' budgets for printing costs at \nthe FY04 levels, which would otherwise be increased, brings the total \namount of offsets to $173 million.\n  To get the remaining $157 million, one can freeze a number of \ncombinations of proposed FY04 increases for ``other services'' of non-\ndefense agencies. This includes, but is not limited to, increases to \nthe Departments of Commerce, Energy, the Judicial Branch, and the FDIC. \nThe portions of the government that I just listed total $365 million so \nthis is more than enough. When added to the ones listed above, this is \n$538 million in offsets.\n  The use of Function 920 to pay for these offsets, which are spread \nover a range of different functions, is appropriate in this case. This \nis the type of offset that Function 920 was established to accommodate.\n  These are not my numbers they are OMB's. I encourage my colleagues to \nread the Object Class Analysis documents for further information.\n  I could go on, but we get the point. There is enough flexibility in \nthis budget to do a tiny bit of belt tightening in order to save lives \noverseas, build goodwill towards the United States, and reduce the \nconditions--poverty, sickness, and despair--that help terrorists gather \nfresh recruits.\n  It may mean a few less paper clips or a few less glossy brochures, \nbut the savings will be well worth it.\n  The President's national security strategy recognizes the essential \nrole of foreign aid. But while we read about the importance of foreign \naid, we don't see it throughout the President's budget request.\n  Most of us have praised the President's budget for significant \nincreases for the Millennium Challenge Account--MCA--and to combat HIV/\nAIDS. However, I have serious concerns because a portion of these \nincreases are paid for by robbing other essential programs, like health \ncare and food aid. Our amendment would restore some of these cuts.\n  Putting AIDS aside, the President's budget cuts essential \ninternational health programs by 11.4 percent.\n  It would cut programs to combat other infectious diseases like \nmeasles, which kills 1 million children--not 100,000 or 200,000--but 1 \nmillion children each year. Measles can be prevented with a simple \nvaccine that costs pennies. Yet in many poor countries they cannot get \nit.\n  The President's budget would cut programs to combat measles and other \ninfectious diseases like SARS, ebola and malaria, by 24 percent.\n  The President's budget would cut programs for vulnerable children by \n64 percent. These programs help provide the basic necessities of life \nto orphans, street children, and children whose lives have been turned \nupside down by war.\n  Child survival and maternal health programs are also cut. These are \nthe programs that provide lifesaving child immunizations. They also \nhelp to reduce needless pregnancy-related deaths each year. Six hundred \nthousand women die from pregnancy related causes. Almost all of these \ndeaths could be prevented.\n  We should be moving aggressively to increase funding for these \nsuccessful programs--not reduce funding.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Over the past 6 years, Democrats and \nRepublicans have worked side-by-side to increase funding for \ninternational health. Funding for AIDS is going up, but it is going up \nat the expense of programs to combat other diseases which also cause \nmillions of deaths. Preventable deaths. And curable diseases. This is \nunacceptable.\n  We cannot save every life. Our international health budget is less \nthan the health budget of my own tiny State of Vermont. The President's \nbudget would cut it even more. Our amendment would at least protect \nthese programs from further cuts.\n  Less than 1 percent of the Federal budget is used to combat the \nconditions that cause poverty around the world. This is woefully \ninadequate. It shortchanges America's future. It invites insecurity.\n  One would have thought that if September 11 taught us anything, it \nwas that business as usual is no longer tolerable. As I have said \nbefore, the President deserves credit for the Millennium Challenge \nAccount and for increasing funding for HIV/AIDS.\n  But, I ask Senators to look behind the curtain to see these are \nfunded. Some is new money. Sadly, some is from cuts to other essential \nhumanitarian programs.\n  If we are going to lead, and especially if we are going to ask others \nto do more, we are going to have to stop playing shell games with the \nforeign aid budget. Leadership is good policy. Leadership means \nresources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, securing this nation's borders and keeping \nAmericans safe from terrorist threats is of the utmost importance to \nthis body. That is why I support the men and women who serve this \ncountry. Thousands of men and women are currently deployed in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and other parts of the world. We count on so many of these \nbrave men and women to protect our communities at a moment's notice and \nfor that, too, we thank them. We want them to come home safe to their \nfamilies, and to find good jobs and good healthcare waiting for them.\n  The State of Montana, known affectionately for its ``big sky'' and \nsmall population, plays a key role in protecting this nation. At the \ncore of this country's national defense is the ICBM program maintained \nby Malmstrom Air Force Base. This program must be fully modernized and \nI support Malmstrom's mission 100 percent.\n  Montana also shoulders a unique responsibility to protect this nation \ndue to the 600-mile land border--the equivalent distance of Washington, \nDC, to Chicago--we share with Canada. This border is porous and \ntopographically diverse and it constitutes the front line in the war on \nterrorism. We have to make sure we not only have enough agents at the \nborder, but that we get them the equipment and technology they need to \nsecure Montana's borders, and to head off any threats directed toward \npopulations and infrastructure anywhere else in the country.\n  Though not every state has an international land border it must \nsecure, every state has the sacred duty to protect the people who call \nit home. In the past 2\\1/2\\ years, the states, with federal assistance, \nhave made strides in emergency planning and terrorism preparedness. We \nneed to give our first responders the training, equipment, personnel \nand resources that they need. But we're not there yet and we've got to \nstay the course. That's why I joined 22 of my colleagues in the Senate \nin urging the Budget Committee to find a way to restore $1 billion \ndollars to the State Homeland Security Grant program that was cut from \nthe fiscal year 2005 budget. Montana's first responders rely almost \nentirely on this assistance for their terrorism preparedness efforts.\n  But that's not enough. We need to make sure that our state and local \nlaw enforcement get the funding they need if we expect them to protect \nour communities and prevent the threat of terrorism. How can we expect \nour communities to fight the war on terrorism if we aren't willing to \nfund it well enough to win?\n  The same people who prepare for the unthinkable terrorist plot must \nalso plan for nature's devastation, which our state knows all too well. \nThese brave people serve their communities and their nation without \nregard for the risks they take. We ought to be thanking them. We ought \nto get them the personnel and resources they need and I am committed to \nfinding the way to do that. The money needs to be there for coordinated \ncommunications for state, local and federal agencies, for fire fighters \nand emergency managers, so that they can save time and save lives in \nthe event of any disaster we'd rather not imagine.\n  Security in Montana is more than knowing our borders and communities \nare protected. It is also knowing that our children are receiving the \ntop notch education we have come to expect. Montana schools have made \ndo with too little for too long. It is access to affordable health \ncare. Unfortunately, access to health care remains a\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nchallenge for many, particularly Native Americans and Veterans. It is \ncritical that the necessary resources are provided in Indian Health \nServices and Veterans Administration.\n  Unfortunatley, it is commonplace for Native Americans seeking care \nfrom Indian Health Service to be denied essential services that most of \nus simply take for granted. This is a problem.\n  I believe we also owe it to our veterans to better attend to their \nmedical needs. Surely the greatest nation in the world should be able \nto keep their promise to the veterans who have fought for and protected \nour nation.\n  There are many challenges that face us now. By working together, we \nwill make America stronger.\n  This week throughout the Senate's debate on the budget several very \ngood amendments, including several on issues I just mentioned, were \noffered that I, unfortunately, could not support. I do not believe that \nwe need to roll back tax relief that Congress enacted in 2001 to fund \nthis amendment. I supported those 2001 tax cuts. Congress enacted them \nin a time of massive surpluses. Returning some of those surpluses to \nthe taxpayer was the right thing to do.\n  We can find other offsets to pay for the spending in this amendment. \nOffsets like the closing of corporate tax shelters currently pending in \nthe JOBS bill come readily to mind. Before we start rolling back the \ntax relief that we enacted in 2001, we should ensure that we have taken \nall reasonable steps to obtain revenues through closing down abusive \ntax shelters.\n  I shall look forward to working with my colleagues to find other \noffsets for their amendments--offsets that as much as possible avoid \nrolling back the tax relief that we enacted in 2001.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, I want to offer my \ncongratulations to our Budget Committee Chairman, Senator Don Nickles, \nfor his efforts to craft a budget. He has announced that he will retire \nfrom this body at the end of his current term, and so this will be his \nlast budget resolution, and his work on the Budget Committee and in \nthis body deserve recognition. Though I oppose the budget resolution he \nproduced in committee, and that was approved by this body, I have \nnothing but the greatest respect for the author of that document.\n  Let me also note that the resolution passed by the Senate is an \nimprovement on the disastrous budget the President proposed, and I \ncredit Chairman Nickles with a great deal of that improvement. In \nparticular, I want to commend him for including at least some of the \nexpected cost of our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in his \nmark. Though it is still far short of what our best estimates tell us \nwill be needed, it is a great improvement to the ``head in the sand'' \napproach adopted in the President's fiscal year 2005 budget proposal. I \nregret the committee did not support my amendment to more adequately \nand honestly budget for our operations, and I very much hope that as it \ncomes out of conference, the final version of the budget resolution \nwill adopt the approach I have advocated--forthright budgeting that \npays for our operations instead of shoving the cost onto future \ngenerations.\n  I regret that this theme of ``buy now pay later'' pervades this \nbudget, as it has for the past 3 years. This resolution heads our \nbudget in the wrong direction. As our distinguished Ranking Member, \nSenator Conrad, has noted, when compared with current policies as \nrepresented in the CBO baseline and as adjusted by taking out last \nyear's supplemental appropriation for our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. this budget resolution further worsens the budget bottom \nline. Budget deficits will be greater, and Government debt will be \nlarger under this budget.\n  That means that this budget further adds to the burden our children \nand grandchildren already bear because of the fiscal recklessness of \nthe past three years.\n  In one important respect, this resolution is a significant \nimprovement over the version reported out of committee, because it \nrestores some of the budget enforcement we so desperately need as we \nface massive budget deficits for years to come. I was pleased that the \nSenate approved my amendment to reinstate the discipline of the PAYGO \nrule which requires that all new mandatory spending and all new tax \ncuts be offset or be subject to a point of order. As it came out of \ncommittee, this resolution maintained the far weaker rules embedded in \nlast year's budget resolution, inviting further damage to the budget, \nand further debt to be heaped on the backs of future generations. With \nthe adoption of my amendment, the Senate has taken an important step \ntoward turning around the rapidly deteriorating budget position.\n\n  This resolution is also an improvement over the original mark offered \nby the chairman because of an amendment adopted in committee that \nfacilitates the reimportation of FDA-approved prescription medicines \nthat I was proud to join with Senator Stabenow in offering. Our \namendment will not only save money for those who rely on those \nmedicines, but it also will reduce our budget deficits and save \ntaxpayers billions of dollars.\n  And I should note that this resolution does not rely on revenues \nraised by drilling for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, and \nI want to express my thanks to the chairman for responding to the \nappeal a number of us made with respect to this issue. I was prepared \nto fight to remove such language, and I think the chairman was wise not \nto rely on revenue assumptions that have always been questionable, and \nthat were at risk of being removed from the resolution.\n  The resolution was also improved on the floor when the body adopted \nan amendment offered by Senator Baucus which stripped the \nreconciliation instruction that would have severely limited \nconsideration of the issues surrounding the proposed significant \nreshaping of Medicaid. The President's proposed changes to that program \nwould put thousands of Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents at risk, \nand the Baucus amendment will make it harder for Congress and the White \nHouse to gut this essential safety net.\n  I regret the body did not adopt amendments offered by the Senator \nfrom Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, that would have provided needed support for our first \nresponders, who are on the front lines in our fight against terrorism. \nThe administration did not include adequate support in its budget, nor \ndid the resolution as it came out of committee, and the Senate failed \nto correct that defect when it rejected those amendments. This is an \narea of funding as critical to the security of our country as any \nother, and while I was pleased to support another amendment in this \narea, offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Levin, to provide a portion of the resources that \nare needed, I very much hope further improvement can be made before \nCongress takes final action on the resolution.\n  I was also disappointed that the Senate did not act to improve the \nmeasure by returning to the ``polluter pays'' policy that served us so \nwell for many years. I was pleased to join with the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg, in offering an amendment to do just that, and I \nregret that this sensible policy was rejected.\n  While the Senate failed to add that provision, it did adopt an \namendment I strongly supported, to increase funding to support state \ncompliance with Federal clean water standards. The goal of that deficit \nneutral amendment is to provide $3.2 billion for the Clean Water State \nRevolving Fund and $2.0 billion for the Safe Drinking Water Act \nRevolving Fund, both vitally important programs that were not \nadequately funded by the President in his budget submission.\n  As I noted earlier, this budget heads us down the wrong fiscal path. \nIf we are ever to climb out of the deficit ditch again, we need to \nstart now. Unfortunately, this resolution, though an improvement on \nwhat the President proposed, still leaves us worse off than merely \nextending current policies.\n  We must do better than that if we are to avoid heaping even more debt \nonto the already enormous burden our children and grandchildren must \nbear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2768-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2768-S2769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION OF NEIL WAKE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, yesterday the Judiciary Committee met in \npublic session to discuss how best to proceed with the investigation \ninto the theft and dissemination of confidential Judiciary Committee \ncomputer files. Over the last several weeks and months Democratic \nSenators have shown great patience with the process.\n  Last week, the chairman of our committee made the report of the \nSergeant at Arms into this matter publicly available. For days, \nSenators have been consulting about the follow-up investigation that is \nnow needed. Over the last few weeks a number of Senators, Republicans \nand Democrats, have acknowledged that these matters, now documented in \nthe report of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, warrant further \nconsideration by law enforcement officials. Along with other Senators, \nI have reached across the aisle to urge all Senators to now join us in \na request for a special counsel to conduct the investigation necessary \nto complete action and assure accountability for this unprecedented \npartisan espionage within the Senate. Yesterday I renewed that \ninvitation to join in our request for the appointment of a special \ncounsel of the highest integrity and independence to follow up on this \nmatter.\n  I had hoped that we could move forward together, and yesterday we did \nachieve a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary, which has now joined in \nrequesting a criminal investigation by an independent prosecutor.\n  On Wednesday, March 10, nine Senators on the committee sent a letter \nto the Justice Department seeking the appointment of special counsel in \nthis matter. Thursday morning, March 11, nine Republican Senators wrote \nto Chairman Hatch and noted:\n\n       [W]e are now certain that only a determination by a \n     professional prosecutor as to whether any laws were violated \n     will bring this matter to a just and timely resolution.\n\n  Yesterday all members on the Judiciary Committee endorsed having a \nprofessional prosecutor free from politics consider these matters \nwithout regard to partisanship.\n  Last night Republicans and Democrats joined in another letter to the \nJustice Department to request ``appointment of a prosecutor of the \nhighest integrity and independence to investigate and, if appropriate, \nprosecute all potential crimes related to the access and dissemination \nof Judiciary Committee staff files'' outlined in the report by the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms.\n  Someone who is removed from politics is essential. As we outline in \nour March 10 letter, many of us are concerned that it be special \ncounsel and that the Attorney General recuse himself from the process \nfor a number of reasons. In the March 12 letter from Senators Schumer, \nGraham, Durbin, Chambliss, Kennedy and DeWine, they likewise note that \nthe prosecutor handling the matter must be ``free from all conflicts \nand appearances of conflict.'' They suggest that Patrick Fitzgerald, \nwho has been given responsibility for the investigation of the lead of \nCIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, would be an ``ideal candidate'' \nand that his mandate is a good model for that of the prosecutor to whom \nis assigned responsibility for investigation of the matter of the \nJudiciary Committee computer files.\n  With respect to the Sergeant at Arms' report, I, again, thank him and \nhis staff for operating in a nonpartisan way and in the best tradition \nof the Senate. The report shows, without question, that the secret \nsurveillance and stealing of confidential computer files was \ncalculated, systematic and sweeping in its scope. After reading the \nreport, there is a lot more that we do know: We know that more than \n4,000 computer files were stolen. We know that the stealing of \nDemocratic computer files occurred over an extended period of time, \nfrom at least 2001 into 2003. We know that numerous staff members of \nRepublican Senators and Republican Senate leadership were aware of this \nactivity. We know that what was done was improper, unethical and likely \ncriminal.\n  However, after reading the report, there is still a lot that we do \nnot know. We do not know how the computer files and the information \ncontained therein were exploited. We do not know whether the stolen \ncomputer files or the information in them were shared with the \nDepartment of Justice directly or indirectly. We do not know whether \nthey were shared with the White House directly or indirectly. We do not \nknow whether they were shared with any of the nominees. We do not know \nwhat stolen files or information contained therein was shared with \npartisan advocacy groups on the right. Those are among the questions \nthat a special counsel with the tools to conduct a criminal \ninvestigation and compel testimony and information may discern. Indeed, \nthe Sergeant-at-Arms report acknowledges many of its limitations and \nthose on the authority of that office to get all the facts.\n  I hope Senators who care about accountability and the rule of law, \nand those interested in repairing the damage by this unprecedented \nspying campaign will support our request for the prompt appointment of \na special prosecutor to conduct the criminal investigation into the \ntheft of our computer files that is still needed. I hope the Justice \nDepartment will move quickly, properly assign this matter, and conduct \nan investigation to get to the bottom of the unprecedented wrongdoing \nthat we have suffered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the letters of March 10, March \n11 and March 12 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2004.\n     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to request that \n     the Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into \n     the theft and use of Democratic computer files from the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee computer server and appoint a \n     special counsel to conduct that investigation.\n       A criminal investigation into the theft and use of these \n     files is warranted. In addition to press accounts since the \n     middle of November 2003 about the stolen computer files, \n     there has been an investigation by Senator Hatch of his staff \n     and a Senate Sergeant-at-Arms inquiry into this matter. \n     Neither of these investigations had the tools a federal \n     prosecutor has available to compel testimony or subpoena \n     evidence in order to investigate fully who stole or spied on \n     Democratic computer files and how the stolen files were used.\n       Based on the recent report of the Sergeant-at-Arms, it \n     appears that from some time in 2001 until at least the spring \n     of 2003, and possibly until November 2003, staff of \n     Republican Senators stole and used information from internal \n     and confidential Democratic office computer files, including \n     memoranda from counsel to Senators. Republican staff \n     knowingly exceeded authorized access and intentionally \n     accessed materials on government computers which they knew, \n     from the directory and subdirectory titles, they were not \n     entitled to access, and thereby obtained information used for \n     their advantage and possibly in violation of law. They read, \n     download, printed, and used such files for their own personal \n     and partisan purposes. Employees from Senator Hatch's \n     Judiciary Committee staff and from Majority Leader Frist's \n     Republican Senate leadership staff have resigned in \n     connection with these activities. We believe that the \n     unauthorized accessing, reading, downloading, printing, and \n     use of these files constitute violations of multiple federal \n     and local criminal laws and warrant criminal investigation.\n       It would be in the public interest to appoint an outside \n     special counsel to investigate these crimes because of the \n     conflict of interest these cases present to the Department. \n     We also respectfully suggest that it would be appropriate for \n     you to recuse yourself from the consideration of this request \n     for a special counsel. Your direct involvement in this matter \n     would present a conflict of interest due to your recent \n     service as a United States Senator and your close personal \n     and political relationships with some of the Senators whose \n     offices are subjects of the investigation and with other \n     Members of the Judiciary Committee. In addition, several \n     former Republican Judiciary Committee staff members, \n     including two with supervisory responsibilities during the \n     period in question, now serve in senior positions within the \n     Department of Justice and others have in the recent past.\n       Among the many outstanding questions is whether the stolen \n     computer files or information derived therefrom was shared \n     with the Department of Justice or White House directly or \n     indirectly. You and your staff were actively engaged in \n     issues relating to judicial nominations during the period \n     when the activities at issue here were being carried out. As \n     you know, a number of Senators recently wrote to ask about \n     your and the Department's knowledge of, or involvement in, \n     the matter of the stolen computer files and information \n     derived therefrom. Any thorough investigation would have to \n     address these issues as well.\n       Only a special counsel can investigate this matter in a \n     manner that will have credibility with the public. It is \n     plainly in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. \n     Political appointees should not investigate this matter when \n     the very purpose of the wrongdoing was to assist with \n     politically sensitive judicial confirmations sought by this \n     Administration and managed, in large part, by the Department. \n     We trust that you, or your designee, will agree that a \n     special counsel with a reputation for integrity and impartial \n     decisionmaking and with appropriate experience and resources \n     should be appointed to conduct such an inquiry. Among those \n     resources would be the expertise of the Computer Crimes and \n     Intellectual Property Section of the Criminal Division, which \n     has assisted in the investigation and prosecution of similar \n     federal crimes. We respectfully request that a special \n     counsel of the highest integrity and independence be \n     appointed and that the special counsel receive a broad and \n     clear mandate for independent action, including the \n     discretionary ability to report to Congress and to the public \n     and protection against termination unless the appointing \n     official finds and certifies to extraordinary improprieties.\n       Thank you for your prompt consideration and action in \n     response to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator; Herb Kohl, U.S. Senator; \n           Charles E.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: A week has passed since the public \n     release of the Report on the Investigation into Improper \n     Access to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Computer System \n     (Mar. 4, 2004) prepared by the Sergeant at Arms of the United \n     States Senate. The Sergeant at Arms' report sets forth in \n     great detail factual findings regarding the improper access \n     of computer files belonging to Democratic staff members of \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary (the committee) by two \n     former Republican committee staff members. As explained in \n     the Sergeant at Arms' report, this investigation was \n     initiated in November of last year, shortly after the Wall \n     Street Journal and Washington Times printed articles in which \n     they acknowledged receipt of Democratic staff memoranda.\n       While it is not our place as members of the committee to \n     decide whether any of the acts described in the Sergeant at \n     Arms' report constitute criminal violations of Federal law, \n     we nevertheless are convinced that this is a very serious \n     matter that needs to be reviewed and considered by the proper \n     authorities at the earliest opportunity. As you know, our \n     goal has always been to approach this investigation in the \n     least politicized manner possible. We had hoped that the \n     committee would debate the proper course of action and arrive \n     at a bipartisan agreement on how to proceed with the \n     information revealed in the Sergeant at Arms' report. \n     However, we are now certain that only a determination by a \n     prosecutor as to whether any laws were violated will bring \n     this matter to a just and timely resolution. We commend your \n     commitment to a thorough investigation of this matter as it \n     affects the very integrity of our committee.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon Kyl, John Cornyn, Jeff Sessions, Larry E. Craig, Mike \n           DeWine, Arlen Specter, Lindsey O.

John D. Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to request that \n     the Department of Justice appoint a prosecutor of the highest \n     integrity and independence to investigate, and, if \n     appropriate, prosecute all potential crimes related to the \n     access and dissemination of Judiciary Committee staff files \n     outlined in the attached Report from the Senate Sergeant at \n     Arms. We consider this breach of Senators' privacy to be a \n     matter of the utmost seriousness. While we very much \n     appreciate the fine work of the Sergeant at Arms, we note \n     that the attached Report itself suggests many avenues of \n     additional inquiry that have not been--and indeed could not \n     have been--pursued by this preliminary Senate investigation.\n       Because of the potential for perceived and actual conflicts \n     of interest, the undersigned members of the Judiciary \n     Committee agree that this matter must be handled by a \n     professional prosecutor who is free from all conflicts and \n     appearances of conflict--or, if appropriate, a special \n     counsel--who has full investigatory, charging and reporting \n     authority; who will conduct a thorough investigation; and who \n     will not be removable from this assignment except in case of \n     extraordinary improprieties. Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. \n     Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, has been \n     given such independence in the investigation of the leak of \n     CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, and we believe that \n     his mandate should be a model for the mandate of the \n     prosecutor in this case. Indeed, we agree that Mr. Fitzgerald \n     himself would be an ideal candidate for this investigation as \n     well. At a minimum, any special counsel or other prosecutor \n     appointed in this matter should be of Mr. Fitzgerald's \n     integrity and have the same degree of independence.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Richard J.

I \nam pleased that the Senate was able to efficiently do its work of \nadvising and consenting on this nomination in order\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nto guarantee the smooth operation of our Federal justice system.\n  Judge Guirola is a 1979 graduate of the University of Mississippi Law \nSchool, and he received his undergraduate degree from William Carey \nCollege in 1973. He has had a distinguished career in the law over the \npast quarter of a century and has gained broad experience from the \nvarious positions he has held. He has served as an assistant district \nattorney, an attorney in private practice, an attorney for the Jackson \nCounty Board of Supervisors, and an attorney for the Mississippi \nHighway Department.\n  Judge Guirola began his Federal service as an assistant U.S. Attorney \nfor the Eastern District of Texas in 1990, and he was named as a U.S. \nmagistrate judge for the Western District of Texas in 1993. He served \nin this position until 1996, when he returned to Mississippi to become \na U.S. magistrate judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, the \nposition he currently holds. He clearly has an extensive knowledge of \nthe Federal court system, and his experience will be a tremendous asset \nfor the country. It is no surprise that the ABA's Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary has unanimously found Judge Guirola to be ``well \nqualified'' to serve as a Federal district court judge.\n  Judge Guirola has also demonstrated a commitment to education and \ninstruction. He has been an adjunct professor at William Carey College \nand the University of Southern Mississippi. He also has given lectures \nand conducted seminars for the U.S. Attorney General's Advocacy \nInstitute, the Federal Bar Association, the Mississippi Bar \nAssociation, the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers Academy, the \nTexas Department of Public Safety, and the U.S. Probation Office. In \naddition, he has authored a number of legal articles and scholarly \npieces.\n  Judge Guirola is well-known and respected in his community, State and \nprofession. His nomination has received widespread support in the State \nof Mississippi because of his reputation for fairness and hard work. I \nknow that Judge Guirola will make an excellent district court judge, \nand I congratulate him on his confirmation by the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2771-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night the Senate confirmed two more \nFederal judicial nominees of President Bush: Judge Louis Guirola to the \nSouthern District of Mississippi and Neil Wake to the District of \nArizona. With these confirmations, the Senate has now confirmed 173 \njudicial nominees of this President. That is more than during the \nentire four years of the first term of President Reagan, from 1981 \nthrough 1984, and just two fewer than were confirmed in all 4 years of \nPresident Clinton's second term in office from 1997 through 2000. We \nhave reduced the number of vacancies in the Federal courts to 43, the \nlowest number in more than 13 years.\n  These two confirmations bring to four the number of judicial nominees \nconfirmed in the first few weeks in session this year. The American \npeople should remember that the Republican Senate leadership in 1996 \nallowed only 17 judicial nominees of President Clinton to be confirmed \nall year. I remain confident that with the cooperation of the \nadministration, the Senate this year will be able to match the total \nfrom that Presidential election year, the last year of President \nClinton's first term. We are well ahead of the pace Republicans \nachieved in 1996. The four judges confirmed so far this year is four \nmore than were confirmed on this date in 1996.\n  The two nominees confirmed last night had their hearings this year \nbut two others, J. Leon Holmes and Judge Dora Irizarry, had hearings \nlast year, were reported by the Judiciary Committee last year, and \nstill have not been scheduled for a vote by the Republican leadership. \nDemocrats have been ready to debate and vote on these nominees for many \nmonths. They have generated some controversy and will need to be \ndebated before the vote, but there is no Democratic ``hold'' on either \nnomination of which I am aware and no Democratic objection to a full \nand fair debate on each as far as I know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2771-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2771-S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday, March 11, 2004, was \na solemn day.\n  Two and a half years ago to the day, 19 terrorists hijacked four \nairliners and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, \nand a field in rural Pennsylvania.\n  It is fitting that we pause today to remember the nearly 3,000 \ninnocent people who lost their lives that day. It is also fitting that \nwe take a moment to remember the responsibilities that we undertook in \nthe aftermath of those horrible events. We in public office undertook a \nparticularly important obligation, as we vowed to take action to \nprevent terrorist attacks of that magnitude from happening again.\n  In his speech delivered before a joint session of Congress on \nSeptember 20, 2001, President Bush put it this way: ``Americans are \nasking, How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every \nresource at our command--every means of diplomacy, every tool of \nintelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial \ninfluence, and every necessary weapon of war--to the disruption and to \nthe defeat of the global terror network.\n  Unfortunately, we have not met that commitment.\n  We now know that the terrorist attacks of September 11 were the \nresult of a sophisticated plot that developed over many months and \nrequired coordination among a number of individuals. If our national \nintelligence agencies had been better organized and more focused on the \nproblem of international terrorism, this tragedy would have been \navoided.\n  Incredibly, it is now 30 months later, and the basic problems in our \nnational intelligence community that contributed to our vulnerability \non 9/11 have not yet been seriously considered, much less resolved.\n  These problems are not a mystery, they are known weaknesses that \nsimply have yet to be fixed. If we in the Congress do not take action \nto remedy these weaknesses, we will not be able to avoid accountability \nfor the next attack.\n  A series of independent commissions and the Joint Inquiry conducted \nby the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in 2002 have identified \na variety of issues that we must address. They fall into four \ncategories:\n  One, setting priority targets for intelligence collection and \nanalysis.\n  Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet declared war on al-\nQaida in 1998, but few in the CIA--and almost no one in the other \nagencies that make up our Intelligence Community--responded to his \nclarion call.\n  Our national intelligence agencies continued to focus on states, such \nas Russia, China, Iran and Iraq. Despite Mr. Tenet's call for action, \nOsama bin Laden al-Qaida was not even near the top of our intelligence \npriority list on September 11, 2001. It was not until September 12 that \nthey moved to the top of the list.\n  Part of the problem was that our intelligence community had no formal \nprocess for regularly reviewing and updating intelligence priorities to \nensure that they accurately reflected the current security environment.\n  Furthermore, it does not appear that the heads of other intelligence \nagencies looked to the Director of Central Intelligence for leadership \nand priority-setting.\n  Even though George Tenet may have realized that non-state actors like \nal-Qaida needed more attention, the importance of these groups was not \nclear to other members of the intelligence community. The head of the \nNational Security Agency, our Nation's electronic eavesdropping agency, \nwas asked if he knew about Mr. Tenet's declaration of war with al-\nQaida.\n  The director of the NSA said that yes, he was aware of Mr. \nTenet's statement, but he did not think it applied to him or his \norganization.\n\n  Two, providing strong new leadership for the intelligence community.\n  Examples like this make it clear that we need to provide strong new \nleadership for the intelligence community.\n9/11 exposed historic tensions within the Intelligence Community, and \nbetween intelligence agencies and law enforcement.\n  We need to empower a Cabinet-level official with the authority to end \nbureaucratic in-fighting and competition\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nfor resources, as well as ensuring the sharing of information among all \nof those charged with protecting our homeland security--including first \nresponders at the State and local level.\n  In many ways, our national intelligence community has resembled, and \nstill resembles, a collection of independently operating actors, rather \nthan a unified team that works together on counterterrorism and other \nmissions.\n  Before 9/11, there were a number of barriers that prevented \ninformation from being shared among various agencies, and while many \nformal barriers have been removed, many informal ones remain in place.\n  Our joint, bipartisan congressional inquiry revealed that in the \nmonths before the September 11 attacks, our national intelligence \nagencies collected pieces of information that, taken as a whole, could \nhave been used to disrupt al-Qaida's hijacking plot.\n  Unforunately, this information was not shared with all of the right \npeople, and helpful actions were not taken.\n  The CIA was aware that two terrorists associated with al-Qaida had \nobtained visas for travel to the United States, but it did not share \nthis information with border protection agencies, or with the FBI, \nwhich could have kept an eye on these men once they were in the \ncountry.\n  The FBI was aware that a man arrested in Minnesota might have been \nplanning a suicide hijacking, but it did not share this information \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration, which could have increased \nsecurity precautions on domestic flights.\n  Better information sharing between the FBI and CIA, as well as other \nintelligence agencies, could have increased the intelligence \ncommunity's overall awareness of terrorist activities. And better \ninformation sharing between the intelligence community and all the \nvarious agencies who contribute to our homeland security could have \nhelped these agencies move to an appropriate level of alertness. We \nhave an obligation to make sure that better information sharing takes \nplace, and the consequences of failure could be very high.\n  Three, setting priorities for limited resources.\n  A Cabinet-level official with authority over intelligence could also \nset priorities for limited intelligence resources.\n  The Intelligence Community did not adapt quickly enough after the end \nof the Cold War, during which we had come to rely more on satellites \nthan on human assets--spies. There was no collective sense of \nimportance within the Intelligence Community, including the Department \nof Defense, and as a result, investments in research and development--\nwhich were once a priority--suffered slippage.\n  Nearly all intelligence agencies faced significant staff shortages \nprior to 9/11, and this had a serious impact on their effectiveness. At \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, for example, many critical \ncounterterrorism personnel were required to work long hours without \nrelief. This obviously made these personnel less effective, and had a \nvery negative effect on their morale.\n  Other intelligence agencies, such as the National Security Agency and \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, faced similar staffing problems. \nIn particular, these agencies lacked sufficient numbers of analysts and \nlanguage specialists to support agents working in the field.\n  When agency directors tried to create solutions to these personnel \nproblems, they were often unable to implement them.\n  The lack of clear counterterrorism priorities made it difficult for \nmanagers to reassign personnel from other areas. Moving money was \nalmost as difficult as moving people, since intelligence community \nmanagers have limited budget authority.\n\n  Incredibly, these problems are still with us today. While all of our \nintelligence agencies have increased in hiring and training of \ncounterterrorism personnel, many of them continue to face resource and \npersonnel problems. Even relatively small shifts of resources still \nmust go through a lengthy approval process, and it is not always \npossible to assign enough people to important areas.\n  Prior to 2001, many CIA officials knew that more agents were needed \nin Afghanistan, but they were unable to move resources away from other \npriorities. By giving our intelligence agencies more budget \nflexibility, we can empower them to address problems further in \nadvance, and begin thinking about solutions, instead of waiting for a \ncrisis to occur before taking any action.\n  Long term planning is also constrained by the process we use for \nfunding our intelligence agencies. Instead of providing them with a \nsustained, stable source of funding, we insist on giving them \nrelatively small budget allocations, and then increasing this through \nthe use of supplemental appropriations bills. Counterterrorism programs \nhave relied heavily on these supplemental appropriations for several \nyears, and this continues today in spite of repeated claims that we \nhave increased our focus on counterterrorism.\n  If we wish to get the most out of our investment in counterterrorism, \nwe must make it possible for Intelligence Community directors and \nmanagers to engage in long term planning, rather than simply jumping \nfrom one crisis to the next.\n  Of course, increased flexibility must be accompanied by increased \noversight. As hard as it is for most Americans to believe, the \nIntelligence Community has only a vague idea of how much money it \nspends on counterterrorism.\n  Most agencies do not regularly examine how much they spend on \ncounterterrorism, and those that do use inconsistent accounting \nmethods--and often base their data on rough estimates.\n  If we do not know how much we are spending on counterterrorism \npriorities, it will obviously be very hard for us to see if our \ninvestment is being spent wisely. A cost-benefit analysis from an \nindependent agency would be very helpful in this regard, but so far \nthere have been no serious efforts to undertake such an effort.\n  Four, establishing a competent domestic counterterrorism capability.\n  Finally, we must begin establishing a competent domestic \ncounterterrorism capability.\n  The FBI has looked at its intelligence-gathering role through the \nprism of a law-enforcement agency. If asked how many suspected \nterrorists or terrorist sympathizers are estimated to live in any given \nmajor American city, the FBI would respond with the number of open \ninvestigative files its field office had there.\n  Americans have to decide what we expect of our domestic intelligence-\ngathering capability--and how much intrusion into our personal lives we \nare willing to accept.\n  Then we must make a choice: Can we accomplish our goal with an agency \nthat has a mixed law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering mission, or \nshould we create a separate domestic intelligence-gathering unit such \nas Great Britain's MI5?\n  For the immediate future, our national security interests are best \nserved by acting to make the FBI as effective as it can be. However, we \nmust also consider our other options and decide if we can do better.\n  The FBI continues to perform its intelligence mission in a \ncommendable fashion, but detecting and disrupting terrorist plots \nbefore they can be executed requires a very different approach than \napprehending perpetrators of crimes that have already taken place.\n  If we look around the world, we can see that there are many different \nmodels for domestic intelligence gathering, and many different models \nfor domestic law enforcement. Here in America we must decide what sort \nof institution best fit our needs and circumstances, and as these \ncircumstances change, we should not be afraid to make our institutions \nchange as well.\n  This must first begin with a debate over the best possible structure \nfor our domestic intelligence and law enforcement programs. I am sorry \nto say this debate has not yet taken place.\n  The problems that I have discussed today need to be fixed as soon as \npossible. Ignoring them will not make them go away. Old habits, \ndifferences in agency culture, and bureaucratic inertia are not \nacceptable excuses for procrastination and delay.\n  If we do not address them quickly and effectively, we will be blind \nto emerging threats, and we will leave ourselves vulnerable to future \nattacks.\n  On the other hand, if we can repair these weaknesses then we can give \nthe\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nhard-working men and women of our Intelligence Community the tools they \nneed to help prevent such attacks from taking place.\n  As we reflect on the horrific events that stunned our Nation two and \na half years ago, and pay tribute to those who lost their lives, we \nmust recommit ourselves to our responsibility to do everything we can \nto prevent such events from happening again.\n  If there is another terrorist attack in our country, the American \npeople will look to their elected leaders and ask us what we learned \nfrom September 11, and how that information was used to protect them.\n  We must be able to tell both those who lived--and those who died--\nthat we did everything we could.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In Dix Hills, NY, in March 2000, a young man's remains were found in \na plastic container in a park in Queens. The teen's social security \nnumber and racial and anti-homosexual epithets were written on the \nskull with a marker.\n  I believe the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2773-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LOWER OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last night the Senate voted to accept the \namendment I offered with Senator Collins to the fiscal year 2005 budget \nresolution to lower oil prices by placing over 50 million barrels of \noil on the open market rather than depositing it in the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve--SPR--as the administration had planned. I would like \nto note for the record that this amendment already is accomplishing its \nobjective of lowering oil prices. At 11:30 a.m. this morning, just \nhours after the news of this amendment reached the markets, oil prices \nfell. According to Reuters, ``NYMEX crude oil futures fell more than $1 \nFriday morning after a U.S. Senate vote seeking to bar more shipments \nof crude oil to the U.S. emergency stockpile.''\n  This amendment is a win-win for the American people. Low supplies of \noil in private inventories are a main reason for high prices. With more \noil on the open market, prices for gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and \ndiesel fuel will decline and consumers will benefit. At the same time, \nour cities and States will gain from additional funds for homeland \nsecurity.\n  The amendment directs the Department of Energy--DOE--to cancel \ndelivery of 53 million barrels of crude oil currently planned for \ndeposit into the SPR and to sell this oil on the open market. By \nselling oil on the open market, the Federal Government would generate \nover $1.7 billion in additional revenues. The amendment would allocate \na portion of the $1.7 billion for deficit reduction and place the \nremainder in a reserve fund to be used for more homeland security \nfunding for the States.\n\n  I will continue to work within the Congress to persuade--or require, \nif necessary--the Administration to suspend shipments of oil to the SPR \nto lower prices further.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached article on the drop in oil \nprices due to the Senate's action last night be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Reuters News Service, Mar. 12, 2004]\n\n         NYMEX Oil Falls Over $1 on Possible SPR Shipments Halt\n\n       New York.--NYMEX crude oil futures fell more than $1 Friday \n     morning after a U.S. Senate vote seeking to bar more \n     shipments of crude oil to the U.S. emergency crude stockpile.\n       The move, which aims to reduce oil prices by keeping more \n     supply in the market, countered, for the moment, fears that \n     oil facilities were once again at risk after Thursday's \n     terror bomb attacks in Madrid killed nearly 200 people and \n     injured more than 1,400 others.\n       NYMEX crude for April delivery fell as low as $35.30 a \n     barrel, down $1.48 on the day, before bouncing back a bit to \n     $35.40.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2773-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF DR.

There is no more important agency in providing \nquality health care for the American people, and Dr. McClellan is \nsuperbly qualified for this important post.\n  Dr. McClellan has served with distinction in the Treasury Department \nduring the Clinton administration and as a health policy advisor and \ncommissioner of FDA in the Bush administration. He has immense \nintellectual gifts, a distinguished background as an economist and \nphysician, and tremendous energy, commitment, and integrity. I am \nparticularly pleased that he is an adopted son of Massachusetts, having \nreceived his M.D. from the Harvard Medical School.\n  Mark and I have worked closely on a number of issues during his \ntenure at the White House and the FDA. While we certainly don't always \nagree, I have always felt that we were working toward the same goals of \nquality health care. At the FDA, he was committed to modernizing the \nagency to assure that it brought the best scientific tools of the new \ncentury of the life sciences, to regulating the drug development \nprocess, and speeding safe and effective products to market. He made a \ntough call to protect the health of women in his decision on silicone \nbreast implants, and he has been aggressive in his attempts to remove \ndangerous dietary supplements, most notably Ephedra, from the market. \nHe has been particularly generous with his time in meeting with the \nMassachusetts device and biotechnology industries, so that he could \nunderstand their concerns and that they could gain a deeper \nappreciation of the most productive way to work with the FDA.\n  At CMS, Mark will have to implement the deeply flawed Medicare bill--\na challenging task under the best of circumstances. I was encouraged by \nhis comments at his confirmation hearing indicating that, unlike others \nin the Bush administration, he understands the need to maintain \nMedicaid as an individuals entitlement guaranteeing health care for the \npoorest of the poor and to end the pernicious policy of overpaying \nMedicare HMOs because they enroll the healthiest senior citizens.\n  In summary, I am pleased to support Dr. McClellan's nomination.

Mr. President, last week, the Senate passed a 10-year \nextension of the assault weapons ban. We passed the assault weapons ban \nin 1994 because law enforcement agencies asked for it, and we extended \nit last week at their urging.\n  Studies have shown that the assault weapons ban works. According to \nNational Institute of Justice statistics reported by the Brady Campaign \nto Prevent Gun Violence, gun trace requests for assault weapons \ndeclined 20 percent in the first calendar year after the ban took \neffect, dropping from 4,077 in 1994 to 3,268 in 1995. This statistic \nindicates that fewer of these weapons were making it onto the streets.\n  As my colleagues know, the 1994 law banned the production of certain \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. \nThe 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons as well as a number \nof other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics such as \npistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash suppressors. \nThis law should not be allowed to sunset on September 13, 2004. This \nlaw does not need to sunset. Our Nation's law enforcement officers \nsupport this legislation, the President even has expressed his support, \nand the Senate passed an extension.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  If the law is not reauthorized, the production of assault weapons can \nlegally resume. Restarting production of these weapons will increase \ntheir number and availability and inevitably lead to a rise in gun \ncrimes committed with assault weapons. The Senate has shown bipartisan \nmajorities for renewing the assault weapons ban. President Bush should \ndemand that Congress act this year to extend the ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2774-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GAO FEBRUARY COMPETITIVE SOURCING REPORT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I have repeatedly voiced my opposition to \nthe Administration's aggressive outsourcing agenda which I believe \ncomes at too high a cost to Federal workers and to Government \naccountability and cost-effectiveness. My concerns are confirmed by a \nFebruary 2004 General Accounting Office, GAO, report entitled, \n``Competitive Sourcing: Greater Emphasis Needed on Increasing \nEfficiency and Improving Performance,'' GAO-04-367. I highly recommend \nthis report to my colleagues.\n  The GAO reviewed the Federal outsourcing agenda at seven agencies: \nthe Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Interior, \nAgriculture, Education, and Veteran's Affairs. These agencies contain \n84 percent of Federal jobs eligible for outsourcing. The administration \nhas identified 304,800 Federal jobs for outsourcing at the Departments \nof Defense, Health and Human Services, and Interior alone, which \nrepresent nearly 42 percent of the total workforce of these agencies.\n  GAO found that the examined Federal agencies are focusing more on \nimplementing Office of Management and Budget, OMB, mandates on the \nnumber of competitions at the expense of cost-efficiency. In 2001, the \nadministration had established the goal of privatizing up to 50 percent \nof federal jobs. However on July 23, 2003, the OMB's Administrator for \nProcurement Policy, Angela Styles, testified before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that contracting quotas would be terminated and \nreplaced by agency-specific plans.\n  This shift in policy came after repeated criticisms from both sides \nof the aisle in the Senate and the House of Representatives. For \nexample, the FY03 Transportation, Treasury, and General Government \nAppropriations Act severely restricted the use of contracting quotas as \na result of strong bipartisan opposition.\n  There are important steps we can take now to improve the cost-\neffectiveness and fairness of public-private competitions. As ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Financial Management Subcommittee \nand the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I am working to \nimprove the financial transparency and cost-savings of Federal \noutsourcing policies. Federal contracts should be required to generate \nat least 10 percent savings over agency costs. The Federal Procurement \nData System, FPDS, reports that the Federal Government spent \napproximately $250 billion on Federal contracts in 2002. The Senate \npassed FY04 Omnibus Appropriations Act would have required a minimum of \n10 percent cost-savings before Federal jobs are contracted out. \nUnfortunately, this measure was stripped from the FY04 Omnibus \nAppropriation Act.\n  The GAO report reaffirms the need for a minimum cost-savings in \nFederal procurement policies. By law, the Department of Defense, DOD, \nis required to achieve cost-savings before jobs are contracted out. DOD \nis the largest buyer of contracted services and according to recent \nFPDS data spent over $164 billion in 2002.\n  We can also improve fairness in public-private competitions. Before \ndecisions are made to contract out Federal work, agencies need the \npersonnel, funding, and technology to ensure that the work is performed \nin a timely and cost-effective manner. We cannot expect Federal \nemployees to oversee billions of dollars of contracts without these \nresources, which is why I was disappointed to learn that GAO found that \nsix out of the seven agency offices examined had only one or two \nemployees overseeing outsourcing activities.\n  Moreover, we should level the playing field so that Federal workers \nhave the right to appeal the loss of a competition just as contractors \ndo today. Fair competition must ensure that affected employees have \nproper appeals and protest rights. Unlike Federal employees, Federal \ncontractors have the right to protest OMB Circular A-76 decisions \nbefore the GAO. I am disappointed that the FY04 Omnibus Appropriation \nAct stripped a provision that would have provided Federal workers the \nsame appeal rights as contractors.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to ensure \nthat Federal procurement policies offer the best return on the dollar \nand are fair to Federal workers. The results of this GAO review \nreaffirms that there is more work to be done in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2774-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nWISCONSIN'S ACQUISITION OF A WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CIVIL SUPPORT \n                                  TEAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was very happy to learn this week that \nWisconsin will be one of 12 new States to receive funding for a full-\ntime Weapon of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team--WMD-CST--this year \nand I want to congratulate the Wisconsin National Guard for their \nefforts to secure a full-time team. These teams, made up of members of \nthe National Guard, play a vital role in assisting local first \nresponders in investigating and combating the new threat we face in the \n21st century. During the 2002 Baseball All-Star Game in Milwaukee, WI \nhad to call in Minnesota's civil support team because Wisconsin did not \nyet have a full-time team. I am pleased that Wisconsin will now have \nits own capability to quickly respond and protect its citizens from \npossible terrorist threats.\n  I have worked for years now to assure that all states and territories \nhave at least one of these teams and I want to thank my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for helping me in this endeavor. We have had \ngreat success. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2003 made it law that all states and territories have at \nleast one WMD-CST and Congress authorized and appropriated the funds to \nestablish 12 of the 23 teams during fiscal year 2004. Now we must make \nsure that the last 11 teams are funded in fiscal year 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2774-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2774-S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               SALUTING DELTA SIGMA THETA SORORITY, INC.\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nwomen of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., a service sorority dedicated \nto promoting sisterhood, scholarship and service, for their efforts in \nthe battle against HIV/AIDS.\n  According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, as of the end of 2002, an estimated 42 million people \nworldwide--38.6 million adults and 3.2 million children younger than 15 \nyears of age--were living with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 70 percent of \nthese people, 29.4 million, live in Sub-Saharan Africa; another 17 \npercent, 7.2 million, live in Asia. Of the estimated 15,603 AIDS-\nrelated deaths in the United States in the year 2001, approximately 52 \npercent were among African Americans and Hispanics. Racial and ethnic \nminority populations constitute more than 57 percent of the more than \n800,000 cases of AIDS reported in the United States since the epidemic \nwas discovered in 1981. Further, the Centers for Disease Control \nreports that as of December 2001, African Americans and Hispanics \nrepresented 52 percent of AIDS cases reported among males and 78 \npercent of those in females. Fifty-eight percent of all women reported \nliving with AIDS that year were African Americans and 20 percent were \nHispanic. African American children represented 58 percent of all \npediatric cases. Of the 175 pediatric AIDS cases reported in 2001, 139, \n79 percent, were African Americans and Hispanic. AIDS is one of the \nleading cause of death among African-American men ages 24 to 44. \nRecognizing the urgency of the issue, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. \nhas taken a leadership role in educating the global community on how to \ndecrease the AIDS pandemic, thus promoting health and wellness.\n  Delta Sigma Theta's effort focuses on an intense HIV/AIDS Education \nCampaign beginning with encouraging local Delta chapters to implement \ninternal\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\neducation awareness workshops. This enabled the sorority members to \nbetter understand the drastic impact HIV/AIDS is having on African \nAmerican women of all ages. In addition, for the past 3 years, chapters \nhave participated in the sorority's International Day of Service for \nHIV/AIDS, a public awareness program in which a day is committed to \nproviding HIV/AIDS education and prevention services to communities \naround the world.\n  On Saturday, March 13, 2004, the more than 900 chapters of the \nsorority located in 44 States, the District of Columbia, and in 6 \ncountries abroad will conduct forums and seminars, provide counseling \nand testing, raise funds for research and services, and petition \nlawmakers to enact legislation that effectively addresses HIV/AIDS \nissues. In my State of New Jersey alone, the Central Jersey Alumnae \nchapter will sponsor a community forum entitled ``Why Not Me? The \nAffect of HIV/AIDS on Our Families.'' The event will include key \nsessions for citizens of diverse age groups, helping participants to \nclarify perceptions/myths about HIV/AIDS and encouraging them to speak \nopenly about the impact of the disease on their communities. There also \nwill be an open general session in which TEEN PEP of Somerset County \nwill perform some powerful and thought-provoking pieces.\n  The Montclair Alumnae chapter will provide direct services to the \nAcademy Street Firehouse After-School Project. As part of the AIDS \nResource Foundation for Children in Newark, the Academy Street \nFirehouse addresses educational, vocational, social and medical needs \nof children and teens who are dealing with the loss of a parent due to \nAIDS. Approximately 50 children between the ages of 7 and 17 will \nreceive services.\n  The North Jersey Alumnae chapter will hold three seminars on topics \nrelated to the HIV/AIDS: (1) The Secret Lives of AIDS; (2) The role of \nthe church in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (3) How individuals can \nprotect themselves. There will be free testing and counseling. Speakers \nwill include community activists and church leaders. There also will be \na dramatization by the ``POWER'' group, a youth organization that \nteaches about HIV/AIDS and its affects.\n  The Rancocas Valley Alumnae chapter will partner with the Township of \nWillingboro to present workshops for men, women and children on (1) \nHIV/AIDS prevention; (2) Functioning as a person living with HIV/AIDS; \n(3) Caring for people with AIDS; and (4) Volunteerism with HIV/AIDS \norganizations. The day will be filled with a variety of activities such \nas panel discussions, videos, dramatic presentations, praise dancers, \nand step teams.\n  The Trenton Alumnae chapter along with the Rho Epsilon and Tau Kappa \ncollegiate chapters will host Trenton's 2nd Annual Aids Walk. The Walk \nwill begin at a local school and end at City Hall where the chapters \nwill host a rally and speakers who will discuss the impact of HIV/AIDS. \nDonations will be collected to benefit the Rainbow House, a nonprofit \norganization that provides housing for children and adults living with \nHIV/AIDS in the city of Trenton.\n  The membership of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. provides an \nextensive array of public service programs and projects through the \nsorority's Five-Point Program Thrust: Economic, Development, \nEducational Development, International Awareness and Involvement, \nPhysical and Mental Health, and Political Awareness and Involvement. \nThe ``International Day of Service'' is an activity of the sorority's \nmental and physical health focus ``Summit V: Let It Continue--Heal and \nHealing: Promoting Health and Wellness on HIV/AIDS.'' Summit V is a \nmeans through which Deltas throughout the world assist in informing and \neducating the public and families about women's health issues, develop \ncommunity partnerships to help inform the public and provide access to \nservices; provide leadership for supporting policy development and \npromoting and enforcing legal requirements that protect the health and \nsafety of women; and support research and political efforts to gain new \ninsights and innovate solutions to health problems impacting women.\n  Delta Sigma Theta Sorority was founded on the campus of Howard \nUniversity in 1913 by 22 visionary college women. Notable members \ninclude our colleague in the other Chamber. Congresswoman Stephanie \nTubbs Jones of Ohio, civil rights pioneer and Congressional Gold Medal \nrecipient Dr. Dorothy I. Height, and former Labor Secretary Alexis \nHerman.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in saluting the women of Delta \nSigma Theta Sorority, Inc., for their global efforts in the battle \nagainst HIV/AIDS, and I urge fellow Americans to participate in the \nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., ``International Day of Service'' \nprojects in their communities on March 13, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2775-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN REMEMBRANCE OF PAMELA LAMAR JORDAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Pamela Lamar Jordan, a tireless advocate for families and \nthe plight of children. She was committed to serving the needs of her \ncommunity and to improving the quality of life for young people in \nSaginaw. Pamela received numerous community service awards throughout \nher life. She will be missed by those whose lives she has touched.\n  Pamela Lamar Jordan was born in Saginaw, Michigan on June 24, 1961. \nShe is a graduate of Arthur Hill High School and was in pursuit of her \nBSW at Saginaw Valley State University. She was a member of the Word of \nFaith International Ministries, where she worked with the Youth \nDepartment. She was also a 1999 graduate of the Spoken Word School of \nMinistry.\n  In 1995, Pamela founded the New Alternatives Youth Service Center in \nSaginaw, Michigan. The Center's purpose is to educate young people and \nto provide an alternative to drugs, gangs, and violence. Pamela was \nalso a mentor with the Family Youth Initiative, which is affiliated \nwith the Bay Area Substance Abuse Coordinating Agency.\n  Pamela was also the founder of the Saginaw Sister-2-Sister Spirit of \nExcellence Pageant. Sister-2-Sister promotes abstinence and works to \ndecrease the rate of pregnancy among teenage girls in the Saginaw \ncommunity. Pamela believed this program helps local teenagers better \nunderstand themselves, and provides them with the appropriate \ninformation necessary to make healthy life choices.\n  Pamela Lamar Jordan passed away at the age of 42 on March 7, 2004. \nShe was a woman of great faith who was devoted to her family and to her \ncommunity. Pamela is mourned by her family, the members of her church, \nand many people across my home state of Michigan. Pamela is survived by \nher husband Cornelius Jordan and her four daughters: Melony, Janey, \nTerri and Brianna.\n  This is, indeed, a great loss to all who knew her or for those who \nhave benefitted from her work. I know my colleagues will join me in \npaying tribute to the life and work of Pamela Lamar Jordan. I hope her \nfamily takes comfort in knowing that her legacy will stand as an \ninspiration for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2775-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2775-S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STAFF SERGEANT RONALD W.

He began his service in March of 1983, when he attended \nMilitary Police training and subsequently moved to Dugway Proving \ngrounds, Utah to act as a military police desk sergeant.\n  In 1984 he was reassigned to Germany where he graduated from Military \nPolice Investigations School at the Combined Arms Training Center. In \n1987 he was promoted to Sergeant.\n  In late 1987 Sergeant Hoskins moved back to the United States where \nhe served in both Texas and Alabama, until he was assigned to the 142nd \nMilitary Police Company in Yongstan, Korea, in 1990.\n  In 1991 Sergeant Hoskins began working as an investigator and \nevidence custodian at Fort Bliss, Texas. He served in this position \nuntil 1995 when he returned to Yongstan.\n  In 1996 He was assigned to the 978th Military Police Company, and \nduring this tour was promoted to staff sergeant while he served as a \nmilitary police patrol supervisor.\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n  Staff Sergeant Hoskins was next assigned to Stuttgart, Germany. He \ndeveloped an emergency vehicles operator's course that was adapted \nthroughout the United States Army in Europe.\n  Over his long career Staff Sergeant Ronald Hoskins has received many \nawards and decorations, including the meritorious Service Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal with four oak leaf clusters, Army Achievement Medal \nwith four oak leaf clusters, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense \nService Medal with Bronze Star. Noncommissioned Officer Professional \nDevelopment Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon with numeral two device, \nOverseas Service Ribbon with numeral four device and Drivers Badge.\n  I congratulate Staff Sergeant Hoskins on his lengthy and dedicated \ncareer in the United States Army. I also want to recognize the efforts \nof his wife Susan without whom none of these accomplishments would be \npossible. Moreover, I extend to Staff Sergeant Haskins my profound \nappreciation for his service to the nation. I am honored to share his \nsuccess with my colleagues and I wish him and his family all the best \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2776-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto an outstanding group of public servants--the Girl Scouts of the \nUSA--who today celebrate the 92nd birthday of their organization.\n  Founded in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah, GA, Girl Scouts \nis the world's pre-eminent organization dedicated solely to girls--all \ngirls--where they can build character and skills for success in the \nreal world. Partnered with committed adult volunteers, Girl Scouts \ncultivate their full individual potential through learning and \nexperience. The qualities they develop in Girl Scouting--leadership, \nvalues, social conscience, and conviction about their own self-worth--\nserve and benefit them all their lives.\n  Nationwide today there are more than 3.7 million Girl Scouts--2.8 \nmillion girl members and 942,000 adult members. Through its membership \nin the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, Girl Scouts of \nthe USA is part of a worldwide family of 8.5 million girls and adults \nin 140 countries.\n  Today's Girl Scouts receive interactive training and experience in \nsuch areas as: leadership; math; science and technology; diversity; \nfinancial literacy; health, fitness and sports; environmental \neducation; the arts; global awareness; and safety. Our children's \nsafety is a matter of great concern to me. You may remember a wave of \nchild abductions not too long ago, including the kidnapping of \nElizabeth Smart in my own home State of Utah, which highlighted the \nneed to enhance our ability to protect our Nation's children. Last \nyear, I introduced the PROTECT Act of 2003, an Act to prevent child \nabduction and the sexual exploitation of children, which was signed \ninto law by President Bush in April. This legislation included the \nAMBER Alert system program, which has proven to be a valuable tool in \nthe rescue of abducted children. AMBER Alert systems are critical to \nsuccessful search and recovery efforts because they enable law \nenforcement authorities to galvanize entire communities to assist in \nthe safe recovery of child victims.\n  Elizabeth's disappearance raised awareness of this type of crime \nnationwide. Our entire Nation rejoiced with the Smart family after \nElizabeth was found alive and reunited with her loved ones. Her \ndiscovery, facilitated by everyday citizens who had followed this case, \ndemonstrates the importance of getting information about these \ndisappearances out to the public quickly, and what accomplishments can \nbe achieved when communities partner together.\n  Today, Girl Scouts of Utah will be celebrating the miracle of \nElizabeth Smart's return to her family, and the Girl Scouts of the \nUSA's 92nd birthday, by organizing a statewide safety awareness \ncampaign--Partners In safety. Ed and Lois Smart, Elizabeth's parents, \nare the honorary chairs of this campaign. Although today kicks off an \nongoing focus on safety rather than just a one-day event, Utah \ncommunities are invited to open house events on that date. Currently \nthere are more than 25 open house locations in the state of Utah; and a \nvariety of organizations state-wide have enlisted to participate as \ncommunity sponsors in company with law enforcement and local \ngovernments. There will be a variety of safety-related activities at \neach site, and each participating agency will have a pledge poster so \neveryone in the community can sign and pledge safety on behalf of those \nthey love.\n\n  We all care about the safety of our youth. The goal of Partners In \nSafety is to bring us all together to deliver the message of safety. I \nencourage everyone dedicated to safety to pledge to make a difference \nin your community by reaching the youth you know--talk to your \nchildren, grandchildren, students, teammates, troops, packs and church \ngroups.\n  Begun by Ogden volunteers, Girl Scouts of Utah has been in existence \nsince 1920 and has been committed to principles of pluralism, respect, \nand community service since inception. Utah Girl Scouts have delivered \nhand-made quilts to hospitals around Utah, decorated Christmas trees \nfor the Festival of Trees, organized and attended hundreds of community \nservice projects, increased their knowledge of finance during the Girl \nScout cookie sale, learned about themselves and others, gained more \nrespect for diversity, and participated in initiatives in science, \nsports, leadership, environmental education, and outdoor exploration. \nRecently, Girl Scouts of Utah was named a proud recipient of the 2004 \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award from the Utah Human Rights \nCommission in recognition of their steadfast devotion to diversity. \nUtah Girl Scouts have gotten a jump start on their way to becoming \nhappy, committed, and resourceful citizens.\n  Throughout its long history, Girl Scouts experienced many milestones \nmade possible by the strength and dedication of countless farsighted \nindividuals--mostly volunteers--who tirelessly served girls and \npromoted Girl Scouting. We simply have no greater resource than our \nchildren; they represent our Nation's future. I commend the Girl Scouts \nof the USA for their tireless efforts on behalf of our children and \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2776-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2776-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, treaties, and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2776-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the speaker has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3915.

A bill to restrict the use of abusive tax shelters and \noffshore tax\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nhavens to inappropriately avoid Federal taxation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to introduce today, with \nSenator Norm Coleman, a comprehensive tax reform bill called the Tax \nShelter and Tax Haven Reform Act. This bill is intended to respond to \nthe ever increasing tax shelter and tax haven abuses that are \nundermining the integrity of our tax system, robbing the Treasury of \ntens of billions of dollars each year, and shifting the tax burden from \nhigh income corporations and individuals onto the backs of the middle \nclass. Abusive tax shelters and the misuse of tax havens must be \nstopped.\n  For more than a year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \non which I serve, has been conducting an investigation at my request \ninto the design, sale, and implementation of abusive tax shelters. I \ninitiated this investigation back in 2002, but it has since been \ncarried out in a bipartisan fashion with the support of Senator \nColeman, who is our current Subcommittee Chairman.\n  What the subcommittee investigation has found is that many of the \nabusive tax shelters were not dreamed up by the taxpayers who used \nthem. Instead, most were devised by tax professionals, like \naccountants, lawyers, bankers, and investment advisors, who then sold \nthe tax shelter to clients for a fee. In fact, as our investigation \nwidened, we found hordes of tax advisors cooking up one complex scheme \nafter another, packaging them up as generic ``tax products'' with \nboiler-plate legal and tax opinions, and then undertaking elaborate \nmarketing schemes to peddle these products to literally thousands of \npersons across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters were \ngetting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while diverting \nbillions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  In November 2003, our subcommittee held two days of hearings and \nreleased a report prepared by my staff which pulled back the curtain \nand provided an inside looks at how even some respected accounting \nfirms, banks, investment advisors, and lawyers have become the engines \npushing the design and sale of abusive tax shelters to corporations and \nindividuals across this country. It was this investigative effort that \ninspired many of the provisions in the bill to combat abusive tax \nshelters and the professionals who promote them.\n  Another part of this bill results from subcommittee investigations \nexamining how tax havens around the globe help taxpayers dodge their \nU.S. tax obligations, using corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws to \nimpede U.S. tax enforcement efforts. At one subcommittee hearing in \n2001, a former owner of an offshore bank in the Caribbean testified \nthat he believed 100% of his bank clients were engaged in tax evasion. \nHe said that almost all were from the United States, described \nelaborate measures taken to avoid IRS detection of his clients' money \ntransfers, and expressed confidence that the Government would defend \nclient secrecy in order to attract business to the island. For the past \nfew years, the IRS has made detection of offshore bank accounts used by \nindividuals to conceal taxable income an enforcement priority, \nestimating that as many as 1 to 2 million U.S. taxpayers are hiding \nfunds in offshore tax havens.\n  Corporations are also using tax havens to reduce their U.S. tax \nliability. A subcommittee hearing held in 2003, on an Enron tax shelter \nknown as Slapshot, as well as Senate Finance Committee hearings on \nother Enron tax scams, show how corporations can utilize tax havens to \navoid U.S. taxes. A GAO report recently released by Senator Dorgan and \nmyself shows that nearly two-thirds of the top 100 companies doing \nbusiness with the United States now have one or more subsidiaries in a \ntax haven. One company, Tyco International, has 115 tax haven \nsubsidiaries. Data recently released by the Commerce Department further \ndemonstrates the extent of U.S. corporate use of tax havens, indicating \nthat, as of 2001, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. \ncorporations were in tax havens.\n  Over the years, subcommittee investigations have uncovered numerous \ninstances of how U.S. tax enforcement efforts examining transactions, \nbank accounts, and other activities in tax havens have been delayed or \nimpeded by tax haven secrecy laws and practices. This bill is intended \nto give the U.S. Government new tools to stop uncooperative tax havens \nfrom continuing to help corporations and individuals dodge their U.S. \ntax obligations.\n  Stop and think what is at stake here. Men and women in our military \nare putting their lives on the line every day for our Nation. They are \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and now Haiti. To make sure we can \nprovide them with the resources they need, all Americans need to \ncontribute their fair share in taxes. Unfortunately, there are too many \ncompanies and individuals that finagle ways to avoid paying what they \nowe, despite the benefits they receive from this country. These tax \ndodgers deprive our Nation of billions of dollars in resources and add \nto the tax burdens of the rest of us.\n  Companies benefit from so much here in America: our stock market, \ntelecommunications infrastructure, patent protections, educated \nworkforce, research support, sophisticated financial systems, and basic \nlaw enforcement. Yet, too many companies run to use tax avoidance \nschemes based on abusive tax shelters and tax havens like a car \nspeeding through a tollbooth, leaving the rest of us to pitch in the \nrequired fare and subsidize their free ride.\n  Corporate and individual tax dodges today take many forms. They \ninclude the following: Abusive tax shelters in which taxpayers use \ncomplex investment schemes with no real business purpose other than to \nevade tax; corporate inversions in which companies pretend to move \ntheir headquarters to an offshore tax haven just to avoid their U.S. \ntax bill; foreign tax havens in which taxpayers use bank accounts and \nshell entities in foreign tax havens to escape detection while dodging \ntaxes; and structured financial transactions in which companies use \nshell entities in convoluted setups or improper transfer pricing \nschemes to avoid taxes. In most cases, these tax dodges are designed, \nsold and implemented by tax professionals who receive lucrative fees to \nhelp their clients avoid their tax obligations. To provide a better \npicture of some of these abuses, here are a few recent examples.\n  Perhaps the best-known corporate inverter is Tyco International, \nwhich operates out of New Hampshire and New Jersey, but claims a \nmailing address in Bermuda to avoid U.S. taxes. This tax dodge is a \nslap in the face of U.S. taxpayers, especially in light of the $300 \nmillion in Federal defense and homeland security contracts awarded to \nTyco in FY 2002, as well as the months-long, taxpayer-financed \nprosecution of Tyco's former officers for diverting $600 million in \ncorporate assets to their personal use. Tyco, once a proud U.S. \ncorporation, has sunk to new lows in its attempts to avoid paying its \nU.S. taxes.\n  Corporate tax abuses aren't confined to large U.S. companies. One \nexample of an abusive tax shelter being used by some small companies is \ncalled ``SC2,'' which was one of the tax shelters featured in our \nrecent Subcommittee hearings and staff report. In this shelter, a \nclosely-held corporation temporarily grants nonvoting stock to a tax-\nexempt charity and then allocates--on paper--a significant portion of \nthe company's profits to that charity. Beforehand, the company takes \nsteps to limit or suspend any obligation to actually distribute income \nallocated to its shareholders. The charity pays no tax on the paper \nprofits allocated to it. When the original corporate owners eventually \nreclaim both the stock and undistributed profits, they claim that \ncapital gains taxes, rather than higher ordinary income taxes, apply to \nthe income previously allocated to the charity. The charity gets paid \nfor its complicity, the corporate owners evade a lot of tax, and Uncle \nSam is the loser.\n  A third tax shelter example involves a massive, $20 billion transfer \npricing tax scam recently disclosed in a report issued by the \nbankruptcy examiner for Worldcom-MCI. The report states that Worldcom \navoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in state and Federal \ntaxes over a four-year period, from 1998 to 2001, by claiming \nquestionable expenses from related shell companies, including for a \nbogus intangible asset called ``management foresight.'' The\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nbankruptcy examiner, former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, called \non the company to sue its tax advisor and auditor, KPMG, for landing \nthe company in this tax disaster, but Worldcom-MCI has, instead \nbrazenly decided to continue using the tax dodge. This is the same \ncompany, by the way, that profits from billions of dollars in Federal \nand State contracts paid for--that's right--with taxpayer dollars.\n  The tax chiseling seems endless. Some of the tax ploys are arguably \ntechnically legal and require a change in law or regulation. Others \nappear blatantly illegal, yet elicit little or no penalty. Companies \nkeep using them, and their competitors are put at a disadvantage unless \nthey join in.\n  Too many respected accounting firms, financial institutions, and \nlawyers have joined in the sickening games by peddling tax dodges and \ntaking a cut of the billions of dollars diverted from the U.S. \nTreasury. As IRS Commissioner Mark Everson has pointed out, accountants \nand lawyers should be the pillars of our system of voluntary tax \ncompliance, not the architects of its circumvention.\n  This tax chiseling hurts average taxpayers, not only by leaving them \nwith the burden of making up the lost revenues, but also by \nconstricting resources for essential government programs. It is a lack \nof resources that results in the new Medicare drug prescription plan \nhaving a huge gap in coverage that denies elderly help with their \nprescription drug bills when they most need it. It's why our schools \nare burdened with unfunded mandates. It's why we have a giant and \ndeepening deficit ditch threatening our children's economic well-being. \nThe list of harmful consequences of tax dodging is long and \ndisquieting.\n\n  The Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act we are introducing today \ncontains a number of measures to put an end to these tax dodges:\n  To curb abusive tax shelters, the bill strengthens the penalties on \ntax shelter promoters and codifies the economic substance doctrine \neliminating tax benefits for transactions that have no real business \npurpose or real economic impact apart from those tax benefits.\n  To crack down on the misuse of tax havens, we authorize Treasury to \nissue an annual list of ``uncooperative tax havens'' and suspend U.S. \ntax benefits for income attributed to those jurisdictions.\n  We also require the Treasury Department to issue standards for tax \nshelter opinion letters, and give the IRS new tools to take tough \nenforcement action against the accounts, lawyers, bankers and other \nfinancial professionals promoting or facilitating deceptive tax \nschemes.\n  Let me be more specific.\n  Title I of the bill strengthens a host of tax shelter penalties, \nwhich are currently so weak they provide no deterrent effect at all. \nTow examples demonstrate the problem:\n  First, consider the penalty for promoting an abusive tax shelter, as \nset forth in section 6700 of the tax code. Currently, the penalty is \nthe lesser of $1,000 or 100 percent of the promoter's gross income \nderived from the prohibited activity. That means in most cases, the \nmaximum fine is $1,000. That figure is laughable, when many abusive tax \nshelters are selling for $100,000 or $250,000 a piece. Our \ninvestigation uncovered some tax shelters that were sold for $900,000 \nor even $2 million each, and instances in which the same cookie-cutter \ntax opinion letter was sold to 100 or even 200 clients. A $1,000 fine \njust doesn't cut it.\n  If further proof were needed, one document uncovered by our \ninvestigation contains the cold calculation by a senior tax \nprofessional at KPMG comparing possible tax shelter fees with possible \ntax shelter penalties if the firm were caught promoting an illegal tax \nshelter. This senior tax professional wrote the following: ``[O]ur \naverage deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a maximum \npenalty exposure of only $31,000.'' He then recommended the obvious--\ngoing forward with sales of the abusive tax shelter on a cost-benefit \nbasis.\n  Proposals to increase the penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters \nhave already passed the Senate three times and are included in the JOBS \nAct pending in the Senate. But these proposals are not tough enough to \ndo the job that needs to be done. In general, they increase the penalty \nfor promoting abusive tax shelters to a maximum of 50 percent of the \npromoters' gross income from the prohibited activity. Now, think about \nthat. Why should anyone who illegally pushes an abusive tax shelter be \nallowed--if they get caught--to keep half of their profits? What \ndeterrent effect is created by a penalty that allows promoters to keep \nhalf of their wages if caught, and all of them if they are not?\n  Penalities for those who peddle abusive tax shelters need to be a lot \ntougher. They should, first, make sure a tax shelter promoter is \ndeprived of every penny of the profits earned from selling or providing \nlegal advice on the shelter, and then pay a fine on top of that. Only \nthat way is the promoter actually penalized for misconduct. Secondly, \ntax shelter promoters ought to face a penalty that is at least as harsh \nas the penalty imposed on the taxpayer who purchased their tax product, \nnot only because the promoter is usually as culpable as the taxpayer, \nbut also so promoters think twice about pushing tax schemes. \nSpecifically, section 101 of the bill would increase the penalty on tax \nshelter promoters to an amount up to the greater of either 150 percent \nof the promoters' gross income from the prohibited activity, or the \namount assessed against the taxpayer--including backtaxes, interest and \npenalties--for using the abusive shelter.\n  A second penalty provision in the bill involves what our \ninvestigation found to be one of the biggest problems--the knowing \nassistance of accounting firms, law firms, banks, and others helping \ntaxpayers understate their taxes. Right now, under Section 6701 of the \ntax code, persons who knowingly aid and abet a taxpayer in understating \ntheir tax liability face a maximum penalty of $1,000 for assisting \nindividual taxpayers and $10,000 for assisting corporate taxpayers. \nThese paltry amounts provide no deterrent at all. Worse yet, the \npenalty applies only to so-called ``tax return preparers.'' Current law \nimposes no penalty at all on those who knowingly design and carry out \nthe abusive tax shelter, so long as those persons don't actually \nprepare the taxpayer's return.\n  Section 102 of the bill would strengthen this penalty significantly, \nsubjecting aiders and abettors to a maximum fine up to the greater of \neither 150 percent of the aider and abettor's gross income from the \nprohibited activity, or the amount assessed against the taxpayer for \nusing the abusive shelter. And this penalty would apply to all aiders \nand abettors, not just tax return preparers.\n  These are just two of the penalties strengthened by the Tax Shelter \nand Tax Haven Reform Act. Others include stronger penalties for tax \nshelter promoters who fail to register a new shelter with the IRS or \nfail to provide the IRS with a client list when requested, and stronger \npenalties for taxpayers who fail to disclose a tax shelter on their tax \nreturn or fail to disclose an offshore bank account.\n  Title II also contains many provisions to combat abusive tax \nshelters, but first I want to mention Title III, which focuses on the \neconomic substance doctrine, and Title IV which addresses offshore tax \nhavens.\n  Title III of the bill would include in Federal tax statutes for the \nfirst time what is known as the economic substance doctrine. This anti-\nabuse doctrine was fashioned by Federal Courts asked to evaluate \ntransactions which appeared to have little or no business purpose or \neconomic substance apart from tax avoidance. It has become a powerful \nanalytical tool used by courts to invalidate abusive tax shelters. At \nthe same time, because there is no statute underlying this doctrine and \nthe courts have developed and applied it differently in different \njudicial districts, the existing case law has many ambiguities and \nconflicting interpretations.\n  Under the leadership of Senators Grassley and Baucus, the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, the Senate has voted three \ntimes to codify the economic substance doctrine, but it has yet to be \nenacted into law. Since no tax shelter legislation would be complete \nwithout addressing this issue, Title III of this comprehensive bill \nproposes once more to include the economic substance doctrine in the \ntax code.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  Sections 401 and 402 in the Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act also \ntackle the issue of tax havens by deterring use of tax havens that fail \nto cooperate with U.S. tax enforcement efforts. There are dozens of \njurisdictions around the world that have enacted corporate, bank, and \ntax secrecy laws and then, in too many cases, used these laws to \njustify a failure to provide timely information to U.S. law enforcement \nabout persons suspected of either hiding funds in the jurisdiction's \noffshore bank accounts or using offshore corporations and deceptive \ntransactions to disguise their income or create phony losses to shelter \ntheir income from taxation.\n  Section 401 of the bill would tackle the problem by giving the \nTreasury Secretary the discretion to designate offshore tax havens as \n``uncooperative'' and to publish an annual list of these uncooperative \ntax havens. The Treasury Secretary is intended to develop this list by \nevaluating the actual record of cooperation experienced by the United \nStates in its dealings with specific jurisdictions around the world. \nWhile many offshore tax havens have recently signed treaties with the \nUnited States promising for the first time to cooperate with U.S. civil \nand criminal tax enforcement, it is undetermined what level of \ncooperation will actually result. For example, after one country signed \na tax treaty with the United States, the government that led the effort \nwas voted out of office by treaty opponents. Treasury needs a way to \nensure that tax treaty obligations are met and to send a message to \njurisdictions that impede U.S. tax enforcement. This bill will help \nTreasury get the cooperation it needs.\n  in addition to authorizing Treasury to publish an annual list of \nuncooperative tax havens, section 401 and 402 of the bill would deter \nuse of uncooperative tax havens by imposing two types of restrictions \non taxpayers doing business in the designated jurisdictions. First, \ntaxpayers would be required to provide greater disclosure of their \nactivities on their tax returns, including disclosing on their returns \nany payment above $10,000 to a person or account located in a \ndesignated tax haven. Second, the bill would disallow any tax benefits, \nsuch as foreign tax credits or deferral of taxation, for income \nattributable to a designated tax haven. These restrictions would \nprovide the United States with powerful weapons to compel tax havens to \nbegin to cooperate with U.S. tax enforcement efforts.\n  In addition to addressing the need to increase tax shelter penalties, \ncodify the economic substance doctrine and deter use of uncooperative \ntax havens, the bill includes a number of measures in Title II that \nwould address other aspects of abusive tax shelters. I'd like to \ndiscuss a few of these.\n  Title II of the bill includes a number of additional measures to \ncrack down on abusive tax dodges. Section 201 of the bill would, in \npart, direct the Department of the Treasury to issue as part of \nCircular 230 new standards for tax practitioners issuing opinion \nletters on the tax implications of tax shelters. The public has \ntraditionally relied on tax opinion letters to obtain informed and \ntrustworthy advice about whether a tax-motivated transaction meets the \nrequirements of the law. The investigation conducted by the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations found that, in too many cases, tax \nopinion letters no longer contain disinterested and reliable tax \nadvice, even when issued by supposedly reputable accounting or law \nfirms. Instead, too many tax opinion letters have become marketing \ntools used by tax shelter promoters and their allies to sell clients on \ntheir latest tax products. In too many of these cases, financial \ninterests and biases were concealed, unreasonable factual assumptions \nwere used to justify dubious legal conclusions, and taxpayers were \nmisled about the risks that the proposed transaction would later be \ndesignated an illegal tax shelter. Reforms are essential to address \nthese abuses and restore the integrity of tax opinion letters issued by \nreputable firms.\n  Treasury recently proposed standards that would address some of the \nongoing abuses affecting tax shelter opinion letters; however, the \nproposed standards do not take all the steps needed. Our bill would \nrequire Treasury to issue standards addressing a wider spectrum of tax \nshelter opinion letter problems, including: (1) the independence of the \nopinion letter writer from tax shelter promoters, (2) collaboration \namong letter writers resulting in joint financial interest, (3) \navoidance of conflicts of interest that would impair auditor \nindependence, (4) review and approval procedures by a firm for opinion \nletters issued in the name of the firm, (5) reliance on reasonable \nfactual representations, and (6) the appropriateness of fee charges. By \naddressing each of these areas, Circular 230 could help reduce the \nongoing abusive practices related to tax shelter opinion letters.\n  During the November tax shelter hearings before the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson testified \nthat his agency was barred by section 6103 of the tax code from \ncommunicating information to other Federal agencies that would assist \nthose agencies in their law enforcement duties. He indicated, for \nexample, that the IRS was barred from providing tax return information \nto the SEC, Federal bank regulators, and the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board, or PCAOB, even when that information might assist a \nFederal agency in evaluating whether an abusive tax shelter resulted in \ndeceptive accounting in a public company's financial statements, \nwhether a bank selling tax products to its clients had violated the law \nagainst promoting abusive tax shelters, or whether an accounting firm \nhad impaired its independence by selling tax shelters to its audit \nclients.\n\n  These communication barriers between our key Federal civil \nenforcement agencies are outdated, inefficient, and ill-suited to \nstopping the torrent of tax shelter abuses now affecting or being \npromoted by so many of our public companies, banks, and accounting \nfirms. To address this problem, section 203 of the bill would authorize \nthe Treasury Secretary, with appropriate privacy safeguards, to \ndisclose to the SEC, Federal banking agencies, and the PCAOB, upon \nrequest, tax return information related to abusive tax shelters, \ninappropriate tax avoidance, or tax evasion. The agencies could then \nuse this information only for law enforcement purposes, such as \npreventing accounting firms or banks from promoting abusive tax \nshelters or aiding or abetting tax evasion, and detecting and punishing \naccounting fraud related to illegal tax shelters employed by public \ncompanies. Improved information sharing for law enforcement purposes \nwould greatly aid our agencies in their enforcement efforts.\n  The bill would also provide for increased disclosure to Congress. \nSection 204 of the bill would make it clear, for example, that \ncompanies providing tax return preparation services to taxpayers cannot \nrefuse to comply with a Congressional document subpoena by citing a \nconsumer protection provision in the tax code, section 7216, \nprohibiting tax return preparers from disclosing taxpayer information \nto third parties. Several accounting and law firms raised this claim in \nresponse to document subpoenas issued by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, contending they were barred by the nondisclosure \nprovision in section 721 from producing documents related to the sale \nof abusive tax shelters to clients for a fee. The accounting and law \nfirms maintained this position despite an analysis provided by the \nSenate legal counsel showing that the nondisclosure provision was never \nintended to create a privilege or to override a Senate subpoena, as \ndemonstrated in Federal regulations interpreting the provision. To \nclarify the law, the bill would codify the existing regulations \ninterpreting section 7216 and make it clear that congressional document \nsubpoenas must be honored.\n  Section 204 would also ensure Congress has access to information \nabout decisions by Treasury related to an organization's tax exempt \nstatus. A 2003 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Tax \nAnalysts v. IRS, struck down certain IRS regulations and held that the \nIRS must disclose letters denying or revoking an organization's tax \nexempt status to the public. The IRS has been reluctant to disclose \nsuch information, not only to the public, but also to Congress, \nincluding in response to requests by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. This\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nsection of the bill would make it clear that, upon receipt of a request \nform a Congressional committee or subcommittee, the IRS must disclose \ndocuments, other than a tax return, related to the agency's \ndetermination to grant, deny, revoke or restore an organization's \nexemption from taxation.\n  Still another finding of the subcommittee investigation is that tax \npractitioners are circumventing current State and Federal constraints \non charging tax service fees that are contingent on actual or projected \ntax savings. Traditionally, accounting firms charged flat fees or \nhourly fees for their tax services. In the 1990s, however, they began \ncharging ``value added'' fees based on, in the words of a one \naccounting firm's manual, ``the value of the services provided, as \nopposed to the time required to perform the services.'' In addition, \nsome firms began charging ``contingent fees'' that were based on a \nclient's obtaining specified results from the services offered, such as \nprojected tax savings. In response, many States prohibited accounting \nfirms from charging contingent fees for tax work to avoid creating \nincentives for these firms to devise ways to shelter substantial sums. \nThe SEC and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants also \nissued rules restricting contingent fees, allowing them in only limited \ncircumstances.\n  The subcommittee investigation found that tax shelter fees, which are \ntypically substantial and sometimes exceed $1 million, are often linked \nto the taxpayer's projected tax savings or paper losses to be used to \nshelter income from taxation. For example, in three tax shelters \nexamined by the Subcommittee, documents show that the fees were equal \nto a percentage of the paper loss to be generated by the transaction. \nIn one case, the fees were typically set at 7 percent of the \ntransaction's generated ``tax loss'' that clients could sue to shelter \nother taxable income. In addition, other evidence indicated that, in at \nleast some instances, a tax advisor was willing to deliberately \nmanipulate the way it handled certain tax products to circumvent the \ncontingent fee prohibitions. One internal document at an accounting \nfirm related to a specific tax shelter, for example, identified the \nstates that prohibited contingent fees. Then, rather than prohibit the \ntax shelter transactions in those States or require an alternative fee \nstructure, the memorandum directed the firm's tax professionals to make \nsure the engagement letter was signed, the engagement was managed, and \nthe bulk of services was performed ``in a jurisdiction that does not \nprohibit contingency fees.''\n  Right now, the prohibitions on contingent fees are complex and must \nbe evaluated in the context of a patchwork of Federal, State and \nprofessional ethics rules. Section 205 of the bill would simplify the \nexisting prohibitions on contingency fees by putting into place a \nsingle enforceable rule, applicable nationwide, that would prohibit tax \npractitioners from charging fees which are ``contingent upon the actual \nor projected achievement of Federal tax savings or benefits, or of \nlosses which can be used to offset other taxable income.''\n  Section 206 of the bill would establish that it is the sense of the \nSenate that additional funds should be appropriated for IRS \nenforcement, and that the IRS should devote proportionately more of its \nenforcement funds to combat rampant tax shelter and tax haven abuses. \nSpecifically, the bill would direct increased funding toward \nenforcement efforts combating the promotion of abusive tax shelters for \ncorporations and high net worth individuals and the aiding and abetting \nof tax evasion; the involvement of accounting, law and financial firms \nin such promotion and aiding and abetting; and the use of offshore \nfinancial account to conceal taxable income.\n  In a bipartisan letter that was recently sent to the Senate \nappropriations committee by Senators Coleman, Collins, Lieberman and \nmyself, we wrote that, ``Tax enforcement is one area where a relatively \nsmall increase in spending can pay for itself many times over.'' Tens \nof billions in revenues that should support this country would actually \nreach the Treasury if we would hire adequate enforcement personnel, \nclose the tax loopholes, and put an end to tax dodges.\n  It is past time to get serious about tax shelter abuses, \nuncooperative tax havens, and the tax dodgers who use them. This bill \nwould send the message to tax dodgers that their shenanigans are \nunfair, unpatriotic, and unacceptable. We need to stop putting a \ndisproportionate burden on the shoulders of the average American and \nmake sure all taxpayers are paying their fair share.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Summary of Senator Levin's Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act\n\n       (See attached, more detailed summary that reflects which \n     parts of this bill are patterned after or incorporated in the \n     Grassley/Baucus revenue raisers that have previously passed \n     the Senate and are included in the upcoming JOBS Act.)\n       Title I--Strengthen Tax Shelter Penalties:\n       Strengthen penalties for promoting abusive tax shelters, \n     aiding or abetting tax evasion, failing to register or \n     disclose potentially abusive tax shelters, failing to \n     maintain and disclose required tax shelter client lists, and \n     failing to disclose offshore bank accounts;\n       Extend statute of limitations for undisclosed tax shelters; \n     and\n       Expand injunctive relief to stop certain conduct related to \n     abusive tax shelters.\n       Title II--Prevent Abusive Tax Shelters:\n       Authorize censure, civil fines, and tax shelter opinion \n     standards for tax practitioners;\n       Expand tax shelter exception to tax practitioner privilege \n     to cover all abusive tax shelters;\n       Authorize IRS to disclose certain tax shelter information \n     to certain federal agencies to strengthen civil law \n     enforcement;\n       Increase disclosure of certain tax shelter promoter \n     information to Congress;\n       Prohibit use of fees contingent on specified amount of tax \n     avoidance; and\n       Sense of the Senate on IRS tax enforcement priorities, \n     advocating more enforcement funds and more enforcement action \n     to stop tax shelter promoters and combat use of offshore bank \n     accounts to conceal taxable income.\n       Title III--Require Economic Substance:\n       Clarify and codify the economic substance doctrine;\n       Strenghten penalty for tax transactions lacking economic \n     substance; and\n       Eliminate tax deduction for interest on unpaid taxes \n     attributable to transactions determined to be without \n     economic substance.\n       Title IV--Deter Uncooperative Tax Havens:\n       Require disclosure of payments to uncooperative tax havens; \n     and\n       Restrict tax benefits for income earned in uncooperative \n     tax havens.\n\n\n              title i--strengthening Tax shelter penalties\n\n     Sections 101-109\n       Strengthens the penalties for (see chart on last page of \n     this summary): promoting abusive tax shelters (Sec. 101); \n     knowingly aiding or abetting a taxpayer in understating tax \n     liability (Sec. 102); failing to register potentially abusive \n     tax shelters with the IRS or to provide required information \n     about such shelters to the IRS (Sec. 103, Sec. 106); failing \n     to maintain and disclose to the IRS upon request tax shelter \n     client lists (Sec. 104); and failing to disclose offshore \n     bank accounts (Sec. 109).\n       Extends statute of limitations for undisclosed tax shelters \n     (Sec. 107), and expands the IRS' ability to seek injunctions \n     against tax shelter promoters and material advisors \n     (Sec. 108). Modeled after provisions in the Grassley/Baucus \n     legislation that has passed the Senate three times.\n\n\n         title ii--preventing abusive tax shelter transactions\n\n     Section 201--Authorize censure, civil fines, and tax shelter \n         opinion standards for tax practitioners\n       Authorizes Treasury to censure or impose civil fines on tax \n     practitioners (such as accountants and attorneys) who violate \n     specified standards of practice in Circular 230, for persons \n     representing clients before the IRS. Modeled after provision \n     in the Grassley/Baucus legislation that has passed the Senate \n     three times.\n       Directs Treasury to issue Circular 230 standards for tax \n     practitioners providing ``opinion letters'' on specific tax \n     shelter transactions. Requires standards to address: (1) \n     independence of letter writer from tax shelter promoters, (2) \n     collaboration among letter writers resulting in joint \n     financial interests, (3) avoidance of conflicts of interest \n     that would impair auditor independence, (4) review and \n     approval by a firm of opinion letters issued in the name of \n     the firm, (5) reasonable reliance on factual representations, \n     and (6) the appropriateness of fee charges. Expands upon \n     standards recently proposed by Treasury.\n     Section 202--Expand tax shelter exception to tax practitioner \n         privilege\n       Expands existing tax shelter exception to the \n     confidentiality privilege for communications between a \n     federally authorized tax practitioner and taxpayer, so that \n     the exception applies to communications not only about \n     corporate tax shelters, but other tax\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n     shelters as well. Modeled after provision in the Grassley/\n     Baucus legislation that has passed the Senate three times.\n     Sections 203-204--Increase disclosure of certain tax shelter \n         information\n       Authorizes Treasury to share certain tax return information \n     with the SEC, federal bank regulators, or PCAOB, under \n     certain circumstances, to enhance tax shelter enforcement or \n     combat financial accounting fraud. (Sec. 204)\n       Clarifies that Congress has the same subpoena authority as \n     federal, state, and local authorities to obtain information \n     from tax return preparers. Expands Congress' authority to \n     obtain certain tax information (but not a taxpayer return) \n     from Treasury related to an IRS decision to grant, deny, \n     revoke, or restore an organization's tax exempt status. \n     (Sec. 205)\n     Section 205--Prohibit tax service fees contingent on specific \n         tax savings\n       Prohibits charging a fee for tax services in an amount \n     contingent upon the actual or projected achievement of a \n     specified amount of tax savings or income loss to offset \n     taxable income. Builds on existing contingent fee \n     prohibitions in more than 20 states, AICPA rules applicable \n     to accountants, and SEC regulations applicable to auditors of \n     publicly traded corporations. Based upon investigation by \n     Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showing tax \n     practitioners are circumventing current constraints.\n     Section 206--``Sense of the Senate'' on IRS Enforcement \n         Priorities\n       Establishes the Sense of the Senate that additional funds \n     should be appropriated for IRS enforcement, and that the IRS \n     should devote proportionately more of its enforcement funds \n     to combat: (1) the promotion of abusive tax shelters for \n     corporations and high net worth individuals and the aiding or \n     abetting of tax evasion, (2) the involvement of accounting, \n     law and financial firms in such promotion and aiding or \n     abetting, and (3) the use of offshore financial accounts to \n     conceal taxable income.\n\n\n                title iii--requiring economic substance\n\n     Sections 301-303--Strengthen the Economic Substance Doctrine\n       Stengthens and codifies the economic substance doctrine to \n     invalidate transactions that have no economic substance or \n     business purpose apart from tax avoidance or evasion. Also \n     increases penalties for understatements and eliminates \n     deductibility of interest on unpaid taxes when the penalties \n     or interest are attributable to a transaction lacking in \n     economic substance. Modeled after provisions in the Grassley/\n     Baucus legislation that has passed the Senate three times. \n     Estimated to raise $13.7 billion over ten years.\n\n\n              title iv--deterring uncooperative tax havens\n\n     Section 401-402--Deter Uncooperative Tax Havens\n       Deters taxpayer use of uncooperative tax havens with \n     corporate, bank or tax secrecy laws, procedures, or practices \n     that impede U.S. enforcement of its tax laws by: (1) \n     requiring disclosure on taxpayer returns of any payments \n     above $10,000 to accounts or persons located in such tax \n     havens (Sec. 401), and (2) ending tax benefits for any income \n     earned in such tax havens (Sec. 402).

A bill to amend title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 to \nprovide that the provisions relating to countervailing duties apply to \nnonmarket economy countries; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Our Nation's manufacturers can compete \nagainst the best in the world, but they cannot compete against nations \nthat provide huge subsidies and other unfair advantages to their \nproducers. I hear from manufacturers in my State time and time again \nwhose efforts to compete successfully in the global economy simply \ncannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing and subsidies of \nnations such as China. The results of these unfair practices are lost \njobs, shuttered factories, and decimated communities.\n  Our Nation's trade remedy laws are intended to give American \nindustries and their employees relief from the effects of illegal trade \npractices. Yet, while U.S. anti-dumping laws can be currently applied \nto non-market economies, countervailing duty laws cannot. It is time \nthat this was changed.\n  This is why I am introducing the ``Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act.'' \nThis bill revises current trade remedy laws to ensure that U.S. \ncountervailing duty laws apply to imports from non-market economies. It \nis simply not fair to prevent U.S. industries from seeking redress from \nthese unfair trade practices because our trade remedy laws are \noutdated.\n  Over the past two decades, there have been significant economic \nchanges in many of the countries classified as non-market economies. \nThis is particularly true in China, one of our largest trading partners \nand the country with which the United States currently runs its largest \ntrade deficit.\n  At the time our Nation's countervailing duty laws were approved in \n1979, it was impracticable to apply these laws to China. In 1979, \nChina's economy was still centrally planned, and most of its economic \noutput was directed and controlled by the state, which set production \ngoals, controlled prices, and allocated the country's resources. When \nan entire economy is controlled by the government, it is difficult, if \nnot impossible, to determine what defines a government subsidy that \ncauses harm to U.S. industries.\n  But beginning in the early 1980's and continuing today, China has \nundertaken major economic reforms. Today, China's economy is a far cry \nfrom being completely state-controlled. Government price controls on a \nwide range of products have been eliminated. Many enterprises and even \nentire industries have been allowed to operate and compete in an \neconomic system that has elements of a free market. Many coastal \nregions and coastal cities in China have been designated as so-called \n``open'' cities and development zones, where there is a free market and \ntax and trade incentives are offered to attract foreign investment. \nAnd, of course, china has taken steps toward fully integrating into the \nglobal trading system by joining to the World Trade Organization and by \nworking toward the establishment of a modern commercial, financial, \nlegal, and regulatory infrastructure.\n  The problem is not China's economic liberalization and modernization. \nThe problem is this: now that China has the capacity to be a key \ninternational economic player, the country has repeatedly refused to \ncomply with standard international trading rules and practices. And \nthese violations include the use of subsidies and other economic \nincentives that are designed to give its producers an unfair \ncompetitive advantage.\n  The most glaringly obvious subsidy comes in the form of currency \nmanipulation. By keeping the Chinese yuan pegged to the U.S. dollar at \nartificially low levels, the Chinese undervalue the prices of their \nexports. Not only does this practice provide their producers with a \nprice advantage, but also it violates the International Monetary Fund \nand WTO rules. The Chinese government also reimburses many enterprises \nfor their operating losses and provides loans to uncreditworthy \ncompanies.\n  Currently, U.S. industries have no direct recourse to combat these \nunfair practices. They instead must rely upon government-to-government \nnegotiations or the dispute settlement processes of international \norganizations such as the WTO. While these channels might eventually \nlead to relief, it usually takes years to see results--and by that \ntime, that industry could already be decimated.\n  Mr. President, unfair market conditions cannot continue to cause our \nmanufacturers to hemorrhage jobs. No State understands this more than \nmy home State of Maine. According to a study by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, on a percentage basis, Maine has lost \nmore manufacturing jobs in the past three years than any other State.\n  There are many reasons for manufacturing job losses, including heavy \ntax and regulatory burdens. This is why I recently introduced a bill \nthat would provide a variety of tax incentives for our Nation's \nmanufacturers. However, without a level international playing field, \ntax reductions will not be enough to stop the flight of U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Industries across Maine that produce products ranging from paper to \nfootwear to furniture are being harmed by unfair trade practices, and \nit is time that we put a stop to it. I ask you to join me in supporting \nthe SOS bill to ensure that all countries are held accountable for \ntheir trade practices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2213. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \nresearch on indicators of child well-being; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday designed to enhance child well-being in every State by collecting \ndata on a State-by-State basis to provide information to advocates and \npolicy makers about the well-being of children. My hope is that this \nlegislation could be incorporated into a welfare reform reauthorization \npackage. I believe that the Senate should reauthorize our welfare \nprogram, known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and we \nshould do it soon. But when we reauthorize TANF we must significantly \ninvest in child care which is essential for parents to move from \nwelfare to work, and to be successful on the job once they leave the \nofficial welfare rolls.\n  In 1996 this body took a bold step forward in reforming welfare. The \ndriving force behind this reform was to promote work and self-\nsufficiency for families and to provide flexibility to States to \nachieve these goals.\n  States have used this flexibility to design different programs that \nwork better for families who rely on them. Because of vast variation \namong State programs, there is an obvious need for research on child \nwell-being for each State. We currently use the Survey of Income and \nProgram Participation (SIPP) to evaluate the progress of welfare. It is \nan important national longitudinal study designed to provide rich, \ndetailed data; the kinds of data most useful to academic researchers. \nIt does not, however, provide States with good, timely data to help \nthem more effectively accomplish the goals set forth in welfare reform.\n  This bill, the State Child Well Being Research Act of 2004, is \nintended to fill this information gap by collecting timely, State-\nspecific data that can be used by policy-makers, researchers, and child \nadvocates to assess the well being of children. It would require that a \nsurvey examine the physical and emotional health of children, \nadequately represent the experiences of families in individual States, \nbe consistent across States, be collected annually, articulate results \nin easy to understand terms, and focus on low-income children and \nfamilies.\n  The proposed legislation will provide data for all States, including \nsmall rural States like West Virginia. Further, this bill avoids some \nof the other problems that plague the current system by making data \nfiles easier to use and more readily available. As a result, the \ninformation will be more useful for policy-makers managing welfare \nreform and programs for children and families. When we reauthorize \nwelfare reform, it will be essential for us to make a modest investment \nin research for every State.\n  Several private charitable foundations, including the Annie E. Casey, \nJohn D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, and McKnight foundations have \nwritten Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus in support of such \nresearch. These foundations have offered to form a partnership to \nprovide outreach and support and to guarantee that the data\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\ncollected would be broadly disseminated. This type of public-private \npartnership helps to leverage additional resources for children and \nfamilies and increases the study's impact.\n  One of the most important ways that Congress can demonstrate its \ncommitment to welfare reform and attempt to help States reach the goals \noutlined in 1996 is to incorporate a strong research component in the \nwelfare reform reauthorization bill. Since each State has used its \nflexibility to creative innovative welfare reform programs, and many \nare quite different, we need State-by-State data on basic aspects of \nchild well-being. I hope that my colleagues will support this bill so \nthat we can give States the information they need to monitor and \nimprove child well-being.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2214. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 3150 Great Northern Avenue in Missoula, Montana, as \nthe ``Mike Mansfield Post Office''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my honor to present this bill to \ndesignate the United States Postal Service facility at 3150 Great \nNorthern Avenue in Missoula, MT as the ``Mike Mansfield Post Office.''\n  I rise today not just as a Republican honoring a Democrat, but rather \nas a Montanan recognizing the most beloved political figure of our \nhistory. Mr. Mansfield holds a special place in the hearts of all \nMontanans, a man whose wisdom, humility, and decency have been sorely \nmissed.\n  Michael Joseph Mansfield was born in New York City on March 16, 1903. \nFollowing the death of his mother at age 7, Mike was sent to Great \nFalls, MT to live with an aunt and uncle.\n  As World War I developed, the 14-year-old Mansfield saw an \nopportunity to serve his country, and lied about his age in order to \njoin the U.S. Navy. He eventually enlisted in the Army and Marine Corps \nas well. During this service he was stationed in the Philippines and \nChina, a time that marked the beginning of a lifelong love for the \ncontinent, its people, and their culture.\n  After being honorably discharged from the Marines, Mike Mansfield \nreturned to Montana as a 19-year-old lacking a high school education. \nHe found a job in the Butte mines, shoveling rock as a `mucker.' It was \nduring his time in Butte that Mr. Mansfield met his lifetime partner \nand companion, Maureen Hayes. It was Maureen who saw in Mike his \nenormous potential and convinced him to go to college. With her \nfinancial support, Mansfield obtained his high school equivalency, \nB.A., and M.A. from the Montana State University, now the University of \nMontana. Mr. Mansfield taught Latin American and East Asian history for \n8 years at the University, retaining lifelong tenure as Professor of \nHistory.\n  Mr. Mansfield began his extraordinary public service career in 1942 \nwhen he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served \nfour more terms before being elected to the Senate in 1952. Within 4 \nyears, he was elected majority whip and in 1961 he was chosen as the \nSenate Majority Leader. Mike would go on to hold this position for 17 \nyears, longer than any other man in the history of this great body.\n  As Senate Majority Leader, Mr. Mansfield is remembered as a truly \nunique figure, a pragmatist whose sensibility, practicality, and \nunrelenting pursuit of results almost always transcended ideological \nconcerns. More Senate leader than Majority Leader, Mansfield preferred \nnot to draw a metaphorical line in the sand. Instead, he sought to \nguide the body as a whole to a fair and agreeable determination.\n  In 1977, upon his retirement from the Senate, Mr. Mansfield was \nappointed Ambassador to Japan by President Carter; a post he held \nthrough 1989. This position offered Mike a chance to utilize his vast \nexperience in Asian affairs, in a region that he truly loved. In the \nspirit of this admiration, the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation \ncontinues to encourage dialogue and cooperation between the United \nStates and Asia.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this dedication of a postal \nfacility is but a small token of gratitude for the many years of \nexceptional service given to this body, this Nation, and Montana by \nthis wonderful man. The ever modest and humble Mansfield would have \nshied at such a tribute; we might even expect him to offer the names of \npeople more deserving of the honor than he. In truth, I can think of no \none more deserving of praise than Mike Mansfield, a true hero of the \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n        Smith):\n  S. 2215. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfunds for campus mental and behavioral health service centers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Campus Care \nand Counseling Act along with my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith and my colleague from New York, \nSenator Clinton. The recent rash of suicides on college campuses has \nhighlighted a mental health crisis. Just this past week, Diana Chien, a \n19 year old student at New York University ended her life by jumping \noff a building. Our own colleagues, the Senator from Oregon, suffered a \ntragic loss when his son, Garret, took his life last September. \nSuicides take the lives of over 4,000 children and young adults \nannually. It is now the third leading cause of death among 10-24 year \nolds. The rate of suicide has tripled from 1952 to 1995. How many more \nof our children will be lost before we take action to prevent their \nuntimely demise? When will we start to say to them that there is an \nanswer; that suicide is not the way out; that we can help them feel \nbetter; that they can live happier and healthier lives?\n  College is a time of great intellectual development--and it is also a \ntime of exponential personal and interpersonal growth and change. When \nchildren go off to college, we need to be sure that they are going to a \nplace that will help them reach their boundless potential. We also need \nto make sure that it will also support them through the transition to \nadulthood and during their greatest hour of need. Additionally, many \nmore adults are going to college, and they too face challenges, \nparticularly in balancing school, work, and family responsibilities. We \ncan and should do more to address the significant lack in this area.\n  A Chronicle of Higher Education survey found that rates for \ndepression in college freshmen have nearly doubled from 8.2 percent to \n16.3 percent. Without treatment, the Chronicle reports that ``depressed \nadolescents are at risk for school failure, social isolation, \npromiscuity, self-medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide.'' A \n2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center Directors found that 85 \npercent of college counseling centers are reporting an increase in the \nnumber of students in need of services, 81 percent were concerned about \nincreasing numbers of students with severe psychological problems, 67 \npercent reported a need for more psychiatric services, and 6.3 percent \nreported problems with growing demand for services without an \nappropriate increase in resources. Clearly, many students with serious \nneeds do not have access to psychiatric or other mental and behavioral \nhealth services.\n  This is an issue that my office has been working on with the American \nPsychological Association since 2002. In light of the forthcoming \ndebate on the Higher Education Act Reauthorization and the recent spate \nof college campus suicides, I am introducing the ``Campus Care and \nCounseling Act.'' This bill amends the Higher Education Act to \nauthorize $10 million in peer-reviewed competitive grants to \ninstitutions of higher education to increase access and enhance mental \nand behavioral health services for our college students. Grants may be \nused for the prevention, screening, early intervention, assessment, \ntreatment, management, and education activities related to mental and \nbehavioral health problems. Taking into consideration that education \ncreates awareness, these funds may also be used to educate parents, to \nhire staff, and to expand training. To address the stigma of mental \nillness, programs funded through this grant will need to focus their \nefforts on developing outreach strategies to reach those students most \nin need of services.\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n  My colleagues in the Senate, this is an important bipartisan measure \nwhich will help to ensure that our nation's college students will have \naccess to quality mental and behavioral health care so that they \nreceive the help needed to not only survive through their difficult \ntimes in college, but also to excel and accomplish all that is within \ntheir reach. I want to also thank the American Psychiatric Association \nand other organizations for their assistance in shaping this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to join myself and Senators DeWine \nand Smith in enacting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Care and Counseling \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college \n     counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of \n     students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, \n     the American College Health Association found that 61 percent \n     of college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent \n     said they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 \n     percent felt suicidal.\n       (2) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of \n     depression among college students. According to a survey \n     described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, \n     2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2 \n     percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers \n     recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for \n     school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self \n     medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third \n     leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''.\n       (3) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in \n     Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-\n     2001) at Kansas State University stated that ``students are \n     experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than \n     they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education, \n     February 14, 2003).\n       (4) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug \n     Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college students \n     use illicit drugs.\n       (5) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also \n     reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are \n     dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In \n     addition, the study found that ``serious mental illness is \n     highly correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among \n     adults with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were \n     dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the \n     rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 \n     percent.''.\n       (6) A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center \n     Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the \n     increasing number of students with more serious psychological \n     problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric \n     services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing \n     demand for services without an appropriate increase in \n     resources.\n       (7) The International Association of Counseling Services \n     accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n     1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher's Survey of \n     Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to \n     students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at \n     institutions of higher education with more than 15,000 \n     students.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve the health of health disparity \npopulations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRIST: Mr. President, today I am introducing additional \nlegislation to address health disparities.\n  On February 12th I joined with Senator Landrieu, Senator Cochran, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Bond and Senator Talent to introduce the \n``Closing the Health Care Gap Act of 2004.'' Today I am introducing \nsimilar legislation to that introduced several weeks ago with one \nsignificant addition. This additional provision directly addresses the \nproblem of access to health insurance for low income Americans.\n  We know that millions of Americans still experience disparities in \nhealth outcomes as a result of ethnicity, race, gender, or limited \naccess to quality health care. For example, disparity populations \nexhibit poorer health outcomes and have higher rates of HIV/AIDS, \ndiabetes, infant mortality, cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. \nAfrican Americans and Native Americans die younger than any other \nracial or ethnic group. African Americans and Native American babies \ndie at significantly higher rates than the rest of the population. \nAfrican Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans are at least \ntwice as likely to suffer from diabetes and experience serious \ncomplications from diabetes.\n  These gaps are simply unacceptable. Every American deserves the best \nquality of health care possible, regardless of their race, ethnicity, \ngender, or where they live.\n  There is a growing awareness on the national level of the existence \nand importance of the serious disparities in the quality of health care \nthat many minority and underserved Americans receive. And this presents \nus with an important opportunity to move forward.\n  The legislation we introduced on February 12th and the legislation I \nintroduce today does this by focusing on these 5 key areas: expanding \naccess to quality health care; strengthening national efforts and \ncoordination; helping increase the diversity of health professionals; \npromoting more aggressive health professional education intended to \nreduce barriers to care; and enhancing research to identify sources of \nracial, ethnic, and geographic disparities and assess promising \nintervention strategies.\n  However, the legislation I am introducing today goes farther. This \nlegislation includes a provision based on President Bush's proposal to \nprovide refundable health insurance tax credits to lower income \nAmericans. I believe that the improved access to affordable medical \ncare fostered by this tax credit will be yet one more critical \ncomponent to the overall effort to reduce disparities in health care \nfor America's vulnerable populations.\n  My intention is to continue to build awareness of these health care \ndisparities and thereby provide the basis for bipartisan efforts to \nfight and reduce them. I think today's bill introduction represents yet \nanother key step in this process. It is my hope that, working together, \nmembers of this body can make substantial progress in reducing and \neliminating disparities.\n  Iask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The overall health of Americans has dramatically \n     improved over the last century, and Americans are justifiably \n     proud of the great strides that have been made in the health \n     and medical sciences.\n       (2) As medical science and technology have advanced at a \n     rapid pace, however, the health care delivery system has not \n     been able to provide consistently high quality care to all \n     Americans.\n       (3) In particular, people of lower socioeconomic status, \n     racial and ethnic minorities, and medically underserved \n     populations have experienced poor health and challenges in \n     accessing high quality health care.\n       (4) Recent studies have raised significant questions \n     regarding differences in clinical care provided to racial and \n     ethnic minorities and other health disparity populations. \n     These differences are often grouped together under the broad \n     heading of ``health disparities''.\n       (5) Studies indicate that a gap exists between ideal health \n     care and the actual health care that some Americans receive.\n       (6) Data collection, analysis, and reporting by race, \n     ethnicity, and primary language across federally supported \n     health programs are essential for identifying, understanding \n     the causes of, monitoring, and eventually eliminating health \n     disparities.\n       (7) Current health related data collection and reporting \n     activities largely reflect the efforts of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services. Despite considerable efforts by \n     the Department, data collection efforts governing racial, \n     ethnic, and health disparity populations remain inconsistent \n     and inadequate. They often quantify disparities but shed \n     little light on their causes.\n       (8) Many Americans, and particularly racial and ethnic \n     minorities and other health disparity populations, miss \n     opportunities for preventive medical care. Similarly, \n     management of chronic illnesses in these populations presents \n     unique challenges to the nation's health care system.\n       (9) The largest numbers of the medically underserved are \n     white individuals, and many of them have the same health care \n     access problems as do members of minority groups. Nearly \n     22,000,000 white individuals live below the poverty line with \n     many living in nonmetropolitan, rural areas such as \n     Appalachia, where the high percentage of countries designated \n     as health professional shortage areas (47 percent) and the \n     high rate of poverty contribute to disparity outcomes. \n     However, there is a higher proportion of racial and ethnic \n     minorities in the United States represented among the \n     medically underserved.\n       (10) While much research examines the question of racial \n     and ethnic differences in health care, less is known about \n     the magnitude and extent of differences in the quality of \n     health care related to nonsocioeconomic factors. Only \n     recently have scientists and quality improvement experts \n     begun to address the issue of how best to measure, track, and \n     improve quality of health care in diverse populations. \n     Additional research in order to understand the\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\n     causes of disparities and develop effective approaches to \n     eliminate these gaps in health care quality will be \n     necessary.\n       (11) There is a need to ensure appropriate representation \n     of racial and ethnic minorities, and other health disparity \n     populations, in the health care professions and in the fields \n     of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health services \n     research.\n       (12) Preventable disparities in access to and quality of \n     health care are unacceptable. Health care delivered in the \n     United States should be care that is as safe, effective, \n     patient-centered, timely, efficient and equitable as \n     possible.\n\nTITLE I--IMPROVED HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVE DATA COLLECTION AND \n                                ANALYSIS\n\n     SEC. 101.

The border \n     States of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas are \n     suffering from one of the worst droughts in history. In \n     Arizona, this is the second driest period in recorded history \n     and the worst since 1904.\n       (2) In spite of decades of water conservation in the \n     southwest United States, irrigated agriculture uses more than \n     60 percent of surface and ground water.\n       (3) The most inadequate water supplies in the United States \n     are in the Southwest, including the lower Colorado River \n     basin and the Great Plains River basins south of the Platte \n     River. In these areas, 70 percent of the water taken from the \n     stream is not returned.\n       (4) The amount of water being pumped out of groundwater \n     sources in many areas is greater than the amount being \n     replenished, thus depleting the groundwater supply.\n       (5) On August 20, 2002, the Board of the North American \n     Development Bank agreed to the creation in the bank of a \n     Water Conservation Investment Fund.\n       (6) The Water Conservation Investment Fund of the North \n     American Development Bank stated that up to $80,000,000 would \n     be available for grant financing of water conservation \n     projects, which grant funds would be divided equally between \n     the United States and Mexico.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) water conservation projects are eligible for funding \n     from the North American Development Bank under the Agreement \n     Between the Government of the United States of America and \n     the Government of the United Mexican States Concerning the \n     Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission \n     and a North American Development Bank;\n       (2) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n     support qualified water conservation projects that can assist \n     irrigators and agricultural producers; and\n       (3) the Board of the North American Development Bank should \n     take into consideration the needs of all of the border states \n     before approving funding for water projects, and strive to \n     fund water conservation projects in each of the border \n     states.\n\n     SEC. 6.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Victims' Economic Security \n     and Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Domestic violence crimes account for approximately 15 \n     percent of total crime costs in the United States each year.\n       (2) Violence against women has been reported to be the \n     leading cause of physical injury to women. Such violence has \n     a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional health \n     and financial security.\n       (3) According to recent government surveys, from 1993 \n     through 1998 the average annual number of violent \n     victimizations committed by intimate partners was 1,082,110, \n     87 percent of which were committed against women. Female \n     murder victims were substantially more likely than male \n     murder victims to have been killed by an intimate partner. \n     About \\1/3\\ of female murder victims, and about 4 percent of \n     male murder victims, were killed by an intimate partner.\n       (4) According to recent government estimates, approximately \n     987,400 rapes occur annually in the United States, 89 percent \n     of the rapes perpetrated against female victims.\n       (5) Approximately 10,200,000 people have been stalked at \n     some time in their lives. Four out of every 5 stalking \n     victims are women. Stalkers harass and terrorize their \n     victims by spying on the victims, standing outside their \n     places of work or homes, making unwanted phone calls, sending \n     or leaving unwanted letters or items, or vandalizing \n     property.\n       (6) Employees in the United States who have been victims of \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking too often suffer adverse consequences in the \n     workplace as a result of their victimization.\n       (7) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking are particularly vulnerable to changes \n     in employment, pay, and benefits as a result of their \n     victimizations, and are, therefore, in need of legal \n     protection.\n       (8) The prevalence of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, stalking, and other violence against women at \n     work is dramatic. Approximately 11 percent of all rapes occur \n     in the workplace. About 50,500 individuals, 83 percent of \n     whom are women, were raped or sexually assaulted in the \n     workplace each year from 1992 through 1996. Half of all \n     female victims of violent workplace crimes know their \n     attackers. Nearly 1 out of 10 violent workplace incidents are \n     committed by partners or spouses. Women who work for State or \n     local governments suffer a higher incidence of workplace \n     assaults, including rapes, than women who work in the private \n     sector.\n       (9) Homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the \n     job. Husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 percent \n     of workplace homicides against women.\n       (10) Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of \n     employed battered women surveyed were harassed at work by \n     their abusive partners.\n       (11) According to a 1998 report of the General Accounting \n     Office, between \\1/4\\ and \\1/2\\ of domestic violence victims \n     surveyed in 3 studies reported that the victims lost a job \n     due, at least in part, to domestic violence.\n       (12) Women who have experienced domestic violence or dating \n     violence are more likely than other women to be unemployed, \n     to suffer from health problems that can affect employability \n     and job performance, to report lower personal income, and to \n     rely on welfare.\n       (13) Abusers frequently seek to control their partners by \n     actively interfering with their ability to work, including \n     preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their \n     partners at work, limiting the access of their partners to \n     cash or transportation, and sabotaging the child care \n     arrangements of their partners.\n       (14) More than \\1/2\\ of women receiving welfare have been \n     victims of domestic violence as adults and between \\1/4\\ and \n     \\1/3\\ reported being abused in the last year.\n       (15) Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the \n     workplace, can impair an employee's work performance, require \n     time away from work, and undermine the employee's ability to \n     maintain a job. Almost 50 percent of sexual assault survivors \n     lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the \n     assaults.\n       (16) More than \\1/4\\ of stalking victims report losing time \n     from work due to the stalking and 7 percent never return to \n     work.\n       (17)(A) According to the National Institute of Justice, \n     crime costs an estimated $450,000,000,000 annually in medical \n     expenses, lost earnings, social service costs, pain, \n     suffering, and reduced quality of life for victims, which \n     harms the Nation's productivity and drains the Nation's \n     resources.\n       (B) Violent crime accounts for $426,000,000,000 per year of \n     this amount.\n       (C) Rape exacts the highest costs per victim of any \n     criminal offense, and accounts for $127,000,000,000 per year \n     of the amount described in subparagraph (A).\n       (18) Violent crime results in wage losses equivalent to 1 \n     percent of all United States earnings, and causes 3 percent \n     of the Nation's medical spending and 14 percent of the \n     Nation's injury-related medical spending.\n       (19) The Bureau of National Affairs has estimated that \n     domestic violence costs United States employers between \n     $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 annually in lost time and \n     productivity. Other reports have estimated that domestic \n     violence costs United States employers $13,000,000,000 \n     annually.\n       (20) United States medical costs for domestic violence have \n     been estimated to be $31,000,000,000 per year.\n       (21) Surveys of business executives and corporate security \n     directors also underscore the heavy toll that workplace \n     violence takes on women, businesses, and interstate commerce \n     in the United States.\n       (22) Ninety-four percent of corporate security and safety \n     directors at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a \n     high security concern.\n       (23) Forty-nine percent of senior executives recently \n     surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their \n     company's productivity, 47 percent said domestic violence \n     negatively affects attendance, and 44 percent said domestic \n     violence increases health care costs.\n       (24) Only 16 States have laws that explicitly provide \n     unemployment insurance to domestic violence victims in \n     certain circumstances, and none of the laws explicitly cover \n     victims of sexual assault or stalking.\n       (25) Only 2 States provide domestic violence victims with \n     leave from work to go to court, to the doctor, or to take \n     other steps to address the domestic violence in their lives, \n     and only Maine provides such leave to victims of sexual \n     assault and stalking.\n       (26) No States prohibit employment discrimination against \n     victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n     New York City is the only jurisdiction with a law prohibiting \n     employment discrimination against actual or perceived victims \n     of domestic violence.\n       (27) Employees, including individuals participating in \n     welfare to work programs, may need to take time during \n     business hours to--\n       (A) obtain orders of protection;\n       (B) seek medical or legal assistance, counseling, or other \n     services; or\n       (C) look for housing in order to escape from domestic \n     violence.\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n       (28) Domestic and sexual violence victims have been \n     subjected to discrimination by private and State employers, \n     including discrimination motivated by sex and stereotypical \n     notions about women.\n       (29) Existing Federal law does not explicitly--\n       (A) authorize victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work \n     to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or \n     assistance with safety planning activities;\n       (B) address the eligibility of victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for \n     unemployment compensation; or\n       (C) prohibit employment discrimination against actual or \n     perceived victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n     SEC. 103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children Who Witness \n     Domestic Violence Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Domestic violence and sexual assault occur frequently \n     in the United States. 1,500,000 women are raped or physically \n     assaulted by an intimate partner annually in the United \n     States, and 1 in 4 women in the United States will experience \n     domestic violence or sexual assault in her lifetime.\n       (2) At least 3,300,000 children in the United States are \n     exposed to parental violence every year.\n       (3) Child abuse and domestic violence often occur within \n     the same families. Because of this overlap, cross-training \n     for child welfare workers, courts, law enforcement, \n     prosecutors, and domestic violence and sexual assault victim \n     service providers is essential.\n       (4) Forty to 60 percent of men who abuse women also abuse \n     children.\n       (5) In 43 percent of households where intimate violence \n     occurs, at least 1 child under the age of 12 lives in the \n     home. Domestic violence has been shown to occur \n     disproportionately in homes with children under age 5.\n       (6) In most States, more than 50 percent of the residents \n     in battered women's shelters are children.\n       (7) As many as 500,000 children may be encountered by \n     police during domestic violence arrests each year.\n       (8) Children who live in homes where domestic violence \n     occurs are at a higher risk of anxiety and depression, and \n     exhibit more aggressive, antisocial, inhibited, and fearful \n     behaviors than other children.\n       (9) Children's experiences vary widely as the result of \n     their exposure to domestic violence depending on their family \n     situations, community environment, and the child's own \n     personality. Children need comprehensive services that serve \n     the continuum of their individual needs.\n       (10) Adolescents who have grown up in violent homes are at \n     risk for recreating the abusive relationships they have \n     observed. Forty percent of violent juvenile offenders come \n     from homes where there is domestic violence, and 50 percent \n     of children who come before delinquency court have been \n     exposed to violence in the home.\n       (11) Men who as children witnessed their parent's domestic \n     violence are twice as likely to abuse their own wives as are \n     sons of nonviolent parents. One-third of women who are \n     physically abused by a husband or boyfriend grew up in a \n     household where their mother was also abused.\n       (12) The most successful strategies for dealing with the \n     overlap between domestic violence and child abuse are those \n     that provide for the safety of both the children and the \n     nonabusing parent.\n       (13) Recent studies show that battered women parent \n     effectively and attend to their children's needs.\n       (14) In a major metropolitan area, 80 percent of surveyed \n     battered women with children reported that they and their \n     children were safe and together as a family after receiving \n     domestic violence advocacy services. In contrast, the rate of \n     substantiated cases of sexual abuse in foster care is more \n     than 4 times higher than the rate in the general population.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to--\n       (1) reduce the impact of domestic violence, sexual assault, \n     and stalking in the lives of youth and children;\n       (2) provide appropriate services for children and youth \n     experiencing or exposed to domestic violence, sexual assault, \n     and stalking;\n       (3) develop and implement education programs to prevent \n     children and youth from becoming victims or perpetrators of \n     domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;\n       (4) encourage cross training and collaboration among child \n     welfare agencies, domestic violence and sexual assault \n     service providers, courts, law enforcement entities,\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\n     health care professionals, crisis nurseries, and other social \n     services to recognize and responsibly address domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and the effects of domestic \n     violence on children and youth;\n       (5) promote the safety of children and youth by increasing \n     the safety, autonomy, capacity, and financial security of the \n     nonabusing parents who are also victims of domestic violence \n     and sexual assault so that they may remain safely together, \n     thereby preventing the unnecessary and harmful removal of the \n     child or youth from the nonabusing parent; and\n       (6) ensure the effective handling of cases where domestic \n     violence or sexual assault and child abuse and neglect \n     intersect in such a way that--\n       (A) holds the adult perpetrator of violence accountable;\n       (B) assures the safety and well-being of both the child and \n     the child's nonabusing parent; and\n       (C) prevents the unnecessary and harmful removal of the \n     child from the nonabusing parent thereby increasing the \n     child's chance to heal.\n\n     SEC. 204. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 320 of the Family Violence Prevention and Services \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 10408) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(7) The term `dating violence' means violence committed \n     by a person--\n       ``(A) who is or has been in a social relationship of a \n     romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and\n       ``(B) where the existence of such a relationship shall be \n     determined based on a consideration of--\n       ``(i) the length of the relationship;\n       ``(ii) the type of relationship; and\n       ``(iii) the frequency of interaction between the persons \n     involved in the relationship.\n       ``(8) The term `domestic violence' includes acts or threats \n     of violence, not including acts of self-defense, committed by \n     a current or former spouse of the victim, by a person with \n     whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is \n     cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim, by a person \n     who is or has been in a continuing social relationship of a \n     romantic or intimate nature with the victim, by a person \n     similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction, or by \n     any other person against a victim who is protected from that \n     person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of \n     the jurisdiction.\n       ``(9) The term `sexual assault' means any conduct \n     proscribed by chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code, \n     whether or not the conduct occurs in the special maritime and \n     territorial jurisdiction of the United States or in a Federal \n     prison and includes both assaults committed by offenders who \n     are strangers to the victim and assaults committed by \n     offenders who are known to the victim or related by blood or \n     marriage to the victim.\n       ``(10) The term `stalking' means engaging in a course of \n     conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a \n     reasonable person to fear death, sexual assault, or bodily \n     injury to such person or a member of such person's immediate \n     family, when the person engaging in such conduct has \n     knowledge or should have knowledge that the specific person \n     will be placed in reasonable fear of death, sexual assault, \n     or bodily injury to such person or a member of such person's \n     immediate family and when the conduct induces fear in the \n     specific person of death, sexual assault, or bodily injury to \n     such person or a member of such person's immediate family.''.\n\n     SEC. 205.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly one-third of American women (31 percent) report \n     being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend \n     at some point in their lives, and about 1200 women are \n     murdered every year by their intimate partner, nearly 3 each \n     day.\n       (2) 85 percent of violent victimizations are experienced by \n     women.\n       (3) 37 percent of all women who sought care in hospital \n     emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by \n     a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.\n       (4) In addition to injuries sustained during violent \n     episodes, physical and psychological abuse are linked to a \n     number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women \n     who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from \n     chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, \n     depression, unintended pregnancies, substance abuse and \n     sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.\n       (5) Medical services for abused women cost an estimated \n     $857,300,000 every year and health plans spend an average of \n     $1,775 more a year on abused women than on general enrollees.\n       (6) Each year, at least six percent of all pregnant women, \n     about 240,000 pregnant women, in this country are battered by \n     the men in their lives. This battering leads to complications \n     of pregnancy, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, \n     and first and second trimester bleeding.\n       (7) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to \n     be victims of homicide than to die of any other cause, and \n     evidence exists that a significant proportion of all female \n     homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners.\n       (8) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n     to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including \n     depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are \n     also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, \n     run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and \n     commit sexual assault crimes.\n       (9) Fifty percent of men who frequently assault their wives \n     frequently assault their children. The U.S. Advisory Board on \n     Child Abuse and Neglect suggests that domestic violence may \n     be the single major precursor to child abuse and neglect \n     fatalities in this country.\n       (10) Currently, about 10 percent of primary care physicians \n     routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new \n     patient visits and nine percent routinely screen during \n     periodic checkups.\n       (11) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness \n     of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of \n     pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a \n     10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in \n     increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable \n     research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of \n     screening men.\n       (12) 70 to 81 percent of the patients studied reported that \n     they would like their healthcare providers to ask them \n     privately about intimate partner violence.\n\n           Subtitle A--Research on Health and Family Violence\n\n      SEC. 311.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2022.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2022) to designate the Federal building located \n     at 250 West Cherry Street in Carbondale, IL, as the ``Senator \n     Paul Simon Federal Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on December 9, 2003, we lost our \ncolleague, U.S. Senator Paul Simon, a great public servant and a great \nfriend.\n  At the age of 19, Paul Simon became the nation's youngest editor-\npublisher when he accepted a Lion's Club challenge to save the Troy \nTribune in Troy, IL. From that start, he built a chain of 13 newspapers \nin southern and central Illinois. He also used his post in the \nnewspaper world to expose criminal activities and in 1951, at age 22, \nhe was called as a key witness to testify before the U.S. Senate's \nCrime Investigating Committee.\n  Paul Simon served the state of Illinois and the United States for \ndecades. He is the only individual to have served in both the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives and the Illinois Senate, and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and U.S. Senate. He served in the state legislature for \n14 years, and won the Independent Voters of Illinois' ``Best Legislator \nAward'' every session. He also served as Lieutenant Governor for \nIllinois from 1968 to 1972. In addition, he served in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1951 to 1953.\n  Paul Simon highly valued education and the youth of our nation. In \naddition to his work in Congress to strengthen public education in \nAmerica, he started the public affairs reporting program at Sangamon \nState University, now the University of Illinois at Springfield. He \nlater became the founder and director of the Public Policy Institute at \nSouthern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL, and taught there for \nmore than 6 years. In addition, Paul Simon wrote 22 books and earned \nover 55 honorary degrees.\n  From journalism to government to education, Paul Simon set the \nstandard for honesty and caring in public life. He was an unapologetic \nchampion of the less fortunate. He was genuine in his politics, life \nand values.\n  Now those of us who loved and respected him will do our best to carry \non his tradition. We will find many ways, great and small, to honor \nhim.\n  Today, the Senate will pass companion legislation to a bill \nCongressman Jerry Costello has introduced in the House. This \nlegislation would designate the federal building at 250 West Cherry \nStreet in Carbondale, Illinois as the ``Senator Paul Simon Federal \nBuilding.'' I am happy to have Senator Fitzgerald as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation. I thank Senators Inhofe and Jeffords for their timely \nconsideration of this legislation in the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee.\n  Paul Simon moved to Carbondale in 1974, where he was elected to serve \nin the U.S. House of Representatives. He continued to call the \nCarbondale area his home until his death. Naming this building in \nCarbondale after him will help present and future generations remember \nand honor Paul Simon, a great man who lived in and worked for the \npeople of Carbondale, Illinois and our Nation with the greatest \nintegrity.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3724) to amend section 220 of the National \n     Housing Act to make a technical correction to restore \n     allowable increases in the maximum mortgage limits for FHA-\n     insured mortgages for multifamily housing projects to cover \n     increased costs of installing a solar energy system or \n     residential energy conservation measures.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3724) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2824-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2824-S2825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this week the Senate completed action on S. \nCon. Res. 95, the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution, under the \ntremendous leadership of Chairman Nickles. As we look over the last 4 \ndays, we have had a very busy course with debating and disposing of 64 \namendments to the budget resolution. There were 25 rollcall votes in \nrelation to the amendments, including passage.\n  We had a long day of voting yesterday until the early hours of this \nmorning with 19 votes, and Senator Nickles guided the budget resolution \nto passage early this morning by a vote of 51 to 45.\n  In addition to that business, we were able to clear executive \nnominations. The Senate confirmed 17 nominations. Two of the \nnominations confirmed were district judges from Arizona and \nMississippi. I am pleased we were able to clear these judicial \nnominations, and I look forward to continuing this process for the \nremaining nominations that are on the calendar.\n  Indeed, there are approximately 22 judges on the calendar, of which I \nbelieve 15 or so should move expeditiously. I will continue to work \nwith the Democratic leader in scheduling these when we return from the \nrecess. I understand the Democratic leader mentioned additional \nnominations, and I will be consulting with him on those as well. He \nmentioned them earlier today and last night, and we will be consulting \non those nominations.\n  Late last night, as I mentioned earlier, the Senate confirmed the \nnomination of Mark McClellan to be Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Yesterday, the Senate also spoke with one voice with regard to a \ntragedy, the deadly attack yesterday against the people of Spain. Our \ncondolences were expressed. We had a moment of silence yesterday to \nhonor the people of Spain. In addition, we sponsored a resolution that \ncondemned this\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\ncowardly act. Our prayers continue to go out to the leaders and the \npeople of Spain over what we know is a very difficult time.\n  In addition, we consider other matters that people do not see very \nmuch, and I won't go through all of them, but we passed S. 741, the \nanimal drug bill that Senator Sessions sponsored that provides for new \ndrugs on what are called minor animals.\n  We passed H.R. 3195 just this morning, a bill that extends Small \nBusiness Administration programs. That is Senator Snowe's bill.\n  We passed H.R. 254, which are amendments to the U.S.-Mexico Agreement \non the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and the North American \nDevelopment Bank. Senator Hutchison was instrumental in clearing this \nbill.\n  The list goes on. I did want to reflect the amount of work we were \nable to pull through over the course of the week.\n  In addition, we were able to ratify the United States-Japan Tax \nTreaty reported by Chairman Lugar and the Foreign Relations Committee. \nThis is a very important treaty.\n  We just passed Senator Alexander's S. 1881, the Medical Devices and \nTechnical Correction Act.\n  Senator Specter secured passage of S. 2043, which designates a \nFederal building in Harrisburg, PA, as the ``Ronald Reagan Federal \nBuilding.''\n  Senator Shelby assisted in passage of H.R. 3724.\n  So we had a very productive week by anyone's measure. I wanted to \nnotice the hard work and efforts of all of my colleagues with respect \nto these legislative and executive accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2825-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2825-S2827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol Between the Government \nof the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of \nEstonia to the Treaty for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection \nof Investment of April 19, 1994, signed at Brussels on October 24, \n2003.

Each of these Protocols is the result of an understanding the \nUnited States reached with the European Commission and these six \ncountries that will join the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, as \nwell as with Bulgaria and Romania, which are expected to join the EU in \n2007.\n  The understanding is designed to preserve U.S. bilateral investment \ntreaties (BITs) with each of these countries after their accession to \nthe EU by establishing a framework acceptable to the European \nCommission for avoiding or remedying present and possible future \nincompatibilities between their BIT obligations and their future \nobligations of EU membership. It expresses the U.S. intent to amend the \nU.S. BITS, including the BIT with Estonia, in order to eliminate \nincompatibilities between certain BIT obligations and EU law. It also \nestablishes a framework for addressing any future incompatibilities \nthat may arise as EU authority in the area of investment expands in the \nfuture, and endorses the principle of protecting existing U.S. \ninvestments from any future EU measures that may restrict foreign \ninvestment in the EU.\n  The United States has long championed the benefits of an open \ninvestment climate, both at home and abroad. It is the policy of the \nUnited States to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit \ncapital to flow freely to seek its highest return.

Mr. President, the Senate will next convene on Monday, \nMarch 22. No rollcall votes will occur that day. However, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the Jumpstart JOBS bill, also known as \nFSC/ETI. We have made some progress on the bill. We interrupted the \nbill when we took up the budget bill this week.\n  Given the March 1 deadline on the FSC/ETI bill, which we have passed, \nand the implementation of sanctions, because that deadline has passed, \nI am concerned about our ability to pass this bill in a timely way. We \nmust address this and it will be the first order of business when we \nreturn.\n  It is clear that extraneous amendments may be offered and that will \nfurther complicate our ability to finish this bill in a timely and \norderly way. We have already spent several days on the bill. I \nencourage my colleagues to stay focused. Let's address the bill in an \nappropriate way to complete action.\n  Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus are still hoping to \npursue an agreement to finish the bill, although I must put everyone on \nnotice that it may be necessary to file cloture to bring this important \nlegislation to a close.\n  I should comment on the bill itself because people say, why the \nfocus? Why the urgency? I mentioned the March 1 deadline--we are past \nthe March 1 deadline--the renewed sanctions that are impacting trade \nright now.\n  The bill brings our trade laws and our trade into compliance with our \ntrade agreements. Right now they are out of compliance. People agree \nthey are out of compliance.\n  In addition, the bill provides badly needed reforms to further \nstimulate manufacturing growth. It is a manufacturing bill. On this \nfloor every day we are talking jobs, manufacturing jobs and loss of \njobs, and this bill hits directly at the heart of improving the \nenvironment for manufacturing in this country.\n  We all know the recession hit the manufacturing sector hard, probably \nthe hardest of any other sector. Manufacturing costs in the U.S. have \nbeen going up. They are getting higher and higher, where they have not \ngone up elsewhere in the world.\n  We compete in a global economy. In my home State of Tennessee, \nexports have risen 26 percent since 1997, and exports support 232,000 \njobs in Tennessee, and that is about 10 percent of our overall \nworkforce in Tennessee.\n  Some people have suggested we close our borders to trade. To me, and \nI think to most people, that is a declaration of defeat. We are the \nmost creative society in the world. We are the most innovative society \nin the world today. Workers in the United States lead productivity \nwhen compared to all other workers in the world. If we are allowed to \ncompete on a level playing field, U.S. manufacturers can and will \ncompete anywhere in the world, but U.S. manufacturers currently have \nthis additional burden of unnecessary cost.\n\n  The WTO also approved the European Union sanctions against the United \nStates. As I mentioned, that began on March 1. That is a 5-percent \ntariff, a 5-percent tax, a 5-percent sanction on a whole variety of \nU.S. goods. Again, that makes us less competitive. Thus, we need to act \nand we need to act now. We do not need a lot of nongermane, extraneous \namendments applied to this bill. Let's stay focused on this bill \nitself.\n  It has gone up 5 percent. These tariffs will increase by 1 percent a \nmonth to a high of 17 percent next year if we do not act and repeal \nthese export subsidies. That, again, is another cost to U.S. \nmanufacturing.\n  There are pending amendments, and others may be offered that day, and \ntherefore Members are expected to come to the floor for debate \nthroughout the day. The next vote will occur on Tuesday. As always, we \nwill notify Members when we lock in a time certain for that rollcall \nvote.\n  I do thank everyone one last time for their hard work and their long \nhours this week.

Mr. President, my compliments to the majority \nleader on the way in which he offered\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nleadership for the Senate on a rather rigorous and very lengthy \ndiscussion of the budget over the last several days. My thanks to him \nfor the hospitality he provided in the course of a very long evening. \nAnd my compliments and congratulations to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Nickles, and to Senator Conrad, the ranking member, \nfor the extraordinarily bipartisan fashion, as the hours of the evening \nwore on and as nerves began to fray, of keeping a calm and cool \ndeliberation in the midst of 300 amendments that had been filed. Those \n300 amendments would have kept us here all day today, all day Saturday, \nall day Sunday, and well into Monday. Yet with that leadership, the \nchairman and the ranking member were able to get reasonable minds to \ncome together and find consensus and therefore withdraw many \namendments. That was a testimony and showed the Senate working its \nwill.\n  I asked for this time because I want to comment on one part of the \nbudget that was passed last night. In the wee hours of the morning, an \namendment was passed by unanimous consent, sponsored by Senator \nSessions, Senator Shelby, this Senator from Florida, and Senator Graham \nof Florida. It was an amendment to bring the level of funding for NASA \nprovided in the budget resolution up to the level requested by the \nPresident. This was no small amount of money, for what had come out of \nthe Budget Committee, over my objection, was a cut to America's space \nprogram, as evidenced in the NASA budget, of $631 million.\n  My pleas in the course of our deliberations in the Budget Committee \nto get the White House to step forward and to support its request for \nits full funding at a level of $16.2 billion, went unheeded. Indeed, \nthose pleas went unheeded for the White House to support its own budget \non NASA all the way up through the end of the deliberations this entire \nweek until around 1 o'clock this morning.\n  It was only when Senator Sessions and Senator Shelby each put their \nfoot down to let the chairman of the Budget Committee know that their \nvotes on final passage were questionable unless that was brought up to \nthe level of the President's request did we successfully get inserted \ninto the budget an amendment that would bring NASA up to the $16.2 \nbillion.\n  Where was the White House and why did it take--and I give great \ncredit to Senator Shelby--that long, with my encouragement and that of \nothers, to get the budget resolution amended so when this budget \nresolution is ultimately passed after conference with the House of \nRepresentatives there will not be such a financial straitjacket on NASA \nso the appropriations committees could not give the adequate funding to \nNASA? Yet that is what we were faced with at 1 o'clock this morning.\n  Where is the White House? That is the subject of my commentary. There \nis no greater supporter in the Senate for America's space program than \nthis Senator from Florida, who has had the great privilege of being a \npart of the space program. There is no greater need than the need at \nthis particular time for the full funding of the President's request, \nwith all that NASA has on its plate. It has, not only the new \ninitiative announced by the President back in January of going back to \nthe Moon and then eventually to Mars--of course, no funding really \nbeing provided for that, the major funding being provided in the \nPresident's announcement in the outyears--but all the other things on \nNASA's plate.\n  We had a major space disaster, the second one that occurred within \nthe span of 17 years. Now, as a result of an excellent report brought \nforth by Admiral Geman's commission, we understand what specific things \nneed to be done to fix the problem and to get back into flight. Of \ncourse, it is going to cost a lot of money to make those fixes, and \nindeed the downtime is costing NASA all kinds of turmoil and \nuncertainty.\n  For us not to have the White House step forward and say with vigor \nthat they support their budget request for NASA caused us to just \nnarrowly, by the skin of our teeth, avert a disaster of almost passing \na budget resolution last night that was $631 million under the \nPresident's request. There is too much riding on our exploring the \nheavens for this extremely prestigious and very productive program of \nthe United States called America's space program. As we explore the \nheavens, we continue to push out the frontiers of our knowledge, and as \nwe develop the technology to do that, that then translates into \nmagnificent enhancement in the quality of our lives as the technology \nfrom the space program is applied to our normal, everyday lives.\n  I call on the White House. I call on the leadership of NASA. We \ncannot take for granted just because the President has announced a \nmajor new initiative that it is going to get funded. Indeed, we are \nswimming upstream. The immediate reaction of the American people to the \nPresident's initiative was they didn't support it. There is only one \nperson who can lead the space program. That is the President or the \nVice President. A Senator can't lead it. The administrator of NASA \ncan't lead it, particularly on bold new initiatives. It has to be the \nWhite House that leads it.\n  I implore the White House and NASA to step forward and support your \nreport. Otherwise, we are going to get into a situation where mistakes \nof omission are going to occur like almost occurred last night. \nSuddenly we are going to find ourselves with a final budget product \nthat is going to straitjacket NASA with less funds than the President \nrequested.\n  Now more than ever NASA needs those funds to return to flight as \nsafely as possible. I say that because space flight is risky. But it is \na risk worth taking because of the expansion of our knowledge and the \nfulfilling of our desire in our inner souls to be explorers and \nadventurers, a characteristic of the American people.\n  I felt compelled to share these thoughts as one of the biggest \nboosters of the U.S. space program--indeed, the world's space program. \nFor we are in an international venture with other nations of this world \non the international space station, sharing various citizens of the \nworld on different avenues, namely, American rockets through the space \nshuttle and European and Russian rockets on other space ventures.\n  It is important the White House back their request vigorously. I hope \nand I expect they will do so, and then we will continue to have an \nexcellent space program.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/12/senate-section/article/S2828-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 22, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
