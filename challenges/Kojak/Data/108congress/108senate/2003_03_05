Please encourage them. Be very present \nhere. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, please empower, renew, and \nstrengthen them.

Mr. President, I would like to move the spotlight of the \ncomments on the Senate floor this morning from the international scene \nto the domestic scene, and point to the front page headline of the New \nYork Times, Wednesday, March 5: ``U.S. Budget Deficit Seen Rising \nFast.'' This is an analysis that they report which comes from the \nRepublican-controlled House Budget Committee. It is a startling piece \nof information. I will read the first two paragraphs from this article:\n\n       The federal deficit is growing much more quickly than \n     expected, even before Congress takes up President Bush's tax-\n     cutting proposals and without factoring in the costs of a war \n     in Iraq, Congressional analysts have concluded.\n       Analysts for the Republican-controlled House Budget \n     Committee have raised their estimates of this year's budget \n     shortfall by about $30 billion, some 15 percent beyond the \n     forecast . . . issued only five weeks ago.\n\n  We come today to discuss many issues, but certainly one of the \noverriding issues is the state of the American economy and what we are \ndoing on Capitol Hill to deal with the challenges we face.\n  There was a time, not that long ago, when the Republican leaders, \nconservative in philosophy, really condemned the whole problem of \ndeficits in our country and said they were dedicated to eliminating \nthem. Now we hear from Treasury Secretary Snow and others that deficits \nare meaningless: Don't worry. Be happy.\n  The concept of going to a $400 billion deficit next year is not only \na troubling prospect but represents a dramatic turnaround in terms of \nFederal spending in Washington, DC.\n  When this President came to power--President George W. Bush--he \ninherited a surplus. He came into office with a set of circumstances \nthat any President, any Executive, would be happy to find. We had \nreached the point where we were not overspending.\n  Of course, the President, as he came to office, saw the beginning of \na recession which has become progressively worse under his \nadministration to the point now where we see consumer confidence at \nhistoric lows, unemployment at historic highs, people in business \nacross America depressed and sometimes despondent over whether we are \ngoing to find our way out of this budget problem.\n  Second, the President--and this, of course, in fairness, is not his \ndoing by any means--inherited the age of terrorism and the threat of \nterrorism which has created a dampening problem across the economy that \ncannot be diminished. That is a major factor.\n  So he has a recession which has become progressively worse while he \nhas been in the White House, terrorism which has cast a pall over the \neconomy, but then this President made matters worse. Two years ago he \nsaid to this country, even though we are facing deficits, the thing we \nshould do first is to cut taxes. Any politician who announces a tax cut \nis going to get applause. People love that idea. Of course, they would, \nto think they would have more money that is not taken by the \nGovernment. But the President came up with this proposal at exactly the \nwrong time in exactly the wrong way. In a deficit situation, he made it \nworse.\n  Two years ago, he proposed a tax cut which took more money out of the \ntreasury and, frankly, did not invigorate the economy. He gave a tax \ncut to the wealthiest people of America. It is the age-old Republican \napproach. They believe if tax cuts are given to the wealthiest people, \nsomehow that will eventually help middle-income families and those in \nthe lower income categories. It didn't work 2 years ago. People in the \nlower income categories saw a $300 check, and they didn't change their \nlifestyle. It did not invigorate the economy. Things went from bad to \nworse. Now this President comes and tells us what we need for the \neconomy is more of the same, tax cuts for the wealthiest people.\n  Quite honestly, if it didn't work 2 years ago, it is not going to \nwork now. It won't invigorate the economy. It will drive up the deficit \nat a time when the bottom is falling out of the Federal budget.\n  Don't take my word for it. The Republican House Budget Committee \ntells us we are about to see a record deficit. This President's \nproposal for tax cuts over a 10-year period of time will dramatically \nincrease the national debt. It means our children and our grandchildren \nwill have to shoulder the burden of the debt we are leaving them. It \nmeans programs such as Social Security are likely to languish and \nsuffer because of this President's reckless economic policies.\n  To think this deficit is coming out of the Social Security trust fund \nshould give us all pause. You know the demographics. The baby boomers \nare about to reach an age when they qualify for Social Security and \nMedicare. We should be mindful of that. We should be preparing for \nthat. We should be cautious and prudent.\n  Instead, this White House and many who support it have said: Forget \nit; don't worry about it. Keep borrowing money from the Social Security \ntrust fund. Keep jeopardizing the future of Medicare, drive up the \ndeficits, increase the tax cuts so that tax breaks can be given to the \nwealthiest people.\n  Why in the world would we follow this course of action? Those who \ncall themselves conservatives should have an examination of conscience, \nas the nuns used to tell me many years ago in grade school. They should \nsit down and ask themselves, Is this really why I came to Congress, to \nbuild up a national debt to record levels?\n\n  Let me add one important footnote. There is another tax out there \nthat this administration will not talk about. It is called the \nalternative minimum tax. It was created years ago to make sure people \nwho escaped all tax liability, people in the highest income categories, \nwould pay something, an alternative minimum tax. But sadly, this tax, \nwithout reform, has grown in terms of its application, has grown in \nterms of the people who are being affected by it to the point that in \njust a few years you will see more and more middle-income Americans \npaying more in an alternative minimum tax than they are paying in their \nregular income tax rates.\n  Who will be the people affected by this? People with incomes below \n$100,000, middle-income families. People with a teacher in the family \nand a policeman, for example, will find themselves paying an \nalternative minimum tax.\n  What does it take to fix this problem? A lot of money; to eliminate \nit, $600 billion that this President has not budgeted for.\n  This President and his administration refuse to tell Congress and the \npeople what we are getting into in terms of our exposure in the war in \nIraq, how much it will cost. Larry Lindsey, the President's economic \nadvisor until he was asked to leave a few weeks ago, blurted out that \nthis war\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nwould cost us $100 to $200 billion. He was asked to leave the \nadministration for his candor. Now we can't get the administration to \neven tell us what this war, not only the waging of it but the cost of \nthe occupation force afterwards, is going to cost. It isn't even \nfactored into the budget deficit.\n  Make no mistake, I will say this as a person who has questioned this \nadministration's approach on foreign policy. If and when this war \nbegins, I will join an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress to \nprovide every penny necessary to wage this war successfully and bring \nour men and women home safely, having completed their mission. We are \ngoing to do that. It is a given. To ask the administration what this is \nlikely to cost is not unreasonable. We went into a bidding war over the \nlast several weeks when it came to Turkey, how much money we would send \nto Turkey, if they would allow us to base our troops there for an \ninvasion of Iraq. The numbers went from $15 billion to $26 billion. We \nwere bidding right and left. What is it going to cost overall?\n  This administration is not putting money into homeland security. This \nadministration is not budgeting what it takes to defend America against \nterrorism. We are budgeting what it takes to prepare to attack in Iraq; \nwe are not budgeting what it takes to prepare to defend in America.\n  When all these are put together, understand that we are headed down a \nperilous course with President Bush's economic policy. It is a course \nwhich, frankly, is not going to invigorate the economy; it is not going \nto create jobs; it will not create consumer confidence. It will create \na debt and deficit at the expense of Social Security and Medicare for \ngenerations to come. We should not, in a weak moment, rally behind a \nPresident who clearly is on the wrong course when it comes to America's \neconomy. We need to stand up and make certain that we are going to work \nfor a sound economy, a fiscal approach that is prudent and cautious and \ntakes into consideration the needs of America in the long term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nIllinois for his eloquence regarding the direction of our economy and \nthe Federal budget and the grave concern he has that I share about the \nlooming and massive long-term debt that is accumulating by the policies \nof this administration.\n  When we look at where we are going and the fact that the entire \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds are currently being used to \nfund tax cuts geared to the very top, the very wealthiest 1 percent, \nand when we look at the discussions we are having in the Budget \nCommittee, we begin to see a picture that is disturbing. Because when \nwe ask what will happen, when we are using all of these funds for other \npurposes, and we know that in just a matter of a few years, the baby \nboomers will begin to retire en masse and they have the expectation, as \nthey should, that Social Security and Medicare will be there for them, \nthey have paid into the system, and we are told, when we ask, how will \nwe afford that, how will we be able to keep that commitment, well, that \nassumes that Medicare and Social Security will be structured the way \nthey are today. That assumes there will be no reform.\n\n  What is becoming clear is that reform is a code word for privatizing; \nthat there is a real interest, a commitment and movement to privatize \nor eliminate Medicare and Social Security, as we know it, in the long \nterm.\n  Today I wish to speak again very specifically about Medicare because \nI believe that is the most imminent threat because the debate that has \noccurred since 1965, when Medicare passed, in various forms is \noccurring yet again today. That is the question of whether Medicare is \na big American success story, which I believe it is, or just a big \nGovernment program, which I believe this administration feels it is.\n  I wish to speak specifically about special interest politics versus \nthe needs of the public, the willingness to provide tax policy that \nbenefits only a few, rather than the middle class, and small businesses \nthat drive our economy, as well as the fact that in Medicare, we are \nseeing a willingness to move the system in a way that benefits, again, \nspecial interests over the needs of all of our seniors and the disabled \nin our country.\n  On page A6 of the Washington Post this morning, there is a very \ndisturbing article. It says: ``Bush Plan a Boon to Drug Companies.'' \nThe President went before the American Medical Association yesterday \nand spoke about his plans for Medicare, again using the word \n``reform,'' which we know now is a code word for ``privatization.'' \nReform equals privatize when we talk about this issue of Medicare. We \nnow find that it also directly relates, once again, to special interest \npolitics, which is very disturbing.\n  The second headline is: ``Medicare Prescription Proposal Would Also \nBenefit Insurers, Analysts Say.'' Not the insured, not the seniors \nabout whom we all talk, not the disabled people about whom we all talk, \nbut the insurance industry.\n  It begins:\n\n       Health care economists said the drug benefit President Bush \n     proposed for Medicare yesterday would be a bonanza for the \n     pharmaceutical and managed-care industries, both of which are \n     huge donors to Republicans.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       Marilyn Moon, a health economist at the Urban Institute, \n     said Bush's plan would hand tremendous negotiating power to \n     health insurance companies.\n       ``By making the private plans such a central part of the \n     future of Medicare, the government is going to have to meet \n     their demands for greater contributions to the cost of care, \n     over and above the subsidy for prescription drugs,'' Moon \n     said.\n       Bush's proposal is vague on many points, including the \n     terms for insurers. Tricia Neuman, a vice president of the \n     Kaiser Family Foundation, said the plan would have to provide \n     a windfall for the companies--\n\n  ``Would have to provide a windfall for the companies.''\n\n     or too few would participate for the plan to work.\n       The analysts said drug companies also could be expected to \n     reap huge profits under Bush's approach.\n\n  Huge profits under Bush's approach. We have to ask ourselves: Is that \nthe purpose of Medicare? Is that the purpose of health care? Is it the \nsame as purchasing a pair of tennis shoes, purchasing soup, purchasing \na new shirt so that we are talking about what profit margin we have off \nour Medicare recipients, or is the goal to make sure we have quality \nhealth care for every senior citizen?\n  I believe it is our responsibility to make sure this is a streamline \nsystem with as few dollars as possible going into administration and \nthat the dollars should go directly to health care for our seniors, not \ninto huge profits. We welcome profits in many areas. We need profits in \nour economy. We want businesses to be successful. But when we are \ntalking about Medicare, we have a different priority in what we need to \ndo to help our seniors make sure they have care.\n\n  To continue with the article:\n\n       Bruce C. Vladeck, who was President Clinton's head of the \n     federal agency that runs Medicare, said Bush's plan ``strikes \n     me as the kind of proposal that pharmaceutical companies \n     would write if they were writing their own bill.''\n\n  These are the kind of comments we heard last year when we were \ndebating prescription drug coverage and were told--in fact, we heard \ncomments coming from staff in the House quoted in the paper as to how \nthey were running their proposals by the pharmaceutical industry to \nmake sure they were OK. It is clear this one is OK, and we should all \nbe very concerned about who we are trying to help.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       ``A slew of private health plans would have nowhere near \n     the negotiating power that Medicare would have if there was \n     national drugs benefit,'' said Vladeck, now a health\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\n     policy professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New \n     York City.\n       If Bush's proposal were enacted, it could provide a high-\n     profile benefit for industries that are reliable donors to \n     Republican candidates and committees. The Center for \n     Responsive Politics said that for the past two elections \n     combined, pharmaceutical manufacturers gave $30 million to \n     Republicans and $8 million to Democrats.\n       Health service companies and HMOs, a leading form of \n     managed care, donated $10 million to Republicans and $5 \n     million to Democrats over the past two elections, according \n     to the center's figures.\n\n  This should be a deep concern of every American, as well as my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and on the other side of this \nbuilding about how this issue is being framed because of the realities \nit points out what is really going on with this issue.\n  I will make one more point. The article continues, quoting President \nBush yesterday:\n\n       Bush, promising to bring more free enterprise to medicine, \n     denounced ``government-run health care ideas.''\n\n  I have been saying for a long time that those who want to privatize \nMedicare believe that Medicare is a big Government-run program, and \nthere is a major philosophical difference that has gone on since 1965 \nwhen only 12 colleagues from the other side of the aisle joined in \npassing Medicare. There is a huge chasm of difference as to whether we \nought to even have Medicare.\n  Fundamentally, that is what this debate is about. It is not about \nwhat the premiums should be, what the copay should be. It is about who \nruns the system as to whether there should be a guarantee so that every \nperson who turns 65 and gets that Medicare card knows they can choose \ntheir doctor, that they can get the medicine they need, that they know \nwhat the copay is, what the premium is, regardless of where they live \nin the country.\n  In a State such as Michigan, where we have the major metropolitan \narea of Detroit all the way up to Ironwood, MI, in the western part of \nthe UP, people today know that under Medicare they can get the health \ncare they need. That was a promise made by the United States of America \nin 1965, and now under a lot of different pretty words, a lot of \ndifferent connotations of reform, we see an effort clearly outlined--\nand even in the President's own words--to put more free enterprise into \nthe health care system. That is privatizing the health care system. \nThat is privatizing Medicare.\n  In general, I do believe there is an important partnership between \nthe public and the private sector. We have an employer model of health \ncare in this country that has worked for workers and their families. I \nappreciate there is a benefit in having partnerships.\n  We have said as a country that once an American citizen reaches the \nage of 65 or they are disabled, we think it is important that whether \none has private plans in their community, whether they can find them \nand/or whether they can afford them, they should be able to have health \ncare. The reason Medicare came into being was that over half the \nseniors could not find or afford private insurance. That is why \nMedicare was created.\n  I, for one, will not quietly stand by to see a promise of some 38 \nyears eroded by this administration or in this Congress. I know there \nare colleagues of mine on both sides of the aisle who have concerns. I \nam hopeful we can come together under Medicare.\n  What is very clear is--and in this article the outside analysts, \nindependent voices, are saying--the fight is about how we administer \nthe prescription drug benefit. The companies want to keep it disbursed \nin the private sector because they know if the some 40 million \nbeneficiaries of Medicare today are in one insurance plan, they will be \nable to negotiate a group discount for the first time. They will not be \npaying retail. They will not be paying the highest prices in the world \nin order to get their medicine. They will be able to get a group \ndiscount.\n  The fight is on to make sure that seniors in this country do not have \nthe collective power to be able to get that discount through Medicare. \nThat is what this is about. It is one of the most fundamental fights we \nwill have in this Congress and on the floor of the Senate, and I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come together and be \nwilling to stand up and say Medicare works, Medicare is a great \nAmerican success story, and we continue to promise that the Medicare \nplan will be there for every single senior and the disabled in our \ncountry.\n  This is a fundamental fight, and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nmaking sure this plan that is passed is not a boon for the drug \ncompanies or for the HMOs but is a boon for the seniors of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3112-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3112-S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move now to another very important topic, and that is \nthe question of stimulating this economy. We know that to get out of \nthe massive debt that is being accumulated, we have got to stimulate \nthe economy. We have to reverse the trend right now. We have seen over \n2 million private sector jobs lost in the last 2 years. We have to go \nback to the Eisenhower Presidency to find those kinds of numbers, those \nkinds of huge private sector losses and this massive debt. We know that \nhas to be turned around.\n  Part of what needs to happen to begin to get us back to the balanced \nbudget and out of this massive debt, so we can protect Social Security \nand Medicare, is to stimulate the economy and create jobs. I am very \nproud to be a part of an effort to do that.\n  We have in front of us a Democratic plan that has been introduced by \nour leader and Members in our caucus. It will provide immediate relief \nfor families through a broad-based tax cut that is on the front end, a \ntax cut to the middle class and to those in our country who we know \nwill turn around and buy those school clothes or a new car--and coming \nfrom Michigan, I am always hopeful it is a new American-made car--and \npurchasing that new home and all of those things that stimulate the \neconomy, rather than giving the tax relief to somebody who has three \nhomes or has five cars and is not likely to buy another one.\n  What we want is to put that tax cut in the hands of middle-class \npeople, working people, who will spend it now, so that our businesses \nwill see the demand. Right now, newspaper headlines this week in \nMichigan relate to the auto industry cutting back on the building of \nnew cars because the demand is not there.\n  We have a proposal that relates to demand, not trickle-down economics \nfrom the top but demand, to put money in the pockets of people who will \nspend it. That is exactly what our proposal would do. It would provide \nabout a $1,200 tax cut this year for a family of four. It would also \nprovide tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest and create \njobs, and it would increase the current multiyear bonus depreciation so \nif one invested now, they would get a bonus depreciation, which is very \nimportant.\n  It would triple the amount of investments small businesses can write \noff immediately, and this is very important because the majority of new \njobs are coming from small business. We need to be focusing on tax \npolicies that will help and support job creation in small business.\n  It would provide a 50-percent tax credit in 2003 to help small \nbusinesses pay for their share of health insurance premiums. This \nrelates very much to the broader question of health care and where we \nare going.\n  Later today, we are going to be introducing legislation to cut the \nprice on prescription drugs so we can bring that health insurance \npremium down for small businesses. It would provide a 20-percent tax \ncredit in 2003 for businesses investing in broadband, high-speed \nInternet infrastructure, focusing on rural areas, underserved areas. \nThis is very important. We are in a high-tech new economy, and \nbroadband access is critical as we move forward to be able to compete \nin the new world of high technology and helping small businesses \ninvest, particularly in our rural areas, the hard-to-reach areas. It is \nan important part of our economic development structure.\n  Another important piece we believe must be addressed now is to \nprovide $5 billion for hometown security that would make sure that as \nwe are investing in the economy, we are also making sure we are safe at \nhome. When people have an emergency, they call 9-1-1. We want to make \nsure people on the other end of that line have the communications \nequipment, the technology, the training, and the personnel\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nto respond in a way that will keep us safe.\n\n  We also know that part of what is happening economically across the \ncountry now is that we are seeing a ripple effect because the majority \nof States are in a financial crisis because of the downturn in the \neconomy and other factors, so that as they lay off, and people are \nspending less because they are laid off from State or local \ngovernments, there is this ripple effect throughout the economy.\n  In addition to putting money directly into people's pockets, we also \npropose putting money into the pockets of the small business owner. We \npropose providing dollars in immediate aid to State and local \ngovernments so that we are not seeing that ripple effect in terms of \npeople losing their jobs, losing purchase power in the economy. We all \nknow common sense says if we can provide money to State, local, and \nmunicipal governments and they can focus on immediate infrastructure \nsuch as rebuilding roads, water systems, sewer systems, we create good-\npaying jobs by doing that, such as construction jobs. We take burdens \noff local property taxes, which helps individuals and businesses, and \nwe can again stop the bleeding that is occurring right now in the \nStates with more and more people losing their jobs and thus losing \npurchasing power in the economy. This is of great urgency.\n  We come to the floor each day to ask that we immediately go to an \neconomic stimulus package that will get America back to work, will put \nmoney in the pockets of individuals and businesses that can get the job \ndone, that can stimulate this economy, to help our hometown security, \nand to make sure that we are helping to rebuild America, which also \nrebuilds jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3113-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 414\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Maybe I will ask unanimous consent to get \nsome time for my colleague from Oregon. In the meantime, I will go \nahead and start my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to add my \nthoughts to this body's consideration of the Treaty on Strategic \nOffensive Reductions, otherwise known as the Moscow Treaty. My \nunderstanding is that this afternoon it will be brought before the \nSenate. We are at a pivotal moment in our country's history. In many \nways, the Senate's advise and consent to this treaty will mark the end \nof an era of hostility and the beginning of an age of cooperation.\n  It is more than a document; it is a signal to the world that the \nUnited States and Russia have moved beyond a relationship of conflict \nand brinkmanship to a relationship of mutual respect and shared values.\n  We all remember the super-power rivalry between the United States and \nthe Soviet Union, which lasted over 45 years. I believe it is important \nfor this debate to recall the tension and hostility that accompanies \nthat time so that we may fully appreciate what this treaty symbolizes \nfor the future of U.S.-Russian relations.\n  In 1947, a little-known foreign service officer named George Kennan \nunder the pseudonym `X' wrote an essay that was published in Foreign \nAffairs journal that was to define our approach to the Soviet Union for \nthe next fifty years. In his essay, he described the Soviet ideology as \nthe belief in the ``basic badness of capitalism, in the inevitability \nof its destruction, in the obligation of the proletariat to assist in \nthat destruction and to take power into its own hands.''\n  This ideological bent would manifest itself, Mr. Kennan predicted, in \nan ``innate antagonism'' between the Soviet Union and Western world. He \nsaid that we should expect secretiveness, a lack of frankness, \nduplicity, a wary suspiciousness, and the basic unfriendliness of \npurpose. Mr. Kennan warned us that the Soviet government might sign \ndocuments that might indicate a deviation from this ideology, but that \nwe should regard such actions as a ``tactical maneuver permissible in \ndealing with the enemy (who is without honor) and should be taken in \nthe spirit of caveat emptor''. As we discovered in the decades \nfollowing, Mr. Kennan was right.\n  The Soviet Union did indeed devote itself to exporting its ideology \naround the world. Its foreign policy was marked by antagonistic \nrhetoric and provocative actions. It signed arms control agreements and \nthen violated them. The Soviet Union invaded its neighbors, launched \nproxy wars, and encouraged revolution and instability. It repeatedly \nproved capable of exploiting weakness and political divisions. And it \nwas successful at taking advantage of geopolitical realities. As a \nresult, Angola, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, \nHonduras, Granada, Vietnam, Korea, Somalia, Yemen, Greece, and Turkey \nall become Cold War battlegrounds.\n  For the most part, the United States followed Mr. Kennan's advice. We \nstrove to contain Soviet expansionist tendencies. We forced back Soviet \nadvances. We were firm. We were patient. And, in 1991, with the fall of \nthe Soviet Union, our patience paid off.\n  It is important that we recognize that the Russia of today is nothing \nlike the Soviet Union of yesterday. Under the leadership of President \nPutin, economic and political reforms are being enacted. Russia is no \nlonger bound by a defunct ideology. The country has stepped away from \nits past and has worked with sincerity to help resolve many of the \nchallenges facing the international community.\n  Russia has also sought to improve its relationship with the Western \nworld. It went eventually along with inclusion of the Baltic states \ninto the NATO Alliance, despite harboring deep concerns. Russia \naccepted our withdrawal from the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. After \nSeptember 11, Russia assisted the United States in the war against \nterrorism by sharing intelligence information and raising no objection \nto the stationing of U.S. troops in the former Soviet states in Central \nAsia. Once inconceivable, it is now possible to imagine Russia joining \nthe World Trade Organization and even NATO in the near future.\n  Another sign of improved relations between the U.S. and Russia is the \ntreaty currently before us. The Treaty on Strategic Offensive \nReductions is much different from arms control treaties agreed to \nduring the Cold War. The text of treaty epitomizes this new \nrelationship. Both parties pledge to:\n\n       Embark upon the path of new relations for a new century and \n     committed the goal of strengthening their relationship \n     through cooperation and friendship.\n       Believe that new global challenges and threats require the \n     building of a qualitatively new foundation for strategic \n     relations between the Parties.\n       Desire to establish a genuine partnership based on the \n     principles of mutual security, cooperation, trust, openness, \n     and predictability.\n\n  The Joint Declaration by Presidents Bush and Putin that accompanied \nthe treaty further expounds upon this new relationship. Let me read a \ncouple of pertinent sections from that declaration:\n\n       We are achieving a new strategic relationship. The era in \n     which the United States and Russia saw each other as an enemy \n     or strategic threat has ended. We are partners and we will \n     cooperate to advance stability, security, and economic \n     integration, and to jointly global challenges and to help \n     resolve regional conflicts.\n       We will respect the essential values of democracy, human \n     rights, free speech and free media,tolerance, the rule of \n     law, and economic opportunity.\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\n       We recognize that the security, prosperity, and future \n     hopes of our peoples rest on a benign security environment, \n     the advancement of political and economic freedoms, and \n     international cooperation.\n\n  What is most notable about the Moscow Treaty as submitted to this \nbody is the absence of certain provisions that normally marked Cold War \nera arms control treaties. Those provisions were based on distrust and \nantagonism. Instead, this treaty utilizes confidence-building measures \nbased on trust and friendship.\n  For instance, the treaty does not establish interim warhead reduction \ngoals or provide a detailed schedule for the reductions. The absence of \nsuch goals or schedules gives both sides flexibility over the next nine \nyears to reduce their warheads at a pace of their own choosing.\n  Another missing element is precise counting rules. The Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty of 1991 provided such complex counting rules that it \nfrequently resulted in overcounting and undercounting. Minor \ndisparities in deployed and ``counting'' forces are no longer a \nsignificant issue given the confidence building measures included in \nthe treaty and our positive relationship with Russia.\n  It should be noted that the Moscow Treaty does continue the START I \nverification regime, which permits on site inspections and continuous \nmonitoring. The Moscow treaty also creates a new Bilateral \nImplementation Commission that will be used to any raise concerns that \nmight arise about treaty compliance and transparency. These measures, \nplus our own technical means, will provide the U.S. government with \nsignificant confidence that it can monitor Russia's activities.\n  The Moscow Treaty is similar to previous arms control agreements in \none significant way: it does not require the dismantlement of warheads. \nNeither Russia nor the United States sought the dismantlement for two \nreasons. First, the dismantlement in the past has been considered \ninherently unverifiable. There is no established process for \ndismantling warheads that can provide assurance to each party.\n  Second, the U.S. intends to keep some warheads in ``ready reserve.'' \nSuch a reserve is essential if we are to retain the capability to \nrespond to changes in the security environment and quickly replace \ndysfunctional warheads.\n  I also think it is instructive to look at the process by which the \nMoscow Treaty was put together and how different these negotiations \nwere from negotiations that occurred during the cold war. Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld remarked on the difference during a Senate \nArmed Services Committee hearing last July. Here is what he said:\n\n       . . . it's significant that while we consulted closely and \n     engaged in a process that had been open and transparent, we \n     did not engage in lengthy adversarial negotiations in which \n     U.S. and Russia would keep thousands of warheads that we \n     didn't need, as bargaining chips. We did not establish \n     standing negotiating teams in Geneva with armies of arms \n     control aficionados ready to do battle over every colon and \n     every comma. . . . An illustration of how far we have come is \n     the START treaty. . . . It is 700 pages long, and it took \n     nine years to negotiate. . . . The Moscow treaty . . . is \n     three pages long and it took five or six months to negotiate.\n\n  Let's take a few moments to review some of the Moscow treaty's \nprovisions. The treaty requires the reduction of strategic nuclear \nwarheads by each party to a level of 1,700-2,200 by the end of 2012. \nEach side currently has about 6,000 warheads. This treaty means a \nreduction of over 8,000 nuclear warheads.\n  The treaty allows both parties to restructure their offensive forces \nas each sees fit, within the prescribed numerical limit. This provision \ngives each flexibility to meet the deadline and permit each party to \ndetermine for itself the composition and structure of its strategic \noffensive arms.\n  The Treaty mandates that the parties will meet at least twice a year \nas part of a Bilateral Implementations Commission.\n  The Treaty allows each party, in exercising national sovereignty, the \nability to withdraw from the treaty upon three months written notice.\n  As you can see, the treaty is simple, straight-forward, and gives \neach party maximum flexibility.\n  Last summer, the Senate Armed Services Committee held two important \nhearings on the national security implications of the treaty. Witnesses \nincluded: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld; Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers; Combatant Commander, U.S. \nStrategic Command, Admiral James Ellis; and Deputy Administrator of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy, \nDr. Everet H. Beckner. The witnesses at the Committee hearings \nunanimously supported ratification of the Moscow Treaty. The Chairman \nof the Joint chiefs, General Myers said,\n\n       The members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I all support \n     the Moscow Treaty. We believe it provides for the long-term \n     security interests of our nation. We also believe that it \n     preserves our flexibility in an uncretain strategic \n     environment.\n\n  Admiral Ellis added that,\n\n       This treaty allows me, as the Commander of the nation's \n     Strategic Forces, the latitude to structure our strategic \n     forces to better support the national security pillars of \n     assuring our allies, dissuading those who might wish us ill, \n     deterring potential adversaries and, if necessary, defending \n     the nation. . . . [I]n my judgment, this treaty provides me \n     the ability to prudently meet those national security needs \n     and to provide a range of deterrent options to the Secretary \n     and the President for their consideration should the need \n     arise. . . .\n\n  I believe it is important to recognize the flexibility that this \ntreaty gives the United States. While the U.S. nuclear stockpile may \ncontain a large number of warheads, we only have six types of warheads, \nand none of these have been tested in over a decade. The average age of \nwarheads in the U.S. stockpile is approaching 20 years--and some \nwarheads are much older. Despite the improved effectiveness of the \nstockpile stewardship program, problems in the stockpile do occur. \nHaving the responsive reserve, as envisioned by the administration, \nenables us to address problems in the stockpile without compromising \nour national security interests. This treaty is simple, flexible, and \nmakes sense. It is a signal that the hostility of the cold war has been \nburied and forgotten. It has been 12 years since the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, and clearly it is time to move one.\n  As we consider this treaty, we should also keep the future in mind. I \nshare Secretary Rumsfeld's vision for future negotiations with Russia \nas he described it at July 26 Armed Services Committee hearing. He \nsaid,\n\n       We are working towards the day when the relationship \n     between our two countries is such that no arms control \n     treaties will be necessary. that's how normal countries deal \n     with each other. The United States and Britain both have \n     nuclear weapons, yet we do not spend hundreds of hours \n     negotiating the fine details of mutual reductions in our \n     offensive systems. We do not feel the need to preserve the \n     balance of terror between us. It would be a worthy goal for \n     our relationship with Russia to evolve along that path.\n\n  I could not agree more with the Defense Secretary's vision. Russia \nand the United States are no longer adversaries and therefore should \nnot treat each other as such.\n  I understand that my good friend, Senator John Warner, Chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, has written to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee expressing his strong support for the Moscow \ntreaty. I join him in that support. I believe the Senate should provide \nits advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty with no \nfurther changes or additional conditions to the resolution of \nratification.\n  Some of my colleagues may offer well-intentioned amendments that \nmight attempt to add reservations, understandings, or declarations. I \nappreciate their desire to amend the treaty, but I think we should keep \nin mind that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously \napproved this treaty without amendment, and the resolution of \nratification before us today has only tow modest conditions. The \nPresident has indicated his opposition to any amendment to the \nresolution. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to oppose all \namendments. I believe it would be best for our nation security \ninterests if this treaty remained unencumbered by items that will \ncomplicate the treaty and reduce our flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to share my views on \nthis important treaty. I look forward to a healthy debate on this \nissue. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, right now the eyes of the Nation are \nfocused on international crises. The threat of war with Iraq, the \nconflict at the United Nations, and a diplomatic standoff with North \nKorea are all critical issues about which this country is concerned.\n  But here at home there is a domestic crisis of massive proportions \nthat affects the lives of millions of Americans each day; that is, the \nfailure of our health care system to work for all Americans.\n  I will take just a few minutes to discuss this because next week I \nanticipate that thousands of Americans will get together in communities \nacross the Nation as part of the special effort to highlight the \nconcerns of the uninsured. This is under the auspices of the Robert \nWood Johnson Foundation, an organization that works in a nonpartisan \nfashion.\n  I expect to see thousands of Americans in their communities--\nbusinesspeople, senior citizens, labor organizations, those from \ncharitable groups--so many who are falling between the cracks in our \nhealth care system speaking out and calling for congressional action. I \nthink it is very timely because Congress must get at this critical \nissue.\n  Very shortly, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I will \nagain go forward with our bipartisan proposal, the Health Care That \nWorks For All Americans Act. Our legislation has been endorsed by the \nChamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and the American Association of \nRetired Persons--three groups that do not normally flock together--\nbecause I think there is a feeling that what has been tried for the \nlast 57 years, in the effort to create a health care system that works \nfor all, simply has not worked.\n  For 57 years, there has been an effort to write health care \nlegislation in Washington, DC. The American people find these bills \nillegible, the special interest groups attack, and invariably nothing \nhappens.\n  So what Senator Hatch and I will shortly propose is something \nfundamentally different, an effort to look outside the beltway here in \nWashington, DC, to the American people, an effort that will begin with \nthe central questions, and coming up with a system that works for all \nAmericans.\n  Those questions are, first and foremost, what are the essential \nservices Americans want in a comprehensive health reform bill? Second, \nwhat will those services cost? And, third, who is going to pay for \nthem?\n  I am of the view that getting the American people involved in those \nkinds of issues--issues that are central to creating a system that \nworks for all--is the only way Congress is going to break the gridlock \non this question.\n  Right now, we are seeing our small businesses getting annual premiums \nrising more than 20 percent a year. Many health care providers, \nparticularly physicians in rural and urban areas, are leaving the \nGovernment programs because of inadequate reimbursement rates. \nCertainly we have heard from many health care providers about rising \ninsurance costs. And then, of course, for seniors, their prescription \ndrug bills are hitting them just like a wrecking ball.\n\n  All of this, of course, is happening before the demographic tsunami \nof millions of baby boomer retirees, as 2010 and 2011 approaches. In \nthose years we are going to start seeing a bow wave of baby boomer \nretirees that is going to continue for 15 to 20 years, after it begins \nin 2010 and 2011, and clearly our health care system is not prepared \nfor it.\n  So the question then becomes, what is going to be done to break the \ngridlock on this issue? You have very powerful interests. And \ncertainly, partisan feelings on these issues run very strongly. If you \ngo to a lot of Republican meetings and talk about the health care cost \ncrisis, they say: Of course it is a problem. We have to act on this. It \nis just the trial lawyers' fault. Let's go and take them on, and things \nwill get better.\n  Then if you go to a lot of Democratic meetings and talk about health \ncare costs and the health care crisis, they will say: You bet it is the \ninsurance companies. If you take them on, everything is going to get \nbetter.\n  What Senator Hatch and I have said, in this essentially \nunprecedented, bipartisan effort, that really would involve the \nAmerican people in creating a new health care system, is that we \nrealize so many of these powerful organizations are going to have to \nlook at changes that have been resisted in the past. My sense is it is \ntime for the Congress to act, and to begin by ensuring there will be \ncongressional action on these issues.\n  If you look, for example, at the last time the Congress debated \nsignificant health reform, back in 1993 and 1994, there were not even \nany votes on this issue. After all of the debate and all of the \ncontroversy surrounding those proposals in 1993 and 1994, there were \nnot even votes in the Congress on fundamental reforms.\n  So what Senator Hatch and I have done is ensure that after the public \nis given an opportunity to weigh in--in community meetings, on line, \nand across the country--on the kind of health care system that would \nwork for all Americans, we guarantee a vote on the floor of the Senate \nand a vote in the House of Representatives on this issue.\n  I think by involving the public, and then following up promptly with \nan assurance there will actually be votes in the Congress on these \nissues, we have a chance to move this debate forward in a fashion we \nhave not seen in the past.\n  What seems unfortunate is there are lots of ideas with respect to how \nto move forward on comprehensive health reform but no vehicle for \nbringing together the American people and a way for Congress to follow \nup on those initiatives. That is why I have believed, with Senator \nHatch, we can take a fresh approach that could really break with the \npast.\n  I was struck, in preparing this legislation, how similar the efforts \nwere over the last 58 years. If you look at what Harry Truman proposed \nin 1945, in the 81st Congress, it was remarkably similar, in terms of \nhow the debate unfolded, to what President Clinton proposed in 1993 and \n1994. In both cases, you began with bills written in Washington, DC. \nThe American people found the proposals incomprehensible. They were \nattacked by interest groups. And the legislation died at that point.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nChamber. I know he is going to begin discussion on the Estrada \nnomination very shortly.\n  Since he is in the Chamber, I express my thanks to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has been working with me for a \nsubstantial amount of time on our bipartisan health reform proposal. \nBecause next week will involve thousands of Americans at the grassroots \nlevel talking about these issues, I thought it was important to come to \nthe floor today and say that the Senate is now listening because the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has been willing to work with me on \nthese issues, because he shares my view that it is critically important \nthat we break the gridlock on the health care issue.\n  I announce to the Senate that very shortly Senator Hatch and I will \nbe going forward with our proposal, the Health Care that Works for All \nAmericans Act. We have gotten a formal endorsement from the Chamber of \nCommerce, the AFL-CIO, and the AARP--three groups that do not exactly \nflock together on a regular basis. To a great extent, those \norganizations have been involved because of the prestige and stature of \nthe senior Senator from Utah. He is, of course, the author of the\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\nCHIP legislation, which was a tremendous breakthrough in terms of \nhealth care coverage for young people. He has worked with me \nextensively on community health center legislation.\n  At a time when the eyes of our Nation are focused on international \ncrises, I want to draw some attention to the incredible crisis at home \nwith respect to health care. We have millions of citizens who are not \nold enough for Medicare. They are not poor enough for Medicaid. Small \nbusinesses are being crushed by annual premiums. Physicians are leaving \nthe system. Older people are not able to afford their medicine. This \nCongress, with the ingenuity and the talent in this Chamber, can come \nup with a health care system that works for all Americans.\n  Toward that end, I have been very gratified that the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah, has joined me for a \nsubstantial time. We are going to stay at it until we get our proposal \non the floor and the Congress breaks with this 57-year gridlock on the \nhealth care issue, gridlock that dates back to the days of Harry \nTruman. We can do it with some bipartisanship, which is what the \nSenator from Utah and I have tried to offer.\n  I will talk more about this next week when Coverage for the Uninsured \nWeek begins across the country.\n  I thank again the Senator from Utah and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear colleague from Oregon for his leadership \nin this area. When he was in the House, he was one of the great leaders \non health care issues. He is repeating that leadership in the Senate. \nIt is a privilege to work with him because you can rely on him. When he \nsays he will do something, he does it. He is very intelligent in health \ncare matters. I have a lot of respect for him, and it is a privilege to \nwork with him. I hope people will listen to the bill that we will \npresent because it is the way to at least move us off the dime and get \nus to do what we should be doing on health care. I thank him and pay \ntribute to him this morning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Utah. We are going to move to the Estrada nomination in executive \nsession. However, prior to doing that, Senator Roberts and I are here. \nWe have long served on the Ethics Committee, and we have a statement we \nwish to give. Senator Hatch has agreed that we can do so prior to going \nto executive session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roberts and I be allowed to \nspeak. As far as the time after that is concerned, we do not believe it \nneeds to be equally divided. If Senator Hatch wants to take all the \ntime, he can do that. I don't think we have anybody who wishes to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3116-S3117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VICTOR BAIRD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I was first elected to the Senate, I \nspent a lot of time trying to figure out the committee structure. It is \ndifferent than it is in the House. But I learned quickly that here, as \nin the House, the work gets done in committees.\n  I was fortunate early to be asked to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Public Works Committee. I have served on these \ncommittees since I have been in the Senate. In these committees, I saw \nthat the two ingredients necessary for successful operation of a \ncommittee were to make sure that there was not extreme partisanship and \nthat we and a good, competent staff.\n  I have served in the majority and the minority while a Member of the \nSenate. I have been ranking member of a subcommittee, a chairman of a \nsubcommittee. I have been chairman of a full committee on two separate \noccasions.\n  But regardless of which capacity I have served in, these ingredients \nremain constant.\n  Though I enjoyed the benefits of both good staff and bipartisanship \nduring my years on these excellent committees, I was uncertain what to \nexpect when I was asked to serve on the Committee on Ethics. I soon \ndiscovered that that committee was no different from any of the others, \nthat you need a good staff and nonpartisanship.\n  It has been a tremendous pleasure for me to work with Senator Pat \nRoberts of Kansas. We have worked through some very difficult issues \nwhile we have served as chairman and ranking member of the committee. \nAs we all know, Senator Roberts has a great sense of humor. But that \nsense of humor is never, ever in the way of doing the right thing for \nthis institution. He is a person who served for many decades in the \nCongress, and his service here in the Senate has been a rewarding one \nfor Members of the Senate because he has brought his experience from \nthe House and made this place a better institution. I can speak with \nauthority in that regard as a result of how he handled himself on the \nEthics Committee during the time he and I served as chairman and \nranking member or vice versa.\n  It is a disappointment to me that he is no longer chairman of that \ncommittee, but the rules are such that he could not serve in that \ncapacity while serving in the same capacity on another committee. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Voinovich, who has replaced him. I \nonly hope that he is half as good in that capacity as Senator Roberts. \nIf that is the case, the Senate will be well served.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee is truly a unique committee. Unlike other \ncommittees, it is comprised of an even number of Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is led by a chair and vice chair. The staff is entirely \nnonpartisan. Most significantly, the committee's obligation is to \nensure that Members of this body adhere to the high ethical standards \nexpected of them as Members of the Senate. This is an obligation that \ntranscends partisan political differences.\n  I have had the honor of serving on the Ethics Committee for a long \ntime. I have had the privilege of being both the chair and the vice \nchair of the committee. Throughout all my time, however, the individual \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of this committee has been \nVictor Baird. In fact, Victor has served on the Ethics Committee since \n1987 as the staff director and chief counsel.\n  He has guided the committee through some of its most controversial \ncases. Regardless of the case or the controversy, however, Victor Baird \ncould be relied on to steer the committee with a degree of \nimpartiality, calmness, and firmness that will be a model for his \nsuccessors.\n  It is significant to note that Victor Baird is leaving the Ethics \nCommittee to enjoy a rich and deserved retirement. His career path is a \ntribute to those who look at public service as a possibility.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, Victor served on the Consumers' \nUtility Council of Georgia, was an administrative law judge in Georgia, \nand served as an assistant attorney general of Georgia.\n  He also is another son of Georgia who found his calling in public \nservice and is finishing his career serving the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. Like other Georgians in the Senate, Victor enjoyed a \ndistinguished career in the U.S. military. He was honorably discharged \nin 1970 from the U.S. Air Force and was a recipient of the Bronze Star. \nDuring his 3 years in the Air Force, he served as a meteorologist and \nwas responsible for predicting tropical storms. I am sure the storms \nthat came after he took this job at the Ethics Committee were certainly \nmore than any of the storms he saw in the nonpolitical environment. I \nam sure that Victor's ability to forecast stormy weather served him \nwell in the Senate.\n  Victor Baird's professional career is marked by serving the public. \nThat alone deserves our commendation. It is unfortunate today that \npublic service is viewed as a short-time venture for some, but I \nbelieve it is a noble calling. The financial rewards are few and the \nhours can be very long. Those who commit their lives to public service \nretire knowing their work, no matter how great or how small, has \ncontributed to the betterment of society. That alone is a reward that \ncannot be quantified in dollars.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I wish to thank Victor Baird \nfor his 15 years of service on the Select Committee on Ethics. Victor's \ncontributions to the betterment of this institution are significant. \nThe Senate\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nhas long recognized that public service is a public trust. Today there \nis greater trust in our Government and in this institution as a result \nof Victor Baird's service on the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.\n  I will miss calling Victor at home at night, trying to find out where \nhe is because there is a question that has to be answered immediately. \nI am sure in some ways he will miss me. But I certainly wish Victor the \nvery best in his retirement. He has been a public servant I will always \nadmire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, I wish to sincerely thank my \ndistinguished colleague and my dear friend from Nevada--Searchlight, \nNV, by the way--Senator Reid, for his very kind comments.\n  It has been a team effort in behalf of Senator Reid and myself as we \nhave tried to serve--some people would say sentenced to--the Ethics \nCommittee. But we have been very conscientious in fulfilling this duty, \nand I think we have done so with Senator Reid's unique ability to not \nonly come up with what is right, according to the ethics manual, but \nwhat is basically common sense. As a matter of fact, Senator Reid has \nthis notion that continually is expressed: Gee, Pat, we ought to sit \ndown and really see if we can rewrite the ethics manual to make it \nactually understood by Members of the Senate and reform it, make it \nadhere to a criterion--a yardstick, if you will--of common sense.\n  I always tried to dissuade him from that. No. 1, I did not want to \nundertake that mountain to climb, and it would be a big mountain to \nclimb, because just as soon as you start that, why, other Members add \nother mountains.\n  At any rate, Senator Reid has been a joy to work with. I admire his \nleadership. He is soft spoken and, as I have indicated, has brought a \nlot of common sense and has tried to make the Ethics Committee \nproactive and very helpful to Members. As a matter of fact, with every \nnew class of Senators that comes in, we have a briefing, and Harry \nalways points out: Ask; ask first before there is any problem. And that \nis certainly good advice.\n\n  I thank Senator Reid for his very kind remarks. I do not know about \nthe decades of public service that I have accrued. Gosh, decades sounds \nlike a long time. I may be fossilized here before we are through with \nthese remarks. I am an old piece of furniture around here, I guess, in \nthe House and Senate.\n  With that experience comes at least some expertise and some real \nappreciation in behalf of certain staff. We are only as good as our \nstaff, I do not care whether you are an individual Member's staff, \ncommittee staff, select committee staff, whatever. It is a real honor \nfor me to offer a few brief remarks for our outgoing Senate Ethics \nstaff director, Mr. Victor Baird.\n  He has 16 years of service, and he now leaves this to enter \nretirement and, doubtlessly, what will be a new phase of life. His \nretirement is certainly well deserved, but his absence will be a great \nloss to the Senate.\n  Sometimes the most important positions are the ones that go \nunacknowledged. This is certainly true with the staff director of the \nEthics Committee. It is one of the few positions where accolades do not \nreally accrue. Only when a storm or controversy presents does the \nspotlight focus on the staff director. When this occurs, the director \nfaces intense challenges from all angles, including media scrutiny, \npublic outcry, and, yes, even partisan bickering. Yet he endures all \nthis for one supreme objective, and this is what Victor did--to \npreserve the integrity of this institution we call the United States \nSenate.\n  For almost a decade and a half, why, Victor Baird has assumed this \nthankless but important job. It is a job requiring keen attention to \ndetail, mastery of the rules, and a precise level of foresight on how \nethics rulings affect the Senate, not only in the present but for \nfuture generations. Just as the Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police \nguard the physical structure of the Senate, Victor Baird guarded the \nreputation of these halls. He accomplished this by insistence that \nMembers adhere and remain accountable to high ethical standards.\n  During his tenure, he guided the Senate through some very tumultuous \ntimes that often really threatened the reputation of the Senate. As we \nall know, a compromised reputation will diminish credibility, and \ndiminished credibility threatens a mandate to govern. It is that \nimportant. With this loss, our whole system of checks and balances \nwould suffer which is vital to the strength of our democracy. All of \nus, regardless of what side of the aisle we sit on, should understand \nthis.\n  Thankfully, Victor handled all ethics proceedings, and particularly \nthose with intense media focus, judiciously, without staining the \ndignity of the Senate. He safeguarded us. This is not an easy task, and \nall of us should be very grateful.\n  The Senate is unlike any other governing body in the world. \nDeliberative by design, it exists to make sure we thoroughly consider \nour actions. In a town fueled by hotly charged emotions that often \nmakes decisions for the moment, thankfully Victor was always available \nfor advice and counsel.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Reid, and I often sought his well-\nreasoned, objective legal opinions. We respected his vast institutional \nknowledge and understanding of how this body should conduct itself. \nWhen dealing with ethics issues, it is important Members rise above \npartisan politics, which is hard to do sometimes, and examine each \nissue on a case-by-case basis. This is what our Founding Fathers \nintended. Maintaining the Senate's distinguished legacy is a task all \nof us must assume, regardless of politics. Victor knows this; Victor \nknew this, and always kept this premise at the forefront of his \nresponsibilities.\n  His most important contribution was understanding that the \ncommittee's ultimate goal was proactive and preventive in nature. He \nmade sure that all Members and their staff knew the rules of acceptable \nconduct at the outset. In public office, innocent mistakes can quickly \nbreak a career. This is why the Ethics Committee, and in particular the \nstaff director, is so important. He is the gatekeeper. He is the \nadviser. He is the counselor to us all. Victor Baird certainly filled \neach of these roles with the utmost professionalism and integrity.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, we thank you for your service and \nyour dedication, Victor. Your influence has preserved the reputation of \nthis governing body for the past 16 years, and we salute you.\n  In the U.S. Marine Corps, we always conclude by saying: Semper Fi. \nThat means always faithful.\n  You have been always faithful, Victor. Semper Fi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, the distinguished \nminority floor leader from Nevada, who is a dear friend of the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas, and my dear friend from Kansas, in \npaying tribute to Victor Baird. That is one of the most miserable, \ntough jobs I think in the whole Senate. As both of them have said, \nthere is not a lot of thanks for doing it. I personally thank him for \nthe efforts he has put forward, and those who worked with him, because \nthis is a very difficult job. He has always been straightforward, \nhonest, and decent in all of the experiences I know about. I join my \ncolleagues in their remarks and ask that I be associated with their \nremarks. I wish him the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3117-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and resume consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. \nEstrada, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the course of the debate on Miguel \nEstrada, there have been many serious misrepresentations of the record \non Mr. Estrada. I want to address in some detail one of the more \nserious distortions which concerns the answers Mr. Estrada gave during \nhis extensive hearing, one of the longest hearings for a circuit court \nof appeals nominee, to questions members of the Judiciary Committee \nasked him.\n  The charge being leveled against Mr. Estrada is that he did not \nanswer questions put to him in general and did not answer questions \nabout his judicial philosophy in particular. That charge is pure bunk.\n  It is important to remember the circumstances under which this \nhearing took place. The hearing was held on September 26, 2002. It was \nchaired by my Democratic friend, the senior Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer. It lasted all day, which was unusual in and of itself. Both \nDemocratic and Republican Senators asked scores of questions which Mr. \nEstrada answered. If any Senator was dissatisfied with Mr. Estrada's \nanswers, every member of the committee had the opportunity to ask Mr. \nEstrada followup questions, although only two of my Democratic \ncolleagues did.\n  Now, a number of the questions Mr. Estrada was asked sought directly \nor indirectly to pry from him a commitment on how he would rule in a \nparticular case. Previous judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate \nhave rightly declined to answer questions on that basis, just as Mr. \nEstrada did. Virtually every Clinton nominee refused to answer \nquestions about how they would decide cases or what they would do in \ncertain circumstances. I will give some examples.\n  In 1967, during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, \nJustice Thurgood Marshall responded to a question about the fifth \namendment by stating:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in a position of giving \n     you a statement on the fifth amendment and then if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the court when a fifth amendment case \n     comes up I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  During Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's confirmation hearing, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, defended her refusal to discuss her views on \nabortion. He said:\n\n       It is offensive to suggest that a potential Justice of the \n     Supreme Court must pass some presumed test of judicial \n     philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest that a \n     potential Justice must pass the litmus test of any single \n     interest group.\n\n  Senator Kennedy was concerned perhaps Justice O'Connor might possibly \nhave difficulty with the conservative side or the pro-life side because \nshe may have been pro-choice. The fact is nobody really knew, and there \nwere some concerns about that, but Senator Kennedy was right when he \nsaid:\n\n       It is offensive to suggest that a potential Justice of the \n     Supreme Court must pass some presumed test of judicial \n     philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest that a \n     potential Justice must pass a litmus test of any single-issue \n     interest group.\n\n  He was right then. But why is there today a different standard for \nMiguel Estrada? Why the comments and remarks by some on the committee \nwho are saying Mr. Estrada should have answered these types of \nquestions?\n  Likewise, I will give another. Justice John Paul Stevens testified \nduring his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court:\n\n       I really don't think I should discuss this subject \n     generally, Senator. I don't mean to be unresponsive but in \n     all candor I must say there have been many times in my \n     experience in the last 5 years where I found that my first \n     reaction to a problem was not the same as the reaction I had \n     when I had the responsibility of decisions and I think that \n     if I were to make comments that were not carefully thought \n     through they might be given significance that they really did \n     not merit.\n\n  It was an excellent answer, but it was basically the same answer that \nMiguel Estrada gave to similar questions, and that almost every other \nnominee of Democrat and Republican administrations, since I have been \non the committee, have given.\n  Why the double standard for Miguel Estrada? Why are we expecting him \nto answer questions that we did not expect leading Democrat judges, or \nother leading judges, to answer? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now \nsitting on the Supreme Court, also declined to answer certain \nquestions, stating: Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it \nwould be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative chamber \nhow I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme Court may be called \nupon to decide. Were I to rehearse here what I would say and how I \nwould reason on some questions, I would act injudiciously.\n  Like these previous nominees, all of whom the Senate confirmed, Mr. \nEstrada refused to violate the code of ethics for judicial nominees by \ndeclining to give answers that would appear to commit him on issues he \nwill be called upon to decide as a judge. Again and again, he provided \nanswers in direct response to questions that make his judicial \nphilosophy an open book. I will share some specific examples.\n  Responding to a question to identify the most important attribute of \na judge, Mr. Estrada answered that it was to have an appropriate \nprocess for decision-making. That, he said, entails having an open \nmind, listening to the parties, reading their briefs, doing all of the \nlegwork on the law and facts, engaging in deliberation with colleagues, \nand being committed to judging as a process that is intended to give \nthe right answer.\n  Now, these are not extreme views. I do not think we could ask more \nfrom any nominee for a judgeship.\n  When asked about the appropriate temperament of a judge, he responded \nthat a judge should be impartial, open minded, and unbiased, courteous \nyet firm, and one who will give ear to people who come into his \ncourtroom.\n  These are the qualities of Miguel Estrada. He testified that he is \nand would continue to be that type of a person who listens with both \nears and who is fair to all litigants.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked a number of questions about his views and \nphilosophy on following legal precedent. Let me highlight a little of \nthose exchanges.\n  Question:\n\n       Are you committed to following the precedents of higher \n     courts faithfully and giving them full force and effect even \n     if you disagree with such precedents?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Absolutely, Senator.\n\n  Question:\n\n       What would you do if you believed the Supreme Court or the \n     court of appeals had seriously erred in rendering a decision? \n     Would you apply that decision or would you use your own \n     judgment of the merits or the best judgment of the merits?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       My duty as a judge and my inclination as a person and as a \n     lawyer of integrity would be to follow the orders of the \n     higher court.\n\n  Question:\n\n       And if there were no controlling precedent dispositively \n     concluding an issue with which you were presented in your \n     circuit, to what sources would you turn for persuasive \n     authority?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       In such a circumstance, my cardinal rule would be to seize \n     aid from anyplace where I could get it, related case law, \n     legislative history, custom and practice and views of \n     academics on analysis of law.\n\n  Pretty good answers. These are better answers than most of the \njudgeship nominees who have come before the committee over the last 27 \nyears.\n  These exchanges illustrate clearly Miguel Estrada's respect for the \nlaw and his willingness and ability to faithfully follow the law. He \nfurther testifies in response to other questions: I will follow binding \ncase law in every case, even in accordance with the case law that is \nnot binding but seems instructive on the area, without any influence \nwhatever from my personal\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nview I may have about the subject matter.\n  This is what we expect good judges to do. I can see no reason anyone \nwould be opposed to a nominee who promised to follow the law.\n  When asked about the role of political ideology and the legal \nprocess, Mr. Estrada replied with a response that, in my view, was \nentirely appropriate and within the mainstream of what all Americans \nexpect from their judiciary. He said: Although we all have views on a \nnumber of subjects from A to Z, the first duty of the judge is to self-\nconsciously put that aside and look at each case with an open mind and \nlisten to the parties, and to the best of his human capacity to give \njudgment based solely on the arguments on the law. I think my basic \nidea of judging is to do it on the basis of law and to put aside \nwhatever view I might have on the subject, to the maximum extent \npossible.\n  Pretty good answer. Why isn't that answer good enough for my \ncolleagues on the other side? It is better than most answers given by \ntheir nominees when their President controlled the White House and the \nnomination process.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked about his views on interpreting the \nConstitution. Mr. Estrada was forthright and complete in his responses. \nFor example, in an exchange regarding the literal interpretation of the \nwords of the Constitution, Mr. Estrada responded:\n\n       I recognize that the Supreme Court has said on numerous \n     occasions, in the area of privacy and elsewhere, that there \n     are unenumerated rights in the Constitution, and I have no \n     view of any sort, whether legal or personal, that would \n     hinder me from applying those rulings by the court. But I \n     think the court has been quite clear that there are \n     unenumerated rights in the Constitution. In the main, the \n     court has recognized them as being inherent in the right of \n     substantive due process and the liberty clause of the 14th \n     amendment.\n\n  That is a pretty good answer, a lot better answer than many of the \nClinton nominees made, although I am not meaning to criticize them. It \nis just that there is a different standard being applied here, a double \nstandard. They were not expected to give these great answers he has \ngiven, that my colleagues on the other side have said he didn't give. \nRead the record. It is replete with decent, good, honorable, and \nintelligent answers to their questions.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked questions about the appropriate balance between \nCongress and the courts. His answers made clear his view that judges \nmust review challenges to statutes with a strong presumption of the \nstatute's constitutionality. For example, in responding to a question \nabout environmental protection statutes he stated:\n\n       Congress has passed a number of statutes that try to \n     safeguard the environment. I think all judges would have to \n     read those statutes when they come to court with a strong \n     presumption of constitutionality.\n\n  At the same time, he recognized that as a circuit court judge he \nwould be bound to follow the precedents established by Lopez and other \nSupreme Court cases. Now, some of my colleagues do not like Lopez and \nthey wish he would be an activist judge and not follow it. But he said \nhe would be bound by it, as he would the other Supreme Court \npronouncements. That is all you can ask of a nominee.\n  Why the double standard? Why is it that Miguel Estrada is being held \nto a different standard than the Clinton judgeship nominees were?\n  Mr. President, it is clear from the record that Mr. Estrada did \nanswer the questions put to him at his hearing. His judicial philosophy \nis an open book. But if my Democratic colleagues are still inclined to \nvote against him, as misguided as I believe that choice to be, they \nshould do so in an up-or-down vote. Vote for him or vote against him or \ndo whatever your conscience dictates. Just vote. And stop this unfair \nfilibuster. It is unfair.\n  Let me make one more point. Even if my colleagues believed, despite \nthe facts and precedent, that Mr. Estrada should answer more questions, \nwell, they have had that chance. And in a February 27 letter, White \nHouse Counsel Al Gonzales made an offer. A copy of Mr. Gonzales' letter \nhas already been printed in the Record.\n  I don't know what more the administration can do other than say we \nwill make him available to you, you ask him whatever questions you \nwant, and you can find out for yourself whether you want to support him \nor not.\n  To my knowledge, not one of our colleagues on the other side has \ntaken advantage of this offer. Not one. How interested are they in \ngetting the real story? Not one. Yet we had Senators on the floor \nyesterday saying all he has to do is answer our questions. Here is an \noffer: He will come right to your office and answer the questions for \nyou. Not one has asked him to come to the office, which makes me \nquestion how serious they are about the merits of Mr. Estrada's \nnomination.\n  That brings me to another point. Mr. Estrada's hearing was held under \nDemocratic control of the committee on September 26, 2002. If there was \nany question about the quality of Mr. Estrada's testimony, they could \nhave held another hearing, they could have extended the hearing, and \nthey could have held another hearing since they controlled the \ncommittee for another 3 months. Why didn't they hold another hearing? \nWhy didn't they ask these questions that are so crucial? Because they \nthought they could kill the nomination by never bringing it up. \nUnfortunately for them and fortunately for the country, the election \nturned the other way and Mr. Estrada, of course, was nominated by the \nnew President.\n  I think there is some hypocrisy, especially with regard to these \nresponses that Mr. Estrada gave, because they are deemed sufficient for \nClinton judges but they are not good enough now. Why this double \nstandard for this Hispanic man? Some Democrats have railed against \nEstrada for his responses to questions from the Judiciary Committee, as \nI have said. The fact is, however, the Democrats routinely voted in \nfavor of Clinton nominees who gave similar responses, maybe not as good \nbut similar responses. These were nominees who had never been judges \nand had few published writings. In their responses to questions they \nacknowledged the law, said they would follow it, and confirmed that \nthey would not let their personal views get in the way--responses just \nlike Miguel Estrada gave. Not one of these nominees, however, was \ndenied a vote on the floor, not one.\n  Take, for example, Blane Michael, a Clinton nominee for the Fourth \nCircuit. He was asked what he would do if his personal beliefs and the \nlaw collided. He said he would uphold the Constitution and the law \nwithout question. As to whether he would follow Supreme Court \nprecedents, he said: It is not my job to circumvent or shade what the \nSupreme Court has done.\n  Was he asked to expound on his favorite or least favorite Supreme \nCourt cases? No. The record is less than four pages on his questioning.\n  Sid Thomas was another Clinton nominee not subjected to the same \nlevel of interrogation as Estrada. In fact, none of them were. Thomas, \nwho had never been a judge or even a judicial clerk, was asked what he \nthought about the constitutionality of capital punishment.\n  He said:\n\n       I believe the Supreme Court has spoken . . . on the death \n     penalty.\n\n  That was it. Thomas, who I should add had very few published \nwritings, added:\n\n       I do not possess any personal convictions which would cause \n     me to not apply the death penalty in an appropriate case.\n\n  The Thomas hearing takes up less than 2 pages in the Record.\n  Why were they treated differently by my colleagues on the other side \nthan Miguel Estrada? Why is it? I don't see any reason, unless they are \njust not going to allow this President to nominate, as all Presidents \nin the past have done, the people he thinks are best for these jobs; or \nunless they just do not want to have a conservative Hispanic nominee \nappointed to this important court; or maybe they just do not want \nMiguel Estrada to get confirmed because they believe he is on the fast \ntrack to the Supreme Court and could be the first Hispanic nominated \nand confirmed to the Supreme Court; or maybe it is because he is \nHispanic, but he is conservative; or maybe it is because he is Hispanic \nand he is Republican and he is conservative; or maybe it is because he \nis Hispanic, he is Republican, he is conservative, and they think he \nmay be pro-life.\n  It is one of those. I personally do not believe there is racism \ninvolved, although there are those who do--but I am not one of them. I \nbelieve there is\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\na double standard being applied to this Hispanic nominee, the first \nHispanic nominee to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia, and I think it is a crying shame.\n  Merrick Garland, a Clinton nominee to the Fourth Circuit, was asked \nif he personally favored the death penalty. I personally was very much \nin favor of Merrick Garland, but there were some on our side who were \nnot very much enthused about him. He was a controversial nominee, as \nwere these others. But he was a Clinton nominee to the Fourth Circuit. \nHe was personally asked if he favored the death penalty. He responded \nby saying it is a matter of settled law. When asked about the \nindependent counsel law, Garland said that, too, was settled and that \nhe would follow that ruling.\n  These sound an awful lot like the responses of Miguel Estrada, the \nones he gave, responses that Democrats say do not give them enough \ninformation. These Clinton nominees were all not only voted out of \ncommittee but were allowed an up-or-down vote on the floor, regardless \nof the fact that some of them were controversial--to borrow some of the \nlanguage of my colleagues on the other side.\n  My colleague from New York has stated that according to an article \nthat appeared in the Legal Times in April 2002, DC Circuit Judge \nLaurence Silberman has advised President Bush's judicial nominees to \n``keep their mouths shut.'' As the rest of the article explains, in \nfact, Judge Silberman simply explained that the rules of judicial \nethics prohibit nominees from indicating how they would rule in a given \ncase or on a given issue--or even appearing to indicate how they would \nrule.\n  As the same article reported, Judge Silberman stated:\n\n       It is unethical to answer such questions. It can't help but \n     have some effect on your decisionmaking process once you \n     become a judge.\n\n  A copy of this article has also been printed in the Record.\n  Yet I heard my colleagues on the other side yesterday blowing smoke \nover there, using a quote out of context to try to indicate that Judge \nSilberman was giving them radical advice. The fact is, he gave them \nadvice that every Democrat President and every Democrat President's \nJustice Department has given to the Democrat nominees for these courts. \nIt is proper advice.\n  This advice is consistent with Canon 5A(3)(d) of the ABA's Model Code \nof Judicial Conduct, which states that prospective judges:\n\n       [S]hall not . . . make pledges or promises of conduct in \n     office other than the faithful and impartial performance of \n     the duties of office . . . [or] make statements that commit \n     or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, \n     controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the \n     court.\n\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall made the same point in 1967 when he \nrefused, as I mentioned before, to answer questions about the fifth \namendment during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. I \nreferenced that quote earlier.\n  Let me go to this letter from Seth Waxman, on behalf of Seth Waxman, \nWalter Dellinger, Drew S. Days, Kenenth W. Starr, Charles Fried, Robert \nBork, and Archibald Cox. That is seven of the living former Solicitors \nGeneral. Seth Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew Days, and Archibald Cox \nare Democrat former Solicitors General.\n  Here is what they said, and they said it in response to the \nDemocrats, who have been saying we have to get these privileged \nmaterials because we do not know enough about Miguel Estrada, even \nthough we have had a full day of hearings conducted where we could have \nasked any questions we wanted to, where we could have held additional \nhearings, we could have filed written questions--only two of them did--\nwe could have asked additional questions, only two of them did. They \neven said the hearing was fair and fairly conducted. But this is a \nletter.\n  Let me just go back. They are hiding behind this red herring, \ndemanding papers they know no self-respecting administration can give \nbecause it would interrupt, disturb the flow, and make it more \ndifficult for the Solicitor General of the United States to do his or \nher job. I think this letter says it all. It was a letter written to \nthe Honorable Patrick J. Leahy on June 24, 2002, better than 18 months \nago:\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our concern about \n     your recent request that the Department of Justice turn over \n     ``appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \n     amicus recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while \n     in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of Solicitor General--under \n     Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decisionmaking process. The Solicitor General is \n     charged with the weighty responsibility of deciding whether \n     to appeal adverse decisions in cases where the United States \n     is a party, whether to seek Supreme Court review of adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae in other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important Federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department, nor just of the executive branch, but of \n     the entire Federal Government, including Congress.\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decisionmaking requires candor, and candor in turn requires \n     confidentiality.\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the U.S. litigation \n     interests--a cost that also would be borne by Congress \n     itself.\n       Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the Federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.\n\n  Four of those former Solicitors General were Democrat Solicitors \nGeneral. Mr. Estrada served three of those Democrat Solicitors General \nbecause he served, as I recall, 4 years in the Clinton administration \nin the Solicitor General's Office without any bad reaction. Then he \nserved 1 year in the Bush administration.\n  Most people would say Archibald Cox is a person of the highest legal \nintegrity and highest legal abilities. Knowing him personally, I have \nto say that is true. Most people would say Drew Days is one of the fine \nlawyers and law professors in this country. Most people would say--in \nfact, I think everybody would say with regard to these Democrat former \nSolicitors General who have said these records should be privileged, \nthat Walter Dellinger was one of the great law professors at Duke, also \na great public servant, and now one of the leading lawyers in one of \nthe major law firms in the country, himself mentioned for the Supreme \nCourt from time to time, a man I have to admit I have gained increasing \nrespect for through the years.\n  It is pretty hard to find a better lawyer than Seth Waxman. He is a \ngreat lawyer. And he is somebody on whom I think the Democrats could \nrely. Have those colleagues on the other side asked those four people? \nThe fact is those four people have basically said Miguel Estrada did a \ngreat job at the Solicitor Generals's Office. In fact, Seth Waxman, in \nparticular, said he did a fine job there. The performance evaluations \nthat described Mr. Estrada's work there are of the highest laudatory \nevaluation of staff. The only person who has raised any conflict is \nProfessor Paul Bender, who gave those glowing performance evaluations \nat a time closest to the service of Miguel Estrada, but who is a very \nleft-wing liberal Democrat law professor who has entered into this \ndebate--and in an improper way, in my opinion--to try to smear Mr. \nEstrada, which he has done. He is the only one they can point to who \nhas any real criticism of Miguel Estrada's work at the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office.\n\n  I think those Democrat Senators on the other side of the floor would \ndo very well to talk to Seth Waxman, Walter Dellinger, Drew S. Days, \nIII, and Archibald Cox to say what is wrong with Mr. Estrada. I think \nthey won't do it because they know these people will say Mr. Estrada is \nan exceptionally fine lawyer, which he, of course, is.\n  This is a man who has the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation--the gold standard of our friends, the Democrats--and, of \ncourse, he has\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nall the credentials in the world as one of the leading appellate \nlawyers in the country. Even though he suffers from a disability, a \nspeech impediment, he has still risen to the top of the appellate \ncourt.\n  I know my colleague from Vermont is waiting. So I yield the floor at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                            THE PRICE OF WAR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for many months now, the administration \nhas shown its determination to wage war against Saddam Hussein.\n  I am very concerned that the Bush administration's intense focus on \nIraq has blinded it to the critical needs here at home.\n  While the administration prepares for a war with sky-rocketing cost \nestimates now in the range of $100 billion or more, it pleads poverty \nwhen it comes to funding our domestic needs.\n  While the administration fixates on Iraq, the economy teeters, the \nstock market tumbles, the terrorist threat at home persists, and \nschools are threatened with premature closings for lack of money.\n  Last week, our Nation's governors met here in Washington and issued a \ntroubling warning. They told us our States are hurting. They told us \nthey do not have the money they need to do their jobs and serve the \npeople of their States. They told us their situations would only worsen \nif the President were to enact his tax-cutting plans.\n  They told us they would need more than $15 billion this year alone in \nemergency funds for schools and domestic security. And as the headline \nin the New York Times put it, ``Governors Get Sympathy From Bush, But \nNo More Money.''\n  Sympathy will not pay our Nation's bills. We have the obligation to \naddress the crisis in America's schools with the same urgency as the \ncrises abroad. Our children deserve at least that much.\n  We have fallen woefully short in our commitment to our students, our \nteachers and our parents. We have failed to meet a promise that we made \nto our States nearly three decades ago to provide our fair share of \nspecial education funding.\n  And now, only 1 year after passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, \nwe are hearing that States don't have the money they need to make that \nlaw work.\n  Yet the administration continues to devote extraordinary resources to \nits campaign against Iraq, and to its pursuit of allies for that \ncampaign.\n  While critical education needs go unmet, the administration was able \nto cobble together the necessary funds to offer almost $30 billion \ndollars to enlist Turkish support for the war.\n  I suspect untold billions are also being promised to other nations \naround the globe. The President apparently is confident that all of \nthese expenses can be borne along with a significant tax cut. I \nsincerely question that logic.\n  There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's rule in Iraq has been marked \nby brutality. He is an evil dictator with clearly evil intentions, and \nis a long-term threat to the United States and its allies in the Middle \nEast.\n  Yet despite the well-documented atrocities associated with his rule \nand his clear flouting of U.N. resolutions, there still is no evidence \nof an imminent threat to the United States that justifies the \nadministration's march to war.\n  Iraq is of obvious importance to the United States and the world \nbecause of its geographical location and its oil reserves. Much of the \nworld depends upon fair access to Iraq's oil.\n  We went to war a decade ago to throw Iraq out of Kuwait and restore \nKuwait's right to control its oil. Similarly, control of Iraq's oil \nmust be put in the hands of the Iraqi people.\n  I praise the administration for abandoning its initial go-it-alone \nstrategy toward Iraq. I congratulate the President for his willingness \nto work through the United Nations and for the results he and the U.N. \nhave achieved since that decision.\n  An increasingly robust inspection process is under way, U2 planes are \nflying over Iraq under U.N. supervision, illegal missiles are being \ndestroyed by Iraq, and additional measures are under consideration to \nmore aggressively seek out illegal Iraqi weapons and programs.\n  The administration should continue to work with the U.N. to \nstrengthen the inspection efforts and seek peaceful means for achieving \nthe disarmament of Iraq. Instead, the administration appears bent on \ncutting this process short.\n  The administration has displayed a troubling lack of focus in \narticulating a rationale for military action in Iraq. Initial \ndiscussion of ``regime change'' shifted for some time to talk of \ndisarmament.\n  However, recent comments from the White House now indicate that we \nare back to ``regime change.''\n  The administration's expectations for post-Saddam Iraq are equally \ntroubling.\n  I am worried that the administration nurtures a naive belief that \nthere will be rapid transformation of the Middle East from an area in \nwhich autocratic governments and Islamist opposition forces vie for \npower to one in which democracy and Western ideals carry the day.\n  Talk of installing an American as temporary administrator of Iraq is \nalso very troubling. We should be sending the message to the Iraqi \npeople that we plan to put them in control of their country. The \nAmerican people are not interested in becoming Iraq's overlord. We \nshould be clear that we do not plan to rule Iraq as an American \nprotectorate.\n  We need to be much more explicit in setting forth the goals and \ntimetable for any post-war Western presence in Iraq.\n  Intelligence assessments make clear that the greatest threat today to \nthe United States is the threat posed by terrorist attacks.\n  We know that the fight against terrorism and the fight against the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction can only be waged \nsuccessfully with a robust set of international institutions and \nrelationships.\n  The administration's push for war with Iraq undermines our relations \nwith other countries and the strength of our international bodies at \nprecisely the moment when they are most important to the United States.\n  We must ensure that any action against Iraq does not jeopardize our \ncounterterrorism and counterproliferation fights.\n  President Bush has sought for many months to rally this Nation and \nthe world community behind the notion that the threat from Iraq is \nimminent and that preemptive military action is required. He has not \nsucceeded in making his case.\n  With no clear evidence of an imminent threat from Iraq, and with no \ncredible plan for postwar Iraq, we should be supporting the U.N. in its \nwork on the ground to bring about Iraqi compliance with U.N. \nresolutions.\n  Going to the U.N. must not be viewed merely as a cynical, tactical \nmove designed to justify and aid preparations for war. Instead, the \nUnited States owes it to the world community, and to the institutions \nit worked so hard to establish in the period since World War II, to \nmake a sincere effort to work with the U.N. to resolve the threat posed \nby Iraq in a peaceful fashion.\n  American Presidents have labored for many decades to construct \nrelationships and international bodies capable of handling situations \nsuch as this.\n  They, the American people, and our allies deserve a patient, \nbalanced, and considered approach to the current situation.\n  More importantly, the American people deserve an Administration that \ndevotes the same degree of energy and concentration to the crises here \nat home.\n  I think, on more careful inspection, the President will realize that \nthe domestic crises are truly imminent, and that they actually pose \nmore of a threat to America's long-term security than the situation \ntoday in Iraq.\n  I urge the President to stop before he has irrevocably committed us \nto the destruction and rebuilding of Iraq, which will draw away the \nresources that are so badly needed here at home.\n  It will take courage and true leadership, but I implore him to act in \nthis regard before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues to \na few of the more than 40 editorials or op-eds from around the Nation \nexpressing concerns about Mr. Estrada's nomination to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Here are just a few of them. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be printed in today's Record: the editorial of the Rutland \nDaily Herald of Vermont on February 24, 2003; the editorial of the \nBoston Globe on February 15, 2003; the recent editorial of the New York \nTimes; and the op-ed in the Washington Post on February 14, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n                            Partisan Warfare\n\n       Senate Democrats are expected to continue their filibuster \n     this week against the appointment of Miguel Estrada, a 41-\n     year-old lawyer whom President Bush has named to the federal \n     appeals court in Washington, D.C.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee, is in the middle of the fight over the Estrada \n     appointment. He and his fellow Democrats should hold firm \n     against the Estrada nomination.\n       Much is at stake in the Estrada case, most importantly the \n     question of whether the Democrats have the resolve to resist \n     the efforts of the Bush administration to pack the judiciary \n     with extreme conservative judges.\n       The problem with the Estrada nomination is that Estrada has \n     no record as a judge, and senators on the Judiciary Committee \n     do not believe he has been sufficiently forthcoming about his \n     views. It is their duty to advise and consent on judicial \n     nominees, and Estrada has given them no basis for deciding \n     whether to consent.\n       President Bush has called the Democrats' opposition to \n     Estrada disgraceful, and his fellow Republicans have made the \n     ludicrous charge that, in opposing Estrada, the Democrats are \n     anti-Hispanic. For a party on record against affirmative \n     action, the Republicans are guilty of cynical racial politics \n     for nominating Estrada in the first place. He has little to \n     qualify him for the position except that he is Hispanic.\n       Unless the Democrats are willing to stand firm against \n     Bush's most extreme nominations. Bush will have the \n     opportunity to push the judiciary far to the right of the \n     American people. Leahy, for one, has often urged Bush to send \n     to the Senate moderate nominees around whom Democrats and \n     Republicans could form a consensus. In a nation and a \n     Congress that is evenly divided politically, moderation makes \n     sense.\n       But Bush's Justice Department is driven by conservative \n     ideologues who see no reason for compromise. That being the \n     case, the Senate Democrats have no choice but to hold the \n     line against the most extreme nominees.\n       Leahy has drawn much heat for opposing Bush's nominees. But \n     he has opposed only three. In his tenure as chairman of the \n     committee, he sped through to confirmation far more nominees \n     than his Republican predecessor had done. But for the Senate \n     merely to rubber stamp the nominees sent their way by the \n     White House would be for the Senate to surrender its \n     constitutional role as a check on the excesses of the \n     executive.\n       The Republicans are accusing the Democrats of partisan \n     politics. Of course, the Republicans are expert at the game, \n     refusing even to consider numerous nominees sent to the \n     Senate by President Clinton.\n       The impasse over Estrada is partisan politics of an \n     important kind. The Republicans must not be allowed to shame \n     the Democrats into acquiescence. For the Democrats to give in \n     would be for them to surrender to the fierce partisanship of \n     the Republicans.\n       The wars over judicial nominees are likely to continue as \n     long as Bush, with the help of Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft, believes it is important to fill the judiciary with \n     extreme right-wing judges.\n       The Democrats, of course, would like nothing better than to \n     approve the nomination of a Hispanic judge. But unless the \n     nominee is qualified, doing so would be a form of racial \n     pandering. That is the game in which the Republicans are \n     engaged, and the Democrats must not allow it to succeed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 15, 2003]\n\n                             Rush to Judges\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee ought to come with a warning \n     sign: Watch out for fast-moving judicial nominees. Controlled \n     by Republicans, the committee is approving President Bush's \n     federal court nominees at speeds that defy common sense.\n       One example is Miguel Estrada, nominated to the US Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia. Nominated in May 2001, \n     Estrada has been on a slow track, his conservative views \n     attracting concern and criticism.\n       Some Republicans called Democrats anti-Hispanic for \n     challenging Estrada. He came to the United States from \n     Honduras at the age of 17, improved his English, earned a \n     college degree from Columbia, a law degree from Harvard, and \n     served as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n       What has raised red flags is Estrada's refusal to answer \n     committee members' questions about his legal views or to \n     provide documents showing his legal work. This prompted the \n     Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle, to conclude that \n     Estrada either ``knows nothing or he feels he needs to hide \n     something.''\n       Nonetheless, Estrada's nomination won partisan committee \n     approval last month. All 10 Republicans voted for him; all \n     nine Democrats voted against. On Tuesday Senate Democrats \n     began to filibuster Estrada's nomination, a dramatic move to \n     block a full Senate vote that could trigger waves of \n     political vendettas.\n       It's crucial to evaluate candidates based on their merits \n     and the needs of the country.\n       Given that the electorate was divided in 2000, it's clear \n     that the country is a politically centrist place that should \n     have mainstream judges, especially since many of these \n     nominees could affect the next several decades of legal life \n     in the United States.\n       Further, this is a nation that believes in protecting \n     workers' rights, especially in the aftermath of Enron. It's \n     an America that struggles with the moral arguments over \n     abortion but largely accepts a woman's right to make a \n     private choice. It's an America that believes in civil rights \n     and its power to put a Colin Powell on the international \n     stage.\n       Does Estrada meet these criteria? He isn't providing enough \n     information to be sure. And the records of some other \n     nominees fail to meet these standards.\n       Debating the merits of these nominees is also crucial \n     because some, like Estrada, could become nominees for the \n     Supreme Court.\n       The choir--Democrats, civil rights groups, labor groups, \n     and women's groups--is already singing about how modern-day \n     America should have modern-day judges. It's time for moderate \n     Republicans and voters to join in so that the president can't \n     ignore democracy's 21st-century judicial needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                   Keep Talking About Miguel Estrada\n\n       The Bush administration is missing the point in the Senate \n     battle over Miguel Estrada, its controversial nominee to the \n     powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats who have \n     vowed to filibuster the nomination are not engaging in \n     ``shameful politics,'' as the president has put it, nor are \n     they anti-Latino, as Republicans have cynically charged. They \n     are insisting that the White House respect the Senate's role \n     in confirming judicial nominees.\n       The Bush administration has shown no interest in working \n     with Senate Democrats to select nominees who could be \n     approved by consensus, and had dug in its heels on its most \n     controversial choices. At their confirmation hearings, \n     judicial nominees have refused to answer questions about \n     their views on legal issues. And Senate Republicans have \n     rushed through the procedures on controversial nominees.\n       Mr. Estrada embodies the White House's scorn for the \n     Senate's role. Dubbed the ``stealth candidate,'' he arrived \n     with an extremely conservative reputation but almost no paper \n     trail. He refused to answer questions, and although he had \n     written many memorandums as a lawyer in the Justice \n     Department, the White House refused to release them.\n       The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, insists that the \n     Senate be given the information it needs to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada. He says there cannot be a vote until senators are \n     given access to Mr. Estrada's memorandums and until they get \n     answers to their questions. The White House can call this \n     politics or obstruction. But in fact it is senators doing \n     their jobs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2003]\n\n                            Estrada's Omerta\n\n                          (By Michael Kinsley)\n\n       Like gangsters taking the Fifth, nominees for federal \n     judgeships have reduced their reason for not talking to a \n     mantra. Repeat after me: ``My view of the judicial function, \n     Senator, does not allow me to answer that question.'' Miguel \n     Estrada, President Bush's nominee for the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, used variations on that one \n     many times in refusing to express any opinion on any \n     important legal topic during Judiciary Committee hearings \n     last fall. Democrats are now trying to block the Estrada \n     nomination with a filibuster.\n       Estrada's ``view of the judicial function'' is shared by \n     President Bush, congressional Republicans and conservative \n     media voices hoarse with rage that Democratic senators want \n     to know what someone thinks before making him or her a judge. \n     The Estrada view is that judges should not prejudge the \n     issues that will come before them. As Estrada amplified in \n     this testimony, ``I'm very firmly of the view that although \n     we all have views on a number of subjects from A to Z, the \n     job of a judge is to subconsciously put that aside and look \n     at each case . . . with an open mind.''\n       Obviously, Estrada's real reason for evasiveness is the \n     fear that if some senators knew what his views are, they \n     would vote against him. However, this kind of high-minded \n     bluster is a powerful weapon in the ongoing judicial wars. \n     Over the past couple of decades, talk like this has \n     intimidated many a senator who aspires to a reputation for \n     thoughtfulness. And it does sound swell. Until you think \n     about it.\n       Potential judges should not reveal their views on legal \n     issues because a judge should\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\n     have an open mind? Hiding your views doesn't make them go \n     away. If the problem is judges having views on judicial \n     topics, rather than judges expressing those views, then \n     allowing people to become judges without revealing their \n     views is a solution that doesn't address the problem. And if \n     the problem is judges who fail to put their previous views \n     aside, rather than judges having such views to begin with, \n     then allowing judicial nominees to hide those views until \n     it's too late is still a solution that is logically unrelated \n     to the problem.\n       So Estrada's Rule of Silence does not solve the problem, \n     And the supposed problem--of ``prejudging''--makes no sense \n     either. To see why, consider--or reconsider--Justice Clarence \n     Thomas. In his 1991 confirmation hearings, Thomas testified \n     that he had no ``personal opinion'' about Roe v. Wade, \n     probably the most controversial Supreme Court decision of the \n     20th century. In 1992 Justice Thomas joined in a minority \n     opinion calling for Roe to be overturned. By 2000 he was \n     writing that the Roe decision was ``grievously wrong'' and \n     ``illegitimate'' and part of ``a particularly virulent strain \n     on constitutional exegesis'' and generally not something he \n     cared for the least little bit.\n       This does not prove that Thomas was lying under oath in \n     claiming that he hadn't prejudged Roe in 1991 (though no \n     reasonable person could doubt that). It does prove that \n     Thomas had prejudged Roe in 1992. But this is a point tht \n     Justice Thomas needn't bother to lie about, because no one \n     objects. It's perfectly okay for a sitting judge to have and \n     express views about an issue that comes before his or her \n     court. That is his job.\n       In fact it's inevitable that anyone who has been an \n     appellate judge for a while will have published opinions that \n     touch on many of the issues he or she must decide in the \n     future. There is not even an expectation of open-mindedness. \n     Although a willingness to reconsider your own assumptions is \n     regarded as admirable, no one is accused of prejudging a case \n     just for ruling the same way this year as last year. Quite \n     the opposite: Intellectual consistency is the hallmark of a \n     fine legal mind. And following precedent is a sign of \n     judicial professionalism.\n       Most legal rulings come from judges who have been on the \n     bench for a while. If that is not a problem, why is it a \n     problem if they have thought and reached conclusions on some \n     important legal issues before they join the bench? The answer \n     is that it is not a problem. It ought to be a problem if a \n     potential judge has not thought about important legal issues \n     and has no views on them. But instead, the problem is how to \n     keep a judgeship candidate's opinions hidden until he or she \n     is safely confirmed for a lifetime appointment, and the phony \n     issue of ``prejudging'' is a strategy for doing that.\n       Judgeship nominations bring out the hypocrite in \n     politicians of both parties, but the Republican hypocrisy \n     here is especially impressive. When Bill Clinton was \n     appointing judges, the senior Judiciary Committee Republican, \n     Sen. Orrin Hatch, called for ``more diligent and extensive . \n     . . questioning of nominees' jurisprudential views.'' Now \n     Hatch says democrats have no right to demand any such thing. \n     President Bush fired the American Bar Association as official \n     auditor of judicial nominations because the ABA gave some \n     Republican nominees a lousy grade. Now Hatch cites the ABA's \n     judgment as ``the gold standard'' because it unofficially \n     gave Estrada a high grade.\n       The seat Republicans want to give Estrada is open only \n     because Republicans successfully blocked a Clinton nominee. \n     Two Clinton nominations to the D.C. Court were blocked \n     because Republicans said the circuit had too many judges \n     already. Now Bush has sent nominations for both those seats. \n     Hatch and others accuse Democrats of being anti-Hispanic for \n     opposing Estrada. With 42 circuit court vacancies to fill, \n     Estrada is the only Hispanic Bush has nominated. Clinton \n     nominated 11, three of whom the Republicans blocked.\n       I could go on and on. Which is just what Senate Democrats \n     are doing.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I have previously mentioned before the \nJudiciary Committee and here before the Senate, I have significant \nconcerns about Mr. Estrada's nomination. Significant concerns have been \nraised and not answered. Many of us would like to have sufficient \nconfidence based on a record and a strong confidence about the type of \njudge he would be. Sadly that record is not there and the \nadministration continues to deny us access to Government files that \nmight be helpful to us.\n  While he has some experience arguing appeals in criminal cases, he \nappears to have little experience handling the types of civil cases \nthat make up the majority of the docket of the D.C. Circuit, a court on \nwhich Republicans blocked appointments during the last 4-year term of \nthe Clinton administration in order to shift the ideological balance of \nthe court.\n  His confirmation has been opposed by many including people and groups \nwho represent the Latino community. The opposition of so many Hispanic \norganizations and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus should be of \nconcern.\n  Mr. Estrada's selection for this court has generated tremendous \ncontroversy across the country and within the Hispanic community. For \nmore than 2 years I have been calling upon the President to be a uniter \nand not a divider. Here is another matter on which the White House has \nchosen divisive, partisanship and narrow ideology over what is best for \nthe Senate, the D.C. Circuit, the Hispanic community and the American \npeople. This has been yet another in a string of controversial \nnominations that has divided, not united, the American people and the \nSenate.\n  Senate Democrats demonstrated in the last Congress that we would bend \nover backwards to work with the Administration to fill judicial \nvacancies.\n  We proceeded with more than 100 nominations in 17 months, held \nhearings and confirmed nominees at a pace almost twice that of \nRepublicans with a Democratic President. Unlike President Clinton, \nhowever, this President has continued to insist on doing things his way \nand only his way and simply refuses to work with us.\n  Last May, at the behest of a number of Senators seeking a solid basis \non which to evaluate this nomination, I wrote to the nominee and to the \nAttorney General requesting access to his work while employed by the \nGovernment at the Department of Justice between 1992 and 1997. In that \ncapacity he worked for the government of which Congress is a part. \nSimilar papers have been provided to the Senate in connection with a \nnumber of previous nominations, including those of William Rehnquist, \nRobert H. Bork, William Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, and \nStephen Trott. Despite this precedent, over 300 days have passed \nwithout cooperation from the administration.\n  The administration has unfortunately, chosen to treat the request for \nrelevant information of a coequal branch like a litigation discovery \nrequest that it must resist at all costs. Their approach reminds me of \nhow the tobacco companies treated requests for information about what \nthey knew about the cancer causing properties of cigarettes for years \nand years. In connection with this nomination, the administration took \nthree weeks to study the files then dismissed the request out of hand \nand called it without precedent.\n  The administration claimed that no administration had ever provided \nsuch materials in connection with a nomination. As we have now \ndemonstrated over and over that precedent exists going back over the \nlast 20 years.\n  When presented with irrefutable evidence that these types of \nmaterials had been provided, the administration shifted its defense to \ntrying to distinguish those past nominations and even claimed that the \ndocuments previously produced by the Department of Justice to the \nSenate had, instead, been ``leaked'' to the Senate. They all but called \nSenator Schumer a liar in response to his January letter seeking to \nresolve the matter.\n  Then we provided documents from the Department of Justice that \nconclusively demonstrate that the materials had been furnished in \nresponse to Senate requests. This refutes the second round of \nmisrepresentations by the Department of Justice. The proof is in a \nletter from Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas Boyd to Chairman \nBiden in May 1988 which notes that:\n\n       [M]any of the documents provided to the Committee, `reflect \n     or disclose purely internal deliberations within the \n     Executive Branch, the work product of attorneys in connection \n     with government litigation or confidential legal advice \n     received from or provided to client agencies within the \n     Executive Branch.' We provided these privileged documents to \n     the Committee in order to respond fully to the Committee's \n     request and to expedite the confirmation process.\n\n  It is now beyond dispute that ``the work product of attorneys in \nconnection with government litigation or confidential legal advice'' \nhas provided to the Senate in connection with past nominations.\n  Rather than admit their errors and work with us to resolve this \nimpasse, the administration simply shifts ground while remaining \nrecalcitrant. The longstanding policy of the Justice Department, until \nnow, has been a practice of accommodation with the Senate in providing \naccess to materials requested in connection with nominations.\n  On February 11, the Democratic leader and I wrote the President \nurging cooperation. Instead, we received another\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\ndiatribe from the White House Counsel's office. It is as if this \nadministration thinks it has a blank slate and a blank check \nnotwithstanding tradition, history, precedent or the shared powers \nexplicitly provided by our Nation's Constitution. There is certainly a \nnexus between our request and the powers committed to the legislative \nbranch, yet the Department has failed to take any efforts to try to \nresolve this dispute. There is part of a pattern of hostility by this \nadministration to requests for information by Congress acting pursuant \nto powers granted to it by the Constitution, regarding nominees and \nother important matters.\n\n  Despite the stonewalling by the administration, the Judiciary \nCommittee proceeded with a hearing on the Estrada nomination toward the \nend of the last session. I had said in January that I intended to \nproceed with such a hearing. The administration took advantage of my \ngood faith declaration and my willingness to proceed on some of their \nmost controversial nominees, including Mr. Estrada. Of course, in \naddition to Mr. Estrada we also proceeded with hearing on Judge Dennis \nShedd, Professor Michael McConnell, Judge Charles Pickering, Judge D. \nBrooks Smith, Justice Priscilla Owen and many others. In spite of all \nour good faith efforts to make progress, the administration continues \nits hostile and partisan ways.\n  Confirmation of 100 judicial nominations in record time, proceeding \non nearly twice as many confirmations as Republicans had in the recent \npast, confirming new judges for the Fifth, Sixth and Tenth Circuits \nafter years of Republican delays, counted for naught with this \nadministration. Still, in spite of the administration's stonewalling, \nthe committee fulfilled my commitment by proceeding with a hearing last \nSeptember after waiting in vain for six months for the Administration \nto show some sign of accommodation to us.\n  Senator Schumer chaired that hearing for Mr. Estrada last September. \nI was hoping that the hearing might allay concerns that have been \nraised about this nomination, but I was left with more questions than \nanswers after all of the steps Mr. Estrada took to avoid answering \nquestions at that hearing. I was also left with little hope that he \nwould ever answer any of the concerns raised about entrusting him for \nthe rest of his life with the responsibility for deciding cases fairly \nand without favor toward any ideological agenda.\n  When President Clinton was nominating moderates to judicial \nvacancies, Republicans insisted on considering the judicial philosophy \nand ideology of the nominees. Many took a pledge not to vote for anyone \nthat might turn out to be an activist. In those years any concern among \nRepublicans could forestall a hearing or committee vote. Anonymous \nholds were the order of the day. The committee proceeded with few \nhearings on few nominees and voted on even fewer. In the entire 1996 \nlegislation session not a single circuit judge was approved by the \nRepublican-led Senate all year not one.\n  Overall, during the 6\\1/2\\ years of prior Republican control, the \nSenate averaged only seven circuit court confirmations a year. During \nthe recent 17 months in which Democrats led the Senate, by contrast we \nconfirmed 17 circuit court nominees for a President of another party \nwho nominated a string of highly controversial nominees. In fact, we \nheld hearings on 20 circuit court nominees. Two of the most \ncontroversial, on whom we proceeded at the request of Republican \nSenators, were voted down before the committee last year. This year Mr. \nEstrada's nomination was reported even though all Democrats on the \nCommittee voted against it.\n  Much like the administration's false claim that materials like those \nrequested with regard to the Estrada nomination had no precedent when, \nif fact, there is ample precedent, the administration and Senate \nRepublicans are now claiming that this Senate debate is without \nprecedent. That, too, is false. In fact, a number of judicial \nnominations have been subjected to extensive debate over the years \nsince Senator Thurmond filibustered the nomination of Justice Fortas to \nbe Chief Justice in 1968. More than a dozen nominations have resulted \nin almost one and one-half dozen cloture votes on judicial nominations.\n  Among those nominations ``filibustered'' by Republicans were Stephen \nG. Breyer's nomination to the First Circuit; Rosemary Barkett's \nnomination to the Eleventh Circuit; H. Lee Sarokin's nomination to the \nThird Circuit; Marsha Berzon's nomination to the Ninth Circuit; and \nRichard Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit. In addition, the \nDemocratic leadership of the Senate had to overcome Republican \nobjection and obtain a cloture to proceed with three of President \nBush's nominations in 2002, Richard Clifton to be a Ninth Circuit \njudge, Julia Smith Gibbons to be a Sixth Circuit judge, and Lavenski \nSmith to be a Eighth Circuit judge.\n  Of course, during the previous six and one-half years of Republican \ncontrol of the Senate, Republicans often chose less public methods to \nend nominations. Almost 80 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nwere not confirmed by the Congress during which they were first \nnominated and more than 50 were never accorded a Senate vote. Most \noften Republicans would just refuse to proceed to a hearing or a \ncommittee vote on a nomination without explanation. Anonymous holds \nbefore the committee ended almost a dozen Clinton judicial nominations \nwithout anyone having to take a vote. Anonymous holds on the Senate \nfloor delayed consideration of nominations for months and months \nwithout debate, explanation or accountability. Democratic opposition \nhas not taken that route. Instead, we ended the secrecy of the home \nState Senators' blue slips and did not allow anonymous holds to long \ndelay Senate consideration of nominations.\n  The Republican spin machine is repeatedly asserting that cloture \nvotes and the use of the filibuster are ``unprecedented'' with respect \nto judicial nominees. Such assertions are false and misleading. \nCloture, the Senate's procedure to end a filibuster, was sought on more \nnominations during the 103rd Congress, from 1993 to 1994, when \nPresident Clinton was President and Republicans used the filibuster \nwhen they were in the Senate minority than at any other time in our \nhistory. In that Congress, cloture was sought on 12 nominations--\njudicial and executive. For the remainder of President Clinton's \npresidency, Republicans controlled the Senate and defeated scores of \njudicial nominations by deliberate inaction or anonymous holds in \ncommittee and on the floor. By using other extreme delaying tactics, \nthey did not need to use filibusters, they defeated nominations without \npublic explanation through other tactics available to them in the \nSenate majority.\n  Individuals from all parties have sought cloture and used the \nfilibuster in response to judicial and other nominees. In fact, the use \nof the filibuster and cloture has increased in recent years. \nCongressional Research Services reports that the filibuster and cloture \nare used much more regularly today than at any time in the Senate's \npast. Approximately two-thirds of all identifiable Senate filibusters \nhave occurred since 1970.\n  Cloture votes on judicial nominees are well-precedented in recent \nhistory. Both Democrats and Republicans have sought cloture in response \nto debate or objections to judicial nominees since the cloture rule was \nextended to nominations in 1949. I would note that cloture was not \nsought on any nomination until 1968, because, prior to then, concerns \nover nominees were resolved, or the nominee was defeated, behind closed \ndoors. From 1968 to 2000, there were 13 cloture attempts on judicial \nnominees. For the record, I should also note that last Congress, \ncloture was sought on four of President Bush's circuit court nominees. \nI further note that it was the Democratic leadership of the Senate that \nsought to invoke cloture and proceed. The objection that was overcome \nlast Congress was that of a Republican Senator who was concerned with \nthe White House's refusals to act on certain executive nominations.\n  Cloture votes have occurred on judicial nominees submitted by \nPresidents of both parties and on nominees to the U.S. District Courts, \nthe U.S. Courts of Appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court. Of these 13 \ncloture attempts on judicial nominees, in six of them, the Democrats \nwere in the majority and in seven the Republicans were in the majority. \nThe opposition has been based on objections to the judicial philosophy \nof\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nthe nominee, concerns about whether the nominee would treat all parties \nfairly and on procedural grounds.\n  I would like to take a moment to shed some light on filibusters and \nthe practices used to block nominees when the Republicans were last in \nthe majority. Some Republicans have been taking a quote of mine out of \ncontext from June 1998 about judicial nominations, replacing my actual \nwords with an ellipse, then distributing it widely and misusing it. \nHere is what Republicans keep quoting: ``I have stated over and over \nagain . . . [ellipse] that I would object and fight against any \nfilibuster on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported.'' \nWhat the Republican talking points omit with their ellipse is the \nessential context of that quote. My actual comment was made during \nfloor discussion about an anonymous Republican hold on yet another of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. Here was his actual comment:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that I \n     would refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I \n     would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt \n     the Senate should do its duty.\n\n  The context of my comment--the subject of that very debate--and my \nreference even within the quote itself were about anonymous holds used \nby Republicans to defeat President Clinton's judicial nominations--\nanonymous filibusters, in essence. This was another instance in which \nsometimes only one or a handful of Republican Senators prevented Senate \nvotes on President Clinton's judicial nominations.\n  The process of the anonymous holds with which Republicans prevented \naction on Clinton judicial nominees required not just a majority or a \nsuper-majority for the Senate to proceed to votes; Republicans were \ndefeating President Clinton's nominees by requiring unanimity. And they \nwere doing it anonymously, without accountability to the public. In the \ncase of the Estrada nomination, Senate Democrats are seeking the \ninformation that the Judiciary Committee began requesting nearly a year \nago, before proceeding to a vote.\n  It is clear from the language Republicans deliberately omit that what \nI was referring to the widespread Republican practice of blocking a \nnominee anonymously.\n  The debate from which my comment was taken was over the anonymous \nRepublican hold on a Hispanic nominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who was \nnominated by the first President Bush to a district court and who \nPresident Clinton nominated to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Immediately after making this comment, I placed in the record a \nnewspaper editorial criticizing these anonymous holds as ``Partisan \nNonsense.'' That editorial notes that, ``In blunt terms, Leahy has \ncriticized the Republicans who, behind the scenes and not for \nattribution, are seeking to scuttle Sotomayor's nomination.'' That \neditorial goes on to note:\n\n       ``Their reasons are stupid at best and cowardly at worst,'' \n     Leahy told a New York Times reporter. ``What they are saying \n     is that they have a brilliant judge who happens to be a woman \n     and Hispanic and they haven't the guts to stand up and argue \n     publicly against her on the floor. They want to hide in their \n     cloakrooms and do her in quiet.'''\n\n  This again makes clear that I was talking about--anonymous holds. \nJudge Sotomayor was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on March 5, \n1998, but anonymous Republican holds had prevented her nomination from \nbeing scheduled for a vote.\n  On June 18, after her nomination had been pending on the floor for \nmore than three months, I went to the floor to protest the anonymous \nhold against her. Republicans refused to bring her to a vote for four \nmore months. That is, Judge Sotomayor's nomination was pending on the \nfloor for seven months, seven times longer than Mr. Estrada's \nnomination, and no Republicans claimed that denying an immediate vote \nwas somehow unconstitutional or amending the Constitution, as they have \nclaimed in these recent days. Once Judge Sotomayor was finally allowed \na vote, 23 Republicans voted against her, yet none put any statement in \nthe record or made a statement accounting for their holds or votes.\n  The real double standard evident during the Estrada debate is that \nduring the prior years of Republican control, Republicans in practice \nrequired unanimous consent to allow a vote on a judicial nominee--not a \nmajority or even a super-majority. One or more Republicans could refuse \nto allow an up or down vote on a nominee, with no accountability to the \npublic. Thus, even if as many as 80 or 90 or even 99 Senators did not \nobject to a judicial nominee, the objection of any Republican was used \nto prevent an up or down vote. Republican complaints about Democratic \nobjections and insistence on following Senate rules ring hollow in \nlight of their own repeated practices with President Clinton nominees. \nThey often required the consent of 100 Senators, and certainly all of \nthe Republicans, to bring a judicial nominee to a vote.\n\n  To hold a nominee anonymously, without any accountability, is what I \nobjected to in my full statement and full comment and in the full \ncontext of my statement during that debate. In contrast, the extended \ndebate on the Estrada nomination is occurring in the light of day. \nRepublicans and the White House can bring this matter to resolution by \nproviding the documents requested and by providing responsive answers \nto Senators' questions. This is not a filibuster through anonymous \nholds. This is a public debate that Republicans can end through \ncooperation.\n  The nomination of Judge Richard Paez starkly displays this Republican \ndouble standard. Judge Paez is a Mexican American who had served for \nyears on the bench in Los Angeles before being appointed to the Federal \ndistrict court by President Clinton in 1994. Judge Paez was nominated \nto the 9th Circuit in January 1996. He was one of only four circuit \ncourt nominees to get a hearing that year. His hearing was in July but \nhe was not allowed to be reported to the floor that year. No circuit \ncourt nominees were given floor votes that year by the Republicans. \nOnly 17 judges were confirmed that session, none of them circuit \njudges. This was the lowest number of confirmations during an election \nyear in modern history. Judge Paez was then renominated in January \n1997, after President Clinton's reelection.\n  Chairman Hatch required a second hearing on the Paez nomination in \n1998, 25 months after his initial nomination. Judge Paez was reported \nto the floor again in March 1998, but Republicans did not schedule him \nfor a vote in April, May, June, July, August, September, or October \nthat year. So in contrast to the Estrada nomination, by the end of that \nyear, Judge Paez's nomination had waited on the floor for more than 8 \nmonths. That is eight times longer than the Estrada nomination has been \npending on the floor and Judge Paez still did not get a vote, due to \nanonymous, unaccountable Republican holds. His nomination was returned \nto the President without action at the end of that Congress. By then \nhis nomination had been pending for almost three years.\n  Judge Paez was renominated again in January 1999. Chairman Hatch \nrefused to place him on the committee's agenda for a vote until July \n1999--another 6 months of delay, after his nomination had then been \npending for more than 1000 days. Republicans continued anonymously to \nblock a vote on the Paez nomination and refused to schedule him for a \nvote in July, August or September. By that time his nomination had been \nbefore the Senate for more than 1,300 days.\n  On September 21, 1999, Democratic Senators, having spent months and \nthen years pleading for a vote on the Paez nomination, made a motion to \nproceed to his nomination. All Republicans voted against bringing his \nnomination up for a vote, including Chairman Hatch.\n  Finally, in March 2000, after his nomination had been pending for \nmore than 1,500 days, Republicans failed in their effort to stop \ncloture from being invoked. The next day, Judge Paez was confirmed, and \n39 Republicans voted for confirmation--two shy of the number necessary \nto prevent cloture or to filibuster the nomination. If they had two \nmore votes, I wonder whether they would have ever allowed Judge Paez's \nnomination to come to a vote.\n  Mr. Estrada's nomination has been pending on the floor for less than \none month. Judge Paez's nomination was pending on the floor for more \nthan 20\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\nmonths before Republicans allowed him a vote. The result was that Judge \nPaez's nomination waited on the floor for a vote for almost two years, \nand his nomination was before the Senate for more than four years, \nbefore he was given an up or down vote on confirmation. Mr. Estrada's \nnomination has been on the floor for less than one month--not 20 \nmonths--and Senate Democrats have raised serious and legitimate \nconcerns about the Senate proceeding to a final vote, concerning the \nincompleteness of the record, the lack of responsive answers to basic \nquestions and the refusal to turn over memos equivalent to those \nprovided in other nominations.\n  It was no secret that the Republicans delayed the nominations of \nJudge Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit for years, culminating in filibusters in 2000, \njust three years ago. After the Republican-controlled Senate repeatedly \ndelayed action on their nominations--over four years for Judge Paez and \nover two years for Judge Berzon--Republicans engaged in a filibuster \nand cited the filibusters of Justice Fortas, Justice Rehnquist and \nothers as precedents. At that time, Republicans argued that they were \nnot setting new precedent.\n  As Senator Robert Smith stated during the debate on these two \nnominees:\n\n       [I]t is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominees, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez. \n     The issue is, why are we here? What is the role of the Senate \n     in judicial nominations? The Constitution gave the Senate the \n     advise-and-consent role. We are supposed to advise the \n     President and consent if we think the judge should be put on \n     the court. . . .\n       I was criticized by some for filibustering, that `we are on \n     a dangerous precedent' of filibustering judges. . . .\n       Filibuster in the Senate has a purpose. It is not simply to \n     delay for the sake of delay. It is to get information. It is \n     to take the time to debate and to find out about what a \n     judge's thoughts are and how he or she might act once they \n     are placed on the court.\n\n  So, those who came before the Senate just prior to our recent recess \nand said that no Republican ever filibustered a Clinton judicial \nnominee were wrong, dead wrong. Senator Smith was characteristically \nforthright about what he was doing.\n  Senator Smith went on to explain:\n\n       As far as the issue of going down a dangerous path and a \n     dangerous precedent, that we somehow have never gone before, \nas I pointed out yesterday and I reiterate this morning, since 1968, 13 \njudges have been filibustered by both political parties appointed by \nPresidents of both political parties, starting in 1968 with Abe Fortas \nand coming all the way forth to these two judges today.\n\n       It is not a new path to argue and to discuss information \n     about these judges. In fact, Mr. President . . . [w]hen \n     William Rehnquist was nominated to the Court, he was \n     filibustered twice.\n       Then, after he was on the Court, he was filibustered again \n     when asked to become the chief Justice. In that filibuster, \n     it is interesting to note, things that happened prior to him \n     sitting on the Court were regurgitated and discussed. So I do \n     not want to hear that I am going down some trail the Senate \n     has gone down before by talking about these judges and \n     delaying. It is simply not true.\n\n  This straight-forward Republican from New Hampshire proclaimed:\n\n       Don't pontificate on the floor and tell me that somehow I \n     am violating the Constitution . . . by blocking a judge or \n     filibustering a judge that I don't think deserves to be on \n     the court. That is my responsibility. That is my advise-and-\n     consent role, and I intend to exercise it.\n\n  Thus, the Republicans' claim that Democrats are taking \n``unprecedented'' action, like the White House claim that our request \nfor Mr. Estrada's work while paid by taxpayers was ``unprecedented,'' \nis simply untrue. Republicans' desire to rewrite their own history is \nunderstandable but unavailing.\n  They cannot change the plain facts to fit their current argument and \npurposes. I note in passing how many Republicans now demanding a vote \non Mr. Estrada, opposed cloture on Judge Berzon and Judge Paez. I have \nalready noted how every Republican, many of whom are now insisting on a \nvote on the Estrada nomination, opposed even proceeding to consider the \nPaez nomination.\n  I also recall a motion that truly was unprecedented, the motion of \nSenator Sessions to recommit the Paez nomination to the Judiciary \nCommittee after it had twice been voted out over a period of four \nyears. In fact, Senator Sessions made a motion to indefinitely postpone \nthe nomination of Judge Paez, and 31 Republicans voted in support of \nthat motion, including most of the people on the other side of the \naisle who have come to the floor to claim that the Constitution \nrequires an immediate up or down vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination. \nAfter cloture was invoked, Senator Sessions made a motion to \nindefinitely postpone a vote on Judge Paez's nomination. The motion to \nindefinitely postpone failed by a vote of 31 to 67. After this motion \nfailed on March 9, 2000 the day Paez was ultimately confirmed--Senator \nHatch spoke about the unprecedented nature of that motion and admitted \nthat there had been a filibuster on Paez's nomination. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I have to say, I have served a number of years in the \n     Senate, and I have never seen a ``motion to postpone \n     indefinitely'' that was brought to delay the consideration of \n     a judicial nomination post-cloture.\n       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on a nomination. A parliamentary \n     ruling to this effect means that, after today, our cloture \n     rule is further weakened.\n\n  While some Republicans would prefer to ignore that filibuster of this \nNinth Circuit nominee in their quest to move as quickly as possible on \nthe Estrada's nomination, but that would be to ignore the recent \nhistory of their conduct.\n  There were likewise two judicial nominees in 1994 whom the \nRepublicans filibustered. Judge H. Lee Sarokin, nominated by President \nClinton to the Third Circuit, was a qualified nominee who served as a \nFederal district judge for 15 years. He was opposed by conservative \nRepublicans who argued, among other things, that he was too liberal. \nSenator Thurmond led the filibuster against Judge Sarokin in calling \nhim a ``liberal judicial activist.'' That effort to defeat Judge \nSarokin failed.\n  In 1994, the Republicans also used delay tactics to block the \nnomination of Judge Rosemary Barkett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eleventh Circuit. Judge Barkett was criticized by those on the \nother side of the aisle as being a judicial activist. Senators Thurmond \nand Specter led the opposition to Barkett. After announcing the \nRepublican intention to filibuster the nomination, Democratic Majority \nLeader George Mitchell stepped in and filed a cloture motion.\n  I could describe other filibusters in detail, such as the Republican \nfilibuster of Justice Breyer to be on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFirst Circuit in 1980. And I could quote those on the other side of the \naisle, who have said time and time again how important it is to debate \na nominee and to scrutinize a nominee's record and views. In 1997, \nSenator Hatch said that he had ``no problem with those who want to \nreview these nominees with great specificity'' and, in fact, he \nsupported such efforts while chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nreviewing the nomination of a Democratic President.\n  So, when Republicans say that a filibuster or extended debate on \njudicial nominees is unprecedented, I would like to ask them about \ntheir filibusters and extended debates on Judge Berzon, Judge Paez, \nJudge Sarokin, Judge Barkett. And, I would like to ask them about all \nthe other judicial nominees and executive nominees that they defeated \nthrough deliberate inaction, anonymous holds, or other extreme delaying \ntactics.\n  Of course, this debate on the Estrada nomination is not, given the \ndefinition used by Republicans, a ``true filibuster.'' As the \nstatements of the Democratic Leader and the exchange that I had with \nSenator Bennett and Senator Reid on February 12 made clear and as \nshould be plain to all, we are seeking cooperation and information \nbefore proceeding to a vote. The current debate could have been \nshortened had the Administration at any time since last May shown any \ninterest in working with us. It has not. Despite the efforts we have \nmade, including the Democratic leader's letter on February 11 seeking \naccommodation and pointed the way out of this impasse, the \nAdministration has steadfastly refused all of our efforts to work \nthrough these difficulties. The administration is intent on forcing \nthis confrontation and division. That is too bad.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorials \nconcerning the Estrada nomination from\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nthe Portland Oregonian, the Omaha World, and the Los Angeles Times, and \nan article on the same topic by Chris Mooney that appeared in \nTomPaine.com, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 13, 2003]\n\n                        Bush's Full-Court Press\n\n       There are at least two explanations--one even more cynical \n     than the other--for President Bush's renomination last week \n     of Judge Charles W. Pickering, a man the Senate rightly \n     rejected last year for a seat on the federal appeals court.\n       Perhaps Bush really didn't mean it last month when he \n     denounced as ``offensive . . . and wrong'' Mississippi Sen. \n     Trent Lott's nostalgic musings about the segregated South. \n     The Republican Party has long tried to have it both ways on \n     race: ardently courting minority voters while winking at \n     party stalwarts who consistently fight policies to establish \n     fairness and opportunity for minorities. Even Bush has not \n     always been above such doublespeak, encouraging African \n     Americans to vote GOP and touting his Spanish-language \n     facility on the campaign trail as a come-on to Latino voters \n     even as he dropped in at Bob Jones University, which, until \n     three years ago, barred interracial couples from sharing a \n     pizza.\n       Bush's renomination of Pickering, a man whose law career is \n     unremarkable but for his longtime friendship with Lott and \n     his dogged defense of Mississippi's anti-miscegenation laws, \n     throws another steak to the far right and sand in the eyes of \n     most Americans.\n       There could be another explanation for Bush's decision, \n     just weeks after denouncing Lott, to again shove Pickering on \n     the American people. Perhaps the president doesn't really \n     care whether Pickering, whom he's indignantly defended as ``a \n     fine jurist . . . a man of quality and integrity,'' is \n     confirmed.\n       Maybe Bush calculates that Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-\n     Mass.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and others, justly \n     incensed that the judge is back before them, will embarrass a \n     Republican or two into joining them and defeat his nomination \n     a second time. The president may be figuring that if they can \n     call in enough chits on Pickering, the Democrats won't have \n     the votes to stop the many other men and women he hopes to \n     place in these powerful, lifetime seats on the federal bench.\n       None of those nominees can be tarred with Pickering's in-\n     your-face defense of segregation. But many, including Texas \n     Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, lawyers Miguel Estrada \n     and Jay S. Bybee, North Carolina Judge Terrence Boyle and Los \n     Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl, share a disdain \n     for workers' rights, civil liberties guarantees and abortion \n     rights. Their confirmations would be no less a disservice to \n     the American people than that of Pickering, who now has been \n     nominated two times too many.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n                            Answers, Please\n\n\nNominee Estrada refuses to disclose judicial views, philosophies to the \n                                 Senate\n\n       A filibuster is a drastic tactic. In regard to federal \n     judicial nominees, we would typically be against it. Now, \n     Senate Democrats have promised to use it to stall a \n     confirmation vote on judicial nominee Miguel Estrada. Yet \n     given the current tight-lipped atmosphere, we understand what \n     is pushing them in that direction.\n       Both sides agree that Estrada, nominated by President Bush \n     to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, has exceptional \n     legal credentials. However, he has refused to answer many \n     basic yet important questions, giving senators scarcely any \n     way to assess his judicial temperament. Democrats contend, \n     rightly or wrongly, that Bush seeks to pack the federal \n     courts with hard-right ``stealth'' activists, and Estrada \n     personifies that goal.\n       Estrada would not tell senators which judges he might uses \n     as role models if he were appointed to the bench, for \n     instance. That is a forthright question. The answer sheds \n     light on a nominee's thinking and potential judicial \n     approach. He also declined to say which Supreme Court \n     opinions he disagreed with, another fundamental query.\n       Most judicial candidates won't, and shouldn't, give their \n     personal views on a broad-brush basis--in effect judging \n     hypothetical cases in advance. But Estrada, who has been \n     mentioned as a potential Supreme Court justice, went beyond \n     that--refusing to discuss well-known prior cases because, he \n     said, he had no firsthand knowledge.\n       Judicial philosophy is important as senators considers an \n     appointment to the court that has been called the second most \n     important in the land after the Supreme Court. The D.C. \n     appeals court considers, among other issues, many challenges \n     to federal environmental regulations. And Estrada's views of, \n     for instance, federalism vs. states' prerogatives would be \n     crucial.\n       The president and Republican leaders have charged that \n     Democrats don't want to approve a Hispanic conservative, an \n     implicit accusation of racism. But Estrada isn't universally \n     popular with Hispanic groups, either. One, the Puerto Rican \n     Legal Defense and Education Fund, said he has ``made strong \n     statements that have been interpreted as hostile to criminal \n     defendants' rights, affirmative action and women's rights.''\n       In fairness, Democrats aren't above playing their own \n     political games. They change that Estrada ``lacks judicial \n     experience,'' as if that were a disqualifying flaw. Before \n     their appointments, most of the members of the D.C. appeals \n     court ``lacked judicial experience'' much as Estrada does.\n       We agree with a statement made by one senator several years \n     ago: ``I believe the Senate can and should do what it can to \n     ascertain the jurisprudential views a nominee will bring to \n     the bench in order to prevent the confirmation of those who \n     are likely to be judicial activists. . . . It will require \n     the Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its \n     questioning of nominees' jurisprudential views.''\n       That was Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, today an Estrada \n     booster, in regard to former President Bill Clinton's \n     nominees. The sentiment was valid then, and it's valid now.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          [From Tompaine.com]\n\n          Benching Congress--The Rising Power of the Judiciary\n\n                           (By Chris Mooney)\n\n       When it comes to President Bush's judicial appointees, Sen. \n     Joe Biden of Delaware has traditionally been one of the most \n     deferential Democrats; he opposed only three out of 102 \n     nominees during the 107th Congress. So Biden's recent speech \n     at a hearing on the appointment of Jeffrey Sutton, a staunch \n     states' rights defender named to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Sixth Circuit, came as something of a surprise. ``You \n     seem to have an incredibly restrictive view of the Congress' \n     prerogatives,'' Biden warned Sutton. Noting that the Supreme \n     Court reviews only a tiny fraction of cases from courts like \n     the Sixth Circuit, Biden announced he was rethinking how the \n     Senate should handle circuit court nominees. ``[Appellate \n     judges] have become the final arbiters in areas where I used \n     to be able to say, `I know the Court will review this,''' \n     Biden said, adding that his staff was preparing a list of \n     roughly 200 cases where courts of appeal have changed ``basic \n     law'' without any review by the Supreme Court.\n       As the showdown begins over Bush's conservative judicial \n     nominees--and Senate Democrats contemplate using their \n     filibuster powers to block Miguel Estrada from a place on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--\n     it is important to remember this exchange. Sutton's history \n     of states' rights advocacy, which included filing a brief on \n     the winning side when the Supreme Court overturned part of \n     the Violence Against Women Act (which Biden drafted), had \n     clearly left Biden feeling leery about giving him a lifetime \n     appointment to the bench. The senator got a taste of \n     conservative judicial activism first hand, and he didn't like \n     it one bit.\n       If more elected Democrats awaken to how their legislative \n     powers are being snatched away by the federal judiciary the \n     way Biden did, perhaps they too will resolve to fight harder \n     against Bush's more radical conservative nominees. The key \n     factor, after all, is the one Biden cited: The Supreme Court \n     hears only about 80 cases a year, from all the circuit courts \n     and state supreme courts combined. This compares with the \n     tens of thousands of cases considered by Federal appellate \n     courts. And because of the extreme rarity of Supreme Court \n     review, ``one could argue that the powerful actors in the \n     United States who have the fewest real checks on what they \n     do are federal appellate judges,'' as Georgetown law \n     professor David Vladeck puts it. One existing check is the \n     U.S. Senate's advice and consent role, yet from Michael \n     McConnell to D. Brooks Smith, Senate Democrats thus far \n     have allowed conservative after conservative to reach the \n     federal bench.\n       Appellate judges interpret a huge chunk of the law that we \n     live by. Even in simply applying Supreme Court precedent, \n     they have immense sway, and they have it for life. The \n     Supreme Court only ``knocks out the broad contours'' of the \n     law, notes American University's Herman Schwartz; courts of \n     appeal then fill in the blanks. For example, the conservative \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently ruled \n     that the Clean Water Act allows mining companies to dump huge \n     amounts of mountaintop rubble into rivers and streams, a \n     process known as creating ``valley fills.'' This ``major \n     victory for the mining industry,'' as The Washington Post put \n     it, is precisely the sort of case that the Supreme Court \n     never reviews. Due to the conservative tilt taken by the \n     federal bench over the past two decades, environmental groups \n     have become more or less resigned to these pro-business \n     rulings. So have labor, civil-rights groups, and other \n     liberal constituencies.\n       Appellate judges can't initiate legislation or make policy \n     decisions, of course, But that's about the only sense in \n     which they don't wield considerably more power than House \n     members or even some senators. Whereas legislators have to \n     sway a large group of colleagues in order to get a law \n     passed, appellate judges need only one ally on a three-judge \n     panel in order to rule the way they want. And most laws \n     passed by legislators, at least controversial ones, \n     inevitably end up being challenged in federal court and heard \n     on appeal. Given all this, plus the fact that seven of the \n     nine current Supreme Court justices were appellate judges \n     first, it's something of a wonder how little attention has \n     been paid to the ongoing\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\n     battle over the judiciary, especially compared with the \n     extensive press coverage leading up to--and following--last \n     year's elections. Instead all we get from the mainstream \n     media are one-shot stories that have much more to do with how \n     the nomination battles are waged than what's really at stake.\n       And appellate judges don't merely exert their power over \n     Congress by overturning laws. They also police the federal \n     regulatory state. Congress, after all, delegates a \n     significant part of its lawmaking mandate to regulatory \n     bodies like the Environmental Protection Agency. Indeed, \n     Congress regularly sets up entire new agencies, like the \n     Department of Homeland security, to implement its wishes. But \n     when these expert agencies try to carry out their \n     mandates, they frequently find their actions challenged in \n     federal court. Once again, appellate judges make the \n     difference when it comes to whether a regulation will be \n     allowed. They often second-guess laboriously prepared \n     administrative rules, but rarely have their actions \n     reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n       For precisely this reason, the appellate court most \n     responsible for ruling on federal agency decisions, the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is \n     also considered the second most powerful court in the nation. \n     Many Senate Democrats know this. That's why they're having \n     such a tough time weighing the pluses and minuses of \n     filibustering Estrada's nomination. The Wall Street Journal \n     editorial page, which rallies the right's troops on judicial \n     nominations, recently wrote that Democrats ``have no reason \n     to oppose Mr. Estrada other than the fact that he is a \n     conservative who also happens to be Hispanic.'' Well, what \n     about the fact that Estrada could be in a position to gut \n     laws Democrats pass?\n       Take a closer look at the sort of cases Estrada will be \n     deciding if he makes it to the D.C. Circuit. One well known \n     D.C. Circuit environmental case was 1994's Sweet Home Chapter \n     of Communities for a Great Oregon v. Babbitt, a case over \n     applications of the Endangered Species Act. In this case, a \n     conservative-leaning panel of the D.C. Circuit overturned a \n     Department of the Interior regulation protecting species \n     habitat, ruling that the Department couldn't consider \n     ``significant habitat modification that leads to an injury to \n     an endangered species'' as ``harm'' under the act. The ruling \n     stood for over a year before being overruled by the Supreme \n     Court. But then, most D.C. Circuit rulings are never reviewed \n     at all--Sweet Home v. Babbitt was exceptional in that \n     respect. In other cases, the D.C. Circuit has rolled back \n     regulations to protect wetlands, corporate average fuel \n     economy (CAFE) standards, and much more. And that's just in \n     the environmental arena.\n       The D.C. Circuit has recently regained a degree of \n     ideological balance. But that won't last if Bush's nominees \n     reach the court. And with a conservative D.C. Circuit \n     prepared to upend regulatory actions as it sees fit, \n     legislators would be foolhardy to assume that administrative \n     agencies will actually be able to implement the laws they \n     pass intact.\n       Of course, some will inevitably object to the power \n     comparison between appellate judges and members of Congress, \n     and perhaps even consider it demeaning to the judiciary. They \n     will point out that appellate judges have a duty to apply \n     Supreme Court precedent, and in many or most cases these \n     judges probably do just that. But even the majority of \n     judges, acting in good faith, have considerable wiggle room \n     under the ``broad contours'' laid out by the Supreme Court. \n     That's what Sen. Joe Biden seems to have figured out, anyway.\n       Moreover, it has become increasingly clear just how often \n     appellate judges are completely on their own--and how willing \n     they are to use their powers. In the past decade we have \n     witnessed an unprecedented push among conservative judges to \n     invalidate acts of Congress on the basis of a radical \n     reinterpretation of the constitutional relationship between \n     the states and the federal government, sometimes called the \n     ``New Federalism'' (though it has its origins in the \n     philosophy of the original opponents of the U.S. \n     Constitution, the anti-Federalists). This push has had plenty \n     of legal cover, of course, but in effect it has been a clear \n     attempt to wrest power away from Congress. Why shouldn't \n     Senators try to wrest some of that power back?\n       They can start with Miguel Estrada.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Oregonian, Mar. 3, 2003]\n\n                          Judicial Power Trip\n\n       The partisan battle in the Senate over one of President \n     Bush's nominees to a federal judgeship escalated last week \n     with the addition of three more conservative nominees.\n       This is a high-stakes contest that encompasses more than a \n     handful of judicial appointments; it represents a naked grab \n     at power and an attempt to stack the federal courts in favor \n     of an ultra-conservative ideology.\n       For nearly three weeks, Democrats have delayed a vote on \n     Miguel Estrada, Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, \n     District of Columbia Circuit. In Senate Judiciary Committee \n     hearings, Estrada simply refused to answer many of Democrats' \n     questions.\n       The battle has led to ugly name-calling, including the \n     charge that Democrats are treating Estrada differently \n     because he is Latino.\n       That's simply preposterous. Eight of the 10 Latino \n     appellate judges currently seated in the federal courts were \n     appointed during the Clinton administration.\n       Republicans should be more careful using the ethnic card. \n     They had no trouble holding up hearings on Latino candidates \n     who were nominated by President Clinton. They used every \n     tactic available to stall scads of Clinton nominees, \n     including anonymous holds on Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the \n     Second Circuit and a four-year delay on Judge Richard Paez to \n     the Ninth Circuit.\n       Some critics have charged the Democrats are trying to \n     extract payback. Of course, they may have overlooked that the \n     Senate has confirmed 100 of Bush's judicial nominees.\n       Raising the stakes late last week, Senator Orrin Hatch, R-\n     Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee forced committee \n     approval of three more of Bush's controversial nominees. \n     While the tactic seems designed to get some of the \n     president's conservative nominees approved, this isn't a \n     fight about one nominee or three or four.\n       The fight shows a majority trying to install one point of \n     view and a president who has shown himself to be more \n     doctrinaire than he gave any inkling of before his narrow \n     success in the 2000 election.\n       In the case of Estrada, it is hard to know what he believes \n     or how he would behave as a judge. He is a graduate of \n     Harvard Law School and was a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy, but little is known about his views. \n     He has an obligation to explain himself.\n       Ironically, Hatch was outspoken about the need for inquiry \n     into nominees' view when Clinton was in office.\n       In the best of all possible worlds, it is better to have a \n     judiciary of nonpartisan independent thinkers. But the \n     process of nominating and confirming court appointments has \n     always been far from ideal.\n       Democrats mustn't cave on this. The fairness and \n     credibility of the nation's courts depend on senators finding \n     a reasonable compromise. Moderates within the president's \n     party should also reconsider their lockstep loyalty.\n       The balance of power between the executive and the \n     legislative branches is being tested. As Senator Ted Kennedy \n     pointed out last work, the Founding Fathers ``did not intend \n     for the Senate to be a rubber stamp.''\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Under the previous order, the hour of 12 noon \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty Document \n     107-8, Treaty Between the United States of America and the \n     Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, the treaty we consider today, known \nofficially as the treaty between the United States of America and the \nRussian Federation on strategic reductions, is truly remarkable in many \nrespects.\n  The treaty is, of course, remarkable because it encompasses the most \ndramatic reductions in strategic nuclear weapons ever envisioned \nbetween two nuclear powers. It is also worth noting that not since 1954 \nhave the two parties held such a low number of strategic nuclear \nweapons as that which will be enforced by the agreed numerical limits \nof this treaty.\n  Many have observed the extraordinary ease by which this treaty was \nnegotiated and compare its three short pages--indeed, it is just three \nshort pages--to the many thousands of pages of documents negotiated \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war.\n  This last point is, for me, the most significant of all, for as \nimportant as the substance of this treaty is, it is the form--the trust \nbetween the United States and Russia--that most shines through.\n  Perhaps this treaty should be known by the epitaph: ``Cold War \nRIP,'' for it is not unreasonable to hope that this treaty represents \nand indeed reflects the close of a long era of hostility between these \ntwo nations.\n\n  In the past few weeks, I and many of my colleagues have had the \nopportunity to meet with a variety of Russian Government officials who \nhave become regular and welcome visitors in\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\nWashington, DC. I am struck with the degree to which these meetings are \nabout routine matters. We do not agree on everything, but what is most \nremarkable to me is we do not disagree on everything.\n  The United States and Russia are entering a new era of relations. Our \ntwo nations confront many of the same challenges in today's world, and \nwe have found common cause in responding to the immediate threat of \ninternational terrorism. Intelligence sharing and joint action between \nour two governments has made both of our countries much safer. We seek \nbroader cooperation between our institutions of government, and to that \nend, I am hopeful the Senate will be able to enter into a deep and \nlongstanding relationship with the upper House of the Russian \nlegislature, the Federation Council. This indeed will build on the \nexcellent work that was initiated and done by my distinguished \ncolleague in the Senate, Senator Lott from Mississippi.\n  Finally, we seek to advance the growing economic relationship between \nour two countries. Toward that end, I will strongly support legislation \nto permanently remove the Russian Federation from the Jackson-Vanik \nagreement.\n  I thank Senators Lugar and Biden for their fine efforts to bring this \ntreaty to the Senate floor in a timely manner. When this treaty was \nsubmitted to the Senate, the administration set the not unreasonable \nexpectation that the resolution of ratification not exceed the treaty \nin length. The committee has indeed met that goal in providing the \nSenate with a well-crafted resolution of ratification that nonetheless \naddresses several key elements of Senate prerogative.\n  I congratulate Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden for their fine work.\n  Finally, I trust that all Senators have indeed had time to review the \ncommittee report on the treaty. It is my hope those who wish to discuss \nit will do the managers the courtesy of coming forth to speak. Although \namendments are in order, I think it would be a worthy tribute to the \nwork of the Foreign Relations Committee to support this resolution in \nits current form. I look forward to its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his thoughtful commendation of the work of our committee. I \nappreciate especially the strong endorsement he has given to the treaty \nand to the procedures that have brought us to this day.\n  On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I am honored to \nbring the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, better known as the \nMoscow Treaty, to the floor for Senate consideration and ratification. \nThe treaty was signed on May 24, 2002, and was transmitted by President \nBush to the Senate on June 20, 2002. It reduces operational deployed \nstrategic nuclear warheads to a level of between 1,700 and 2,200 by \nDecember 31, 2012.\n  This is truly a tremendous accomplishment and deserves the full \nsupport of the Senate and the Russian Duma. I believe this treaty is an \nimportant step toward a safer world.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee held four hearings and numerous \nbriefings on the treaty, starting in July of last year, under the \nchairmanship of Senator Joe Biden. I thank Senator Biden and his staff \nfor the timely consideration the treaty received and for the many \nopportunities provided to members of the committee to hear testimony \nand to engage in conversation with experts from the administration and \nfrom the private sector.\n  Moreover, during the last 2 months, Senator Biden has been an \nindispensable partner in constructing this resolution of ratification. \nIts provisions reflect our mutual efforts to construct a bipartisan \nresolution that could be broadly supported by the Senate.\n  The resolution, in fact, was approved unanimously by the Foreign \nRelations Committee. We are hopeful of a very strong vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  During the course of the committee's consideration of the Moscow \nTreaty, we received testimony from Secretary of State Colin Powell, \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Richard Myers. Each expressed a strong desire for an \noverwhelming vote of approval. In addition to administration witnesses, \nwe heard from the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \nKen Adelman; from the former commander in chief of U.S. Strategic \nCommand, GEN Gene Habiger; and our former colleague, Sam Nunn; as well \nas numerous representatives of think tanks and interest groups.\n  In addition to efforts undertaken in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenators Levin and Warner and the Committee on Armed Services conducted \ntwo hearings examining the military implications of the treaty and \nshared analysis of their findings with us. These letters have been made \na part of the record and our committee report.\n  Furthermore, the Intelligence Committee conducted a thorough review \nof the treaty's verification procedures through numerous members only \nand staff briefings. The Committee on Foreign Relations appreciates the \nexpertise of our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and what they \nhave lent to this process.\n  President Bush and President Putin have assigned a high priority to \nthe timely ratification of the Moscow Treaty. Both point to the treaty \nas evidence that the U.S.-Russian relationship has turned the corner. \nAreas of disagreement clearly remain, but we are attempting to develop \na partnership in the war against terrorism, and both Russians and \nAmericans believe that political and economic cooperation can increase \ndramatically in the coming decade.\n  On May 1, 2001, in a speech at the National Defense University, \nPresident Bush called for a new strategic framework to transform our \nrelationship with Russia ``from one based on a nuclear balance of \nterror to one based on common responsibilities and common interests.''\n  Less than 8 months later, President Bush announced his intention to \nreduce our nuclear levels unilaterally and invited President Putin to \nimplement similar reductions. This was the beginning of a process that \nled to a treaty signing during the summit in Moscow last year.\n  The Moscow Treaty is unlike arms control agreements we have \nconsidered in the past. I remember vividly, as do many of our \ncolleagues, visiting the START I and START II treaty negotiations. The \nUnited States and the Soviet Union faced off against each other, \nagainst conference tables. They met for years. These negotiations \nproduced extensive treaties and verification annexes that described in \ndetail the requirements mandated by the treaties.\n  To be sure, the treaty before us today could have been more \nexpansive, rigid, and demanding. The negotiators could have followed \nthe cold war template for arms control negotiations and entered into a \nmultiyear discussion process. That procedure did not serve the best \ninterest of either side. Both sides, Americans and Russians, wanted to \nmove quickly to capitalize on the opportunity to sharply reduce \nstrategic weaponry.\n\n  The agreement benefits not only the cause of arms control, but also \nthe broader United States-Russia relationship. In my opinion, President \nBush was wise to conclude the treaty quickly in this form rather than \nenter into a more lengthy and uncertain negotiation process.\n  Russian strategic and nuclear forces are declining. Russian leaders \nhave indicated they would prefer warhead levels to be less than 2,200 \nby 2012. In fact, Moscow pushed for a limit of 1,500 nuclear warheads \nand settled for a range of 1,700 to 2,200. It would appear that Moscow \nis reluctant to accept the resource tradeoffs necessary to maintain a \nlarger force. President Putin inherited a force structure that already \nwas moving toward the deep reductions necessary for START II \nimplementation. Faced with continued resource constraints, he decided \nto limit further spending on strategic forces while seeking a new \ntreaty to limit the United States and Russian forces in a predictable \nmanner.\n  In the past, most critics of strategic arms control treaties objected \nto the constraints these treaties placed on U.S. forces. They often \nalleged the treaties would expose U.S. security to unnecessary risk. \nCritics of the Moscow Treaty, however, have made the opposite \ncomplaint. They have said the treaty's constraints do not go far \nenough. Various analysts have suggested the treaty should include a\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\nverification system requirement to dismantle warheads, a specific \nreduction schedule, and provisions dealing with tactical nuclear \nweapons.\n  I share some of the concerns expressed by these critics, but the \ntreaty is an important step forward because it maintains the momentum \nof an arms control process that has been successful.\n  The treaty provides a mutual framework for continuing the destruction \nof offensive nuclear weapons whose purpose was to target the United \nStates of America. It also underscores the importance of the United \nStates-Russia relationship at a time when we are depending on Russian \nsupport for the war on terrorism.\n  Nevertheless, important questions remain and will be discussed during \nthis debate. What happens to the nuclear warheads taken from dismantled \nRussian delivery systems? I have confidence in the United States \nstorage procedures and appreciate the flexibility the treaty permits in \nour strategic systems, but I am concerned with the parallel Russian \nprocess. We must work with Russia to make certain that these dangerous \nweapons do not fall into the wrong hands. However, there are readily \navailable means to address these deficiencies.\n  The primary vehicle for cooperation in reducing warheads to levels \nset by the Moscow Treaty and addressing the threat posed by warhead \nsecurity is the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction program. \nWithout Nunn-Lugar, it is unlikely that the benefits of the treaty will \nbe realized.\n  During consideration of the treaty, the committee heard testimony \nfrom Secretary Powell asserting that increased Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwould serve as a foundation for the cooperation necessary to meet \nRussian obligations under the treaty and as additional means of \nverifying that those obligations are met.\n  My concerns about treaty implementation are compounded by the impasse \nwe experienced over the Nunn-Lugar certification process last year. \nEach year, our President is required by law to certify that Russia is \n``committed to the goals of arms control.'' In 2002, the administration \nrequested a waiver to this condition, pointing out that unresolved \nconcerns in the chemical and biological arenas made this difficult. \nMeanwhile, existing Nunn-Lugar activities and projects were permitted \nto continue, but no new projects were initiated and no new contracts \nwere finalized.\n\n  President Bush requested a permanent annual waiver to the Nunn-Lugar \nlegislation so we could continue with important work. But some in \nCongress preferred just a 1-year waiver or no waiver at all. Without a \npermanent waiver, the President would be forced to suspend dismantling \nassistance each year pending congressional action to waive the \nrequirement. This could lead to delays of up to 6 months or more, just \nas we experienced last year.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, this is not a hypothetical situation. It \njust happened to us. For more than 6 months, submarines on the Kola \nPeninsula awaited destruction. Regiments of SS-18 missiles loaded with \n10 nuclear warheads apiece were left standing in Siberia, and almost 2 \nmillion rounds of chemical weapons in relatively transportable shells \nawaited elimination at Shchuch'ye. But the Nunn-Lugar program was \npowerless to address these threats because of congressional conditions \ndrafted over a decade ago.\n  American dismantlement experts in Russia were forced to wait and \nwatch as these dangerous weapons systems sat in their silos, docks, or \nwarehouses while the conference committee process between the two \nHouses of Congress dragged on through the summer.\n  Without the changing of congressional conditions on the legislation \nor the granting of a permanent Presidential waiver, the current \nsituation could reoccur in the years ahead. To say the least, this \nwould delay full implementation of the Moscow Treaty far beyond the \nenvisioned 10-year time period; namely, 2012.\n  Let me be clear. The Moscow Treaty alone is insufficient to meet our \nsecurity needs. The treaty is part of the answer, but without \ncooperative threat reduction, dismantlement, and warhead security \nprojects, the agreement will not reach its potential in a timely \nmanner.\n  Critics of the Moscow Treaty suggest this lack of a new verification \nregime is a weakness that must be rectified. Some have gone so far as \nto suggest the treaty be shelved until verification is strengthened. \nBut this point of view sees the treaty through a cold war prism when \ncooperative threat reduction programs did not exist and both sides were \ntrying to maximize strategic nuclear force levels.\n  The Bush administration has been forthright in its recognition of the \nlack of a verification provision in the Moscow Treaty, including \nstatements in the President's letter of transmittal and the testimony \nof Secretary Powell before the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The administration's views on verification of the treaty are based \nupon three basic assumptions: First, the United States and Russia have \nmoved beyond cold war tensions, and the United States would have \nundertaken these reductions of nuclear warheads regardless of Russia's \nview--unilateral disarmament. Second, the national security interests \nof the United States are better served through the flexibility of the \nMoscow Treaty. And third, Russia is unlikely to have the means or the \nincentives to violate or withdraw from this agreement.\n  I believe the level of verification of the Moscow Treaty is \nsufficient. American verification experts will have the START I treaty \nverification procedures in place throughout at least 2009. But perhaps \nmore importantly, the Nunn-Lugar program has placed American \ndismantlement teams and equipment on the ground in Russia now. These \nteams work on a daily basis with their Russian counterparts to safely \ndismantle weapons systems. For example, at Surovatika, U.S.-provided \nequipment is routinely dismantling four ICBMs per month. It is hard to \nimagine a more complete means by which to verify the dismantlement of \nweapons than the systematic work occurring under cooperative threat \nreduction at Surovatika.\n\n  Senator Biden and I met with President Bush last June to discuss \nSenate consideration of the treaty, just after the President returned \nfrom his visit at the Moscow Summit. We committed to moving the treaty \nforward in a responsible, bi-partisan, and expeditious manner. The \nresolution before us today is a product of close cooperation and \nconsultation. I am pleased to report that it enjoys the strong support \nof the administration.\n  The resolution of ratification contains two conditions and six \ndeclarations. I would like to describe each of these provisions for the \nSenate.\n  The first condition requires the President to submit to the Foreign \nRelations and Armed Services Committees an annual report on the amount \nof Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction assistance that Russia will \nneed to meet its obligations under the Treaty. As I mentioned earlier, \nwithout U.S. assistance, Russia cannot meet the timetable of its \nobligations under this treaty. Without the Nunn-Lugar program, it is \nlikely the benefits of this treaty will be postponed or never realized.\n  The second condition requires the President to report to the Foreign \nRelations and Armed Services Committees on important items related to \nthe treaty, including: 1, Strategic force levels; 2, planned offensive \nreductions; 3, treaty implementation plans; 4, efforts to improve \nverification and transparency; 5, status of START I treaty verification \nextension; 6, information regarding the ability of either side to fully \nimplement the treaty; and 7, any efforts proposed to improve the \neffectiveness of the treaty.\n  The report contained in this condition must be submitted within 60 \ndays of the exchange of instruments of ratification of the Treaty and \nby April 15 of each following year. The extensive nature of this report \nprotects our critical Senate role in oversight of implementation and \nensures that this body will remain an integral part of the process \nthroughout the treaty's life.\n  The first declaration has been in each resolution of ratification for \narms control treaties since the INF Treaty's resolution of ratification \nin 1988. It is known to colleagues here as the Byrd-Biden Condition. \nThe condition articulates the Constitutional principles on which the \ncommon understanding of the terms of a treaty will be based.\n  The second declaration encourages the President to continue efforts \nto\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\neliminate the threats posed by strategic offensive nuclear weapons to \nthe lowest level possible while not jeopardizing our country's national \nsecurity or alliance obligations. Secretary Powell stated in his \ntestimony before the Foreign Relations Committee that ``the Moscow \nTreaty represents significant progress in meeting the obligations set \nforth in Article VI of the Nonproliferation Treaty.'' This treaty takes \nanother step in meeting the U.S. and Russian commitments under the \nNonproliferation Treaty.\n  The treaty establishes a Bilateral Implementation Commission, as a \ndiplomatic consultative forum to discuss issues related to \nimplementation of the Treaty. The resolution's third declaration calls \non the Executive Branch to provide briefings before and after meetings \nof the commission concerning: 1, issues raised during meetings; 2, any \nissues the United States is pursuing through other channels; and 3, \nPresidential determinations with regard to these issues. This provision \nhas been included to ensure that we remain fully aware of the \nactivities of the Bilateral Implementation Commission.\n  During the hearings on the treaty, Secretary Powell and Secretary \nRumsfeld testified that non-strategic nuclear weapons remain an \nimportant issue and expressed a strong interest in working closely with \nRussia to reduce associated threats. The resolution's fourth \ndeclaration is meant to underscore the threat posed by tactical nuclear \nweapons. It urges the President to work closely with Russia and to \nprovide assistance on the full accounting, safety, and security of the \nRussian tactical nuclear weapon stockpile.\n  In 1991, President George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev announced \nthe removal of their deployed nonstrategic nuclear weapons. In Helsinki \nin 1997, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to begin talks on these \nweapons, but negotiations have failed to materialize.\n  Secretary Powell has reported that the inclusion of tactical nuclear \nweapons was not possible in the Moscow Treaty. Thus far, Russia has \ndeclined to engage in discussions on the future of non-strategic \nsystems. This declaration is meant to communicate the Senate's concerns \nabout the threats associated with non-strategic weapons. It is our hope \nthat there will be further dialogue and, if possible, greater efforts \nto secure these systems.\n  The fifth declaration encourages the President to accelerate U.S. \nreductions where feasible and consistent with U.S. national security \nrequirements so that reductions may be achieved prior to December 31, \n2012.\n  The final declaration has been included in an attempt to address \nconcerns put forward by some Senators regarding the treaty's withdrawal \nclause in Article IV. This text follows up on Secretary Powell's \ncommitment to consult with the Senate should the President consider the \nutilization of the withdrawal provision.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee asked the Secretary: ``What role will \nthe Congress have in any decision to withdraw from this treaty?''; and \n``Will the administration agree to at least consult closely with this \ncommittee before making any such decision?'' The Secretary responded \nthat: ``While it is the President who withdraws from treaties, the \nadministration intends to discuss any need to withdraw from the treaty \nwith the Congress, to include the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nprior to announcing any such action.''\n  While I am sympathetic to arguments from Senators regarding the need \nto maintain Senate prerogatives, the process governing termination and \nwithdrawal is a point of Constitutional debate. Although the \nConstitution assigns a specific role for the Senate in the treaty \nratification process, it is silent on the is due of treaty termination. \nFurthermore, nothing in the Constitution restricts the President from \nterminating or withdrawing from a treaty on his own authority.\n  Presidents have consistently terminated advice and consent treaties \non their own authority since 1980. Twenty-three of the thirty treaties \nterminated during this period were bilateral; seven were multilateral. \nPrior to 1980, Senator Barry Goldwater challenged Presidents Carter's \ntermination of the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan. Senator \nGoldwater's challenge failed and the treaty was terminated. Since that \ntime, objections have been raised only with respect to Presidents \nBush's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.\n  The White House Legal Advisor has long argued that the President is \nthe principle spokesman of the nation in foreign affairs and \nrestrictions on the power have been strictly construed.\n  Given the absence of a textual basis conferring the termination power \non another branch or an established practice derogating from the \nPresident's termination power, it is difficult to envisage such a role \nfor the Senate.\n  Proponents of a Senatorial role in this process will often respond by \nsuggesting that the President cannot on his own authority terminate a \ntreaty because it is the ``law of the land.'' Again, the White House \nsuggests this is a fallacy. A terminated treaty no longer has effect in \nmuch the same way that a provision of a law or treaty found by the \ncourts to be unconstitutional no longer has effect. However, in neither \ncase is the law repealed.\n  Historically there is evidence of only one instance in which the \nSenate sought by a resolution of advice and consent to limit the \nPresident's constitutional power to terminate a treaty. The first \ncondition to the 1919 proposed resolution of advice and consent to \nratification of the Versailles Treaty would have provided: ``notice of \nwithdrawal by the United States may be given by a concurrent resolution \nof the Congress of the United States.'' Vice President Thomas Marshall, \naddressing the Senate before the vote, called the condition an \nunconstitutional limitation on the President's powers--a view with \nwhich a number of leading scholars of the day concurred. However, the \nresolution failed to receive the required two-thirds vote and the \nquestion has remained moot for the better part of a century.\n  Beyond the legal issues which underlie this debate, some have \nexpressed concern that Article IV differs from previous arms control \nagreements in that it only requires three months notice and permits \nwithdrawal based upon issues related to national sovereignty. Critics \npoint out that the START Treaty allows a Party to withdraw, after \ngiving 6 months' notice and only ``if it decides that extraordinary \nevents related to the subject of this Treaty have jeopardized its \nsupreme interests.''\n  I do not view the withdrawal provisions as a weakness in the treaty. \nInstead, I believe it is another manifestation of the improved U.S.-\nRussian relationship. It should also be pointed out that our bilateral \nrelationship provides us with some confidence that the time and reasons \nfor withdrawal would not necessarily relate to the agreement. As the \nSecretary of State told the Committee: ``The Moscow Treaty's \nformulation for withdrawal reflects the likelihood that a decision to \nwithdraw would be prompted by causes unrelated either to the Treaty or \nto our bilateral relationship. We believe this formulation more \nappropriately reflects our much-improved strategic relationship with \nRussia.''\n  Mr. President, in performing its constitutional responsibilities with \nrespect to treaties and international agreements, the Senate has to \nreach a judgment as to whether, on balance, U.S. acceptance of the \nobligations contained in the treaty serves the national interests of \nthe United States.\n  The Moscow Treaty is not without blemishes. The Senate should not be \nsurprised that the treaty is not perfect or that it does not cover \nevery desired area of bilateral arms control. But that is not the \npoint. The proper question is whether on balance, the Moscow Treaty \nserves the national security of our nation.\n  For some, no arms control treaty is good enough. Indeed, the very \nhigh stakes of the cold war and the fact that arms control cheating by \nthe Soviet Union represented a potential threat to the survival of the \nUnited States led to a legitimate focus on treaties with high \nstandards, especially for verification and the ability to detect even \nminor violations.\n  The cold war is over, and treaty requirements must suit U.S. national \ninterests as they exist today. The Moscow Treaty charts a course \ntowards greater security for both the United States and Russia. I urge \nmy colleagues to ratify this treaty and approve the resolution of \nratification without amendment.\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join our esteemed chairman, \nSenator Lugar, in presenting the Senate this resolution giving the \nSenate's advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty on Strategic \nOffensive Reductions, known in the vernacular as the Moscow Treaty. Let \nme state flatly at the outset, I urge my colleagues to support the \ntreaty.\n  On February 5, as Senator Lugar noted, the Senate Foreign Affairs \nCommittee approved this resolution unanimously. The committee did so, \nin my view, for two very good reasons.\n  First, the Moscow Treaty should be ratified and implemented. It is \ntrue that there is much that the Moscow Treaty does not do, which I \nwill discuss at some length. But virtually all of the witnesses at our \nhearing recommended the ratification of the treaty because its \nimplementation would be a step toward a more secure world. Reducing \neach nation's deployed strategic warheads from approximately 6,000 to \nbetween 1,700 and 2,200, in my view, will move us further away from the \ncold war era and may--I emphasize may--and I hope promote a United \nStates-Russian relationship based upon mutual cooperation.\n  Second, in my view, while the resolution does not include everything \nwe may want, it does address many of our concerns. It requires \nsignificant annual reporting by the executive branch on implementation \nof the treaty so that the Senate can oversee and support that \nimplementation. These are important gains from an administration that \nfirst opposed any treaty at all and then pressed for a clean resolution \nof ratification. The administration has agreed to support and implement \nthis resolution before the Senate. I think the country will benefit \nfrom that.\n  But there is much the Moscow Treaty does not do. So in the spirit of \nnot engaging in false advertisement, I think we should speak about that \na little bit. It is very unusual, at least in my 30 years as a Senator \nworking on many arms control agreements from the Senate perspective, \nthat an arms control agreement by any standard be put forward the way \nin which this one has.\n  In our hearings, the Secretary of Defense proudly compared the three \npages of this treaty to the roughly 300 pages of the START treaty \nsigned by the first President Bush. But that is just the beginning. \nTraditional arms control agreements usually involve the negotiated \nlevel of arms to which the parties will be held. They usually require \nthe destruction of some weapons. Often they specify milestones that \nmust be achieved in reducing those arms and bar withdrawal from the \ntreaty unless there is a good reason to withdraw and the President \ngives or the other side gives 6 months notice.\n  For decades, there has been emphasis on verifying that each party is \ncomplying with its obligations. We remember the famous phrase uttered \nby former President Reagan: Trust but verify.\n  In addition, the United States worked to ban MIRV ICBMs in the START \nII treaty. I know the Presiding Officer knows, but for those who may be \nlistening, the MIRV'd ICBM is a single missile, a single rocket upon \nwhich multiple nuclear warheads sit and when the rocket goes off and \nthe head of the missile comes off, it contains more than one nuclear \nwarhead, and you can independently target each of those nuclear \nwarheads, in the vernacular.\n  So we have thought for years and years, these are the most \ndestabilizing weapons that existed, and we worked very hard, and the \nfirst President Bush worked very hard, to eliminate either side being \nable to possess these multiple warhead missiles with independently \ntargeted warheads. It was contained in the START II treaty.\n  We were hoping in START III to control tactical nuclear weapons. They \nare the weapons that are shorter range and are used at shorter \ndistances, referred to as tactical nuclear weapons. We had hoped to \nhave a de-alerting of weapons slated for later elimination.\n  That is, the purpose we initially started off with was: Look, if we \nare agreeing we are going to get rid of these weapons, while we are \ngoing through the process of destroying them or taking them out of the \nsilos or out of the bellies of submarines or out of the bellies of \nbombers, what we will do is we will de-alert them. That is, we will \npull the plug. They will sit there, but they will not be aimed at \nanybody. They will not be on alert.\n  So for the longest time our objective, for stability reasons and for \nsecurity reasons, was to get rid of multiple warheads, to make sure we \nmove to include tactical nuclear weapons which are destabilizing so we \nbegin to reduce them and, third, to say while we are getting ready to \ndestroy these weapons, or take them out of the inventory, we will de-\nalert them. That is, not keep them on a hair trigger.\n  None of these objectives was achieved, or for that matter attempted, \nin the Moscow Treaty we are about to ratify--I hope ratify.\n  For starters, the United States unilaterally set this treaty's arms \ncontrol levels before any negotiation. Indeed, the administration saw \nno particular reason for this treaty in the first place. Initially they \nsaid they would not do it as a treaty.\n  According to the Secretary of State:\n\n       We concluded before the Moscow Treaty was negotiated that \n     we could and would safely reduce to 1,700 to 2,200 \n     operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads, regardless \n     of what the Russians did.\n\n  Secretary Powell reports that President Bush then told President \nPutin:\n\n       This is where we are going. We are going there \n     unilaterally. Come with us or not, stay where you are or not.\n\n  In short, the Moscow Treaty does not codify an agreement. Rather, it \ncodifies two unilateral decisions to reduce strategic forces. That is \nnot a bad thing, but it is not such a significant thing.\n  Another way in which the Moscow Treaty differs from previous arms \ncontrol agreements is that it does not require the elimination of any \nmissiles, any bombers, any submarines, or any warheads. As a result, \neach party is free to stockpile its officially reduced weapons.\n  We used to fight with our conservative friends on this floor who said \nwe could not support such-and-such arms control treaty proffered from \nPresident Nixon through to President Ford and President Reagan and \nPresident Bush--we could not do it unless we were certain that the \nmissile was destroyed, the warhead was destroyed, the submarine was \ndestroyed. We used to hear what is going to happen is they are going to \ntake these missiles and they are going to hide them in barns and they \nare going to hide them in the woods and they are going to hide them in \ncamouflaged areas.\n  Let's be clear what this treaty does. It says you have to get down to \n1,700 to 2,200 of these within the next 10 years or so, but all you \nhave to do is take them out of commission. You don't have to destroy \nthem. You can stockpile them. You can put them in a warehouse. You can \npile them up in a barn for ready reload. You can take them back out. \nYou don't have to destroy anything. That is in fact what the United \nStates plans to do with many of its reduced weapons. They are reduced, \nnot destroyed.\n  Trident submarines that are taken off nuclear patrol will be \nconverted to other purposes--and could presumably be reconverted to \ncarry strategic nuclear weapons, although at some cost.\n  Bombers will also be converted; actually, their re-conversion to \nstrategic nuclear uses might be rather difficult.\n  According to recent press stories, the United States might use ICBMs \nto deliver conventional payloads. That would leave the missiles still \navailable for use with nuclear warheads instead.\n  And the administration says that about three-quarters of the \nreductions may be made simply by ``downloading''--that means by \nremoving bombs and warheads from bombers and missiles, while leaving \nthe delivery vehicles in service.\n  What happens to those ``downloaded'' warheads? Of the thousands of \nwarheads that will be ``reduced'' by the United States, many--perhaps \nalmost all--would be retained in some form of reserve status, available \nto be returned\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nto action in months, weeks, or even days.\n  The Secretary of State did not indicate that some warheads would be \ndismantled. But the administration has yet to earmark a single type of \nwarhead for dismantlement.\n  For years, now, the Air Force has been prepared to give up the W-62 \nwarheads on its Minuteman Three missiles.\n  They will be replaced by the W-87 warheads that are removed from the \nPeacekeeper missile, which is to be retired. But the Defense Department \nseems incapable of letting go of the old warheads.\n  I will move on. The Secretary of State did indicate, though, that \nsome warheads would be dismantled, but the administration is yet to \nearmark a single type of warhead that we are going to dismantle. My \nsupport for ratification of this treaty is based in part on the \nadministration's assurances for the record that ``some warheads are to \nbe removed and will be destroyed or dismantled.''\n  Since the statement was made, however, there has been no action by \nthe executive branch to turn this into a reality. I expect the \nadministration to live up to Secretary Powell's commitment. If it \nshould fail to do so, this would endanger the process by which the \nSenate gives advice and consent to the ratification of not only this \ntreaty but every treaty in the future.\n  An equal concern for me is the question of what the Russians will do \nwith its reduced weapons. If it follows the lead of the United States, \nit will try to retain as many missiles and bombers as possible, and it \nwill stockpile its downloaded nuclear weapons rather than dismantling \nthem and disposing of the excess fissile material.\n  Under this treaty, Russia can do whatever it wants with its so-called \nreduced weapons. But we have a stake in Russia's decision on this. That \nis because of the risk that Russia will not adequately protect the \nweapons and nuclear materials it has stockpiled.\n  It is one thing for us to decommission, reduce our nuclear weapon and \nstockpile it. We have exceedingly tight security on such material.\n  The Russians have incredibly, incredibly insecure facilities because \nthey lack the money to be able to maintain these secure facilities. I \nworry that if Russia does not destroy them, that they will find \nthemselves--and we will find ourselves--susceptible to the clandestine \nsale or the actual stealing of these materials, and they will fall into \nthe hands of people who do not have our interests at heart.\n  The only threat to our very existence is the accidental launch of \nRussian missiles, and that is why I still worry about the MIRV'd ICBMs. \nBut perhaps the worst other threat to America is that some Russian \nnuclear weapons, or material with which they make them, could be stolen \nor diverted to rogue states or terrorist groups. The more weapons \nRussia stockpiles, the greater the risk not all of them will be \nproperly safeguarded.\n  To combat that danger, our chairman cofounded the Nunn-Lugar program \nto assist the Soviet Union--and now its successor states--in meeting \ntheir arms control obligations.\n  Related programs in the Energy Department and the State Department \nhelp Russia to safeguard its sensitive materials, and to find civilian \ncareers for its thousands of weapons scientists.\n  These programs will have a major role to play in the years to come. \nWith Nunn-Lugar, we can enable Russia to destroy its old delivery \nvehicles rather than mothballing them. Russian officials have already \ndecided they want to move in that direction.\n  Let me put something in focus, by the way. The entire budget for \nRussia for this fiscal year is roughly $40 billion. The entire Russian \nmilitary budget is $9 billion.\n  My neighboring States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have budgets \nbigger than all of Russia. I suspect if you added up all their law \nenforcement and prison-related budgets, it probably exceeds the entire \ndefense budget of Russia.\n  Our defense budget, and I make no apologies for it, is between $350 \nand $400 billion. So I want us to keep this in focus. The ability of \nRussia to maintain and/or take the money to destroy this fissile \nmaterial and mothball nuclear capacity is very limited, increasing the \nneed for Nunn-Lugar, the threat reduction money, to be spent on \nAmerican scientists with American contractors to go to Russia to \ndestroy these weapons for them because they do not have the money to do \nit.\n  U.S. assistance can also help Russia to secure and dispose of its \nexcess fissile material. That is the stuff that makes nuclear \nexplosions. That is the stuff that is the product from which chain \nreactions, nuclear chain reactions start.\n  That is an urgent and continuing task, with or without this treaty.\n  I think the administration understands this. The Secretary of State \nhas laid it out:\n\n       U.S. assistance helps to improve the security of Russia's \n     nuclear weapons by improving their physical protection \n     (fencing, sensors, communications); accounting (improved \n     hardware and software); personnel reliability (better \n     screening); and guard force capabilities (more realistic \n     training).\n       These improvements are particularly important because \n     Russia faces a difficult threat environment--political \n     instability, terrorist threats, and insider threats resulting \n     from financial conditions in Russia.\n\n  Translated: The Russian Mafia; translated: Departments seeking money \nto keep their folks employed doing things that are not in the interest \nof Russia, and clearly not in the interest of the United States.\n  The Secretary of State also assured the Committee that:\n\n       . . . we intend to continue to work with Russia, under the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction, CTR program, when and to the \n     extent permitted by law, to make its warhead storage \n     facilities more secure.\n       Such U.S. assistance will also increase the security of the \n     Russian warheads made excess as provided in the Moscow \n     Treaty.\n\n  The Secretary of State continued:\n\n       If requested by the Russian Federation, and subject to the \n     laws related to CRT certification, the Administration would \n     be prepared to provide additional assistance for removing, \n     transporting, storing, and securing nuclear warheads, \n     disassembling warheads and storing fissile material, \n     dismantling surplus strategic missiles, and disposing of \n     associated launchers.\n\n  I am pleased that the administration accepts the need to use Nunn-\nLugar and related programs in implementing this treaty, and that the \n2004 budget request has a 9-percent increase for Nunn-Lugar.\n  That increase is probably spoken for, however, by the cost of \nbuilding--belatedly--a chemical weapons destruction facility at \nShchuch'ye. So I wonder, at least, whether enough fund are budgeted for \nNunn-Lugar; I hope they are but I don't think they are.\n  And I hope that the President will prevail upon his own party in the \nHouse to give him more than temporary authority to waive certification \nrequirements for these programs.\n  Nunn-Lugar efforts cannot achieve their maximum effectiveness if \nevery year or so the funds dry up for months at a time, while waiting \nfor Congress to permit another presidential waiver.\n  The laissez-faire nature of the Moscow Treaty is also evident in the \ntiming of its reduction requirement.\n  This is very unusual. Under Article I of the Treaty, the reductions \nmust occur ``by December 31, 2012.'' Until that date, there is no \nreduction requirement. Indeed, until that date, there is nothing \nbarring each party from increasing its force levels.\n  A party could even have more weapons than it has today, so long as it \ndoes not exceed START Treaty levels before that treaty expires in 2009. \nI don't expect that, of course, but there is nothing to prohibit it.\n  And what happens on December 31, 2012. The treaty expires.\n  If a party fails to achieve the reductions required by this treaty, \nthe other party will have little recourse. The treaty codifies legally \nbinding promises, but provides no way to make the Parties live up to \nthem.\n  This is a very unusual treaty.\n  Most curious of all, perhaps, is the withdrawal provision in Article \nIV of the treaty. You might think that, with no obligations until the \nvery last day of this treaty's existence, there would be little reason \never to withdraw from it. That is certainly what I think.\n  Just in case, however, the treaty has what is probably the most \nliberal withdrawal clause in any arms control treaty. A party can \nwithdraw with only 3 months' notice.\n  There is no need for withdrawal to be due to ``extraordinary events \nrelated to the subject matter of this treaty [that]\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\nhave jeopardized its supreme interests,'' as is required in the START \nTreaty signed by the first President Bush.\n  Indeed, there is no requirement in this treaty to state any reason \nfor withdrawal.\n  I hope the administration is correct in its view that we no longer \nneed verification. The Secretary of State said, ``in the context of \nthis new relationship, a treaty with a verification regime under the \nCold War paradigm was neither required nor appropriate.''\n  It may be that we need not care what Russia does. That might explain \nwhy the Moscow Treaty leaves it to each party to decide what weapons it \nis reducing and how it will do that, and sets no benchmarks for \nmeasuring progress between now and December 31, 2012.\n  To this day, the Russian Federation has yet to say how it defines the \nterm ``strategic nuclear warheads,'' or how its reductions will be \nmade.\n  We can only hope that his laissez-faire approach to arms control \nobligations will not lead to misunderstandings down the road. With no \nagreed definitions and no benchmarks, I respectfully suggest that there \nis lots of room for quarrels over whether a party will really be in \ncompliance by December 31, 2012.\n  Perhaps voluntary transparency by each party will assure the other \nthat arms reductions are proceeding properly.\n  I applaud the decision to establish a transparency committee under \nthe U.S.-Russia Consultative Group on Strategic Security.\n  But I am not reassured by the Secretary of State's statement that \n``specific additional transparency measures are not needed, and will \nnot be sought, at this time.''\n  It may be that continuing U.S. assistance to Russia under the Nunn-\nLugar program and other assistance programs will give us such \nvisibility into Russian forces that we will have no need of \nverification.\n  But if we are to rely on that window, then--as I noted earlier--\nPresident Bush ought to persuade House Republicans to let him waive the \ncertification requirements that periodically stall the funding of our \nprograms for months at a time because if there is no verification and \nno ability through the threat reduction program to look inside what \nRussia is doing, then we are operating in the blind.\n\n  When the President requested that authority to waive provisions \nallowing him to move forward with Nunn-Lugar, it was people in his own \nparty in the House who refused to make that authority permanent.\n  Previous Presidents gave special attention to the need to do away \nwith MIRVed ICBMs. The first President Bush achieved that in the START \nII Treaty.\n  But Russia refused to let that treaty enter into force unless we \ncontinued to adhere to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. When the \ncurrent President Bush pulled us out of the ABM Treaty, START II died.\n  Why worry about MIRVed ICBMs? A MIRVed missile has multiple warheads. \nIt's cheaper to put several warheads on a single missile than it is to \nbuild, house and launch several missiles.\n  But if I put 6 or 10 warheads on a missile, and you can take that \nmissile out with only 1 or 2 warheads by attacking first, then my \nmilitary planners are going to be nervous.\n  And that is precisely what can happen if my missile is an ICBM in a \nfixed silo. It may be powerful, but it is also a sitting duck.\n  So my military planners are going to say to me: We need to be able to \nfire our missiles before the attacking missiles land on them. The \nnuclear theologians call this: ``Use 'em or lose 'em.'' Put another \nway, if Russia has MIRV'd ICBMs sitting in silos, and we get to a \npoint--hopefully, that will never happen--in the next year, decade or \ntwo decades, and they know that one of our warheads can take out that \nmultiple warhead ICBM they have on the ground, their military planners \nare going to say: You better strike first with that missile because if \nyou don't, it will be taken out. And we are going to sit here and say: \nWe know that is what their military planners are going to do, so we \nbetter take that missile out first.\n  That is called destabilizing. That does not lend security or a sense \nof security. That is why the first President Bush, and every other \nPresident before him, said it was important, of any missile you get rid \nof, to do away with MIRVed warheads because they were destabilizing, \nthey were on a hair trigger.\n  This ``use 'em or lose 'em'' strategy is still in play. I will use \nradars and satellites to tell when somebody is attacking me. My command \nand control system will allow me to order a launch of my nuclear-tipped \nmissiles within 10 minutes because that is all the time I will have \nbetween the warning of a possible attack and when the warheads will \nstart falling on my MIRVed missiles.\n  Now, if I am the United States, that works. But if I am Russia, my \nmissile warning network is made of Swiss cheese. Some of my satellites \ndo not even work if I am Russia. I lost some radars when the Soviet \nUnion broke up. And worse yet, my rocket force troops are so poorly \npaid, so ill-housed, that sometimes they even go berserk and shoot each \nother. This is not a joke. They really do. So there are risks in basing \nour deterrent force on MIRVed ICBMs. And if Russia's nuclear-tipped \nmissiles are ever launched in error, we in the United States are the \nones most likely to suffer.\n  But the administration is confident that none of this will happen. \nThe Secretary of State told the Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       We cannot conceive of any credible scenario in which we \n     would threaten to launch our strategic forces at Russia. The \n     scenario . . . of Russia believing it faced a ``use it or \n     lose it'' situation with its force of MIRVed ICBMs is \n     therefore not a credible concern.\n\n  As a former press secretary of mine used to say--Evelyn Lieberman--\n``My lips to God's ears.'' Hopefully, that is true.\n  As a result, President Bush felt at liberty to tell President Putin:\n\n       [Y]ou can do whatever you think you have to do for your \n     security. You can MIRV your missiles, you can keep more, you \n     can go lower. Do what you think you need.\n\n  I sincerely hope the relationship between the United States and \nRussia has truly been transformed and that, as President Bush wrote in \nhis letter of transmittal, ``Russia is not an enemy, Russia is a \nfriend''--a friend, I might add, that is not with us right now on the \nSecurity Council and not with us with regard to Iraq, but that is a \nparenthetical note.\n  Most of all, I hope that Russia feels the same way. If President \nPutin fears a U.S. attack, then it won't matter what President Bush has \nas his intent.\n  If the Russian military fears a U.S. attack, their missiles may stay \non a ``hair trigger'' alert even if President Putin does not share \ntheir fears.\n  In short, the Moscow Treaty is a treaty that is long on flexibility \naccorded to each party and short on provisions intended to ensure \ncompliance. That emphasis on military flexibility is the hallmark of \nthis administration. It is an understandable response to dangerous \ntimes, but I think it is also a vision that ignores many of the \npolitical risks.\n  This administration has also promoted a nuclear weapons policy that \nspeaks of the use of new ``bunker-buster'' weapons against deeply \nburied targets, treating nuclear weapons as a handy tool just as any \nother weapon, and thus lowering the threshold for nuclear war.\n  This administration also speaks of possible new nuclear weapons \ntests. This administration speaks of the possible use of nuclear \nweapons against states that neither have such weapons nor are allied \nwith states that have them, contradicting previous American statements \nthat we made in order to maintain other countries' support for the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  This administration has indicated possible preemptive attacks, \nperhaps with nuclear weapons, on states that we fear are preparing to \ndo us harm--again, perhaps even if those states do not have nuclear \nweapons.\n  I do not doubt that if we went through this list, issue by issue, we \nwould find that the administration has understandable reasons for its \nactions. But in foreign affairs, understandable reasons are not enough. \nWe need a sensible strategy. We need statecraft that offers what Thomas \nJefferson called ``a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.''\n  In that respect, we risk alienating ourselves from those who could be \nof\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nhelp to us in many areas. The issue may be to keep an American on a \nUnited Nations commission or whether to support an American use of \nforce in Iraq. Chickens come home to roost.\n  The fact is, we cannot take these unilateral positions irrespective, \nin my view, of world public opinion and then not expect to pay for it \ndown the road somewhere. I would respectfully suggest, parenthetically, \nI think we are paying for some of that right now in the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  This fixation with military power extends to the Moscow Treaty as \nwell. How should we handle a treaty that calls for significant force \nreductions but also allows each party to keep its powder dry?\n  Retired Senator Sam Nunn, former chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, has a good term for the Moscow Treaty. He calls it, not \n``the Moscow Treaty,'' but the ``good-faith treaty.'' Senator Nunn \nadds:\n\n       It expresses--and relies upon--good faith in our common \n     interests and the common vision of our leaders.\n\n  I think it is a pretty good way to characterize this treaty.\n  But when he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Sam Nunn added a very important point about the treaty. He \nsaid:\n\n       If it is not followed with other substantive actions, it \n     will become irrelevant at best--counterproductive at worst.\n\n  Let me read that again. He said: ``If it is not followed with other \nsubstantive actions''--he means actions in terms of arms control and \nverification, and the like--``it will become irrelevant at best--\ncounterproductive at worst.'' I share his view.\n  I support the Moscow Treaty because, on balance, it enhances our \nnational interests. Put another way: To reject this treaty, in my view, \nwould harm our national interest and, as I said at the outset, the \nrelationship between the United States and Russia.\n  The arms reductions in it do not go far enough, in my view, but they \nare better than nothing. There is no verification provisions, but good \nfaith, information from START verification activities, and Nunn-Lugar \nmay be a good substitute for verification.\n  There is a risk that the Russians will rely upon MIRVed ICBMs that \nraise the threat of an accidental war, but there is also a chance that \nRussia will destroy those missiles as fast as they can pay for their \ndestruction.\n  The flexibility built into this treaty could undermine each party's \ncommitment to reductions and its confidence that the other side will \nachieve them, but the Bush-Putin relationship, which is now being \nsomewhat strained on North Korea and on Iraq, could lead to new \npatterns of cooperation that make further formal agreements \nunnecessary.\n\n  May all the good outcomes come to pass, but they require a leap of \nfaith. In the meantime, however, I worked with Chairman Lugar to draft \na resolution of ratification that keeps Senator Nunn's admonition in \nmind. We must build on this treaty in order to ensure its success.\n  The resolution before us strengthens congressional oversight of the \nMoscow Treaty implementation and highlights some of the areas on which \nthe administration should build on the treaty to secure a safer world \nfor ourselves and future generations. The resolution includes two \nconditions and six declarations. Let me briefly go through them.\n  Condition (1) requires an annual report to the Senate Foreign \nRelations and Armed Services Committees on how U.S. cooperative threat \nreduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia can best contribute \nto enabling Russia to implement its side of the bargain. Reports \nsubsequent to the initial report will be due on February 15 so that the \nSenate can take them into account as it considers the budget for \nprograms for which the administration is calling. This is vital because \nU.S. assistance can bring about the weapons dismantlement the Moscow \nTreaty fails to achieve.\n  Condition (2) requires an annual report to the Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services Committee on U.S. and Russian strategic force levels; \neach party's planned reductions for the current year; each party's \nplans for achieving the full reductions by December 31, 2012. Further, \nit requires reporting on any measure, including verification or \ntransparency measures, taken or proposed by a party to assure each \nparty that the other will achieve its reductions by December 31, 2012.\n  Condition (2) also requires information relevant to the treaty \nlearned through START verification, and the status of consideration of \nextending the START verification regime beyond December 2009 when the \nSTART treaty is scheduled to expire; anything calling into question \neither party's intention or ability to achieve the full Moscow Treaty \nreductions by December 31, 2012; and any action taken or proposed by \nthe parties to address such concerns. This report will provide a strong \nfoundation for Senate oversight of the treaty's implementation.\n  The first declaration in the treaty reaffirms the Biden-Byrd \ncondition on the authoritative nature of executive branch \nrepresentations to the Senate and its committees during the \nratification process insofar as they are directed to the meaning and \nlegal effect of the treaty.\n  In other words, it says the President--this President or a future \nDemocrat or Republican President--cannot reinterpret the treaty, cannot \ngive it a meaning different than was suggested to us as what it meant.\n  There is a second declaration. It encourages the President to \ncontinue strategic offensive reductions beyond those mandated by this \ntreaty to the lowest possible levels consistent with national security \nrequirements and alliance obligations of the United States. \nDeclarations, I might note, for the Presiding Officer, who knows this \nwell, are nonbinding. But this one makes clear that the Moscow Treaty \nshould not be the end of arms control.\n  President Bush also issued a joint declaration on May 24, 2002, with \nRussian President Putin that declared ``their intention to carry out \nstrategic offensive reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent \nwith our national security requirements and alliance obligations and \nreflecting the new nature of their strategic reductions.''\n\n  The joint declaration went on to call the Moscow Treaty a major step \nin this direction--not the final step, only a major one. The clear \nimplication is that further reductions may follow. This declaration \ngives the arms reduction process the Senate's blessing, just as we did \nwhen considering ratification of START and the START II treaties.\n  The third declaration states the Senate's expectation that the \nexecutive branch will offer to brief the Senate Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services Committees on issues raised in the bilateral \nimplementation commission, which is part of this treaty, on Moscow \nTreaty issues raised in other channels, and on any Presidential \ndetermination regarding such issues.\n  Given the lack of verification or transparency provisions in the \nMoscow Treaty, the bilateral implementation committee established by \narticle III of the treaty may play a major role in assuring that each \nparty knows what the other party is doing and retains confidence that \nthe reductions required by article I will be completed on time--a very \nimportant point, on time. Remember, there are no drop-dead dates here.\n  The fourth declaration urges the President to engage Russia with the \nobjective of, one, establishing cooperative measures regarding the \naccounting and security of nonstrategic--that is, or tactical--nuclear \nweapons, and two, providing U.S. and other international assistance to \nhelp Russia improve its accounting and security of these weapons. The \nfirst meeting of the U.S.-Russian Consultative Group on Strategic \nSecurity established a committee to examine these issues. The \nadministration witnesses listed this as a top priority. This \ndeclaration, in my view, adds the Senate's encouragement to pursue the \nissue of tactical nuclear weapons. It does not call for bilateral \nagreement on reductions of those weapons because several outside \nwitnesses said no Russian agreement to such reductions was likely.\n  The fifth declaration before us encourages the President to \naccelerate U.S. force reductions where feasible and consistent with \nU.S. national security and alliance obligations. The Treaty's intended \nreductions may be achieved prior to December 2012. To me, the wisdom of \nfaster reductions is clear. It will reassure the world of our \ncommitment to reduced nuclear forces to a reasonable level as speedily \nas we can. They will also ease any possible\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nRussian concerns about whether we will meet the one deadline in the \ntreaty. Department of Energy and Air Force officials warn that absent \nadditional resources, major bottlenecks would slow down an accelerated \nreduction effort.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report on the treaty cites specific \nconcerns in that regard. But those concerns relate to an effort to \ncomplete all reductions by the year 2007.\n  I believe in the years after 2007, when the transfer of Peacekeeper \nwarheads to the Minuteman III missile will have been completed, faster \nreductions will be much more feasible.\n  There is declaration 6. It urges the President to consult with the \nSenate prior to actions relevant to article IV, paragraph 2, which \nrelate to extending or superseding a treaty, or paragraph 3, which \nrelate to withdrawal from the treaty. This declaration builds on the \nstatement of the Secretary of State that ``the administration intends \nto discuss any need to withdraw from the treaty with the Congress, to \ninclude the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, prior to announcing any \nsuch action.''\n  The Secretary's statement could mean only that the administration \nwould discuss with the Senate the need to withdraw when the decision \nhas already been made. This declaration we have in the resolution goes \nfurther, by urging the President to consult with the Senate. One may \ndiscuss after the decision has been made, but one can only consult \nbefore a decision has been taken. The latter is what the Senate expects \nif this treaty is passed, and this expectation extends beyond the \nwithdrawal issue to cover actions relevant to extending or superseding \nthe treaty. It is vital that the executive branch consult with us when \nit is considering changes in a treaty. That way, Senators can raise any \nconcern before decisions are made that might jeopardize the chances of \nsecuring our advice and consent to ratification.\n\n  The resolution of ratification before us was recommended unanimously \nby the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I believe it will make a \nreal contribution to the success of this treaty, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  To be sure, the resolution does not address every issue we could \nraise. It clearly does not speak to every declaration that I think \nshould be included in this treaty, but neither is it the only venue in \nwhich to raise those issues. For example, consider what the Foreign \nRelations Committee's report of the treaty says about the proposal by \nGEN Eugene Habiger, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command:\n\n       Members of the committee . . . share General Habiger's view \n     that options for reducing alert status should be evaluated by \n     those with significant expertise on the specific weapons \n     systems in question. If the President does not order \n     preparation for such analyses, Congress could require the \n     analyses or establish a commission of weapons systems experts \n     to undertake this task. Such commissions have been created \n     before, some under the auspices of the National Academy of \n     Sciences, and have proven useful in considering issues of \n     such a technical nature.\n\n  Senator Lugar and I do not think this resolution of ratification is a \nproper vehicle through which to establish such a commission, but unless \nsomething has changed, which I know it has not, we will continue to \npursue this proposal in a venue other than this treaty.\n  The committee's report also addresses two other issues we were unable \nto incorporate in the resolution of ratification. On verification and \ntransparency, our report says:\n\n       The committee believes that the absence of verification \n     provisions in the Moscow Treaty makes confidence and \n     transparency a high priority issue. . . . The United States \n     should not only practice transparency, but also promote it, \n     in close coordination with the Russian Federation.\n\n  Our report goes on to say:\n\n       The committee urges the President to use implementation of \n     the Moscow Treaty as a means to foster . . . mutual \n     confidence in the national security field.\n\n  The report also calls attention to the Congressional Budget Office's \nestimate that further drawdowns in strategic delivery vehicles after \n2007 could save some $5 billion.\n  Our report adds:\n\n       The committee recommends that the President give particular \n     attention, as the Moscow Treaty implementation proceeds, to \n     the possibility that modest further reductions in strategic \n     delivery systems after 2007 could lead to significant cost \n     savings without endangering the national security.\n\n  The Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee can \npursue both of these issues as they oversee the implementation of the \ntreaty in the coming years, and I am committed to doing so, and I \nbelieve the chairman is as well.\n  Some of my colleagues are concerned about still other issues. Several \namendments may be proposed today. Some of them are amendments I would \nlike to support, but I will not support any additional amendments \nbecause I think it is fair to say, speaking for myself, but I think it \nreflects the view of the chairman--he may have already mentioned it--we \nbelieve that in order to get the cooperation we had to add the total of \neight declarations or conditions to this treaty, we would, in fact, \noppose other amendments, some positive, some, in my view, very \nnegative. So it will be my dubious distinction of possibly voting \nagainst some amendments that I think are useful because I think if that \nwere to happen and we started to load this up, we might very well lose \nthis treaty. I think it is very important.\n  It is a mild exaggeration to suggest, but not very far off, that my \nview is that the value of the treaty is exceeded only by the danger of \nfailing to ratify this treaty, and there is a danger, in my view, of \nfailing to ratify this treaty. This is not a treaty, were I in charge \nof negotiation--as my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, this is not the \nwhole of it--this is not all of what I would like to have seen in this \ntreaty. I sincerely hope this further changes the atmosphere in the \npositive direction it has been changing, that this administration and \nthe Russian administration will conclude we should be dealing with MIRV \nmissiles, we should be dealing with tactical nuclear weapons, and we \nshould be dealing with other genuine mutual concerns that we have. I am \nconfident if we reject this treaty, if we bog it down and it does not \nget the necessary supermajority required, then it will make those \npossibilities impossible in the near term.\n  So in each case, as these amendments are put forward, if they are, I \nwill be guided also by the need to maintain administration support and \nSenate consensus regarding the resolution of ratification as a whole.\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues on my side of the aisle, I do not \npresume to speak for them all. Generally, I do not think it is \nappropriate for the chairman or a ranking member to commit his or her \nparty to a single position that that chairman or, in this case, the \nranking member takes.\n  I respect my colleagues who may come forward with amendments, but I \nhope they understand my rationale and why I will not be supporting \nthose amendments, even the good ones, because there is no amendment I \ncan see that is so significant that it would cure all the defects or \nall the things this treaty fails to address. The risk I am concerned \nabout is bogging this treaty down.\n  It is a good resolution, I say to the Presiding Officer, who knows \nthat as well as or better than anyone present--he is one of the most \ninformed people in this body on foreign relations and arms control \nissues. I think it will be implemented. The reporting it requires, I \nthink, will enable us to do our constitutional duty of watching over \nthe treaty in the coming years.\n  Let's pass it and then work together to make it a success and work \ntogether to take the next steps we have to take.\n  I would note to my chairman that there may be a resolution unrelated \nto any amendment to this treaty calling for the Senate to go on record \nin a much more forceful way to support a comprehensive non-\nproliferation strategy and Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction \nefforts. As I said in the chairman's absence, without verification, \nthere are only two things that give me real solace, and they are the \ninsight we get from the Nunn-Lugar initiatives and cooperative threat \nreduction, as well as the remaining verification process that exists \nwithin the START treaty which will expire three years before this \ntreaty expires. But it will not, I assure my colleague, be as an \namendment. It will not be as a declaration which we cannot amend. It \nwill not be as a condition to this treaty.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I do not plan on speaking \non\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nthis issue very much longer except on each amendment at some point. I \nhope we can move as rapidly as possible because, again, the treaty is \nvaluable, but it is dangerous if we do not pass this treaty.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking \nmember for the work they have done. I can only agree wholeheartedly \nwith the ranking member's comments about the problems this treaty has, \nalthough I also intend to vote for it.\n  I came to the Senate in 1989. At that time, Vermont was a leader in \nthe effort to reduce nuclear weapons. I, therefore, became very \ninterested in what we could do to reduce the threat of nuclear war.\n  In November 1990, I traveled with seven Members of Parliament from \nthe United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. We went to the \ncapital of each of our countries. We worked as hard as we could to \nraise awareness of the dangers of nuclear war and discuss what could be \ndone to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  In England, we spoke with people who were involved with nuclear \nissues. We had a very memorable time with the Speaker of the House of \nLords and also the House of Commons and gained insight into the British \nperspective on these issues.\n  We then traveled to Moscow on the evening Soviet President Gorbachev \ngave his annual economic speech. We were amazed when, following the \nspeech, he spent a great deal of time with us discussing the nuclear \nissue. He stated that the Soviet Union would certainly welcome a \nprohibition on nuclear testing. At the end of that meeting, there was \none light moment. I brought him a pint of maple syrup. I offered it to \nhim and said that if he were to give a teaspoonful of this to someone, \nwhy, they would immediately seek peace. He responded: Do you have a \nliter? I said: No, but I will get you one. It was an interesting time.\n  We flew from there to Washington and met with National Security \nAdvisor Brent Scowcroft.\n  This is an issue I have followed for many years. I agree with my \npredecessor, the ranking member, that this treaty is far from perfect. \nWe are engaged in a global struggle to confront the terrorist threat \nand to curtail the dangers posed by the prospect of nuclear materials \nin the hands of so-called rogue nations.\n  While I will vote for this treaty, I cannot help but feel that the \nMoscow Treaty represents a tragic waste of opportunity. Instead of \ncapitalizing on the Russian desire to reach agreement on deep cuts in \nnuclear warheads and instead of seeking destruction of warheads to \nensure that Russian nuclear materials never fall into the hands of \nAmerica's enemies, the Bush administration's distaste for arms control \nagreements--indeed, for any sort of internationally binding agreement--\nhas prevented it from seizing the opportunity to make the American \npeople more secure.\n  There is nothing inherently wrong with the Moscow Treaty. It requires \nthe United States and Russia to reduce their operationally deployed \nstrategic nuclear weapons to between 1,700 to 2,200 warheads.\n  In a small way, it will make the United States, Russia, and the world \na safer place--a very small way. It also is consistent with the \nprevious administration's recommendations in the 1994 Nuclear Posture \nReview.\n  The shame of the Moscow Treaty is not in what it does, but in what it \ndoes not do. The treaty represents a lost opportunity. The Bush \nadministration's scorn for arms control blinded it to a golden \nopportunity presented by negotiation of the Moscow Treaty to address \nbigger nonproliferation and counterterrorism concerns of the United \nStates.\n  The Bush administration came into this negotiation only reluctantly. \nIt repeatedly declared its opposition to the negotiation of a legally \nbinding treaty text, asserting that less formal agreements or \nstatements would suffice.\n  Press reports are replete with examples of conflict between the \nPentagon, which opposed any limitations on its offensive nuclear \nweapons and wanted the flexibility to increase nuclear forces, and the \nState Department, which supported the negotiation of a legally binding \nagreement.\n  In the end, the State Department got its legally binding agreement, \nand the Pentagon got an agreement that is notable not only for its \nbrevity, but also for its lack of lasting impact.\n  While the treaty calls for each side to ``reduce and limit'' its \nstrategic nuclear warheads to within the 1,700 to 2,200 range, the \nUnited States made clear early in the negotiation that it would \ninterpret this phrase to apply only to ``operationally deployed'' \nwarheads. In other words, there is no obligation to destroy even a \nsingle warhead under the Moscow Treaty.\n  Warheads can be removed from their delivery vehicles and stored close \nby and still count as a ``reduction'' under the treaty. The United \nStates has made clear that it plans to dismantle some warheads, put \nsome in deep storage, and store others as spares.\n  The absence of any obligation to destroy warheads leads to one of the \ntreaty's most striking anomalies. The deadline for the reduction of \noperationally deployed warheads to within the 1,700 to 2,200 range is \nDecember 31, 2012. Unless otherwise agreed, the treaty expires the very \nsame day. So the reduction in operationally deployed warheads, which \nare the only reductions in strategic nuclear weapons required by the \ntreaty, lasts for only 1 day.\n  On January 1, 2013, each party will be free from Moscow Treaty \nconstraints on deployment of its strategic nuclear warheads. Moreover, \nif either the United States or Russia decides at any time in the \ninterim that it wants to redeploy its warheads, it need only provide 90 \ndays notice of withdrawal, and it will be free to do so.\n  On May 13, 2002, the President stated that he was ``pleased to \nannounce that the United States and Russia have agreed to a treaty \nwhich will substantially reduce our nuclear arsenals to the agreed-upon \nrange of 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. This treaty will liquidate the legacy \nof the cold war.''\n  This statement provides one more example of the President's rhetoric \nnot matching reality. The treaty does not reduce our nuclear warhead \narsenals to the range of the 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. Far from it. The \nWhite House refused to agree to such reductions. The treaty merely \nremoves warheads from operational deployment. There is no reduction in \nnuclear arsenals. The legacy of the cold war lives on. It just sits a \nshort distance from our missiles, bombers, and submarines rather than \nin a deployed posture.\n  Faced with the opportunity to lock in reductions of Russian strategic \nnuclear warheads, the President let ideology get in the way of \nmeaningful agreement. Despite well-publicized concerns over Russia's \nability to control its nuclear materials, he passed on an opportunity \nto assist global efforts against proliferation and terrorist attack by \nhelping Russia deal with its nuclear stockpiles.\n  There are a host of additional steps that could have been taken in \nconnection with the negotiation of the Moscow Treaty.\n  The President could have acted upon Russian desires to make true \nreductions in our offensive strategic nuclear weapons. He refused, \ndespite the fact that destruction of Russian nuclear warheads would \nhave eliminated their vulnerability to theft or diversion to \nterrorists.\n  The President could have agreed to Russian proposals for negotiation \nof a verification regime to track progress toward the 2012 limits on \ndeployed warheads.\n  He refused, despite the confidence it would have instilled in the \nreduction process.\n  The President could have expanded the negotiation to cover tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  He refused, despite the fact that thousands of such weapons exist in \nRussia and the United States without any sort of monitoring or control \nby an arms control regime.\n  Because of their small size and battlefield application, these \nweapons are extremely attractive to terrorist organizations, and \nrelatively vulnerable.\n  The United States is currently unable to determine the precise number \nof Russian tactical nuclear weapons, and therefore unable to determine \nthe nature of Russian control over such weapons and whether some might \nalready have been lost or stolen.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  The President also could have expanded the negotiation to cover the \nproblem of multiple independently targeted warheads known as MIRVs.\n  Refusal to do so by the President leaves the American people \nvulnerable to the loss of several sites from a single missile launch.\n  Steps of this sort truly would have matched the President's rhetoric, \nand they would have made this world far safer for our children.\n  The opportunities presented by the Moscow Treaty are now lost. Other \nopportunities exist, however, to work with Russia and others around the \nworld to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons, material, and \nknowledge.\n  Such work is critical to our efforts to combat terrorism and to halt \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and know-how to countries such as North \nKorea, Iran, and Iraq.\n  It is my sincere hope that in the future the President will \nreconsider the narrow approach taken toward the Moscow Treaty, and to \nother agreements such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  The fight against terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons must be \nfought on several fronts.\n  Half-hearted efforts like the Moscow Treaty will not meet the needs \nof the American people and the world.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to support the resolution of \nratification of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions--or, as we \ncall it, the Moscow Treaty--now before the Senate.\n  The Moscow Treaty represents a shared commitment by the United States \nand Russia to step back from the cold war policies of nuclear \nconfrontation and enter into a new era of cooperation. This is to \nassure that our nuclear weapons no longer threaten either our peoples \nor our civilization.\n  It was the bold vision of President Ronald Reagan, 17 years ago, at \nthe Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik that set in motion this effort to \nmake dramatic reductions in the nuclear weapons arsenals of the United \nStates and then the Soviet Union. President Reagan's vision, once \nconsidered by some a fantasy or a negotiating ploy, is becoming the \nstandard by which we should measure our success in arms control.\n  The Moscow Treaty avoids the strategic gamesmanship and pitfalls of \nthe SALT treaties, the ABM Treaty, and other negotiations of the cold \nwar.\n  The simplicity of this treaty, only three pages in length, betrayed \nits historic significance for United States-Russian relations and for \nglobal security. Its strength is the power of its objective, to \ndramatically reduce American and Russian strategic weapons.\n  On November 13, 2001, President Bush announced that the United States \nwould reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal by two-thirds, from \napproximately 6,000 nuclear weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200 \noperationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons by December 31, \n2012. The President made this determination independent of what Russia \nwould do, knowing that these reductions would be in the overall \nstrategic interest of the United States.\n\n  President Putin determined that comparable reductions would also be \nin his country's own national security interest. On May 24, 2002, Bush \nand Putin agreed that their commitment to these reductions would take \nthe form of a legally binding treaty.\n  The negotiations over the Moscow Treaty did not fall into the traps \nof previous arms control agreements negotiated with the Soviet Union \nduring the cold war. That is as much a testimony to the new spirit of \nU.S.-Russian relations and the realities of today's threats as it is to \nthe strength of the treaty. For example, it took the United States \nSenate 3 years to ratify the START II treaty. It took the Russian Duma \n7 years for ratification. And both sides put conditions unacceptable to \nthe other side on the respective ratification agreements. As a result, \nthat agreement never went into force.\n  Instead of years of back and forth negotiations, with each side \nseeking a strategic advantage, the Moscow Treaty illustrates a turning \npoint in America's relationship with Russia. It should provide an \nenvironment conducive to future arms control negotiations.\n  The Resolution of Ratification before us today introduces just two \nstraightforward conditions that complement rather than complicate the \ntreaty. First, the administration must report to the Senate annually on \nhow the United States plans to reach the required reduction goals. \nWhile this resolution does not set a rigid timetable, these reports \nwill allow the Senate to oversee the implementation of this treaty.\n  The second condition deals with the Cooperative Threat Reduction or \nNunn-Lugar programs. Russia is committed to meeting these reductions, \nbut the question remains if Russia has the resources to meet them. The \nNunn-Lugar program has been successful in assisting the former states \nof the Soviet Union to help reduce their nuclear arsenals. The \nResolution of Ratification rightly includes Nunn-Lugar programs as \ninstrumental in achieving lasting and durable arms reduction.\n\n  The Moscow Treaty should not be considered as the final chapter in \nU.S.-Russian arms control, but it is an important and historic step \nforward. The United States and Russia must do more to prevent the \nproliferation of dual use technology and weapons of mass destruction to \nIran, North Korea, and other countries. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction programs are crucial to our shared security interests \nin preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destructions. For us \nto succeed in making a safer world, Washington and Moscow must be \nstrategic partners, not strategic adversaries.\n  The Bush Administration, Chairman Lugar, Senator biden, and others \nwho have framed the Treaty and the Resolution of Ratification deserve \ncredit and thanks for their leadership and steady focus. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes on the resolution without amendments, for the \nvery reasons Senator Biden articulated just minutes ago, and to \nunderstand the broader context and significance of this treaty for \nU.S.-Russian relations and global security. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will speak briefly today about the \ntreaty we are considering. I spoke about it in brief yesterday and said \nwhile I would vote for it, I think it is not much better than nothing \nwith respect to arms control. I will explain a little bit about where I \nthink we are and where I hope we might go on some of these issues.\n  I note that Senator Lugar is in the Chamber, the chairman of the \ncommittee. He might or might not know that yesterday when I spoke on \nthese issues, I spoke about the general issue of threat reduction. I \nspoke about the Nunn-Lugar, or Lugar-Nunn, programs by which we were \nactually using taxpayer money in this country to dismantle delivery \nsystems and weapons in the old Soviet Union and in Russia, the very \nsuccess of those programs, and how much I thought those programs have \ncontributed to moving in the right direction.\n  We may not agree. I do not know. I suspect there are some who think \nthis Moscow Treaty actually advances our interests. I think it probably \ndoes not, but I do not think it hurts anything. It is an agreement by \nwhich the United States and Russia decide that a number of nuclear \nweapons will be taken off the active delivery systems and put in \nstorage, but at the end of the time during which this transition takes \nplace, in 2012, we will have exactly the same number of nuclear weapons \nin Russia and in the United States as we have today, at least as a \nresult of this treaty.\n  This treaty does not propose that any nuclear weapons be disassembled \nor destroyed. It is simply putting nuclear\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nweapons in storage facilities somewhere. Are they at the ready? Are \nthey in storage? I think it is not a great distinction, or at least it \nis a distinction without much of a difference.\n  While Senator Lugar is present, I want to mention, as I did \nyesterday, I have here a piece of a strut from a wing of a Soviet \nbomber. Some of my colleagues have been given pieces of this as a \ncommemorative of a very successful effort we have made and continue to \nmake with respect to arms reductions. I stress the word ``reductions'' \nof both nuclear weapons and delivery systems.\n  I ask unanimous consent to use this old strut of a Soviet bomber to \nmake the point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point is this: I hold in my hand a piece of metal \nthat belonged to a bomber that presumably carried nuclear weapons that \nthreatened every American. Did we shoot this bomber down? No, we did \nnot. We sawed the wings off and destroyed the fuselage. How did we do \nthat? Because we had a program called Nunn-Lugar, or Lugar-Nunn, that \nactually recognized it is a whole lot better to reach an agreement for \narms reduction and then help pay for the destruction of a Soviet bomber \nor a Russian bomber, or the dismantlement of a missile or a submarine \nand the destruction of a warhead, than it is to exchange them or to try \nto shoot it down or to sink the submarine. So we appropriated \ntaxpayers' money for this purpose. This is called peace.\n  This is another item I showed yesterday: Ground-up copper from a \ndismantled Soviet submarine that carried missiles with warheads aimed \nat American cities. This is called progress. This submarine does not \nexist any longer. Why? Because we had the foresight, particularly by \nSenator Lugar and Senator Nunn, to say if we can have verifiable \nreductions in both delivery systems and nuclear weapons, and even help \npay for that destruction, it is far better than having this continued \nstandoff and actually having to fight at some point to try to knock \ndown a Soviet bomber or destroy a Russian submarine. We are destroying \nthem, all right, but peacefully, through a program that works.\n\n  Because I think that is very important to understand, I made the \npoint yesterday that there are thousands and thousands of nuclear \nweapons in this world. The bulk of them are contained in arsenals by \nRussia and the United States. Many of them are called theater nuclear \nweapons, lower yield, smaller nuclear weapons. Then there are strategic \nnuclear weapons, the larger nuclear weapons. There are thousands of \neach, and over time, through arms control agreements, we have reached \nsome understanding that we want to reduce the number of warheads, the \nnumber of delivery systems. We have moved back and forth about exactly \nhow we do that. In some cases, there has been great emphasis on \ndismantling or limiting the number of delivery systems, the missiles \nthemselves, or the bombers or the submarines. They are mere delivery \nsystems for a weapon of mass destruction. In some cases, we paid great \nattention to that. In other cases, we have paid attention to the number \nof warheads themselves.\n  All of that is important. But I must say a treaty is not, at the end \nof the day, very important to us if it discontinues the effort to \nactually reduce the threat of war through dismantling weapons and \ndelivery systems. We have made some progress in arms control, progress \nthat I think is very important to the American people, but there is so \nmuch more to be done.\n  A rumor that someone had stolen one nuclear weapon some many months \nago caused great concern in this country. The loss of one nuclear \nweapon to a terrorist could hold hostage an entire American city or, \nfor that matter, much of a country, and there are thousands and \nthousands of these weapons.\n  It seems to me, if we wish to make this a safer world for our \nchildren and grandchildren, it is our job to aggressively stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons. God forbid other countries will become part \nof the nuclear club or that terrorists and terrorist organizations will \nacquire weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. We \nwill stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And we must be the leader to \ndo that. This country must be in the lead. It is our job. This \nresponsibility falls on our shoulders at this time.\n\n  No. 2, in addition to stopping the spread, we must systematically, \nover a period of time, begin reducing the stockpiles. We must do that.\n  I have been disappointed for some long while on arms control issues. \nI don't believe we should disarm. I don't want our country to be weak. \nBut I believe it is in our country's best interests to stop the spread \nof nuclear weapons and to have a mutually agreed upon reduction in the \nnumber of nuclear weapons.\n  In October of 1999, this Senate rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest-Ban Treaty. That was a terrible disappointment, certainly for me \nand for many around the world. We have not tested nuclear weapons for \nnearly a decade, yet we send a message to the rest of the world that we \ndo not want a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, one that much of \nthe world has already embraced. That was a terrible setback. Since that \ntime, by the way, the reports by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman \nShalikashvili and the National Academy of Sciences have endorsed the \nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and concluded that the treaty can be \nverified adequately, adversaries cannot significantly advance their \nnuclear weapons by cheating, and the United States can maintain \nconfidence in its nuclear stockpile without testing. We made a horrible \nmistake in rejecting that treaty.\n  This country, in December 2001, announced it would unilaterally \nwithdraw from the ABM Treaty with Russia. In my judgment, that was a \nsignificant mistake. That treaty was the center pole of nuclear arms \nreduction agreements, talks, and discussions.\n  In January 2002, the administration released its Nuclear Posture \nReview, and it said the United States needs to keep a very substantial \nnuclear force for 20 years. It set out what that nuclear force would \nbe. But that Nuclear Posture Review blurred the lines between \nconventional and nuclear weapons, calling for a new generation of \nsmaller, easy-to-use nuclear weapons, including smaller bunker buster \nweapons--the wrong thing for our country if we are going to be a leader \nin trying to say to another nation, let's never see a nuclear weapon \nused again anywhere in this world. And yet we are talking about perhaps \ndesigning new bunker buster nuclear weapons--moving exactly in the \nopposite direction, in my judgment.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review called for increasing our readiness to \nresume testing of nuclear weapons. I don't understand that.\n  All of these, together, represent movement in exactly the wrong \ndirection for this country. We have very serious challenges in the \nworld that require our leadership. India and Pakistan don't like each \nother. They are shooting at each other at the border, over Kashmir. \nThey both have nuclear weapons. It was not too many months ago we had a \nvery serious, very tense time with respect to India and Pakistan.\n  The message we send as the world leader, the strongest military power \nin the world, is critically important. Our message ought to be that we \nwant to make this a safer world by beginning the long process of \nreducing the stockpile of nuclear weapons, not by putting them in \nwarehouses someplace. We should be really reducing the number of \nnuclear weapons and making sure that our efforts as the United States \nof America are used to try to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to \nany other country in the world, any other group in the world--that is \nour responsibility. It is what we must be about. If that mantle of \nworld leadership is not borne by us, that leadership will not exist. I \nfear our future will not be a particularly good future with more and \nmore countries becoming a part of the nuclear club.\n\n  As I indicated, the Moscow Treaty does not require a single missile \nsilo, submarine, bomber, missile, or bomb, for that matter, to be \neliminated. Compare this with previous treaties. The Intermediate-Range \nNuclear Forces Treaty required the destruction of an entire class of \nballistic missiles with ranges from 2,000 to 3,000 miles.\n  I had a picture in the Senate one day of a few acres of sunflowers. \nThis few\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nacres of sunflowers were sunflowers planted on a piece of ground that \nused to house missiles in the Ukraine with a warhead aimed at the \nUnited States of America. It is not a warhead. It is not a missile. It \nis gone. It is destroyed. And now where a missile was once buried, \nthere grows a field of sunflowers. What a wonderful thing.\n  The fact is, these agreements, these treaties that we have had, have \nworked. The treaties require irreversible action by requiring the \ndestruction of delivery vehicles and warheads.\n  As I indicated, the Moscow Treaty does not require a single nuclear \nwarhead to be destroyed. It limits the number of strategic nuclear \nweapons that each side can deploy, from 1,700 to 2,200.\n  Admittedly, previous arms treaties did not require the destruction of \nwarheads, but at the Helsinki summit Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin \nagreed to a framework of SALT III negotiations for destruction of \nwarheads. During treaty negotiations, Russia insisted that it require \nthe elimination of nondeployed warheads, but our country resisted \nbecause we wanted to keep warheads removed from deployment in storage.\n  So now we have a Moscow Treaty that says we are going to keep these \nwarheads in storage but we will count them as a reduction in warheads \nbecause they are no longer active with respect to the ability to put \nthem on an airplane or submarine or on the tip of a missile. Frankly, \nit does not reduce the number of nuclear warheads in a significant way, \nand in my judgment, we ought to be doing that.\n  We have the START treaty. We have a whole series of efforts that have \noccurred over a long period of time that give us a roadmap on how to \nsucceed with respect to what I think our obligation is in these areas. \nThere is nothing particularly objectionable about this treaty, but it \ndoes not really provide any progress for us. One can hardly object to \nsomething that does not do anything, except that my wish would be that \nwe would engage in a manner that would allow us to make some progress.\n  I intended to offer an amendment. I say to my colleague from Indiana \nthat I am not going to offer an amendment. I have the amendment, but I \nwill not offer it because my understanding is that the ranking member \nwould be obligated to vote against it based on an agreement the \nchairman and the ranking member have reached. But let me read my \namendment and state what I hope this country will do at some point.\n  My amendment would have added a section (7):\n\n       Further Negotiations.--The Senate urges the President to \n     build upon the foundation of the Treaty by negotiating a new \n     treaty with the Russian Federation that would enter into \n     force upon the termination of the Treaty on Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, with Annexes, \n     Protocols, and Memorandum of Understanding, signed at Moscow \n     on July 31, 1991 (START Treaty), and would require deep, \n     verifiable, and irreversible reductions in the stockpiles of \n     strategic and non-strategic nuclear warheads of the United \n     States and the Russian Federation.\n\n  The purpose of this would be to say that future negotiations which \nshould occur, and should occur now, should have as an objective to \nreduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons contained both in Russia and \nthe United States. I do not propose disarmament. I do propose that in \ncircumstances where each of us has thousands and thousands and \nthousands of nuclear weapons--perhaps as many as 25 to 30,000 between \nboth countries, if you include both theater and strategic nuclear \nweapons--I do propose we find a way to reduce the stockpiles on both \nsides in an irreversible way.\n  Then, as I indicated previously, my fervent hope and prayer is that \nthe leadership of this country will exert itself to try to do \neverything it can to be a world leader to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons. This country's future depends on it.\n  Let me conclude by saying I have great admiration for Senator Biden, \nwho has had a world of experience in these areas, and for Senator \nLugar. I have already spoken of Senator Lugar. I will not go on at \ngreat length. But his work has been extraordinary. Senator Biden's \nwork, as well, contributes a great deal to this Senate and to this \ncountry.\n  I know he believes, as I do, that we have seen many missed \nopportunities in recent years to don the mantle of world leadership \nthat we must assume dealing with these areas. While I will vote for \nthis treaty, I am confident that Senator Lugar and Senator Biden \nunderstand, perhaps even if this administration does not, based on \ntheir past actions and based on the things they have supported \npreviously, this is a step, even if a baby step, that must be followed \nby very large strides, vigorous, aggressive approaches to do what we \nknow needs to be done: A real reduction in the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons and a major effort on behalf of America to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons in the rest of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 250\n\n             (Purpose: To provide an additional condition)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the resolution of ratification we have \nbefore us on the treaty between the United States of America and the \nRussian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions, also known as the \nMoscow Treaty, is a step forward but in many ways it is a very modest \nstep. The treaty is a three-page document signed by Presidents Bush and \nPutin on May 24, 2002, to reduce deployed strategic nuclear weapons to \nbetween 1,700 and 2,200 warheads by December 31, 2012.\n  The treaty actually calls for no warheads or delivery vehicles to be \ndestroyed. They can simply be stored. There are no verification \nprovisions, other than those still in effect through 2009 from the \nSTART treaty, and the reductions in deployed warheads have to occur by \nDecember 31, 2012, the very same day the treaty expires.\n  However, once the reductions in deployed warheads are met, it means a \nlarge number of warheads will not be ready to launch at a moment's \nnotice. That is a positive thing, even if no warheads are dismantled \nand no delivery vehicles are destroyed.\n  When nonnuclear countries agreed to forgo nuclear weapons in the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, an essential part of the grand bargain \nwas that nuclear countries, like the United States and the Russian \nFederation, were to control and reduce their nuclear weapons. Because \nthis treaty is an effort to control and reduce the number of deployed \nwarheads, I will vote for the resolution of ratification.\n  From the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty flowed all the various \nefforts of U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control, including the SALT and \nSTART treaties. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was renewed in \n1995, but it required a lot of arm twisting by the United States \nbecause nonnuclear countries have accused the nuclear powers of not \nbeing serious about nuclear arms control and reduction. A major reason \nnonnuclear states agreed to renew the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \nis because the United States signed and agreed to pursue ratification \nof the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which sadly, this body, \nthe Senate, rejected on October 13, 1999.\n\n  The failure of the Senate to meet its obligation and ratify the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty left us with little or no \nleverage to keep Asia from a spiraling arms race in India, Pakistan, \nChina, and perhaps even other countries. Pakistan and India are in a \ntense nuclear standoff that came to the brink of nuclear war over \nKashmir and easily could again. North Korea, we all know, already has \nnuclear weapons and is likely to build more. Libya, Iran, and Iraq, may \nbe seeking to acquire or develop nuclear weapons.\n  For those who think nuclear arms control is just a quaint leftover of \nthe cold war, let me say we are facing a major round of nuclear \nproliferation with destabilizing effects that we may have no way to \nstop.\n  Let me at this point pay special tribute to the Senator from Indiana, \nMr. Lugar. Several weeks ago I went to a breakfast at which Senator \nLugar spoke relative to the issue of nuclear proliferation. Since the \ndays of Nunn-Lugar, with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Dick Lugar of \nIndiana has been a leader, a global leader, on the question of nuclear \nproliferation. I hope more Members of the Senate on both sides of the \naisle will pay particular heed to his warnings about proliferation and \nabout the need for the\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nUnited States and other countries seeking stability and peace in the \nworld to be mindful of the danger of proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Some of the examples he gave us from his own life experience, \nvisiting the former Soviet Union, were chilling--chilling because we \nare this close to the proliferation of weapons, weapons in the hands of \ncountries that will not deal with them in a responsible way.\n  Having said that, though, I am still very concerned about the \npolicies of this administration that could, in fact, further fray the \nfabric of the grand bargain struck with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty and actually create an incentive for current nonnuclear states \nto acquire nuclear weapons--exactly the opposite of what we want to see \nin the world of tomorrow. This country has to do more to deal with the \ncrisis in North Korea, do more to secure fissile materials in other \ncountries, and do more to secure a broad international coalition \nagainst proliferation.\n  I have cosponsored a resolution with Senator Tom Daschle, which will \nbe introduced today, calling for a more vigorous nonproliferation \npolicy.\n  I am particularly concerned this administration's policy of \npreemption, combined with a new policy of first use of nuclear weapons, \nis an incentive, an invitation to proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons. I have introduced a resolution \nof my own on that subject today.\n  Let me elaborate with just a few points. Press reports about the \nDecember 31, 2001, Nuclear Posture Review indicated that the United \nStates might use nuclear weapons to discourage adversaries from \nundertaking military programs or operations that could threaten U.S. \ninterests; that nuclear weapons could be employed against targets able \nto withstand nonnuclear attack, and that setting requirements for \nnuclear strike capabilities, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya \nare among the countries that could be involved in so-called \ncontingencies. The September 17, 2002, national security strategy of \nthe United States stated:\n\n       As a matter of common sense and self defense, America will \n     act against such emerging threats before they are fully \n     formed.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our \n     adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act \n     preemptively.\n\n  The U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, John Bolton, \nrecently announced this administration's abandonment of the so-called \n``negative security assurance,'' the pledge to refrain from using \nnuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapons, which was outlined in 1978, \nrestated in 1995, and in 2002 in the context of gaining the support of \nother nations for the nonproliferation treaty. Press reports indicate \nthat in a classified document, National Security Directive 17, the \nPresident may have made explicit what had been usefully ambiguous \nbefore--a threat to use nuclear weapons in response to an attack with \nchemical or biological weapons. Making that threat explicit may mean \nthat leaders of other countries that fear a United States attack will \nthink they have to have nuclear weapons to deter the United States, \nleading to even more proliferation.\n  What we have here is an escalation of rhetoric, where we have moved \nbeyond ``no first use of nuclear weapons,'' to the point where this \nadministration is saying we can use nuclear weapons against those who \ndo not have them. And now we have a new policy of preemption where the \nuse of those weapons does not even require an imminent danger, imminent \nthreat against the United States.\n  This rhetoric and this policy cannot help but escalate the situation, \nleading to more proliferation. That is why I think it is sad that this \nU.S. Congress has been so passive, while this President has sought to \ndramatically radicalize and change the foreign policy which has guided \nthis Nation for decades.\n  The United States is currently engaged in the expansion of research \nand development of new types of nuclear weapons such as the so-called \nbunker busters, or small nuclear weapons intended to destroy \nunderground facilities or buried chemical or biological weapons caches.\n  These policies and actions threaten to make nuclear weapons appear to \nbe useful, legitimate, offensive first-strike weapons, rather than a \nforce for deterrence, and therefore this policy undermines an essential \ntenet of nonproliferation.\n\n  The cumulative effect of the policies announced by President Bush is \nto redefine and broaden the concept of preemption, which has been \nunderstood to mean anticipatory self-defense in the face of imminent \nattack, and the right of every state to include preventive war without \nevidence of an imminent attack in which the United States may opt to \nuse nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states.\n  We don't know where this dangerous policy may lead. But it is hard to \nimagine it will lead to a safer world. It is hard to imagine that a \nnonnuclear power can look at the new Bush foreign policy and say with \nany degree of confidence that forestalling the development of nuclear \nweapons is in their best interests in the long term. I am afraid the \nPresident has created an incentive for proliferation of nuclear \nweapons--exactly the opposite of what this world needs.\n  Turning back to the treaty before us today, I am going to offer an \namendment, and a number of colleagues will as well. It is my hope we \nwill be able to make constructive and responsible improvements to the \nResolution of Ratification that will address some of the weaknesses.\n  When the Senate considered the Resolution of Ratification of the \nSTART treaty in 1992, it approved a condition that requires the \nPresident to seek a cooperative monitoring and verification arrangement \nin any future agreement.\n  I am offering an amendment to this Resolution of Ratification that \nrequires the President to report to relevant Senate committees on how \nhe is complying with that requirement.\n  The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty--also known as the Moscow \nTreaty--does not contain any verification measures other than those \nalready required by the START treaty, which expires in 2009.\n  The President's position is that our new cooperative relationship \nwith Russia means no verification is necessary. Certainly our \nrelationship with the Russian Federation is quite different than it was \nduring the dark and dreary days of the cold war. The preamble to the \ntreaty makes reference to this new relationship saying the two parties \ndesire ``. . . to establish a genuine partnership based on the \nprinciples of mutual security, cooperation, trust, openness, and \npredictability.''\n  I believe a series of cooperative measures, inspections, data sharing \nand other verification measures are appropriate even in a relationship \nbased on trust, cooperation, openness, and predictability.\n  I am sorry to remind my colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle that it was their President, Ronald Reagan, who said, ``Trust but \nverify.'' He was negotiating a START treaty at the time with the Soviet \nUnion. I think his words still apply. Verification builds trust.\n  As British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston said in 1848--and it \nhas become an often-quoted maxim in foreign affairs--``We have no \neternal allies and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are \neternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.'' \nIn this case, the interests of both countries are served by reducing \ndeployed warheads, but interests can change with the circumstances.\n  President Bush has said several times--in fact, he said it in a \nconversation that I was a party to--that he has developed a \nrelationship of trust with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. In a \njoint press conference with the Russian President in June, 1991, \nPresident Bush said: ``I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be \nvery straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I \nwas able to get a sense of his soul. . . . The Cold War said loud and \nclear that we're opponents and that we bring the peace through the \nability for each of us to destroy each other. . . . Friends don't \ndestroy each other.''\n  This may well be so, but the fact is that both countries still both \nhave, at the push of a few buttons, the capability to destroy each \nother, and to destroy the world. There can be no more serious matter.\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n  President Bush and President Putin may have the best of trusting \nrelationships, but we cannot know what the future will bring or who \nwill be President of either country over the life of this treaty, or \nwhat kind of relationship those Presidents may have.\n  Condition 8 of the resolution of ratification of the START treaty \nrequires that in connection with any subsequent agreement reducing \nstrategic nuclear weapons, the President shall seek appropriate \nmonitoring measures. I want to read the entire condition, because I \nbelieve it is very important for my colleagues to hear what the Senate \nrequired in 1992:\n\n       (8) Nuclear Stockpile Weapons Arrangement.--In as much as \n     the prospect of a loss of control of nuclear weapons or \n     fissile material in the former Soviet Union could pose a \n     serious threat to the United States and to international \n     peace and security, in connection with any further agreement \n     reducing strategic offensive arms, the President shall seek \n     an appropriate arrangement, including the use of reciprocal \n     inspections, data exchanges, and other cooperative measures, \n     to monitor--\n       (A) the numbers of nuclear stockpile weapons on the \n     territory of the parties to this Treaty; and\n       (B) the location and inventory of facilities on the \n     territory of the parties to this treaty capable of producing \n     significant quantities of fissile materials.\n\n  This condition, originally offered to the START Resolution of \nRatification during committee consideration, was offered by the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Biden, who is in the Chamber today and has been a \nleader, as well as Senator Lugar, in developing the kind of arms \ncontrol which can make a safer world. Senator Biden offered an \nexcellent condition that reflected deep concern about nuclear warheads \nand fissile material falling into the hands of terrorists and \nirresponsible states, and anticipated that future treaties would \nrequire cooperative measures to monitor and verify reductions in \nstrategic weapons in a post-cold-war context.\n  In fact, measures to monitor what becomes of the thousands of \nwarheads to be taken off of operational deployment is one of the most \nimportant steps the United States and the Russian Federation can take \nto be sure those weapons or fissile materials are secured.\n  The START treaty contains an extremely complex verification regime. \nBoth countries collect most of the information to verify compliance \nthrough ``National Technical Means of Verification,'' in other words, \nsatellites and remote sensing devices. START also allows intrusive \nmeasures, such as on-site inspections and exchanges of data.\n  But these measures under START apply to the retirement and \ndestruction of nuclear weapons launchers and not the warheads \nthemselves. START has a complex way of limiting nuclear forces--rather \nthan counting warheads, it attributes a certain number of warheads to \neach kind of missile or bomber.\n  The treaty before us does not require the destruction of launchers, \nor warheads. There is simply no way to verify what may happen to the \nthousands of warheads that are to be taken out of operational \ndeployment.\n  When Senator Lugar came to our breakfast a few weeks ago, he told a \nstory of visiting the submarine facility at Minsk--I am sure he can \nfill in the details--and seeing the long line of nuclear submarines \nthat used to be part of the Soviet Navy. He raised a serious and \nimportant question about what would happen to the nuclear payload or \nthe nuclear materials in those submarines. Will they be taken out to \nsea and scuttled, or dismantled and sold? It is a serious concern.\n  Think about the materials we are talking about. I have seen Senator \nBiden many times come to the floor with materials no longer than a \nsaucer, and easily transported in terms of their size. Now we are \ntalking about a treaty before us which does not include verification \nprocedures so that we are not certain that the Russian Federation is \nactually dealing with these fissile materials and nuclear weapons in a \nfashion to guarantee that they won't be the subject of proliferation.\n  Doesn't it make sense for us to have a reciprocal obligation on the \npart of both the United States and the Russian Federation to make \ncertain this treaty works? To say the President of the United States \nand the President of Russia have a trusting working relationship is a \ngood thing for world peace. But who knows what tomorrow will bring? Who \nknows where we will be or where the Russian Federation will be? And who \nknows who the leaders will be?\n  It is important for us, if we are ratifying a resolution for a treaty \nthat will affect the United States for 9 or 10 years, that we at least \nconsider the possibilities that things may not end up as smoothly as we \nhoped. It is far better for us to build into this resolution a \nverification procedure to make sure both sides live up to the terms of \nthe treaty. As President Reagan said, ``Trust but verify.''\n  I believe that it makes sense for new verification measures to be \nnegotiated. A Bilateral Implementation Commission and the Consultative \nGroup for Strategic Security have both been established in connection \nwith the treaty, and verification and transparency measures may be \ndiscussed in these fora. Secretary of State Colin Powell said in his \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the \nAdministration will ``consider whether to pursue expanded \ntransparency'' at meetings of the Consultative Group.\n  My amendment reminds the Executive Branch that it is already required \nto seek an arrangement on such issues by Condition 8 of the START \ntreaty, and simply requires a report on what it has done to comply with \nthe requirements of that condition.\n  I believe this change, although small, is important. It is a change \nthat states to every Member of the Senate and to the American people we \nrepresent and to future generations that this is more than just words \non paper. It is more than just a blink of an eye and a relationship.\n  There is a verification procedure to make sure that the nuclear \nweapons that are to be set aside and not menace the rest of the world \nare actually set aside, verification procedures which we can trust and \nthe Russians can trust as well. That is not too much to ask. To do \nanything less is to perhaps jeopardize the good, positive relationship \nwe have today, by leaving unsaid and unmet our obligation for \nverification.\n  Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 250.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following new condition:\n       (3) Compliance Report.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     exchange of instruments of ratification of the Treaty, and \n     annually thereafter on April 15, the President shall submit \n     to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate a report on the compliance of \n     the President with the requirements of condition (a)(8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Treaty on Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, with Annexes, \n     Protocols, and Memorandum of Understanding, signed at Moscow \n     on July 31, 1991 (START Treaty), which states that ``[in] as \n     much as the prospect of a loss of control of nuclear weapons \n     or fissile material in the former Soviet Union could pose a \n     serious threat to the United States and to international \n     peace and security, in connection with any further agreement \n     reducing strategic offensive arms, the President shall seek \n     an appropriate arrangement, including the use of reciprocal \n     inspections, data exchanges, and other cooperative measures, \n     to monitor (A) the numbers of nuclear stockpile weapons on \n     the territory of the parties to [the START Treaty]; and (B) \n     the location and inventory of facilities on the territory of \n     the parties to [the START Treaty] capable of producing or \n     processing significant quantities of fissile materials''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have shared a copy of this amendment \nwith Senator Lugar, and I hope Senator Biden's staff has a copy as \nwell. If not, we will provide it to them immediately.\n  At this point, I do not know if Senator Lugar would like to respond \nto the filing of the amendment or to engage me in a conversation about \nthe nature of the amendment. I would welcome that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his very \nthoughtful and generous remarks about cooperative threat reduction and\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\nthe conversations we have enjoyed about that.\n  The Senator from Illinois has been a very strong supporter of \nnonproliferation in this country as we have worked with the Russians or \nwe have tried to direct our own programs. It is always difficult to \noppose an amendment of someone who has been so generous in mentioning \ncooperation we have had together.\n  I will oppose the amendment because I believe that, in fact, the \nSenator's objectives are being realized in many ways. Some are known to \nthe Senator; some I would like to discuss presently.\n  But, first of all, I would say that in arguing in favor of the Moscow \nTreaty, Senator Biden and I have pointed out that the President had \nalready made a determination that we were going to unilaterally destroy \na good number of weapons. And the Russians, for their own reasons, had \ndecided they wanted to do so.\n  This is why it is a very short and simple treaty without extensive \nverification protocols that have characterized other treaties. But it \ncomes with the START I verification procedures that last through 2009. \nIn our hearings, we have pointed out 2009 is short of 2012, which is \nthe timetable for the total treaty to be consummated. But, at the same \ntime, there is all of the strictness the Senator from Illinois has \nmentioned in previous treaties incorporated in this one.\n  The second point of verification is the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, the Nunn-Lugar program. This has people from our country \nworking with Russians on the ground in Russia. They are verifying \nprecisely what they are doing.\n  I want to mention the extent of this reporting and verification by \npointing to the CTR report which was just published for the year 2002. \nIt has, on the front, so that all Senators will be able to see, the CTR \nlogo, and says: ``Cooperative Threat Reduction annual report, Fiscal \nYear 2002.''\n  Now, page by page, the report goes through a description of \ncooperative threat reduction activities carried out in fiscal year 2000 \nin the nuclear, chemical, and biological areas, project by project and \nobjective by objective. It discusses the 5-year plan for destruction or \ncontainment, security of each of these materials or weapons systems.\n  I mention this simply because that has been the objective of those of \nus who have tried to foster this Cooperative Threat Reduction Program; \nthat in fact there be very close congressional scrutiny, dollar for \ndollar, area by area, all the way through.\n  Now, Senator Biden was prescient in his amendment that the Senator \nfrom Illinois has cited. But this clearly influenced the subsequent \nwork under cooperative threat reduction, and does to this day.\n  The objectives that the Senator from Illinois has suggested that are \nespecially important--and those were also mentioned by the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, early on--we are \nconcerned about the tactical nuclear weapons. We have raised the \nquestion to Secretary Powell as to why this was not included. In \nessence, this is not a quote from the Secretary, but he said: It is a \nbridge too far. We raised this with the Russians. They are not prepared \nto come to agreement.\n\n  Now, other countries are deeply interested in the Russians coming to \nagreement, the G-8 countries that have come together in the so-called \n10 plus 10 over 10 program, which means $10 billion for each of 10 \nyears from the countries in the G-8 other than the United States, thus \nmatching essentially what we are doing under cooperative threat \nreduction.\n  One of the objectives of the early meetings was clearly: What about \nthe tactical weapons? These are very close to the Europeans. They are \nnot long-range ballistic missiles. They are missiles on the continent \nin proximity to countries worried about their security.\n  So we have friends, in a multilateral way, who are helping to pursue \nthis situation. I have some confidence--because Secretary Powell and \nSecretary Rumsfeld, in their testimony, indicated this is a high \npriority for them, they will continue to raise it with the Russians--we \nwill make some headway. But we have not thus far.\n  I would just say to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, whether \nspurred by the Biden amendment years ago or various other activities, \nour activities as Members of the Senate and the House and on the ground \nin Russia have been vigorous.\n  I think the Senator cited perhaps some of my trips. But one recently, \nlast August, was an attempt to go to the biomilitary plant at so-called \nKirov 200. I sought to go there because it was identified as one of \nfour bioweapons facilities of which we believe the Russians are simply \nstill in denial. They are not prepared to work with us, even though at \n14 other sites we do now have active programs.\n  Under the ISTC Program, the International Science and Technology \nProgram, we are giving stipends to Russian scientists who now have left \nthe weapons field and are working on HIV/AIDS or other ways to combat \nchemical weapons poisoning.\n  I would simply say that the Kirov 200 situation, for me, was almost a \nbridge too far, even though I thought arrangements were available for \nour U.S. Air Force plane to convey me and the party out there. At the \nairport that morning, we were informed we would not be able to land. We \ncould fly, but we were not going to land. So we began to work our way \nthrough the bureaucracy of the foreign office of Russia, unwilling to \ntake no for an answer. In due course, we did fly the aircraft, and we \ndid land in Kirov.\n  Having gotten there, I would say that I did not see everything that I \nwished to see. But what I did find were retired Russians, retired at \n55, who had come, from the plant that was denied to me, down to our \nactivities and who, in essence, told me everything they were doing at \neither.\n  So I think we have a pretty good insight. I just mention this because \neven as we legislatively will some things to happen, they do not happen \nwithout persistence and sort of doggedly pursuing those objectives. I \nam just testifying that is occurring, sometimes to the discomfort of \nour relationship with the Russians. But in this particular case, I \nreported all my activities to the defense minister, Mr. Ivanov, and at \nleast mildly admonished him we ought to be beyond this. The whole idea \nof the Moscow Treaty should be a new relationship, a new trust between \nPresident Putin and our President Bush. And all of us on both sides \nneed to be fostering that.\n  So my response to the Senator from Illinois is to say that I think we \nare on the same side in pursuing congressional oversight, more vigor \nwith regard to everything we are now doing, although I think it is \nfully reported annually by the Department of Energy, quite apart from \nCTR, and with goals to go where we have not been; namely, tactical \nweapons and future destruction.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Am I right in my premise that this SORT treaty, this \nMoscow Treaty, does not destroy the nuclear warheads but simply calls \nfor them to be stored, set aside, not in a deployable mode, so they, \nfrankly, are at least within the grasp of either country to be \nreactivated? Is that accurate?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. The treaty does not call for the \ndestruction of warheads.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I also ask the Senator from Indiana, since we live in \nthe 21st century in fear that fissile material and nuclear weapons will \nbe transferred either openly or covertly to countries that will misuse \nthem, why would the Senator from Indiana believe that a verification \nprocedure which spotlights the location and number of these weapons in \nboth countries would not be in the best interest of reducing the \nlikelihood of proliferation?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would not disagree, in response to the distinguished \nSenator, that it would be ideal for this verification to occur, but I \nwould simply respond that although we have been negotiating such \nverification for some time, the Russians have not agreed to do this. In \nother words, one reason that is not in this treaty is the negotiators \nhave found resistance. I have found resistance. Other people have found \nresistance.\n  These things open up tediously, sort of one by one. For example, \nafter great pressure, I was taken on a small Russian aircraft to a \nplant where in fact\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nthere are warheads taken off of missiles, and they are stored almost \nlike bodies in coffins side by side, lined there. Each one had a \nhistory of when the warhead was built, when it was taken off of the \nmissile that would have conveyed it, when it was put there in storage, \nand some estimate as to its efficacy; that is, how long you can \nanticipate this warhead would actually be explosive. Much more ominous \ndown the trail and something that I am pursuing is some sort of \nprediction as to when it might become dangerous.\n  The difficulty--and the Senator knows this--is these warheads are \nunstable sometimes in terms of their chemical composition. They may not \nlie there in peace forever, like a sporting goods store situation of \ninert matter. That is the problem for the Russians. At some point they \nwill have to move the warheads. So they already have a railway station \nsecured. They have procedures because they know that at some stage they \nwill have to take the warhead out and disassemble it, a very dangerous \npredicament and one that then leads to problems of storage of the \nfissile material. So in another Nunn-Lugar program we are trying to \nwork on the storage facilities for thousands of these warheads because, \nfor the moment, there is not adequate storage for the fissile material \nitself after it is taken as plutonium or highly enriched uranium from \nthe warhead. The Russians would like to pursue that.\n  So we asked the logical question the Senator has asked: Why can't we \nwork together to verify where all these warheads are, what status they \nare in. We are interested in that. We don't want an accidental nuclear \nevent in Russia. And the Russians have been resistant, in the fullness \nof time perhaps less resistant, but I would just say, once again, that \nwas probably a bridge too far for this treaty. Our negotiators found \nthe Russians not to be prepared.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware that the amendment I offer calls on \nthe President to report to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \nCommittee on Armed Services of the Senate not later than 60 days after \nthe exchange of instruments of ratification, annually thereafter on \nApril 15, on the progress toward verification, and we go on to say that \nwe are seeking the same type of verification as in the START treaty, \nthe numbers of nuclear stockpiled weapons in the territories of the \nparties and the location and inventory of the facilities?\n  I ask the Senator from Indiana, if we have not reached the stage we \nwant to in verification, is it not of some value for this Senate to say \nas part of the agreement that we are going to ask this President, and \nany subsequent President affected by the treaty, to continue to report \non an annual basis to the Senate the progress that is being made to \nreach verification?\n  I would think that would have real value to spur this administration \non to keep negotiating, keep trying to reach agreement with the \nRussians. And absent that, I am afraid there would be a disincentive \nfor that sort of thing to occur. I ask the Senator if that is a \nreasonable interpretation of my own amendment.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I think it is a reasonable interpretation, I respond to \nthe Senator, but I would also say that in fact the President, at least \nthrough the Department of Defense, in the CDR report I have in front of \nme, is doing that each year. These are annual reports. Likewise the \nSecretary of Energy is making his own reports on the nuclear \naccountability issues. So it appears to me that generally the objective \nof the Senator is being fulfilled in current reports.\n  What is not being fulfilled and what the Senator and I both wish was \nbeing fulfilled is more progress toward the destruction of the warheads \nthemselves and more openness on the part of the Russians to what their \nproblem clearly is and one in which we could help if we had more \naccess. Before I got into this particular vault I am talking about, \nGeneral Habiger, who has been mentioned in this debate, was the last \nAmerican ever to get there. This is not openness or transparency. So \neven though property threat reduction brings a lot of Russians and \nAmericans together, there are areas in which we have not come together, \nthese bioweapons plants, the four of them, for example, and some of \nthese vaults that we have not seen.\n  Every year we are reporting, however, our deficiencies or our \ninability to reach agreement. It is a checkoff list with the Russians.\n  I say, on behalf of those who are in the field with the CDR, they \nwork at it all the time, working with their compatriots out in the \nhinterland of Russia to see what might open up this year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might say, by way of a question in closing so that \nwe don't prolong this debate, I hope the Senator from Indiana will view \nthis amendment as instructive and as friendly and not as adversarial to \nhis goals. I took heart from the statements he made in meetings I \nattended about the need for all of us to be more sensitized to the \nproblem of proliferation of nuclear weapons. What I am seeking to do is \nto get an ongoing relationship with the President and the Senate so \nthat we can continue to monitor the progress being made and the \nincentive is there for this President and any other President in the \nRussian Federation or the United States to continue to move forward on \nthis track so we can reduce the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  I ask my colleague from Indiana if he will consider this amendment I \nam offering in that light, as a positive, supportive effort, a friendly \neffort to add something that may be of value to the conversation.\n  Mr. LUGAR. In response to the Senator, of course, I see it in that \nlight. My only argument with the Senator today is that I do not believe \nit ought to be part of the treaty. I believe clearly the fulfillment is \nalready occurring in terms of the reporting, with considerable vigor, \nbut at the same time, as I have admitted to the Senator, the objectives \nwe both seek by getting the President to indicate energy and so forth \nalso requires the Russians to reciprocate. This particular treaty still \nhas to be ratified by the Duma. We have our own debate here, but they \nwill have theirs, too.\n  Senator Biden and I in our opening comments indicated we would resist \namendments simply because we believe we have at least in a very general \nway covered territory of what we ought to be doing in terms of \noversight but in ways that would not in any way be objectionable to the \nRussians who have to ratify the treaty and thus at least preserve the \nspirit in which Presidents Putin and Bush negotiated, admittedly, a \nlimited treaty. I would ask the Senator at least for his thoughts as to \nwhether he would be sufficiently assured by the vigor of my response to \nwithdraw the amendment, understanding that we will continue to pursue \nthese reports.\n  I will try to make available to Senators the CDR message if they do \nnot have it which really reviews in detail the gist of what the Senator \nis requesting. But beyond that, it is a pledge of vigor in proceeding \nwhere we have not been, these bridges too far that I have described \nthat are very important.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Indiana a followup question? \nWould the Senator be willing to join with me and perhaps Senator Biden \nin a letter to the administration relative to this verification \nprocedure, asking that the administration move forward to at least \nestablish on an informal basis a reporting with the Senate so we can \nsee the progress being made? I would consider that to be a step in this \ndirection which moves us to the same goal.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the Senator that I would be pleased to work \nwith the Senator on a letter which affirms, once again, the importance \nof the debate we are having, the interest of Members who are signing \nthe letter, but others literally in the subject matter of what we are \ntalking about who would acknowledge perhaps that some reports are being \nmade and maybe ask for more vigor in being more complete. I would like \nto work with the Senator in that project.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my colleague from Delaware, since I am taking his \nlanguage from the START treaty and have venerated it, deified it, given \nit all of the credence any Senator could ask, whether he would be kind \nenough to join me.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer is yes. I think what the Senator is attempting\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nto do is very important. Let me explain to the Senator my perspective, \nand to state the obvious--I may very well be wrong about this. But let \nme tell my colleague why I honestly think what Senator Lugar and I came \nup with is, quite frankly, more likely to get at what we need.\n  Condition 8 that has been referred to in the START treaty was a very \nnew and important idea when we enacted it 10 years ago. It led the \nClinton administration to use the Nunn-Lugar program to achieve a \nmeasure of transparency into the Russian fissile stockpiles in the mid-\n1990s.\n  In recent years, the United States has helped Russia to conduct a \ncensus of its civilian fissile material, but I doubt that either side \nis now prepared to allow access to the weapons stockpiles that are not \non the civilian side of this equation.\n  It would be my expectation that a report called for on the activities \npursuant to condition 8 to the START treaty resolution of ratification \nwould only tell us there are no negotiations toward a bilateral \nagreement, even though there are useful efforts underway on the Nunn-\nLugar related programs.\n  We already have a condition to the resolution before us that requires \nthe Nunn-Lugar report; in other words, progress on Nunn-Lugar \ninitiatives. We are required to have a report. While I will join the \nSenator in a letter, and I agree with what the Senator is trying to do, \nI honestly--not out of pride of authorship of what we came up with, but \nI honestly believe that what we did as a condition on the Nunn-Lugar \nprograms on this treaty is, quite frankly, more effective than going \nthe route of the condition 8 requirements in the START treaty. I hope I \nmade that clear.\n  Again, there is no disagreement I have with the Senator from \nIllinois. The bottom line is that what he has pointed out is, in my \nview, a real deficiency in this treaty overall. His legitimate attempt \nto take condition 8 of START and use it as a vehicle to stand in for \nthe absence of a verification requirement in this treaty is useful.\n  I honestly think, though, I say to Senator Durbin, the way we did it \nin the resolution is a more effective way of accomplishing what the \nSenator is trying to do than through condition 8 of the START treaty.\n  I will conclude by saying, as I said in a necessarily lengthy \nstatement laying out my interests, concerns, and the assets and \ndeficiencies of this treaty when the chairman brought it to the floor, \nthe treaty, as former Senator Sam Nunn said, in an overall context, can \neither be moderately helpful or it can be mischievous. I am \nparaphrasing.\n  The absence of a verification provision worries me not so much \nbecause I think we are going to be put in jeopardy if they do not do \nwhat they are supposed to do, but because it is going to allow a future \nadministration or Members of the Senate to do what they did when we had \na verbal agreement on tactical nuclear weapons in the first Bush \nadministration.\n  It is going to allow some of our friends on the right, who are not \ngoing to like it when things are not going so smoothly with Russia, to \nsay: See, these guys are liars. These guys do not keep their \nagreements. These guys are not doing what they said because we cannot \nverify that they have done what they said they were going to do.\n  It leads to distrust because there is always, as my friend from \nIllinois knows, whether in the House or the Senate--and he has been \nhere a long time--there is always a group in this body that trusts no \nagreement, none whatsoever, no arms control agreement, no matter how \nloosely structured.\n\n  As Senator Helms, my good friend and the predecessor of the Presiding \nOfficer, used to say: There is never a war we have lost or a treaty we \nhave won. So it is axiomatic on the part of some, in the very \nconservative elements of our party, but clearly in the Republican \nParty, who say all treaties are bad ideas, they are just bad ideas.\n  Absent verification provisions, we allow for misunderstanding to \ncreep in over the next 10 years to what is basically a good-faith \nagreement until December 31, 2012, the drop-dead date when we know what \nhas happened.\n  I wish to make one other point because I think it will affect other \nlegitimate points of view and amendments that are brought to the floor \nthat I would be inclined to support.\n  I remind everyone who may be listening--and I know my colleagues on \nthe floor fully understand this--the President started off with a flat \nassertion that this would not be a treaty, the Moscow agreement. As a \nmatter of fact, the day on which we had the police memorial service on \nThe Mall--and I am part of that process--I was up on the stage, and the \nPresident, who has a great sense of humor and is really an engaging \nguy, walked up on the stage, grabbed my arm, and said: You owe me one, \nJoe.\n  I looked at him joking and said: How is that, Mr. President?\n  He said: You got your treaty.\n  He was kidding about my owing him one. But the generic point was well \ntaken. He never wanted this to be a treaty in the first place. The \nSenator from Indiana--I will not say the Senator from Indiana--the \nSenator from Delaware was vocal, vociferous privately and publicly with \nthe President personally and on this floor that it had to be a treaty.\n  The backdrop to all of this is, in terms of additional conditions \nthat may or may not be added to this resolution, that if push comes to \nshove, I am convinced this President would not be disappointed if we \ndid not vote for this. Let me restate that--he would be disappointed if \nwe did not vote for it. But I am worried that, if certain amendments \nwere added that he did not like, I do not think he would have any \ntrouble saying, I would rather not have it as a treaty, and I will keep \nthe verbal agreement, the executive agreement with Mr. Putin, rather \nthan have it as a treaty and have to accept these conditions.\n  It is very important this stay as a treaty as--flawed is the wrong \nword--but as incomplete as it happens to be. The Senator--I am not \nbeing solicitous--points out a deep and serious deficiency in this \ntreaty, and I think the mechanism he chose to try to remedy it is, \nquite frankly, sound; but the remedy we chose to deal with the \ndeficiency I think is a more likely way to achieve what we are seeking \nthan condition 8 of the START treaty.\n  Having said all of that, I will be happy to join the Senator in a \nletter, as strong as he would like to make the letter. I have already \nsent a few missives down to the President on my views on some of these \nissues, for what they are worth. I would be happy to join the Senator \nand sign with him a letter along the lines he has been talking about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Madam President, because I am convinced of the genuineness and \ncommitment of both the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from \nDelaware to the issue of nonproliferation, of transparency in our \nagreement with any nation when it comes to nuclear weapons, I am going \nto defer to their judgment. But I will also add, were I to send a \nletter by myself, I am not sure what it might mean, but if they will \njoin me in this correspondence to the administration, I am certain it \nwill carry more weight and be a reminder that we are mindful of the \nneed for real verification, to make certain these nuclear weapons do \nnot end up in the wrong hands and, in fact, they are set aside so they \nwill not be a threat to any other nation.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 250, Withdrawn\n\n  For that reason, with the assurance of Senator Lugar, as well as \nSenator Biden, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I \nfiled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw the \namendment, and the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be allowed to proceed as in morning business for such \nperiod of time as he may require.\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may paraphrase Winston \nChurchill, the ``only thing worse than this treaty would be not having \nthis treaty at all.'' So I rise this afternoon in support of this \ntreaty--a good but ultimately insufficient treaty--and in support of my \ncolleagues' amendments to it.\n  I rise also to lend my voice to a related resolution that I drafted \nwith the minority leader and several of my colleagues, which enunciates \nthe beginnings of a coherent non-proliferation strategy.\n  A little over one decade ago we awoke to the sound of freedom. The \nBerlin Wall had fallen; brothers and sisters who had been kept forcibly \napart were able, once more, to take up the rights which are enshrined \nin our own Declaration of Independence, rights which we all too often \ntake for granted. The Soviet empire was no more. It was the beginning \nof a new era. The threat of nuclear war, at least between two great \nsuperpowers, had lifted. It soon became clear that the newest threat to \nour security, the increased chance of proliferation wrought by the fall \nof the Soviet empire, was perhaps an even greater challenge. The sword \nhad slipped from the giant's hand. We knew then and we know now, that \nwe had no choice but to take action and prevent those who would do us \nharm by picking the sword up again.\n  We in the Congress and our President acted with resolve. We moved to \nstrengthen international institutions and systems designed to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. And we were \nsuccessful. The nuclear capable states of the former Soviet Union, one \nby one, renounced the use and possession of nuclear weapons and \nreturned them to Russia. We had a few setbacks along the way, but \noverall we have managed to contain proliferation. But now I fear that \nthis President has lost his way, and is undoing the good progress of \nprevious administrations.\n  The fact is, the events of September 11, 2001 should be a rallying \ncry for non-proliferation--we can imagine all too well the results if \nthose who masterminded the attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon, had access to weapons of mass destruction. Yet since then, \nthe Bush administration has unwisely led our Nation and the \ninternational community down a meandering path of policy choices with \nonly one clear outcome: the increase of proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. In doing so, their choices have raised more questions \ninstead of settling them.\n  Why has the administration failed to engage North Korea, the prime \nproliferator of missiles and the greatest threat for immediate nuclear \nproliferation in direct talks?\n  Why has the President chosen to ignore the advice of General John \nShalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \ninstead actively pursued new uses for, and types of, nuclear weapons, \nwhen such action will erode the nuclear firebreak?\n  Why has the administration failed to meet the Baker-Cutler funding \nbenchmarks for nonproliferation and arms control programs?\n  Why has the administration failed to fully invest in the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram?\n  Where is the long-term strategy to diplomatically engage \nproliferating nations?\n  I agree with President Bush that ``history will judge harshly those \nwho saw this coming and failed to act.'' However, at a time when the \ninternational community needs leadership and guidance on this issue, \nthe administration is virtually silent. Too often on arms control and \nnon-proliferation, America has become a colossus that oscillates \nbetween pouting and shouting. In contrast, the resolution that my \ncolleagues and I are introducing today gives this nation a strong, \nclear, and constructive voice on these critical issues. Here and now we \ncall for the administration to rebuild the broad international \ncoalition against proliferation that it has permitted, and even \nencouraged, to deteriorate over the past two years. We call for the \nfull funding of all Federal non-proliferation and arms control programs \nto the levels prescribed by the Baker-Cutler report. We call for \nengaging North Korea in direct and full talks. We call for the \nexpansion of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program to include \nadditional states willing to engage in bilateral efforts to reduce \ntheir nuclear stockpiles. These would be acts of strength by the \nstrongest nation in the history of the world and they would be acts of \nwisdom because these acts would increase our security.\n  The bottom line: the United States must start now to rebuild the \ninternational community's consensus on stopping proliferation in its \ntracks. The measures outlined in our resolution will begin to do just \nthat.\n  On September 11, 2001, in a single fell blow, we learned just how \nvulnerable we may be if we do not act with foresight and urgency on \ncontaining weapons of mass destruction. Today, I believe everyone in \nthis chamber understands that we cannot speak of homeland security \nwithout addressing non-proliferation.\n  We cannot debate national security without including arms control. \nThis Nation requires a coherent non-proliferation policy, and a clear \nvoice on the matter in the international community. This resolution is \nthe start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise in support of the ratification of \nthe Moscow Treaty. I would like to begin by thanking Senators Lugar and \nBiden who have done very good work in this instance, and I believe they \nare going to provide very dynamic leadership on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in the Senate. These Senators have been working in this area \nfor many years.\n  I remember specifically the work of the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana after the dissolution of the Soviet Union as we had Russia and \nother countries grow out of that. We had the Nunn-Lugar legislation. \nQuite frankly, some of us were a little leery of how that program would \nwork and whether it was the right thing to do. But looking back on that \ntime in history, there is no question but that was a really dynamic \nleadership effort that needed to be made. It has been helpful. It has \nnot been perfect, of course. But I think it has helped our relationship \nwith Russia, and I think it has also helped to control the escape of \nand the misuse of some of those nuclear weapon capabilities. I want to \nrecognize Senator Lugar's past leadership in this area and thank him \nfor working to get this Moscow Treaty ready.\n  I had occasion last year to go to Russia, to St. Petersburg and \nMoscow, with a delegation of Senators to meet with foreign policy \nleaders, defense leaders, members from the Duma, members of the Russian \nFederation Council, and the chairman of the foreign relations committee \nthere in the Federation Council. It was very interesting and very \ninformative.\n  I believe there is a growing opportunity for the United States to \nhave a close working relationship with Russia. It has to be one of \ntruths. It has to be one that covers the entire sphere of not only \ntrusting each other when it comes to arms and treaties but also the \neconomy and trade, foreign policy, and international issues such as the \none we are working on right now.\n  We see today that the vote of Russia and what they do at the Security \nCouncil is going to be important as we prepare to deal with the \nsituation in Iraq. So we need to have a growing relationship and \nfriendship with this important country.\n  I think this treaty is a good one. It is one that certainly is \ntimely.\n  Russia's transformation to a market economy still faces a number of \nchallenges, obviously--its interests, and the people there. Also, the \nUnited States is working to get through problems. There are still \nproblems we are trying to deal with. But our strategic relationship \nwith Russia provides a strong foundation of cooperation on issues \nregarding nuclear weapons reduction and security.\n  Since 1992, the United States has spent over $3 billion in \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program funds to help Russia dismantle \nnuclear weapons and ensure the security of its nuclear weapons, \nweapons-grade fissile material, and other weapons of mass destruction. \nThis has been a very big program. It is one that I think has been very \nimportant.\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\n  In 1998, both countries agreed to share information upon detection of \na ballistic missile launch anywhere in the world and to reduce each \ncountry's stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium. As Russia and the \nUnited States continue to reduce the stockpile, we must stay vigilant \nin our collective effort to ensure that weapons-grade nuclear materials \nstay under lock and key. It is easy to say, but it is not a question of \njust turning the lock. There has to be an ongoing effort, there has to \nbe verification, and there has to be a lot of cooperation.\n  The Moscow treaty builds upon the spirit of cooperation between the \nUnited States and Russia. It serves the interests of both nations and \nboth peoples, and makes the world a safer place. The treaty is just one \nelement of a growing relationship between the U.S. and Russia that \nincludes several new opportunities for cooperation including trade, \nenergy, and economic development.\n  There has been some concern, noted by the opposition, that the Moscow \nTreaty is not substantive enough--that it is only 3 pages long--much \nshorter than the several hundred pages of the START treaty--that is \ndoesn't deal with actual warheads. First, we need to recognize that the \nMoscow Treaty does not take the place of the START treaty. The Moscow \nTreaty is separate from the START treaty--the START treaty is still in \nfull force and effect.\n  Perhaps more important than laying out comprehensive steps of \nreduction, these important three pages of the Moscow Treaty \nfundamentally approach Russia as a friend, not as an adversary. I \nbelieve that is a relationship that is going to grow and become more \nand more important in the years ahead.\n  This is a historic achievement. With the document we will be voting \non in the next day or two, both the United States and Russia will be \nmaking a commitment to reduce the quantity of operationally deployed \nwarheads. Undeniably, it is in the best interests of both of our \ncountries to destroy as many warheads as possible. Both sides continue \nto be challenged by warhead destruction in any given year because it is \na very complex process. It is not a matter of just using a bulldozer.\n  However, we must also not allow the complexity of the process to \nprevent us from our commitment to progress in this warhead reduction. \nAlthough not intended to be a detailed roadmap to accomplish that \nreduction, the Moscow Treaty lays out a high-level framework that is \nboth workable and flexible.\n  I am greatly encouraged by the level of developing cooperation \nbetween the United States and Russia that is embodied in this treaty. I \nam encouraged by the prospect now of having exchanges between leaders \nof the Duma and the Federation Council and leaders of the House and the \nSenate. I think it is important that we have those ongoing \nrelationships. Under the leadership of Senator Lugar and Senator Biden, \nI believe we will see that continue to develop.\n  By bringing forth the ratification of this treaty, I think it makes \ngood sense for our Nation. It is important for the future security of \nthe world, and I think it will help our friendship grow so that we will \nhave not an adversary, as we had for so many years, but a friend in \nRussia.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and endorse this treaty. I think it is \nan important signal of our feelings, and it is very important in a \ntimely sense also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if it is agreeable to the managers of \nthe bill, I would be pleased to address my remarks at this time to the \nimportant matter before the Senate--the treaty between the United \nStates of America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive \nReduction.\n  I rise to express my strong support for the ratification of the \ntreaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation \non Strategic Offensive Reduction, more commonly known as the Moscow \nTreaty.\n  In my career as a public servant, I have had a number of \nopportunities to work with the former Soviet Union and with the current \nRussian Federation.\n  I remember when I was Secretary of the Navy, I was asked to negotiate \nover a period of 2 years an executive agreement in the years 1970 to \n1972 between the United States of America and the then Soviet Union. \nThat executive agreement applied to the naval forces which I was \nprivileged to be associated with at that time as Secretary of the Navy. \nIt was a very important executive agreement. It is still in existence \ntoday. It has been used as a pattern for other nations for executive \nagreements between themselves and other countries. It related to how we \noperated our ships and aircraft in the international waters of the \nworld--operated them in a manner that provided the maximum degree of \nsafety to the vessel or aircraft itself and, of course, the crews who \noperated those platforms.\n  We had experienced, in those days, incidents not unlike the one \nprovoked by North Korea just days ago--where one of our aircraft, on a \nroutine mission, in international airspace, operating under clearances \ngiven by the international programmers of airspace--when we were \nbroached upon, as we use that phrase in the military, by North Korea's \nfighter aircraft. And, indeed, that broaching took the form of actions \nthat bordered on literally hostile actions, in my judgement. But time \nwill settle out that event.\n  I just mention this chapter of history as showing my support for the \npeople of Russia and the need for our two nations to work together. I \nstill look upon Russia as a superpower, certainly in the arena of \ndiplomacy, the arena of world economics. Indeed, I have profound \nrespect for their armed forces today, even though those armed forces \nare somewhat significantly reduced in size.\n  But against that background, I remember so well a number of trips to \nthe Soviet Union. I remember so well one with the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, when he put together a \ndelegation. We were the first Members of Congress to meet with then-\nPresident Gorbachev. It was a momentous day for all of us, having \ntraveled those long distances, and then waiting in the anteroom, and \nthen being escorted in to see that figure of history, a very important \nfigure of history for Russia. I have a lot of respect for President \nGorbachev.\n  I remember another codel with Robert Dole, again, leader of the \nSenate, as was Senator Byrd. We went to visit President Yeltsin. At \nthis time, I note, the delegations to visit President Putin certainly \nhave not been large in number. I am not so sure that is for the good of \nour two nations. I would hope that Russia might look more favorably \nupon delegations of the Senate to come and visit with their leaders of \ntoday.\n  In any event, I commend Senators Lugar and Biden for their leadership \non this issue. It has been exemplary. I think this Chamber can take \nrightful pride in each of those individuals--one the former chairman \nand one, of course, Senator Lugar, the current chairman of the \ndistinguished Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I certainly commend President Bush for his vision and leadership in \nnegotiating this treaty and establishing a new strategic relationship \nwith Russia. It is truly remarkable how our country's relations with \nRussia have evolved and deepened over the past 2 years. Groundbreaking \nU.S.-Russian cooperation on the war on terrorism has been critical to \nour success in Afghanistan and more broadly in our efforts to root out \nterrorism and deny terrorist groups safe havens and access to money and \ndestructive weapons.\n  On the subject of destructive weapons, the Nunn-Lugar program, I have \nhad a strong interest and support for that program from the very day it \nwas conceived. I remember Sam Nunn had a small breakfast and sat down. \nWhat an audacious concept. We stood there in awe, as the cold war was \nvery much in evidence in those days. But I think the bold foresight of \nSenators Nunn and Lugar to envision this program has reaped a great \ndeal of mutual benefit for both nations and, indeed, perhaps the world \nat large, to further limit the proliferation of not only weapons of \nmass destruction but the materials by which those weapons are made.\n  Equally remarkable is President Bush's success in implementing the \nbold vision he set forth in his May 2001 speech at the National Defense \nUniversity for a new strategic relationship with Russia. President Bush \ndecided to move the U.S.-Russian relationship beyond the cold war not \nincrementally,\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nbut in a bold leap. He articulated the controversial view that it would \nbe possible to pursue a vigorous missile defense program to respond to \nthe growing proliferation threats of the post-cold-war world, and at \nthe same time dramatically reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons in the \nU.S. and Russian arsenals.\n\n  President Bush set out to break the cold war linkage of restraints on \nmissile defense to reductions in nuclear weapons, and he did so in a \nway that caused no harm to U.S. relations with Russia. No harm--I would \nsay, indeed, it brought about a strengthening of those relations. This \nwas a remarkable accomplishment. There were many who thought it could \nnot be done. But their fears proved unfounded. President Bush deserves \nour respect and admiration for leading the world out of its \nconventional cold war mindset.\n  Russian President Putin shares in that credit. He, too, exercised \nadmirable vision and leadership when he understood and convinced \ndoubters in his own country that U.S.-Russian relations had evolved to \nthe point where the ABM Treaty was no longer critical to Russian \nsecurity. Because the United States and Russia no longer threatened \neach other, the ABM Treaty was no longer a necessary linchpin in \nregulating what used to be a U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race.\n  If I might just digress a minute, again, in my years of 1969 to 1974, \nbeing the Navy Secretary, and my early years in the Senate, when we \nexperienced so many periods of tension with regard to the cold war, \nthere was always an underlying theme, which I will describe as follows. \nI remember President Reagan used to say, ``Trust but verify''--a very \nmagical phrase that captured the relationship between our two nations. \nBut there was the feeling among the professional military who were \nresponsible for these awesome weapons of mass destruction--and I think \na feeling among those who negotiated, as did I in a very minor way on \nthe Incidents at Sea Agreement--that the bottom line, the Russian \nGovernment, the Russian military were always there with a measure of \nprudent, sensible realization of these weapons, and there was an \ninherent responsibility in all of those individuals, both in Russia and \nin the United States, and their respective Governments, to exercise \nthat judgment.\n  The concept of deterrence, the concept of massive retaliation always \nhad the underlying theme that individuals had sound judgment as to any \nfinal decision, and that sound judgment would be exercised.\n  That is not true today with Saddam Hussein. We cannot find, in the \nhistory of his dictatorship over Iraq, that level of sensible \nresponsibility as it relates to weapons of mass destruction. And I \nquestion whether that exists with North Korea today. I am not here to \nuse any words of condemnation, but underlying the cold war period was \nthat sense of some security with regard to the ability of those in \npossession of weapons to use good judgment, even in the times of the \ngreatest of tensions.\n  President Bush's readiness to negotiate a legally binding nuclear \nreduction agreement was instrumental in persuading President Putin that \nthe new strategic framework proposed by President Bush--including \nwithdrawal from the ABM Treaty--would serve Russian interests. The \nresult: A treaty that was negotiated in record-breaking time, will \nbring sweeping mutual reductions in deployed nuclear weapons, and will \nenhance the national security of both the United States and Russia.\n  The Moscow Treaty is unlike any treaty we have had before. It is the \nfirst arms control treaty to embrace the new Russian-U.S. strategic \nrelationship. In negotiating this treaty, both sides consciously \nrejected the cold war mentality of distrust and hostility that \npreviously had required lengthy negotiations and extensive legal \nstructures and detailed verification regimes to ensure that both sides \nwould abide by their treaty obligations.\n  This simplicity puts the focus where it belongs--quickly achieving \ndeep, equitable reductions in deployed nuclear weapons.\n  This breakthrough treaty will reduce the United States and Russian \nnuclear arsenals from their present levels of approximately 6,000 \nstrategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed \nstrategic nuclear warheads over the next decade. These reductions, \nwhich amount to about two-thirds of the warheads in the Russian-United \nStates arsenals, are the most dramatic in the history of arms control \nagreements. Such reductions are clearly in our national security \ninterest. Russia is no longer perceived, or in actuality, an enemy. Our \nstrategic arsenals, swollen by the cold war, no longer need to be \nsustained at such high levels.\n  Another great strength of this treaty is the flexibility it accords \nour leaders to meet the uncertainties both in the international \nsecurity environment and in the technological status of our nuclear \nstockpile. September 11 was a vivid reminder that we are vulnerable to \nattack in ways we never imagined. It is critical to our national \nsecurity that our leaders retain the maximum flexibility to respond to \nemerging threats and changes on the world scene.\n  The witnesses who testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee during our committee's review of the military implications of \nthe treaty unanimously supported ratification of the Moscow Treaty. \nGeneral Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:\n\n       The members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I all support \n     the Moscow Treaty. We believe it provides for the long-term \n     security interests of our nation. We also believe that it \n     preserves our flexibility in an uncertain strategic \n     environment.\n\n  Throughout its history, the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nplayed a critical role in assessing the national security impact and \nmilitary implications of arms control agreements negotiated by the \nexecutive branch. Based on the hearings conducted by the Armed Services \nCommittee and subsequent analysis, I am convinced that the Moscow \nTreaty advances the national security interests of the United States \nand deserves the Senate's unqualified support.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join all of us in giving our advice \nand consent favorably to ratification of the Moscow Treaty.\n  Mr. President, I see others about to address the Senate. I am happy \nto yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, the senior Senator, who is a gentleman. The old saying is: \n``He is a gentleman and a scholar.'' I have known him and worked with \nhim, confided in him and with him for these many years. I cherish his \nfriendship.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank him for those remarks. I made reference to my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia moments ago in addressing \nthis treaty and recalled when he led a delegation of which I was \nprivileged to be a member----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER [continuing]. To meet with President Gorbachev. I remember \nthat day as if it were yesterday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And President Gorbachev said, we have this amount of \ntime. And you very graciously, as the leader of the delegation--Senator \nThurmond was with us as well----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Anyway, it was a brilliant dissertation between yourself \nand at that time President Gorbachev, and it was a historic meeting. I \nsaid on the floor moments ago, I only wish we could do more of that \nwith President Putin because I felt those delegations--I went on two \ndelegations to the Soviet Union with the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. They were very meaningful and helpful.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I believe on that occasion former Senator Sam Nunn was \nwith us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. The Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Pell.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. And Senator Mitchell.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Mitchell, Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. It was a fine delegation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, it was, but it was under your leadership. You were \nthe first Member of Congress to go and meet with President Gorbachev.\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. That was the first Senate delegation to go and meet with \nhim, yes, it was.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for remembering that occasion.\n\n\n                              north korea\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while the United States continues its \nrelentless march to war against Iraq, a crisis that is potentially far \nmore perilous is rapidly unfolding halfway around the world on the \nKorean peninsula.\n  While Saddam Hussein hunkers down in Baghdad, under the thumb of the \nUnited Nations weapons inspectors, and is being forced to begin \ndestroying some of his most prized missiles, North Korean leader Kim \nJong II is aggressively taunting the United States and moving full \nspeed ahead toward restarting his nuclear weapons program.\n  Over this past weekend, the North Koreans took their defiance and \ncontempt of the United States to a new level when four North Korean \nfighter jets intercepted an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane in \ninternational airspace over the Sea of Japan.\n  According to news reports, the armed North Korean jets came within 50 \nfeet of the American plane and shadowed it for 22 minutes. Initial \nreports suggest that one of the North Korean pilots may have engaged \nhis radar in preparation for firing an air-to-air missile moments \nbefore the U.S. aircraft aborted its mission and returned safely to its \nhome base in Kadena, Japan.\n  This latest action by North Korea is a marked escalation of the \nrecent tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Not since it shot \ndown an unarmed U.S. surveillance plane in 1969--more than 30 years \nago--has North Korea engaged in aerial confrontation with the United \nStates. That last weekend's provocation by the North Koreans ended \nwithout incident is a relief, but it is not a reprieve from concern. \nGiven the hostility and volatility of the North Korean government, this \nlatest confrontation could easily have ended in disaster--a major \ndisaster.\n  The White House branded North Korea's actions as ``reckless \nbehavior,'' and the Pentagon promptly dispatched 24 long-range bombers \nto Guam in a move that was seen by some as a not-so-subtle warning to \nKim Jong Il that a military response to North Korea's increasing \nbellicosity is not outside the realm of possibility. But the President \nhas given no indication that he is willing to address the North Korean \ncrisis head-on by engaging North Korea diplomatically in an effort to \ndefuse tensions. To the contrary, the White House appears determined to \ncontinue to proceed in its no-talk policy toward North Korea while it \nfocuses the vast weight of its energy and resources on preparing for \nwar with Iraq.\n  I am increasingly alarmed that this administration's military and \ndiplomatic fixation on waging war with Iraq is serving to overshadow \nand possibly eclipse the mounting crisis in North Korea.\n  Benign neglect is a dangerous policy to apply to North Korea. The \nnation is isolated and its people are starving. Kim Jong Il is hostile, \nerratic, and desperate for cash. He is also armed and heavily \nfortified. In open testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \non February 12, CIA Director George Tenet noted that ``the United \nStates faces a near-term ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) \nthreat from North Korea.''\n  According to intelligence estimates, North Korea already has one to \ntwo nuclear weapons and continues to develop the Taepo Dong-2 missile, \nwhich has the capability of reaching the United States with a nuclear-\nweapon-sized payload.\n  Recent relations between the United States and North Korea were far \nfrom good to begin with, but since October, when it was revealed that \nNorth Korea had a secret program to produce enriched uranium, the \nresulting nuclear standoff between the United States and North Korea \nhas gone from bad to worse.\n  In a period of just over 4 months, North Korea has moved swiftly and \nboldly to take the necessary steps to resume the production of nuclear \nweapons. Following the disclosure of its covert nuclear program in \nOctober, North Korea in December expelled U.N. inspectors from its \nnuclear facilities at Yongbyon, removed U.N. monitoring seals and \ncameras, and announced it would reactivate the facilities. In January, \na month before last, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and appeared to begin moving its \nstockpile of nuclear fuel rods out of storage. Just last week, on \nFebruary 27, American intelligence sources concluded that North Korea \nhad, indeed, reactivated the Yongbyon facility. The significance of \nstarting up the reactor is that it could, over time, provide a \ncontinuing source of plutonium for nuclear weapons, which North Korea \ncould either stockpile or sell. If North Korea also begins reprocessing \nits nuclear fuel rods, some U.S. intelligence officials have concluded \nthat it could begin producing bomb-grade plutonium within a matter of \nweeks, a process that could yield enough plutonium for five to seven \nbombs by this summer.\n  In other words, North Korea could begin grinding out the essential \ncomponents of nuclear weapons for its own use or for sale to the \nhighest bidder even before the first volley is fired in Iraq.\n  At the same time that it has been ratcheting up its nuclear activity, \nNorth Korea has also been ratcheting up its rhetoric and its military \nsaber-rattling. In February, a North Korean MiG fighter jet crossed \nbriefly into South Korean air space for the first time in 20 years. On \nFebruary 24, North Korea rattled the inauguration of South Korea's new \npresident by test firing an anti-ship missile into the sea. Earlier, \nNorth Korea threatened to abandon the armistice that ended the Korean \nWar.\n  And just this week on March 3, Kim Jong Il warned that nuclear war \ncould break out if the U.S. Government attacks North Korea's nuclear \nprogram, while President Bush explicitly raised the possibility of \nusing military force against North Korea as a ``last resort'' if \ndiplomacy fails.\n  The pattern of increasingly hostile words and actions on the part of \nNorth Korea, coupled with the moves it appears to be taking toward \nbuilding up its nuclear arsenal, make North Korea one of the most \nvolatile and dangerous spots on Earth today. The Bush Administration's \ninattention to the problem and its unwillingness to engage in diplomacy \nwith North Korea are only exacerbating an already precarious situation.\n  Under the circumstances, North Korea presents a far more imminent \nthreat than Iraq to the security of the United States. It is ironic \nthat the President has made it clear that a military response to the \ncrisis in North Korea would be considered only as a last resort at the \nsame time that he is massing forces in the Persian Gulf region to \nlaunch a preemptive military strike, possibly within a matter of weeks, \nif not days, against a much less potent threat to the United States.\n  What is particularly frustrating is that the North Korean crisis \nmight never have reached the proportions it has reached had President \nBush taken a different tack with respect to North Korea when he came \ninto office. Today's nuclear standoff with North Korea is, in many \nways, a replay of a similar crisis in 1994, when North Korea pushed the \nenvelope on its nuclear program, nearly precipitating a military \nresponse from the United States. That crisis was resolved when the \nClinton administration reached an agreement, called the Agreed \nFramework, to freeze nuclear production in North Korea in exchange for \nfuel oil and light-water reactors. Unfortunately, when he took office, \nPresident Bush put relations with North Korea in the deep freeze by \nheaping suspicion and disdain on the North Korean Government, branding \nKim Jong Il a ``pygmy'' and including North Korea in the ``axis of \nevil.''\n\n  Even so, the current crisis might well have been defused weeks ago, \nbefore the two leaders started exchanging threats of war, had the \nUnited States agreed to talk directly to North Korea, as our allies in \nthe region have been pleading with us to do. Instead, the \nadministration drew a line in the sand, insisting that the United \nStates would not be blackmailed into one-on-one talks with North Korea. \nAs a result, the Americans and the North Koreans have been talking past \none another for the past 4 months, and the progress has been all \ndownhill.\n  It has come to the point that, whether by accident or design, the \nsituation in North Korea could rapidly disintegrate from a war of words \nand gestures\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\ninto a war of bullets and bombs perhaps even nuclear bombs. As it \nstands now, North Korea has shown no evidence that it is willing to \nback down from its nuclear confrontation with the United States, and \nthe United States has shown no evidence that it is willing to talk to \nNorth Korea.\n  Stalemate and neglect are not effective tools of foreign policy. \nWishful thinking is not an effective tool of foreign policy. The \nsituation in North Korea is a crisis, and the United States must come \nto grips with it. We must open a dialog with North Korea.\n  To ignore the peril presented by North Korea and its nuclear \nambitions is to court--to court--disaster.\n  Frankly, the longer the United States procrastinates and lets North \nKorea set the agenda, the harder it will be to deal with the situation \ndiplomatically. If we do not act quickly, we may inadvertently paint \nourselves into a corner as we have done in Iraq.\n  It does not have to be that way. It is time for both nations to stop \nposturing and start talking. It is time for the United States to deal \nwith the crisis in North Korea. I call on this administration to \naddress the growing peril in North Korea, and to fully engage in a \ndiplomatic effort to resolve what may well become an international \nproblem of epic proportions. We can, and must, be firm, but we cannot \nremain aloof. We can, and should, insist that other nations with a \nstake in the future of North Korea be at the table, including China, \nRussia, Japan, and South Korea, but we can wait no longer for those \nnations to take the lead.\n  The situation in North Korea is serious, but it is not yet desperate. \nThe window to initiate diplomacy is not yet closed, but the longer the \nUnited States drags its feet, the narrower that window becomes. It is \ntime to start talking to the North Koreans. If the United States takes \nthe lead, our allies in the region are likely to follow. But it is the \nUnited States that must lead the way. The only practical way to solve \nthe crisis in North Korea, before it erupts into chaos, is with \npatience, skill, and determination at the negotiating table. Let us \nbegin now, before it is too late.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator entertain a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, over my years in the Senate, I have had \nthe privilege many times of working with my distinguished colleague. I \nhave listened very carefully to his remarks. The bulk of the facts the \nSenator relates with regard to how North Korea has violated the \nframework agreement are accurate. I think his assessment of the \npotential threat as to how they address the serious issue of nuclear \nweapons is correct. But I respectfully say I believe this \nadministration has been pursuing a policy--now my colleague may \ndiffer--of diplomacy to resolve this dispute. Our President recognizes \nthe seriousness.\n  As the Senator said, the bombers were promptly dispatched. My \nunderstanding was that that mission of those bombers had been in the \nplanning for some time and, coincidentally, they were dispatched right \nafter the eve of this very serious incident by which the hostile \naircraft broached our unarmed aircraft. The Senator was dead accurate \nin his characterization of that serious incident.\n  The point I wish to make is that I think our President has taken the \ncorrect tack at this time in diplomacy of saying that there may come a \ntime in the future on bilateral talks, but at this juncture of this \nserious situation--and our President fully recognizes and I think \nshares with my colleague from West Virginia the seriousness of it--the \nmultilateral approach; namely, that the talk should initiate with a \ntable at which Russia, of course, South Korea, Japan, and China are \nthere to participate. That is the way this administration quite \nappropriately desires to approach it.\n  I believe Secretary of State Powell, in his most recent trip to the \nregion not more than 10 days to 2 weeks ago, clearly said that out of \nthat multilateral approach could evolve the situation whereby bilateral \ntalks between the United States and North Korea would follow.\n  Am I correct in my summary of how the President is approaching this? \nThe Senator may have differences with it, but at least for the basis of \nour debate, I think I am correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have clearly not had the opportunity to fully exhaust \nthe potential of a preliminary round of multinational talks such that \nthese nations believe they are a partner with the United States. Now we \nmay take the lead, but so often our Nation is criticized that we are \nthe ones who are saying, you do this, you do that. Rather, in this \ncrisis I think our country is saying that we want to work together with \nother nations as partners in addressing this issue before the \npossibility of bilateral talks.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think that is a good approach normally, if there is time \nand if there is an indication that those other nations are going to \ntake that lead. That is one thing. But there is not time here. There is \nnot the indication that the other nations are going to take that lead.\n  So I say we need to act more expeditiously. I do not think we can \nafford to wait. This is a crisis that is developing, and developing \nquickly, and there is every indication that if we continue to wait, Kim \nJong Il is going to take additional steps. I understand he may have one \nor two nuclear weapons now, and he is fast getting into the position \nwhere he will be able to manufacture a weapon a month and then faster. \nWe do not have the luxury of waiting until these other nations finally \ndecide they want to do this.\n\n  They seem to be reluctant. They have not shown any dexterity in \nmoving in to fill this void up to now. I do not think we can afford to \nwait.\n  In addition, yes, other nations have thought we acted too fast. They \nhave done that in spades with respect to Iraq. We have gone hellbent \ninto that. It seems the President has been determined to conduct a war \nin Iraq from the beginning almost. I would say as far back as last \nAugust he had said there were no plans. That was the response we \nreceived from all of the people in the administration. I know once \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, Secretary of State Powell, in \nanswer to a question from me, said: There are no plans.\n  The administration and its functionaries must have taken Members of \nCongress as fools when the administration continued to at that time \nsay, well, the President has no plans. Anybody could see through that. \nHe may not have plans today. He may not have plans on his desk. That \nwas the way it was phrased: He had no plans on his desk. It takes only \na fool not to be able to see through that. Perhaps he does not have \nplans on his desk, but there may be plans on some other desk somewhere \nthat the President knows about, or the President may have plans \ntomorrow. He is certainly not immune to knowledge of what is going on \nall around him. After all, he is the Commander in Chief, the top man in \nthe executive branch; he is supposed to know what is going on.\n  So while we were fed that line by the administration, they simply did \nnot want to tell us, and they do not want to tell us yet. It is not \nthat they do not want to--that other nations have a right to complain \nabout this administration moving pellmell into a situation without \nwaiting for other nations, without wanting to wait for other nations. \nNot only that, but the administration treats us the same way in the \nCongress.\n  The administration does not want to tell us what the cost of this was \nis going to be. They say it is such a range of costs that it might \nchange from day to day. They do not want to say what it will be now \nbecause, who knows, maybe tomorrow it will be different. Well, of \ncourse, that is to be expected. But I think the administration ought to \nbe honest, upfront, and sincere with the elected representatives of the \npeople in Congress, and say now this is the situation today, Senator, \nas we see it. We think the range would be somewhere between A and B. \nThat can change, Senator. Mr. Chairman, that can change. It can change \ntomorrow. But as of today, we cannot pinpoint the exact figure, but it \nwould appear that it would be thus and so.\n\n  Now, if the war lasts longer than a week, lasts longer than 2 weeks, \n10 days, or 3 weeks, it may cost more. Of course, if we win the war, \nand win it quickly, it will not cost much. But then there is the \nproblem of the morning after. What is the cost going to be\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nin helping to rebuild Iraq? If we are going to be responsible for \ndestroying a great portion of it, we have a responsibility of \nrebuilding it. So, the cost would be, the estimate would be, thus and \nso.\n  If the administration would come before the Appropriations Committee \nand address it like that--we understand that any administration would \nfind it difficult; it would be impossible to be sure as to what the \ncosts would be. But if an administration sits down with the \ncongressional committee and says: Here is the situation; we estimate it \nto be thus and so, because we think the war will not last more than a \nweek, or 10 days, or 2 weeks, or a month; if it lasts longer, it will \ncost more--that is being honest and forthright with the elected \nrepresentatives of the people. We understand that. We were not born \nyesterday. But to just say, ``We do not know exactly,'' what does the \nadministration think that Members of Congress are fools?\n  We can see all that. We know all that. We know these things are \ndifficult to figure. But when we also know that estimates are being \nkicked around internally, we believe we are entitled, on behalf of the \npeople, to know what those estimates are.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might reply to my good friend, first \non the issue of diplomacy, I do believe our President has worked very \nhard with the Prime Minister of Great Britain and other heads of state \nof the nations willing to proceed on the diplomatic route.\n  Today we had a speech by the Secretary of State. I don't know if my \ncolleagues had an opportunity to read it as I have. But it clearly says \nwe are on a diplomatic course. No decision has been made to go to war.\n  What little success the diplomats have had to date--and I frankly \nthink Resolution 1441 was a high water mark of this whole controversy--\nis owing to the fact that this President had the courage to put our \ntroops in forward deployments to back up the words of the diplomats and \nto send a signal to Saddam Hussein and others that we have a commitment \nto those men and women there, 200,000 of them in that gulf region. I \nvisited the gulf region just 10 days ago. They are there as a symbol of \nour commitment to make diplomacy work.\n  I recognize the Senator and I were with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nthe other day when my good friend from West Virginia expressed, as he \nhas done now, the question of cost estimates. But the Secretary of \nDefense said he believed at this time he could not give those \nprojections which would enable, I think, some very serious and finite \nparameters to be established.\n  My good friend might recall President Clinton one time--I am not here \nto be political--said about the Balkans, we would be home in a year. I \nthink the Senator remembers that because he and I collaborated on an \namendment to require the other nations to come forward with their \nallocation of commitments to try to resolve some of the problems in \nthat region. I remember we stood toe to toe on that.\n\n  Here we are, 8 years later, and we are still in the Balkans with a \nnot insignificant force. We have learned from that and experienced the \nneed to exercise caution with regard to the questions of casualities. \nHow well I remember being in the Chamber in 1991. The projected \ncasualities we might encounter in the gulf war of 1991 were in the \nestimates of the tens of thousands. We thank the dear Lord that it did \nnot in any way near approach that amount, although this country did \nlose brave soldiers, sailors, and airmen, and experienced the wounding \nof others in that very important conflict.\n  The better side of prudence is being demonstrated here by the \nPresident and his Secretaries who are entrusted with dealing with the \nCongress. I printed in the Record earlier today, I say to my good \nfriend, a recitation of a number of hearings the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, on which I am privileged to say my colleague serves, has \nconducted. That committee has, in connection with our debates on Iraq, \nheld a number of briefings and so forth, in which I have been in \nattendance, on Iraq. Those are helpful for the public in its important \ndebate now, and which I respect the diversity of opinions on Iraq, as I \nrespect the opinions of my colleague from West Virginia. Nevertheless, \nI think our Senate has taken a constructive role in addressing that \nconflict.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I think we are going pretty far from the subject that I started out \nwith today. I was talking about the fact that we are not paying the \nkind of attention that should be paid; we are not addressing the real \ncrisis that is developing. We are not looking at the real peril that is \nfacing this country; namely, North Korea. We are being distracted by \nthe developing situation in Iraq, which, as far as I am concerned, does \nnot present to this country anything near the peril, the danger, that \nwe are confronted with in North Korea.\n  Now, if the distinguished Senator wishes to engage in a freewheeling \ndebate on the whole subject matter, fine, we will do that another day. \nBut I am addressing the Senate on the need to open talks with North \nKorea and not wait for other nations to take the lead. We need to take \nthe lead ourselves. Every day counts. Every 24 hours counts. We are \nalready seeing this situation advance quickly. As long as Kim Jong II \nthinks we are going to be distracted with Iraq, he is likely to take \nfurther advantage of the situation. That is the issue I am addressing.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. We did start out on that subject, \nbut I wished to make reference to other statements the Senator made.\n  Going back to the question of Korea, I think your concerns are \nimportant, as are mine. I simply say I think our President is \nvigorously trying to exercise leadership in world diplomacy with a \nmultilateral approach with the nations of Russia, China, South Korea, \nand Japan at this point, and I have not read into any of the statements \nor actions that would say that after the full exploration of the \nmultilateral approach, hopefully participation by those nations as \npartners, possibly of a bilateral approach--indeed, the Secretary of \nState has made an offering of food to care for the tragic situation of \nstarvation in the North Korean section of that peninsula.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I hope the President \nwill display this kind of desire to engage in multilateralism more so \nthan he has with respect to Iraq. This is the approach I favored all \nalong. We should get the United Nations, be sure the opinion of the \nworld is with us in Iraq, and get the support of the United Nations.\n  I have a resolution I introduced some time ago urging we seek a \nsecond U.N. resolution. If the President would show more interest in a \nmultilateral approach to that situation, I think many would feel \nbetter. I recall his saying, I think, to the U.N.: If you don't do it, \nwe will. If the U.N. doesn't do this, I will--or we will.\n  That kind of an attitude has not been to my liking, certainly, and it \ndoes not show enough concern about the opinions of other nations, and \nit does not show enough desire to have the support of other \nnations. But this President is determined, apparently, to have a war in \nIraq, even if he has to go it alone. That has been the impression I \nreceived thus far. When he says to the U.N., if you don't do it, I \nwill, or we will, that doesn't show any great inclination to wait on \nother nations to help join in that situation.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we have somewhat debated this \nissue. I believe the President has made strong overtures to the \ninternational community. Certainly he gave a brilliant speech in the \nU.N. He is working within the Security Council. Our Secretary of State \nhas addressed the issue today. Perhaps at another time I would very \nmuch be privileged to engage our distinguished colleague in a debate on \nthe subject. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I think \nwe certainly need, more and more, to debate this situation. I think we \nhave not debated it enough. I believe that where we missed the boat was \nlast fall when this Congress turned over to the executive branch the \nauthority, by a resolution, virtually to declare war. I think Congress \nwas wrong in doing that. I voted against that resolution. I am proud of \nthe vote that I cast at that point. I think Congress, under the \nConstitution, has the authority to declare war, and I think we shift \naside our responsibilities and our duties under the Constitution when \nwe attempt to shift\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nthat duty and that responsibility and that authority over to the Chief \nExecutive of the United States.\n  The time for debate was then. It is not too late to debate it now. I \nhave been attempting to say a good bit from time to time on this \nmatter, and will continue to, if we have much time left. But time is \nclosing in on us, as I see our troops massing on the borders of Iraq. I \ndon't think there is much time left to debate. But as long as that time \nremains, I think we ought to utilize it. We ought to tell the American \npeople what their losses are going to be and what the cost is going to \nbe to them.\n  That is where I think the administration is falling down. It ought to \nlet the American people know the sacrifices they may have to make and \nwhat the cost of this war is going to be in terms of money, in terms of \nlives, and in terms of our image before the world--what it is costing \nus there. So let's have more from the administration on this point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say in conclusion, to those who \nperhaps take views different from I and others, I hope that debate \nwould include very clearly a message to Saddam Hussein in Iraq that his \nlack of cooperation is the root cause of the problem today.\n  So I thank my colleague for this opportunity. Maybe at a later date \nwe can get into a further discussion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course there are always two sides to issues. Preston \nCounty, WV, is a great buckwheat flour-growing area. They make fine \nbuckwheat cakes. But there is no buckwheat cake so thin that there \nisn't two sides to it. So there are two sides.\n  It seems to me we have just been recreant in not telling the American \npeople what this is going to cost. I have a feeling they don't know \nvery much, from the lack of debate that has gone forward, and from the \nfact that this administration has not come forward with the facts and \ntold the American people what the cost may be to them. And all the \nwhile we see our young men and women being shipped out, as the National \nGuard goes forth and takes our schoolteachers, our policemen, our \nfirefighters, our lawyers, and our churchmen. It takes people from all \nwalks of life and sends them overseas--for how long we do not know. We \ndon't know. They don't know what the duration will be. They don't know \nwhether they will come back, of course. And I am sure their salaries \nare suffering when they go over as National Guardsmen.\n\n  The people are entitled to know more than this administration has \nbeen willing to tell them. So I hope the Senator will join me in urging \nthe administration to come forward with the facts and tell the American \npeople, his constituents and mine, what they may have to pay.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share those concerns. My State has \nlikewise contributed many reservists and guardsmen. As a matter of \nfact, I have been working with colleagues today on a question relating \nto that.\n  Were it not for the sacrifices of those individuals, the reservists, \nactive duty, and many others, we would not be where we are trying to \nsolve this problem diplomatically.\n  Say what you want about this President, I have seen a measure of \ncourage in this fine man that I have not seen in others. He has all \nalong said: The buck stops on my desk, and I accept responsibility.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to the Senator, courage is fine. I don't think the \nPresident lacks courage. Nobody is questioning his courage. But whether \nhe has wisdom or vision or exercises good judgment along with courage \nis something else. I am simply saying this administration has not been \nforthright with the American people and has not been forthright with \nthe Congress. We can debate that as long as you wish, but that is the \nway I see it. At some future time, if the distinguished Senator wishes \nto debate that, I will be happy to accommodate him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I accept that challenge. I thank my \nfriend.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I acknowledge my friend, the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, who is in the Chamber.\n  Today the Senate is engaged in an important and historic debate on \nthe Moscow Treaty. President Bush and President Putin signed the Moscow \nTreaty on May 24, 2002, to limit strategic offensive nuclear weapons. \nUnlike arms control treaties of the past, this treaty does not include \ndefinitions of terms, counting rules, elimination procedures, or \nmonitoring and verification provisions--all conditions considered in \nthe past as essential to an effective agreement. As President Reagan \nonce said, ``trust but verify.''\n  The administration believes that the lack of these features is an \nasset and indicative of a new age in American-Russian relations. In the \nwords of President Bush, it is time that the United States ``complete \nthe work of changing our relationship from one based on nuclear balance \nof terror to one based on common responsibilities and common \ninterests.''\n  The treaty reflects American and Russian intent to reduce strategic \nnuclear warheads to between 1,700 to 2,200 by December 31, 2012. Each \nparty is free to define for itself its ``strategic nuclear warheads'' \nand to determine how to reduce them. The treaty does not provide for \nthe destruction of warheads or delivery systems. Nor does it place any \nrestrictions on either party's force structure over the next ten years. \nBoth sides can keep warheads for testing, spare parts, and possible \nredeployment.\n  The administration plans to meet treaty requirements by moving an \nundefined number of warheads to a reserved force, some to storage, and \ndismantling others. The Russians will make similar force structure \nchanges. Russia intends to continue to reduce weapon platforms and \nwarhead levels and dismantle weapon systems with U.S. assistance under \nthe important Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n  However, the Moscow Treaty leaves many issues unresolved and many \nquestions unanswered. For example, Article I of the treaty specifies \nthat each party shall ``determine for itself the composition and \nstructure of its strategic offensive arms.''\n  The United States has defined this to be ``operationally deployed \nstrategic nuclear warheads,'' and has defined operationally deployed to \nmean ``reentry vehicles on intercontinental ballistic missiles in their \nlaunchers, reentry vehicles on submarine-launched ballistic missiles in \ntheir launchers onboard submarines, and nuclear armaments loaded on \nheavy bombers or stored in weapons storage areas of heavy bomber \nbases.''\n  Congress will have to wait to see how many warheads are destroyed and \nstored. Likewise, we will have to wait to see how Russia defines \n``strategic offensive arms.'' Russia may move to redeploy multiple \nindependently-targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs.\n  Article II of the treaty states that the Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty, START, will remain in force. During the signing of the Joint \nDeclaration, Presidents Bush and Putin stated that the provisions of \nSTART ``will provide the foundation for providing confidence, \ntransparency, and predictability in further strategic offensive \nreductions.''\n  But START expires in 2009. If START is not extended, we do not know \nhow the parties will provide confidence and transparency between 2009 \nand 2012.\n  Article III of the treaty establishes a Bilateral Implementation \nCommission but does not establish guidelines, procedures, or even \nresponsibilities of the Commission. We do not know if the Commission \nwill focus on monitoring and verification of agreed reductions.\n  When President Bush signed the Moscow Treaty nearly a year ago, he \nassured the American people that he would continue to work on a \nseparate political declaration that would create a strategic framework \nfor the United States and Russia.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  This document was to be broader in scope and would address other \nsecurity and arms control issues aside from strategic reduction, \nincluding non-proliferation, counter-proliferation, anti-terrorism, and \nmissile defenses. We have yet to receive that document.\n  We need a better vision and a better strategy of how to make America \nsafer and more secure from attack with weapons of mass destruction.\n  I fear that the President is moving us toward a world of greater \ninsecurity besieged by fears of nuclear weapons proliferation. Today's \nWashington Post indicates that the administration is willing to accept \na North Korea with nuclear weapons. This is astounding, and, if true, \nthreatens stability in northeast Asia. In addition, the administration \nhas sought funding for new battlefield nuclear weapons that are more \n``useable.''\n  Until now, U.S. non-proliferation policy has been based on reducing \nthe number of nuclear weapons states, controlling the spread of nuclear \nweapons technology, and eliminating nuclear weapons. We need to prevent \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction and establish with the rest \nof the world a system that deters both countries and terrorist groups \nfrom gaining access to these dangerous technologies.\n  The resolution intended to be introduced by Senator Daschle and \nothers, which I am proud to cosponsor, lays out the type of \ncomprehensive non-proliferation policy that we need to make the world a \nsafer place for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support it, \nand I urge the administration to adopt its recommendations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to address the \nSenate on the treaty being considered for ratification, the Moscow \nTreaty. I want to praise the hard work of our chairman, Senator Lugar, \nand the ranking member, Senator Biden, and their staffs, for the \ndiligent efforts on this treaty. Their hard work on this treaty will \nultimately enhance U.S. security.\n  This treaty describes what both the United States and Russia hope to \ndo in a new era, and that is to reduce our respective strategic \noffensive nuclear weapons stockpile and to reduce it quite \ndramatically. Considering how strategic nuclear weapons policy has \nchanged since the time I first came to Capitol Hill, to the House of \nRepresentatives, way back in 1978, this new Moscow Treaty is a \nsignificant accomplishment but one that failed to maximize the \nopportunity to provide the world with the real destruction of weapons. \nIt is clearly a major step in the right direction, but I do not think \nit has gone far enough.\n  During this debate today, we have heard about the weaknesses of this \ntreaty, and there are some. I regret, for example, that the treaty \nmerely de-alerts nuclear weapons. It does not require their \ndestruction.\n  The treaty also is weak in its timetable for reaching the lowering of \nthe target inventories, the inventories of warheads on top of the \nICBMs. The treaty brings the target down from multiples of thousands to \na range between 1,700 and 2,200 weapons. But it does not offer a \nspecific timetable for how that will occur over these next several \nyears. I believe we can remove these weapons more rapidly, and I hope \nthe administration will do so.\n  I also regret the treaty does not address tactical nuclear weapons, \nnor does it include verification procedures beyond those of the START I \ntreaty.\n  I remember when I was in the House of Representatives at the time \nPresident Reagan was President, he kept saying over and over: ``Trust \nbut verify.'' I think we could have some more of that in this treaty.\n  Despite all of those weaknesses, reductions in our strategic \noffensive weapons are appropriate, and are a major step in the right \ndirection. Our relationship with Russia has evolved into an important \npartnership, and we hope that partnership is going to be strengthened. \nAs we continue to move in this century to develop a relationship under \nthe premise that Russia is not an enemy, then that is a step in the \nright direction.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the South. I am from the South. We are \naccustomed to seeing two strange dogs approach each other. They are \nvery leery of each other. And pretty soon they are sniffing around each \nother, and pretty soon those dogs decide it is OK, they can be friends. \nSo as we start sniffing around with this former adversary, one that we \nhope will be a future solid partner, we must work to build mutual trust \nso our nations can cooperate on other important issues of common \nconcern to our collective security, such as fighting terrorism, and \nsuch as economic reform and development.\n\n  Clearly, one of the areas we have had a very cooperative relationship \nin is our respective space programs.\n  I will never forget in the midst of the cold war there was a little \nbit of thought when an American astronaut crew rendezvoused and docked \nwith a Soviet crew of cosmonauts. They lived together in space for 9 \ndays in the Apollo-Soyuz historic mission of 1975. That started the \ncontacts between our two space programs. That ultimately led to the \njoint venture we have now where the Russians are a partner of ours and \nthey are helping us. They are our partner as we build the International \nSpace Station. By virtue of this recent tragedy with the Space Shuttle \nColumbia, the way we can save those three humans on board should we not \nbe able to get another space shuttle to the space station is the fact \nthat there is a former Soviet--now Russian--spacecraft, Soyuz, that is \ndocked to the International Space Station that can bring that crew of \ntwo Americans and one Russian home if they need to.\n  This relationship with Russia has extended to NATO. We look forward \nto cooperating with Russia on issues affecting the security of Europe \nand our allies. But there is one area in which the United States can \nprovide assistance to Russia while enhancing U.S. security. In this \ncontext of the Moscow Treaty, this is critically important. Earlier \ntoday Senator Biden said we must continue to move forward and provide \nadequate funding to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program \nand related nonproliferation programs in the Departments of Energy and \nState.\n  These programs collectively facilitate the destruction of nuclear \nweapons. They bolster the security of the facilities containing \nweapons-usable and fissile material. And these programs provide for \nretraining of scientists.\n  These programs are very valuable. Yet they have not been adequately \nfunded. This administration has not come forward with the adequate \nrequest for funding for the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction \nprogram.\n  I will tell you, there is no one I have a greater respect for than my \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Dick Lugar. I \nthink he will tell you the same thing. The spread of nuclear weapons \nand associated materials is a real threat. It is one particularly \nevident as we weigh the options available to us to deal with so many of \nthe threats around the globe. Look at North Korea. It is one of those \nthreats.\n  We must provide resources to these programs to try to stop the spread \nand the proliferation of nuclear materials because they enhance our \nsecurity by ensuring the adequate disposal of these weapons and their \nfissile material.\n  Certainly now when we are engaged in this war against terrorists, \nwhen we are trying to prevent al-Qaida sympathizers and other \nterrorists from acquiring such deadly weapons, we should not lack in \nany resources.\n  I again make a pitch to my colleagues in the Senate to adequately \nfund the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction program.\n  These programs were evaluated in a report released in January 2001 by \nour former colleague and now the Ambassador to Japan--Howard Baker from \nthe State of the Presiding Officer--and his partner in that report, \nLloyd Cutler. Their report clearly said these threat reduction programs \nare being underfunded. They call the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nand weapons-usable material to be ``the most urgent unmet national \nsecurity threat to the United States today.''\n\n  That is what Howard Baker and Lloyd Cutler said in their report to \nthe Congress in 2001.\n  That report was before an agreement was reached on the Moscow Treaty \nfor reducing our nuclear arsenals.\n  Now with so many new nuclear weapons coming out of service, we must \nconsider significant action to reduce proliferation to ensure that the \nAmerican people and our friends and allies around the world will be \nsafe. The most obvious way is to bolster the Nunn-Lugar programs.\n  I want to also speak on the subject of nuclear weapons, and I want to \nmention North Korea.\n  I was very troubled to see the report that the Bush administration is \nslowly accepting North Korea's status as a nuclear power. This is an \nunconscionable abdication of leadership by this administration. North \nKorea has taken provocative steps. I don't know why we weren't raising \nCain--I mean shaking the rafters--when those fighter aircraft buzzed \nour observation aircraft--our surveillance aircraft--just 2 days ago. \nNorth Korea has taken some very provocative steps hostile to the United \nStates.\n  It is likely they already have, according to our estimates, between \none and three nuclear weapons because North Korea cheated on several \ninternational and bilateral agreements over the past decade. Since that \ntime, they have renounced the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They \nhave renounced the International Atomic Energy Agency and their \nmonitors who were there present by international agreements. They have \nrenounced the 1994 Agreed Framework with the United States. They have \nbeen moving spent fuel rods to a reprocessing plant. Then, of course, \nthis inexcusable incident with fighter jets to harass a U.S. \nreconnaissance flight in international airspace.\n  Now, lo and behold, the President of North Korea is overtly \nthreatening a nuclear war if the United States leads any effort to \nisolate them.\n  With all of this belligerence, we have to have a plan. I would \nsuggest that the Bush administration start working to diplomatically \nsit down with North Korea to start reducing tensions. We cannot and \nmust not allow the North Koreans to develop an effective nuclear \nweapons arsenal.\n\n  A year ago, the President, in his State of the Union Address, \nreferred to North Korea as an ``Axis of Evil.'' Does he think that they \nare evil? I think he does. Do I think that they are evil? I certainly \ndo.\n  But is this the best way, diplomatically, to approach someone that we \nare trying to contain from becoming a nuclear power? We want them to \nstop their brutal actions against their own population, and we want to \nstop their proliferating technologies relating to weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  So in that regard, the President was correct. But we have started to \nsee what the consequences of that speech are. Instead of, as Theodore \nRoosevelt would say, ``speaking softly and carrying a big stick,'' the \nPresident made a judgment to speak harshly. And I want to know, where \nis the policy to back it up?\n  This pronouncement did not cause the North Koreans to begin bad \nbehavior and cheat on their agreements with the U.S. and the \ninternational community, but it did embolden them to harden their \nposition and to spurn the international community and begin in earnest \nto openly pursue more nuclear weapons. This is now the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves. And we have to get out of it.\n  I want this administration to have success because I think North \nKorea, with, a short way behind them, the country of Iran, poses the \nnext major threat behind the threat that we are engaged in, which is, \nthe war against terrorists.\n  I think the United States needs some clear action. U.S. leadership is \nneeded to get the world's declared nuclear powers to work together \nthrough the United Nations Security Council on a common response to the \ndanger, not only in North Korea, but in Iran as well. If we fail to do \nso, the nightmare scenario of North Korea selling its nuclear weapons \nto terrorist groups and other rogue states, even their enriched uranium \nthat they are trying to produce, all of that could become a reality. \nThat is not good for anybody on planet Earth.\n  I believe we ought to approach a policy where we must make North \nKorea understand that building an arsenal of nuclear weapons will not \nbe tolerated and that all options to combat this threat, including the \nmilitary options, have to be on the table. At the same time, we must \nwork to form a viable regional solution with China and Russia and Japan \nand South Korea, but not to the exclusion of bilateral dialog with \nNorth Korea.\n  I think all of us here are disappointed that China did not respond \nfavorably to Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent appeals for \nassistance and involvement during his recent trip there. China, and \nother members of the Security Council, have a lot at stake. They must \nlive up to their commitments of trying to prevent nuclear \nproliferation.\n  No policy that we pursue can possibly work unless it is carried out \nin concert with key countries. But we are getting to the point that we \ncannot wait. We are going to have to devise workable policy options \nthat the United States and North Korea may take to de-escalate this \nsituation.\n  So I call upon our colleagues here and our friends in the \nadministration to begin a dialog with North Korea immediately. Each day \nthat passes is a day that the danger notches up one more level.\n  Again, I thank Senators Lugar and Biden for their strong leadership \non these critical security issues facing our Nation. I thank them for \ntheir sponsorship of this Moscow Treaty. I will support the Moscow \nTreaty on the final result at the end of the day when we pass it. It is \nclearly in the interests of the United States. Indeed, it is in the \ninterests of planet Earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Democratic leader took to the floor \nrecently to pay tribute to the retiring Sergeant at Arms, GEN Al \nLenhardt.\n  I used to chair the Committee on Legislative Branch Appropriations, \nin which circumstance I had continual contact with the Office of the \nSergeant at Arms. When I became the ranking member of that subcommittee \nwas when Al Lenhardt was hired as the Senate Sergeant at Arms. I can \nreport to my fellow Senators that he had no partisanship at all in the \nway he discharged his duties.\n  It was within a matter of days after he was sworn in as Sergeant at \nArms that September 11 hit. His baptism into the procedures of the \nSenate was handling the disaster of September 11 and trying to work out \nsecurity for the Senators, and then to handle security as we traveled \nto Ground Zero in New York. Since that time, he has been faced with the \nchallenge of making the Capitol as secure as possible.\n  As he moves on to his next assignment, I want to make it clear that \nI, too, salute him for the service he has performed for the Senate. He \nhas handled himself in a very professional way. He has done very \nsignificant things to make this building safer, things that most \nSenators do not see.\n  By virtue of my position on that subcommittee, I was privileged to be \nin a confidential, classified briefing, as he outlined for us the \nactions that have been taken to make this building safe.\n  Indeed, I now take some comfort out of the fact that if there is a \nbiological or chemical attack on Capitol Hill, this building is the \nsafest place to be of any place on Capitol Hill. And that is a tribute \nto the patriotism, professionalism, and service of Al Lenhardt.\n  So I join with my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, and \nthe Democratic leader, who chose him for that position, in wishing him \nthe very\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nbest in his professional service here forward.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am embarrassed that I have not come prior \nto tonight and said something about GEN Al Lenhardt. I have served in \nthe Senate a long time, and we have had some very fine Sergeants at \nArms. But for the time and place, he was what we needed.\n  He is a man who had been literally under fire when he was in the \nmilitary. He had been head of all the MPs in the Army. And for him to \nstep in here, it was a perfect time, when we were going through all the \ntrouble we had.\n  I have gotten to know him extremely well. He has been a personal \nasset to me and to all the Senators. As the distinguished Senator from \nUtah mentioned, staff and a number of Senators do not know how much he \nhas done. Someday maybe something will be written about everything he \npersonally went through to make sure this place is very safe.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from Utah mentioning this fine \nman. This is not a partisan issue. Those of us who worked with him know \nwhat a wonderful job he has done. This is a spoils system we have here, \nand there are things that happen when there are new administrations, \nand I accept that.\n  I personally am going to miss him. He is a fine American. He has \nrendered great service to the Senate and to our country.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would also note that \nat the request of the majority leader, I was somewhat involved in the \nselection process to come up with a successor to Al Lenhardt. I can \nassure the Democratic whip and all other Senators that in the new \nSergeant at Arms Pickle, we have a worthy replacement for Sergeant \nLenhardt.\n  Mr. REID. General Lenhardt.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now General Lenhardt. All right. I am very comfortable \nthat the new Sergeant at Arms will carry on the same level of \nprofessionalism and provide the same level of protection for the \nSenators and our staffs that we have seen before.\n  It is a tribute to General Lenhardt that he has agreed to stay on \nuntil March 17 to see that the transition is as seamless as possible \nand that we do indeed maintain the level of safety we now have.\n  As good as the hands we have been in in the past, we will remain in \ngood hands in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3155-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3155-S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATE ENGAGEMENT\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

I find \nthis strong and thoughtful debate, no matter on which side of the issue \nindividuals or writers may be, extremely important at this key time in \nAmerica's history.\n  I have been fortunate to be on planet Earth somewhat longer than \nmany, and I have been fortunate to have been on the scene and been in a \nposition to observe World War II, Korea, Vietnam and, this being my \n25th year in the Senate, together with my colleagues in this Chamber \nover these many years, these wonderful years, I have been in a position \nto observe, and if I may say with some modesty, participate in those \ndecisions facing our Nation as it relates to national security.\n  I have said many times of recent that this particular framework and \ndecisions facing this President, President George Bush, this very \ncourageous President, are as complicated, if not more complicated, than \nany I have ever seen in this span of my 76 years.\n  I commend our President and his team--Secretary of State Powell, \nSecretary Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Rice, and many others. I \nfollowed, as I hope other colleagues did, another brilliant speech \ngiven today by the Secretary of State--no equivocations, respect for \nothers and their views, but clearly staying the course, a course on \nwhich our Nation embarked to pursue diplomacy to resolve these issues. \nIraq is foremost in our minds but close in parallel to significance is \nthe Korean peninsula. There, again, we are being confronted with a \nsituation that requires the strongest of commitments and the strongest \nof diplomacy. And our President, again, is guiding that diplomacy such \nthat we should address this issue in a multilateral context. I think he \nis on the right track.\n  Worldwide terrorism: How many could have foreseen before September 11 \nthat this country would be in the grip, not of state-sponsored \nterrorism--some state-sponsored but now more the individual. The al-\nQaida, the Hamas, you can recite these organizations that challenge our \nfreedoms, our very security, and our most precious security at home.\n  Yes, America is engaged in this important debate. I commend all. \nThere is a diversity of thought, and I am perfectly willing to listen \ncarefully and heed the thoughts of others. But in that debate a \nquestion has arisen, and an important one: What has been, what is, and \nwhat is to be, the role of the Congress, and most particularly, the \nSenate?\n  The Senate is known and respected worldwide as a debating society; an \ninstitution where we have this marvelous opportunity for unlimited \ndebate in certain instances, but most significantly, debate among 100 \nindividuals, well-informed, very conscientious Members who work hard at \ntheir duties. We are the world's greatest institution for \ndeliberations, and I am proud, modestly, to be a part. But we symbolize \nthe hope across this world for freedom such as we enjoy in the United \nStates, the hope to fight despair and hunger and political oppression. \nThe Senate so often and carefully addresses those issues day by day.\n  As there is diversity of views in debate on Iraq across this Nation, \nthere is diversity among Members in the Senate. That is the way it \nshould be. Therein lies our strength. But there are some who have come \nup with some viewpoints which I simply do not share.\n  Some in this Chamber have exercised their very right to criticize the \nbody as an institution for what it has done, is doing, and, more \nparticularly in their views, has not done. Some have gone so far as to \nsay, ``We are sleepwalking through history;'' ``this Chamber is \nhauntingly silent.''\n  Those are strong words, and words that I heed, and listen to, and in \nthis instance I have great respect for the marvelous Senator who stated \nthose words.\n  I can remember in the debate on Iraq that we had back in November, 5 \nhours one day, debating with that particular Senator, whom I admire. So \nthe debate goes on.\n  But my point is, even though the rafters of this Chamber are not \nrattling with the rhetoric on Iraq, there are many very important \nfunctions going on beyond this Chamber, in the halls of the Senate, in \nthe committee rooms, in the offices of Senators, throughout the entire \ninfrastructure of this institution--in our field offices in our \nrespective States where I and others so frequently meet our \nconstituents. The debate on Iraq is taking place in a responsible way, \nin my judgment, in the Senate, and this institution is fulfilling its \nrole.\n  Other Senators have criticized our President. We are really at war \nnow. Yes, I agree that diplomacy is still at work and that final \ndecision to go or not to go is yet to be made by our President, by the \nvery courageous Prime Minister Tony Blair, and other heads of state and \ngovernment of the group of willing nations, those willing to face up to \nthe need to remove weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein. \nYes, they criticize the President. But really we are at war now, and I \nquestion how severe that criticism should be.\n  I was with the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Mr. Levin, the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Mr. Roberts, and the vice chairman, Mr. Rockefeller. The \nfour of us toured Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf region. As we were \nthere, missions were being flown in Operation Northern Watch, Operation \nSouthern Watch, and other activities were taking place regarding which \nI am not at liberty to describe, nor should I describe, here on the \nfloor.\n  But men and women in the uniform of the United States, and indeed a \ngreat many civilians--particularly those of the Agencies and \nDepartments of this Government who perform our intelligence missions \nthroughout the\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nworld--are taking grave risks at this very hour. For that reason, I \nthink we should exercise a measure of restraint and caution exercising \nour right to criticize, be it the President or criticize this \ninstitution. I looked into the faces of those individuals, some who \nmight well have been involved in the recent capture of this individual \nwho allegedly plotted 9/11, planned it, and those plans might well have \nincluded the very building in which I am so privileged to stand at this \ntime. We shall learn in due course more and more about the aims of the \nterrorists who struck us on 9/11, the aims of the terrorists who are \nstill planning to strike us.\n  But let the debate go on. This is a strong nation, and our citizens \nare of strong mind, and our citizens are of a fair mind. Our citizens \nare very mindful of those in uniform, and those not in uniform, who \ntoday are taking the risks beyond our shores to interdict those who \nwould bring harm to these great United States of America.\n  Homeland defense, how important that subject is. Our President again \nhas led. We created that Department. But homeland defense begins beyond \nthe shores where the men and women of the Armed Forces and civilians \nand others are stationed, in so many nations. It begins there for the \nreason that, to the extent they can interdict, to the extent they can \ncrush the terrorists before their plans are unwrapped to inflict damage \non our beloved homeland--that is where homeland defense begins.\n\n  So my reply today to my good friends who have taken this institution \nand called upon it in certain ways, as to what it is doing, I would say \nmost respectfully that the Senate as a body has been, is, and will \ncontinue to be responsibly engaged in this debate; responsibly engaged \nin the consultation as it relates to these issues, consultation with \nthe administration, consultation with our constituents, consultation \nwith heads of governments and states--which I was privileged to do on \nthis trip with my colleagues--consultation with our militaries of the \nUnited States and the military leaders of other nations.\n  There is a broad range of activity by many Members of this body, a \nbroad range of activities that I think are as important as any debate \nthat takes place on the floor of the Senate.\n  We had a historic debate, as I alluded, last fall. My calculation--\nothers' may be different--is that debate lasted longer than the one we \nhad in 1991. I remember that debate very well. I was privileged to be \none of the coauthors of the resolution, as I was a coauthor of this \nresolution, this resolution which, after this very lengthy debate, was \nadopted with a strong vote of support for our President to have the \nauthority to use force--77 strong votes.\n  But those activities did not end. In other words, there were many \nactivities going on apart from the debate at that time: The same series \nof meetings and briefings, the same consultations going on just prior \nto that debate and during that debate. Those same meetings have \ncontinued on to this very hour. I am proud of the role of this \ninstitution. I am proud of it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chronology \nthat I put together of the meetings in which I have participated with \nmany other Senators. For example, on September 4, a meeting to discuss \nIraq with President Bush at the White House; a number of us were there; \nSeptember 5, a briefing on Iraq with CIA and DOD officials; programs, \n25 in number, of all of the times that I have been involved. Most \nparticularly, I am very proud of the record of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Again in the fall, under the able chairmanship of \nmy distinguished colleague here.

I would like \nmost respectfully to encourage the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, to likewise put in the Record the \nactivities which they as individuals, they as leaders of their \ncommittee, have done in connection with this very important issue, or \nseries of issues facing our Nation today.\n  The Armed Service Committee and the entire Senate have spent an \nenormous amount of time reviewing, discussing and debating Iraq. In the \nArmed Services Committee alone we have had at least twelve hearings or \nbriefings since September 2002 where the issue of Iraq was discussed \nextensively, if not exclusively. That is in addition to numerous \nbriefings for all Members by Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell and \nother Administration officials. Also, the President, Vice President and \nother members of the Administration have hosted countless events for \nCongressional leadership to exchange views on Iraq.\n  In October 2002, we had a thorough debate on the floor of the Senate \non a resolution to authorize the use of force. That debate exceeded the \namount of time we spent debating the resolution to authorize the use of \nforce against Iraq in 1991. The resolution passed by an overwhelming \nvote of 77 to 23.\n  While there have been many developments since October, the vast \nmajority have all reinforced the case that the authorization for the \nuse of force should remain unchanged. The military buildup has been in \nsupport of the President's diplomatic efforts. If anything, the events \nsince October have clearly shown that inspections are not succeeding \nand there is no compelling evidence that they will succeed in disarming \na regime that will not cooperate with the inspectors. We must keep in \nmind that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs have been \ndesigned to operate under an inspection regime. That is why more time \nfor inspections will not produce substantive results--if Saddam Hussein \ncontinues to deny, deceive and defy inspectors.\n  President George Bush wants to build a broad international coalition \nto confront the threat Iraq poses to global security. Far from ``going \nit alone,'' he has taken his case to the United Nations. President Bush \npresented a remarkable speech to the U.N. on September 12, 2002, that \nbrought to the attention of the world the threat this man, Saddam \nHussein, represents. Were it not for the leadership of President Bush \nand Prime Minister Blair, the world would not be focused on this clear \nand growing threat to global security.\n  The U.N. is really the organization that is being tested here. Is it \nto be a\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\ndecisive fore in international affairs that enforces the will of its \nmembers, or is it to be the organization that stands in the way of \ntimely, decisive action and takes no action to enforce its mandates?\n  The United States, Britain and Spain tabled a clear resolution this \nweek that reaffirms U.N. Security Council resolution 1441 and the 16 \nresolutions that came before it, and simply states what is plain to all \nof us: that Saddam Hussein has failed in this, his final opportunity to \ncooperate fully with U.N. demands that he destroy his weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The Security Council now must decide whether it will live up to its \nsometimes difficult responsibilities. By failing to act, the U.N. would \nonly damage its own credibility, not deter the U.S. and the other \nmembers of the ``coalition of the willing'' from exercising their \nrights and responsibilities to protect the security interests of their \nnations from the threat posed by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.\n  Failure to achieve consensus cannot and should not be used as an \nexcuse for inaction. If our principles, our security, our interests are \nat stake, we must act, in spite of differences with others, and whether \nor not others choose not to act for their own reasons.\n\n  A strong, clear-thinking and decisive UN can make the world stronger \nand safer, but a UN unable to make difficult decisions will be of \nlittle use in dealing with Iraq and other security challenges, such as \nNorth Korea.\n  Resolution 1441, which the security Council passed 15-0, is not about \ninspections, it is about disarmament. It is about offering Iraq a \nfinal--17th--opportunity to turn away from a rogue, non-cooperative \nstatus and become a responsible member of the community of nations, in \nthis case by living up to the terms of the cease fire signed 12 years \nago.\n  With other Senators, I had the opportunity to travel to the Middle \nEast and Afghanistan recently, and I can say without equivocation that \nour brave young men and women mobilizing in support of this mission are \nthe best trained, best equipped fighting force ever assembled, and the \nbest defenders of freedom any country could possibly have in this \nsituation. They are ready, and so is America, to lead a coalition of \nnations in disarming Saddam, if necessary.\n  The decision time is rapidly approaching. We will welcome UN support, \nbut, make no mistake: we will do what is necessary, without the UN if \nneed be. America is ready to face that challenge.\n  This is not a ``rush to war'' as some have suggested. Saddam Hussein \nagreed to disarm 12 years ago this month. The United Nations has passed \n17 Security Council Resolutions with regard to Iraq and their \ntransgressions against their own people, their neighbors and the \ninternational community. Every conceivable diplomatic, economic and \nmilitary avenue, short of overwhelming force, has been tried. There is \none last faint hope that diplomacy can succeed, if Saddam Hussein \nagrees to fully cooperate and disarm, without further delay. But, it is \ncertainly not a rush to war.\n  Some have asked, ``why now?'' I would remind those who ask such a \nquestion that the risks of further delay or inaction could be far more \ncostly and devastating than confronting Saddam Hussein now. This is a \nman who has used chemical agents on his own people and his neighbors. \nThis is a man who has had 4 unimpeded years to accelerate and hide his \nWMD program. This is a man who is attempting to develop new means to \ndeliver weapons of enormous danger well beyond his own borders. This is \na man who has ties to terrorist groups who have sponsored terrorist \nattacks against U.S. interests. We cannot wait for another 9/11 or \nsimilar event before we act.\n  Meeting with leaders in the Persian Gulf region recently, I was \npersuaded that there is far more support in the entire Gulf region for \ndisarming Saddam promptly than has been reported publicly. Most of \nSaddam's neighbors want him removed--quickly--so that he is no longer a \nthreat to them, no longer a force for instability in their region, no \nlonger repressing the quality of life of the people of Iraq.\n  This confrontation with Saddam Hussein is about disarming a \ndangerous, brutal dictator. But, it is about other things, including \nfreedom and liberty for the Iraqi people. As our President reminded the \nworld in his address to the United Nations in September 2002, ``Liberty \nfor the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal. \nThe people of Iraq deserve it, and the security of all nations requires \nit.''\n  Claims that the Administration has failed to plan or prepare for a \npost-conflict Iraq and accommodate the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi \npeople are simply not true. The Departments of Defense and State, along \nwith other interaency partners and international organizations have \nundertaken extraordinary steps to prepare to meet the security, \neconomic and humanitarian needs of a post-war Iraq. We have received \nextensive briefings at the staff and Member level detailing these \npreparations. Can all of the questions be answered definitively? No. To \ntry to do so would be deceiving to our people.\n  While some have faulted the lack of specificity regarding cost of a \nconflict or of securing the peace following potential conflict, the \nAdministration has been prudent and honest in its uncertainty about how \nlong any conflict may last and how long it will take to transition to a \ndemocratic, free Iraq.\n  Past administrations have provided quick, unrealistic estimates that \nsatisfied the immediate concerns, but later proved wrong. For example, \nwe all remember the famous claim of the previous administration that we \nwould be out of Bosnia in one year. That was in 1995--we are now \nbeginning our 8th year of military presence in that nation.\n  I commend this Administration for its honesty. They will share \ninformation on costs and duration of any operations when they can have \nreasonable confidence in the estimates.\n  Further delay and concessions will not lead to the disarmament of \nSaddam Hussein. He has proven that for 12 years. He must understand \nthrough the strength of our coalition--and, if possible, with the UN--\nthat disarmament without further delay is his only option. As history \ntells us, ``peace in our time'' with this man will not be achieved by \nappeasement. This is a time for action.\n  I will perhaps at a later date expand on the theme I have spoken \nabout today. But the principal reason I come forward is to show this \nSenator's strong support because of the action of our President, strong \nsupport for Secretary of State Colin Powell in my remarks today, and \nmost significantly strong support for the work of this institution, of \nwhich I am privileged to be a Member, and for the work they have done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICAN INTERESTS AT RISK IN RUSH TO WAR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on a number of recent occasions, I have \noutlined here on the floor of the United States Senate my deep \nreservations about the Bush administration's rush to war with Iraq, \nparticularly as U.N. inspectors are on the ground and making progress. \nI am especially concerned that war with Iraq at this time without the \nbacking of our allies and the support of the United Nations will \nundermine the effective coalition against the more dangerous threat of \nterrorism. And I believe it is the wrong priority, especially in the \nface of the current nuclear threat from North Korea.\n  But I also believe that this administration's conduct of American \nforeign relations has angered our friends and encouraged our enemies. \nThis chip-on-the-shoulder, my-way-or-the-highway approach to diplomacy \nhas alienated our allies at a time when we need unity to address modern \nthreats.\n  Recently, a senior member of the U.S. Foreign Service resigned in \nprotest over the administration's approach and its policies. Mr. John \nBrady Kiesling has served American interests as a diplomat for many \nyears in many difficult situations. And his brave letter of resignation \nspeaks volumes about the dangerous direction of the Bush administration \nin the conduct of foreign affairs.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay careful attention to his words, and ask \nunanimous consent that his thoughtful letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my \n     resignation from the Foreign Service of the United States and \n     from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy \n     Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The \n     baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give \n     something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was \n     a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages and \n     cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars and \n     journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and \n     theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and it \n     values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic arsenal.\n       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State \n     Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical \n     about the narrow and selfish bureaucratic motives that \n     sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is what it is, \n     and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human \n     nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to \n     believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was \n     also upholding the interests of the American people and the \n     world. I believe it no longer.\n       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible \n     not only with American values but also with American \n     interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us \n     to squander the international legitimacy that has been \n     America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense \n     since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle \n     the largest and most effective web of international \n     relationships the world has ever known. Our current course \n     will bring instability and danger, not security.\n       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and \n     to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is \n     certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not \n     seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such \n     systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in \n     Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than \n     before, rallying around us a vast international coalition to \n     cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the \n     threat of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those \n     successes and build on them, this Administration has chosen \n     to make terrorism a domestic political tool, enlisting a \n     scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as its bureaucratic \n     ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion in the \n     public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of \n     terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to \n     justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to \n     the military and to weaken the safeguards that protect \n     American citizens from the heavy hand of government. \n     September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of \n     American society as we seem determined to so to ourselves. Is \n     the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish, \n     superstitious empire thrashing toward self-destruction in the \n     name of a doomed status quo?\n       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more \n     of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over \n     the past two years done too much to assert to our world \n     partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override \n     the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims \n     were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model \n     of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what \n     basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image \n     and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is \n     blind in Chechanya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied \n     Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military \n     power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of \n     post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it \n     will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to \n     follow where we lead.\n       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many \n     of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral \n     capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are \n     persuaded less that war is justified than that it would be \n     perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete solipsism. \n     Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our President condone \n     the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our friends and \n     allies this Administration is fostering, including among its \n     most senior officials. Has ``oderint dum metuant'' really \n     become our motto?\n       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world. \n     Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-\n     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the \n     American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when \n     they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the \n     world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a \n     strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close \n     partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than \n     for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who \n     will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it \n     was, a beacon of liberty, security, and justice for the \n     planet?\n       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character \n     and ability. You have preserved more international \n     credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged \n     something positive from the excesses of an ideological and \n     self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the \n     President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an \n     international system we built with such toil and treasure, a \n     web of laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that \n     sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever \n     constrained America's ability to defend its interests.\n       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile \n     my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. \n     Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process \n     is ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I \n     can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better \n     serve the security and prosperity of the American people and \n     the world we share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3158-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 2, \n2000 in Carlsbad, CA. Four minors beat a 34 year-old man because they \nbelieved he was gay. The assailants confronted the victim as he was \nwalking home from a bar. The group yelled ``Hey, faggot, what are you \nlooking at?'' then attacked the victim.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3158-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3158-S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S.-PAKISTAN CONNECTION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last week, with the help of Pakistani \nauthorities, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was captured and taken into \ncustody. This represents the highest ranking al Qaeda official to be \napprehended in the war on terrorism and, according to some experts, \nMohammed is the most important terrorism related arrest in history.\n  I come to the floor today to publically express my gratitude to the \ngovernment of Pakistan and to President Musharraf in particular.\n  The arrest, along with the intelligence information gathered at the \nscene, brings us one giant step closer to dismantling the al Qaeda \nterror network.\n  You don't have to dig too deeply into the recent press stories to see \nthe significance of this event.\n  From the Washington Post:\n\n       U.S. authorities said they expect a trove of leads from the \n     search of Mohammed's living quarters . . .\n\n  From the New York Times:\n\n       Al Qaeda Hobbled by Latest Arrest . . .\n\n  From Time magazine:\n\n       Pakistani authorities nab Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the al-\n     Qaeda bigwig who helped mastermind the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n  It is important to note the context in which this significant \naccomplishment was achieved. Pakistan today is dealing with internal \nterrorist elements that want to turn that country into a radicalized, \nterrorist state. There are whole areas of the country in the \nmountainous boarder with Afghanistan--which are outside the control of \nthe government. And while the campaign against the Taliban was a \ncrucial first step in the war on terrorism, it has also shifted many of \nthe radicals who were operating there into this part of Pakistan.\n  Against this backdrop, it would be easy for President Musharraf to \nyield to the threats and intimidation of these elements within his \nsociety. We have seen all too well what happens when leaders neglect \ntheir responsibility to educate and lead their people rather than cave \nto popular mob mentality. Even in Europe, we have seen elements of this \nin the performance of Schroeder and Chirac.\n  But despite some public pressure, President Musharraf has taken a \nbold and strong stance against a fundamentalist future for his country. \nHe understands that it is in Pakistan's best interest to rid the \ncountry of the terrorist cells that are acting as parasites on the \nPakistani people. He understands that the best way to bring investment, \njobs, health care and security for his people is to join the realm of \nthe responsible world.\n  It is easy to underestimate the amount of courage this type of \nleadership takes. Sitting in our comfortable\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\ndemocracy in the U.S., it seems the obvious choice.\n  But I call on my colleagues to take a moment to remember the immense \nproblems that Pakistan is dealing with: because of tensions in the \nregion, and the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan's economy has suffered a \nhuge loss. And despite my best efforts with some fellow colleagues, the \nU.S. has yet to provide the one thing Pakistan really needs: a better \ndeal on textiles.\n  Textiles and textile products are Pakistan's main export. As a result \nof the war effort, invaluable orders for textile products made and \nexported by Pakistan have been canceled due to perceived instability in \nthe region and a lack of confidence that such orders will ultimately be \ndelivered.\n  According to the Pakistan Textile and Apparel Group, Pakistan has \nwitnessed a 64 percent reduction in orders for clothes that would be \nmade from last year alone, by the 14 largest apparel factories in \nLahore, Karachi, and Faisalabad. As a result, employment in these \nfactories has dropped 32 percent from a year ago. The Pakistani \ngovernment has estimated the overall decline in orders at 40 percent. \nThis has very real consequences for the future of Pakistan, its \nstability, and its ability to forge a future of economic prosperity for \nits people.\n  As a weakened market for Pakistani textile exports ultimately renders \nhuman development programs within Pakistan less effective, especially \nthe primary education element, young Pakistani's are faced with the \nprospect of no education and therefore no quality employment. An all-\nto-frequent alternative to this prospect is for young Pakistani's to \nattend Madrasas--Islamic religious schools run by mullahs--where too \noften basic skills and primary education are supplanted by religious \nteachings used to indoctrinate young Pakistani's into following the \nperverted version of Islam followed by Osama Bin Laden, Al Queda, and \nthe Taliban.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to work with me in the \nCongress to provide the President with authority to assist Pakistan in \nthe textile market immediately. Such action is vitally important to the \nstability of our important ally, and victory in our Nation's war \nagainst terrorism. Failing to take quick action only strengthens our \nenemy.\n  The war on terrorism will only be won through the continued \ncooperation of important countries like Pakistan. The very least we can \ndo in this body today is to recognize this support and to say thank you \nfor it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3159-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENERGY OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dianne \nFeinstein in sponsoring the Energy Oversight Bill. This bill clarifies \nthe scope of the existing regulatory authority of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, CFTC, over markets in over-the-counter, OTC, \nderivatives, including its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation \njurisdiction over exempt commodities such as metals and energy.\n  Over-the-counter derivatives markets have assumed an increasingly \nlarge role in the U.S. economy. A recent conservative estimate put the \nsize of the global OTC derivatives market at $111 trillion. The U.S. \nshare of that market is estimated to be at least two-thirds. \nDerivatives based on ``exempt commodities,'' such as energy and metals, \nmake up a small percentage--probably no more than 2 percent--of the \ntotal OTC derivatives market. However, derivatives play an increasingly \nimportant role in energy and metals markets, which are in turn critical \nto our overall economy.\n  The energy markets are among the largest and most dynamic in the \nUnited States. Hundreds of billions of dollars in energy products--\nwhich include electricity, natural gas, crude oil, and gasoline--are \ntraded each year in the United States--both on-exchange and in the \nover-the-counter markets.\n  We are all well aware of the tragedies that occurred last fall \nsurrounding the collapse of Enron. For instance, there have been \nnumerous stories in the press regarding allegations of manipulations in \nenergy markets. I understand the CFTC currently is in the process of \npursuing a comprehensive, detailed investigation of allegations raised \nby the Enron collapse.\n  However, some have suggested that following passage of Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act, CFMA, in 2000 the CFTC does not in fact have \nauthority to effectively and successfully investigate and punish fraud \nand manipulation in derivatives markets for exempt commodities--\nparticularly energy and metals. In a hearing held by the Senate \nAgriculture Committee last July, questions were raised about the CFTC's \nability to prevent fraud and manipulation in the first place.\n  If that is the case, not only do these transactions fall outside the \njurisdictional reach of the CFTC, but in most cases, they are beyond \nthe reach of any other federal financial regulator. Thus, we have a gap \nin the oversight of exempt commodity transactions. And plainly, this \ngap was not something Congress intended when it passed the CFMA.\n  This legislation puts these questions to rest.\n  Our bill clarifies that the CFTCs anti- fraud and anti-manipulation \nauthority applies to all exempt commodity transactions and requires \nderivatives marketplaces like electronic swap exchanges--like the now-\ndefunct ``Enron Online\"--to adhere to certain, minimal regulatory \nobligations: among them are transparency, disclosure, and reporting.\n  It recognizes the benefits of market innovation by preserving the \nlong-sought legal certainty for swaps--they remain for the most part \n``exempt'' from CFTC jurisdiction. At the same time, however, the bill \nensures that all derivatives transactions are subject to the \ncommission's fraud and manipulation authorities. It would not require \nthe registration of swap counterparties, but would require that they \nmaintain books and records of transactions--something that should be \nroutine practice in the industry. Finally, the legislation recognizes \nthat all exchange markets serve price discovery and hedging purposes by \nimposing modest transparency, disclosure, and reporting obligations.\n  Experience has shown that measures designed to increase market \ntransparency instill confidence in markets, attract investment, and \nincrease market integrity by providing regulators with the means to \nmonitor for fraud and manipulation. Application of these principles to \nderivatives markets generally is sound public policy, prudent business \npractice, and common sense. The consequent benefits extend not only to \nmarket users, but also to consumers.\n  Accountability is important and must be restored because Enron is not \nalone. It is only a case study exposing the shortcomings in our current \nlaws. Future debacles wait to be discovered not only by investigators \nor the media, but by the more than one in two Americans who depend on \nthe transparency and integrity of our public markets.\n  The majority of Americans depend on capital markets to invest in the \nfuture needs of their families--from their children's college fund to \ntheir retirement nest eggs. American investors deserve action. Congress \nmust act now to restore confidence in the integrity of the public \nmarkets.\n  Accountability and transparency help our markets work as they should, \nin ways that benefit investors, employees, consumers and our national \neconomy. Our job is to make sure that there are adequate doses of \naccountability in our regulatory and legal system to prevent such \noccurrences in the future. The time has come for Congress to rethink \nand reform our laws in order to prevent corporate deceit, to protect \ninvestors and to restore full confidence in the capital markets.\n  Unfortunately, in the wake of Enron, we are presently witnessing some \nof the best arguments in favor of such changes. U.S. energy markets are \nsuffering a crisis in confidence. This modest legislation is a good \nfirst step toward restoring this lost confidence and returning energy \nmarkets to a path of growth and efficiency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3159-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3159-S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO OPERATION EAGLE'S NEST\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Operation Eagle's Nest. The Military Affairs Committees of \nHopkinsville and\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nOak Grove, KY, and Clarksville, TN, created this fund-raising \ninitiative to help the families of deployed soldiers from Fort \nCampbell.\n  The communities surrounding Fort Campbell have a long tradition of \nsupporting the more than 20,000 soldiers and their families of the \n101st Airborne Division and the other units stationed at Fort Campbell. \nTroops from Fort Campbell have played a vital role in the war against \nterrorism in Afghanistan and around the world. As thousands of troops \nand tons of machinery and equipment depart Fort Campbell for the Middle \nEast, it is important that Americans not forget the sacrifices of the \nfamilies that the men and women of our Armed Forces leave behind.\n  Local businesses and citizens in Kentucky and Tennessee founded \nOperation Eagle's Nest with the goal of raising at least $1 million as \na contingency fund to be used as needed at the base. The local citizens \nare excited about the initiative and the opportunity to once again show \nour soldiers and their families how much they appreciate the sacrifices \nthey make for our great Nation. The Fort Campbell soldiers deployed in \nthe Middle East feel at ease with the confidence that their families \nare supported by local citizens.\n  For Campbell Division Commander MG David Petraeus recently praised \n``not just the monetary support but the symbolism of our communities \ncoming together for the families.'' He is absolutely correct. The \nsoldiers of Fort Campbell are heroically doing their part in the war on \nterror and the local citizens of Hopkinsville, Oak Grove, and \nClarksville are graciously doing theirs. This is exactly what President \nBush meant when he stated that all Americans must do their part in the \nwar on terror.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO STATE SENATOR ALVIN PENN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nlife and career of Connecticut State Senator Alvin Penn, who died an \nuntimely death on Friday, February 14, at the age of 54.\n  Alvin was a passionate and principled fighter who sought to give \npeople of all races and backgrounds the equal opportunity that is every \nAmerican's birthright. Through difficult times, he never wavered in \nserving his beloved city of Bridgeport. And those of us who were \nblessed to know him will always remember him as a larger than life \nhuman being with a generous spirit and sharp and unsinkable sense of \nhumor.\n  As chairman of the State senate's public safety committee, Senator \nPenn banned the insidious practice of racial profiling and improved the \nState's witness protection program. Thanks to Senator Penn's work on \nthis committee and others, Bridgeport has better schools, safer \nstreets, and more prosperous neighborhoods than it did a decade ago.\n  The city of Bridgeport and the state of Connecticut, of course, still \nhave their share of troubles--but Alvin never gave up, never let the \nsteepness of the hill stop him from trying to climb. He understood that \nto get to the mountaintop, you must keep going up.\n  That is what he did. State Senator Penn did not take orders from \nspecial interests or party bosses. He listened to, and did what was \nright for, the people he served. Eight years ago, Alvin met with Gov. \nJohn Rowland, and told the Governor, ``You're a Republican from \nWaterbury and I'm a Democrat from Bridgeport. We understand the issues \nof our urban communities.'' He pledged to work together--and his word \nwas good.\n  The city of Bridgeport will always hold State Senator Penn close to \nits heart. He is a part of its history, its present, and will be a part \nof its future. There is not yet an Alvin Penn memorial in Bridgeport--\nthough there may someday be. For now, his legacy, and his memorial, is \nin every school and business and church, and every citizen on every \nstreet corner in the city he loved to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3160-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING PATRICK S. LeROY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have the privilege and honor \ntoday of recognizing Patrick S. LeRoy of Louisville, Kentucky. Earlier \nthis month, Patrick was honored by the Muscular Dystrophy Association \nas the 2003 Kentucky State Goodwill Ambassador.\n  Patrick is a special child with a special condition and unique \nopportunity to share his story with thousands of people. Each day he \nlives with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of this disease \ninclude increasing muscle weakness in the body, concentrated mainly in \nthe arms and legs.\n  Nevertheless, Patrick does not allow this condition to limit his \ndaily activities. In fact, this 8 year old is more active than most \npeople his age, and even adults. Currently, Patrick is a second grader \nat Coral Ridge Elementary in Fairdale. When not studying his favorite \nsubjects, math and science, this young man enjoys swimming, \nparticipating in karate class, and he also shares my passion for the \ngame of baseball. In addition to his participation in athletics, \nPatrick also develops his artistic abilities through drawing.\n  What sets Patrick apart from other children is not his health \ncondition but his willingness to make a difference by speaking with \npeople about muscular dystrophy, helping to remove a stigmatism that \nstems from lack of knowledge. Being selected as the Kentucky ambassador \nwill give Patrick a valuable opportunity to encourage public support \nand education of this disease. Please join me in congratulating Patrick \nS. LeRoy and wishing him the best of luck in his new position of 2003 \nKentucky State Goodwill Ambassador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3160-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3160-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3160-5", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERIODIC REPORT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS PAYMENTS MADE TO CUBA PURSUANT TO \n              TREASURY DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC LICENSES--PM20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 1705(e)(6) of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, \nas amended by section 102(g) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, 22 U.S.C. 6004(e)(6), I transmit \nherewith a semiannual report prepared by my Administration detailing \npayments made to Cuba by United States persons as a result of the \nprovision of telecommunications services pursuant to Department of the \nTreasury specific licenses.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 1993 income tax increase on Social Security benefits; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Social \nSecurity Benefits Tax Relief Act of 2003. This is a simple bill that \nwould repeal the income tax increase on Social Security benefits that \nwent into effect in 1993.\n  When the Social Security system was created, beneficiaries did not \npay Federal income tax on their benefits. However, in 1983, Congress \npassed legislation that changed all this. The 1983 law requires that 50 \npercent of Social Security benefits be taxed for senior whose incomes \nreached a certain level. The revenue this tax generated was then \ncredited to the Social Security trust funds. Although I wasn't in \nCongress back in 1983, some argued that these changes were necessary \nbecause it kept Social Security taxes more in line with taxes on \nprivate pensions and because it shored up the Social Security system.\n  In 1993, President Clinton proposed that 85 percent of Social \nSecurity benefits be taxable for seniors meeting certain income \nthresholds, and that this additional money be allocated for the \nMedicare Program. Unfortunately, Congress passes this provision as part \nof a larger bill, which President Clinton then signed into law.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives at this time. I voted \nagainst this bill and didn't support this provision. This tax is unfair \nto our senior citizens who worked year, after year, after year, paying \ninto Social Security, only to be faced with higher taxed once they \nretired.\n  The bill I am introducing would repeal the 85 percent tax, and would \nreplace the funding that has been going to the Medicare Program with \ngeneral funds. This tax was unfair when it was implemented in 1993, and \nit is unfair today. I hope my Senate colleagues can support this \nlegislation to remove this burdensome tax on our seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Allen, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Burns, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Thomas, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mr. Miller, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 516. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to allow the \narming of pilots of cargo aircraft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today with several of my senate \ncolleagues to introduce the Arming Cargo Pilots Against Terrorism Act. \nThis bill closes a loophole to better protect the homeland against \nterrorists.\n  As a result of the airplane hijackings on September 11, 2001, \nCongress took the appropriate action to prevent from ever happening \nagain the use of an airliner as a missile and weapon of mass \ndestruction and murder. Last year, large majorities of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives voted to arm both cargo and passenger pilots \nwho volunteered for a stringent training proram as part of the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  Arming these pilots served to protect the pilots and aircrew, \npassengers and those on the ground from ever being victims of another \nairline hijacking. It was the right thing to do. However, during \nconference of the homeland security bill the cargo pilots were yanked \nfrom the bill. This bill we introduce today will arm cargo pilots and \nclose the loophole created when they were left out last year.\n  It is true that cargo airlines rarely have passengers, but that is no \nreason to disregard and ignore the safety of those cargo pilots and the \naircrafts they control. Indeed, on occasions they do carry passengers, \nand sometimes they transport couriers and guards of some of the cargo \nbeing transported. Too many times these couriers and guards are armed \nwhile the pilots are unarmed. After September 11, that simply does not \nmake sense.\n  As well, physical security around too many of our air cargo \nfacilities and terminals is not up to the standard it should be. This \nlax in security has allowed stowaways a free pass in climbing aboard \ncargo airplanes for a free ride. Just a few months ago a woman in \nFargo, ND, rushed onto a United Parcel Service plane trying to get to \nCalifornia. Fortunately she was caught. I guarantee that many have \nsuccessfully sneaked onto cargo airplanes. And many more will continue \nto try. This is further evidence as to why we need to act to allow \nthese cargo pilots to defend themselves and the cockpit.\n  Cargo pilots are not armed and they will never have Federal air \nmarshals. Cargo planes do not have trained flight attendants or alert \npassengers to fend off hijackers. Cargo planes do not have reinforced \ncockpit doors, and some do not have any doors at all. Cargo areas of \nairports are not as secure as a passenger areas, and thousands of \npersonnel have access to the aircraft. Finally, stowaways sometimes \nfind their way aboard cargo aircraft. And in the future one might be a \nterrorist.\n  There are no logical reasons to exclude cargo pilots. Simply saying \nthat since they carry no passengers unlike a passenger airliner is not \na good enough reason. Cargo planes are just as big as--if not bigger \nthan--passenger planes. They can carry larger loads of fuel and \nfrequently carry hazardous materials, including chemicals and \nbiological products. A cargo airplane causes just as much damage when \nused as a weapon as did the passenger planes hijacked on September 11.\n  We cannot allow what happened on September 11 to ever happen again. \nThis loophole of excluding cargo pilots from being able to protect \nthemselves and their aircraft and the public must be removed. This is \nthe right thing to do, and I ask my Senate colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arming Cargo Pilots Against \n     Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed measures that \n     would have armed pilots of cargo aircraft.\n       (2) Cargo aircraft do not have Federal air marshals, \n     trained cabin crew, or determined passengers to subdue \n     terrorists.\n       (3) Cockpit doors on cargo aircraft, if present at all, \n     largely do not meet the security standards required for \n     commercial passenger aircraft.\n       (4) Cargo aircraft vary in size and many are larger and \n     carry larger amounts of fuel than the aircraft hijacked on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) Aircraft cargo frequently contains hazardous material \n     and can contain deadly biological and chemical agents and \n     quantities of agents that cause communicable diseases.\n       (6) Approximately 12,000 of the nation's 90,000 commercial \n     pilots serve as pilots and flight engineers on cargo \n     aircraft.\n       (7) There are approximately 2,000 cargo flights per day in \n     the United States, many of which are loaded with fuel for \n     outbound international travel or are inbound from foreign \n     airports not secured by the Transportation Security \n     Administration.\n       (8) Aircraft transporting cargo pose a serious risk as \n     potential terrorist targets that could be used as weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (9) Pilots of cargo aircraft deserve the same ability to \n     protect themselves and the\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n     aircraft they pilot as other commercial airline pilots.\n       (10) Permitting pilots of cargo aircraft to carry firearms \n     creates an important last line of defense against a terrorist \n     effort to commandeer a cargo aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a \n     member of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be \n     armed with a firearm to defend the cargo aircraft against an \n     attack by terrorists that could result in the use of the \n     aircraft as a weapon of mass destruction or for other \n     terrorist purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3. ARMING CARGO PILOTS AGAINST TERRORISM.\n\n       Section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``passenger'' each place \n     that it appears; and\n       (2) in subsection (k)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by striking ``or,'' and all that follows; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``or any other flight deck crew \n     member.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) All-cargo air transportation.--For the purposes of \n     this section, the term air transportation includes all-cargo \n     air transportation.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       (a) Time for Implementation.--The training of pilots as \n     Federal flight deck officers required in the amendments made \n     by section 3 shall begin as soon as practicable and no later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Effect on Other Laws.--The requirements of subsection \n     (a) shall have no effect on the deadlines for implementation \n     contained in section 44921 of title 49, United States Code, \n     as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Miller):\n  S. 518. A bill to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for \nresearch, to provide better coordinate of Federal efforts and \ninformation on islet cell transplantation, and to collect the data \nnecessary to move islet cell transplantation from an experimental \nprocedure to a standard therapy; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am pleased to join my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Patty Murray, as well as my colleague and co-chair of the \nSenate Diabetes Caucus, Senator John Breaux, in introducing the \nPancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act of 2003, which will help to \nadvance tremendously important research that holds the promise of a \ncure for the more than 1 million Americans with type 1 or juvenile \ndiabetes.\n  As the founder and co-chair of the senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families \nas they await a cure. Diabetes is a devastating, life-long condition \nthat affects people of every age, race, and nationality. It is the \nleading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations \nnot related to injury. Moreover, a new study released by the American \nDiabetes Association last week estimates that diabetes cost the Nation \n$132 billion last year, and that health care spending for people with \ndiabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have \ndiabetes.\n  The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for children and young \nadults with type 1, or juvenile diabetes. Juvenile diabetes is the \nsecond most common chronic disease affecting children. Moreover, it is \none that they never outgrow.\n  In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's immune system \nattacks the pancreas and destroys the islet cells that produce insulin. \nWhile the discovery of insulin was a landmark breakthrough in the \ntreatment of people with diabetes, it is not a cure, and people with \njuvenile diabetes face the constant threat of developing devastating, \nlife-threatening complications as well as a drastic reduction in their \nquality of life.\n  Thankfully, there is good news for people with diabetes. We have seen \nsome tremendous breakthroughs in diabetes research in recent years, and \nI am convinced that diabetes is a disease that can be cured, and will \nbe cured in the near future.\n  We were all encouraged by the development of the Edmonton Protocol, \nan experimental treatment developed at the University of Alberta \ninvolving the transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic islet \ncells, which has been hailed as the most important advance in diabetes \nresearch since the discovery of insulin in 1921. Of the approximately \n200 patients who have been treated using variations of the Edmonton \nProtocol, all have seen a reversal of their life-disabling \nhypoglycemia, and nearly 80 percent have maintained normal glucose \nlevels without insulin shots for more than 1 year.\n  Moreover, the side effects associated with this treatment-- which \nuses more islet cells and a less toxic combination of immunosuppressive \ndrugs than previous, less successful protocols--have been mild and the \ntherapy has been generally well tolerated by most patients.\n  Unfortunately, long-term use of toxic immunosuppressive drugs, has \nside effects that make the current treatment inappropriate for use in \nchildren. Researcher, however, are working hard to find a way to reduce \nthe transplant recipient's dependence on these drugs so that the \nprocedure will be appropriate for children in the future, and the \nprotocol has been hailed around the world as a remarkable breakthrough \nand proof that islet transplantation can work. It appears to offer the \nmost immediate chance to achieve a cure for type 1 diabetes, and the \nresearch is moving forward rapidly.\n  New sources of islet cells must be found, however, because, as the \nscience advances and continues to demonstrate promise, the number of \nislet cell transplants that can be performed will be limited by a \nserious shortage of pancreases available for islet cell \ntransplantation. There currently are only 2,000 pancreases donated \nannually, and, of these, only about 500 are available each year for \nislet cell transplants. Moreover, most patients require islet cells \nfrom two pancreases for the procedure to work effectively.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today will increase the supply of \npancreases available for these trials and research. Our legislation \nwill direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to grant \ncredit to organ procurement organizations OPOs--for the purposes of \ntheir certification--for pancreases harvested and used for islet cell \ntransplantation and research.\n  Currently, CMS collects performance data from each OPO based upon the \nnumber of organs procured for transplant relative to the population of \nthe OPO's service area. While CMS considers a pancreas to have been \nprocured for transplantation if it is used for a whole organ \ntransplant, the OPO receives no credit towards its certification if the \npancreas is procured and used for islet cell transplantation or \nresearch. Our legislation will therefore give the OPOs an incentive to \nstep up their efforts to increase the supply of pancreases donated for \nthis purpose.\n  In addition, the legislation establishes an inter-agency committee on \nislet cell transplantation comprised of representatives of all of the \nFederal agencies with an active role in supporting this research. The \nmany advisory committees on organ transplantation that currently exist \nare so broad in scope that the issue of islet cell transplantation--\nwhile of great importance to the juvenile diabetes community--does not \nrise to the level of consideration when included with broader issues \nassociated with organ donation, such as organ allocation policy and \nfinancial barriers to transplantation. We believe that a more focused \neffort in the area of islet cell transplantation is clearly warrented \nsince the research is moving forward at such a rapid pace and with such \nremarkable results.\n  To help us collect the data necessary to move islet cell \ntransplantation from an experimental procedure to a standard therapy \ncovered by insurance, our legislation directs the Institute of Medicine \nto conduct a study on the impact of islet cell transplantation on the \nhealth-related quality of life outcomes for individuals with juvenile \ndiabetes, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the treatment.\n  Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure, accounting for \n40 percent of new cases, and a significant percentage of individuals \nwith type 1 diabetes will experience kidney failure and become \nMedicare-eligible before they are age 65. Medicare currently covers \nboth kidney transplants and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants \nfor these individuals. To help Medicare decide whether it should cover \npancreatic islet cell transplants, our legislation authorizes a \ndemonstration project to test the efficacy of simultaneous islet-kidney \ntransplants\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nand islet transplants following a kidney transplant for individuals \nwith type 1 diabetes who are eligible for Medicare because they have \nend stage renal disease ESRD.\n  Islet cell transplantation offers real hope for people with diabetes. \nOur legislation, which is strongly supported by the Juvenile Diabetes \nResearch Foundation JDRF, addresses some of the specific obstacles to \nmoving this research forward as rapidly as possible, and I urge all of \nmy colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 519. A bill to establish a Native American-owned financial entity \nto provide financial services to Indian tribes, Native American \norganizations, and Native Americans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Native \nAmerican Capital Formation and Economic Development Act of 2003.\n  Before the Europeans landed on these shores, Indian nations were \nvigorous and vital: tribal governments functioned well; tribal cultures \nand religions flourished; and tribal economies were strong.\n  Over time tribal institutions failed when the independence they had \nknown were stifled by the Federal Government.\n  Since 1970, Indian self-determination has assisted the tribes in \nrebuilding their governments and resurrecting their economies.\n  The bill I am introducing today will foster real self-determination \nand create a Native-capitalized development assistance corporation.\n  If enacted, the tribes themselves will be the financiers and \nshareholders of the Native American Capital Development Corporation \nwhich will focus on mortgage lending and Indian home ownership; provide \nassistance to Native financial institutions; and work to create a \nsecondary market in Indian mortgages.\n  The corporation will include the Native American Economies Diagnostic \nStudies Fund to partner with tribes to conduct diagnostic studies of \ntheir economies and identify the inhibitors to greater levels of \nprivate sector investment and job creation. Ultimately the corporation \nand the tribes will work to remove those inhibitors.\n  The corporation's Native American Economic Incubation Center Fund \nwill work with participating tribes to channel development assistance \nto those tribes with a demonstrated commitment to sound economic and \npolitical policies; good governance; and practices that create \nincreased levels of economic growth and job creation.\n  It is my expectation that there will be much debate generated by this \nlegislation which I consider a good thing. I expect to hold hearings on \nthis important legislation in the weeks ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is a special legal and political relationship \n     between the United States and the Indian tribes, as grounded \n     in treaties, the Constitution, Federal statutes and court \n     decisions, executive orders, and course of dealing;\n       (2) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian land and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     Native Americans suffer rates of unemployment, poverty, poor \n     health, substandard housing, and associated social ills to a \n     greater degree than any other group in the United States;\n       (3) the economic success and material well-being of Native \n     Americans depends on the combined efforts and resources of \n     the United States, Indian tribal governments, the private \n     sector, and individuals;\n       (4) the poor performance of moribund Indian economies is \n     due in part to the near-complete absence of private capital \n     and private capital institutions; and\n       (5) the goals of economic self-sufficiency and political \n     self-determination for Native Americans can best be achieved \n     by making available the resources and discipline of the \n     private market, adequate capital, and technical expertise.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish an entity dedicated to capital development \n     and economic growth policies in Native American communities;\n       (2) to provide the necessary resources of the United \n     States, Native Americans, and the private sector on endemic \n     problems such as fractionated and unproductive Indian land;\n       (3) to provide a center for economic development policy and \n     analysis with particular emphasis on diagnosing the systemic \n     weaknesses with, and inhibitors to greater levels of \n     investment in, Native American economies;\n       (4) to establish a Native-owned financial entity to provide \n     financial services to Indian tribes, Native American \n     organizations, and Native Americans; and\n       (5) to improve the material standard of living of Native \n     Americans.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Act of August 9, 1955, to extend the \nterms of leases of certain restricted Indian land, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nIndian Land Leasing Act of 2003 to make routine changes to title 25 of \nthe United States Code and to assist economic activity on Indian lands \nby liberalizing the Indian land leasing process.\n  Federal law requires tribal landowners to seek the approval of the \nSecretary of the Interior to lease their lands and further restricts \nthe lease term to a period of 25 years.\n  This legal framework is an obstacle in the path of the tribes and \ntheir members, and year after year Indian tribes are forced to seek the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs' assistance in extending the lease term to \n99 years.\n  Over the years not fewer than 38 tribes have come to Congress and \nsecured 99-year lease authority.\n  At the tribes' request, this bill will extend 99-year lease authority \nto the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, the Yavapai-\nPrescott Tribe, the Yurok Tribe, and the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians \nto the long list of tribes that have already secured similar \nextensions.\n  The bill also provides 99-year lease authority for tribes that wish \nto do so without the prior approval of the Secretary.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this modest but \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Land Leasing Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF 99-YEAR LEASES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of the first section of the \n     Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. 415(a)) is amended in the \n     second sentence--\n       (1) by inserting ``the reservation of the Confederated \n     Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation,'' before ``the \n     Burns Paiute Reservation,'';\n       (2) by inserting ``the'' before ``Yavapai-Prescott'';\n       (3) by striking ``Washington,,'' and inserting \n     ``Washington,''; and\n       (4) by inserting ``land held in trust for the Yurok Tribe, \n     land held in trust for the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians of \n     the Hopland Rancheria,'' after ``Pueblo of Santa Clara,''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to any lease entered into or renewed after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to assist \nIndian tribes in developing energy resources, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNative American Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003.\n  Our Nation is about to be embroiled in war in the Middle East and the \nmarkets are anxious about the military action. As a result, world oil \nprices are soaring and now are nearly $40 per barrel.\n  The economic repercussions to everyday Americans of high oil prices \ncannot be overlooked. Industries reliant on cheap energy will contract \nand people will lose their jobs.\n  The single working mom who commutes and delivers her child to daycare \nwill be paying much higher prices at the pump. Shoes for her kids and \npayments into the college fund will have to wait.\n  The family-owned construction firm will be forced to let people go. \nFamilies will be disrupted.\n  One obvious answer to our energy future is in more vigorous domestic \nproduction.\n  For far too long Indian-owned energy resources have been overlooked \nand untapped.\n  There are nearly 90 tribes that own significant energy resources--\nboth renewable and nonrenewable--and with rare exception these tribes \nwant to develop them.\n  The Interior Department estimates that 25 percent of oil and less \nthan 20 percent of natural gas reserves on Indian land have been \ndeveloped.\n  The bill I am introducing will provide financial assistance, \ntechnical expertise, and regulatory relief to the tribes in their \nefforts to manage and market their resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention \nand Control Act of 1990 to reauthorize and improve that Act; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins and I are very pleased to introduce the National Aquatic \nInvasive Species Act of 2003. This bill, which reauthorizes the \nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, takes a \ncomprehensive approach towards addressing aquatic nuisance species to \nprotect the Nation's waters. This bill deals with the prevention of new \nintroductions, the screening of new aquatic organisms coming into the \ncountry, the rapid response to new invasions, and the research to \nimplement the provisions of this bill.\n  The problem of invasive species is a very real one. Over the past 450 \nyears, during colonization and development of this country, more than \n6,500 nonindigenous invasive species have been introduced into the \nUnited States and have become established, self-sustaining populations. \nThese species--from microorganisms to mollusks, from pathogens to \nplants, from insects to fish to animals--typically encounter few, if \nany, natural enemies in their new environments and wreak havoc on \nnative species. Aquatic nuisance species threaten biodiversity \nnationwide, especially in the Great Lakes.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember that back in the late eighties, \nthe problem of aquatic nuisance species was first raised after the \nzebra mussel was released into the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes still \nhave zebra mussels, and now, 20 States are fighting to control them. \nZebra mussels were carried over from the Mediterranean to the Great \nLakes in the ballast tanks of ships. The leading pathway for aquatic \ninvasive species is maritime commerce. Most invasive species are \ncontained in the water that ships use for ballast. Aquatic invaders \nsuch as the zebra mussel and round goby were introduced into the Great \nLakes when ships, often from halfway around the world, pulled into port \nand discharged their ballast water. Aquatic invaders can also attach \nthemselves to ships' hulls and anchor chains.\n  Because of the impact that the zebra mussel had in the Great Lakes, \nCongress passed legislation in 1990 and 1996 that have reduced, but not \neliminated, the threat of new invasions by requiring ballast water \nmanagement for ships entering the Great Lakes. Today, there is a \nmandatory ballast water management program in the Great Lakes. The \ncurrent law requires that ships entering the Great Lakes must exchange \ntheir ballast water, seal their ballast tanks or use alternative \ntreatment that is ``as effective as ballast water exchange.'' \nUnfortunately, the effectiveness of ballast water exchange has been \nleft undefined. Consequently, alternative treatments have not been \nfully developed and widely tested on ships because the developers of \nballast technology do not know what standard\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nthey are trying to achieve. This obstacle is serious because \nultimately, only onboard ballast water treatment will adequately reduce \nthe threat of new aquatic nuisance species being introduced through \nballast water.\n  Our bill rectifies this problem. First, this bill establishes \ndeadlines for national interim and final standards for ballast water \nmanagement. This way, technology vendors and the maritime industry know \nwhen to expect clear requirements. Second, our bill establishes what \nthe phrase ``as effective as ballast water exchange'' means for the \npurposes of the interim period. Research has shown that ballast water \nexchange has highly variable effectiveness rates. This bill takes the \nmaximum effectiveness that ballast water exchange could have using the \nsafest approach--a 95-percent reduction of near coastal plankton and \nestablishes it as the floor for treatment effectiveness which is a 95 \npercent kill or removal of live organisms. Within 18 months of the \nbill's passage, the Coast Guard is required to issue regulations \nimplementing an interim ballast water standard that would require ships \nthat enter any U.S. port after operating outside the Exclusive Economic \nZone of 200 miles to either use ballast water treatment technology that \nmeets the standard, retain the ship's ballast water, or exchange the \nship's ballast water in the high seas. Ships operating in coastal \nwaters would not be required to manage ballast water during the interim \nstandard.\n  A 95-percent reduction of organisms will be the interim standard used \nfor treatment technology until the EPA, with the concurrence of the \nCoast Guard, promulgates the final standard. This interim standard is \nnot intended to be implemented for the long run, and it is not perfect. \nHowever, a final standard is difficult to set today or in the near \nfuture because of the limited research that has been conducted on how \nclean or sterile ballast water discharge should be, what is the best \nexpression of a standard, and what is technologically achievable. \nRather than wait many more years before taking action to stop new \nintroductions, I believe that an imperfect but clear and achievable \ninterim standard for treatment technology is the right approach. This \ninterim standard will lead to the use of ballast treatments that are \nmore protective of our waters than the default method of ballast water \nexchange provides, and it can be implemented in the very near future. \nFurther, the bill provides the Coast Guard with the flexibility to \npromulgate the interim standard using a size-based standard or by \nwhatever parameters the Coast Guard determines appropriate.\n  I understand that ballast water technologies are being researched and \nare ready to be tested onboard ships. These technologies include \nultraviolet lights, filters, chemicals, deoxygenation, and several \nothers. Each of these technologies has a different pricetag attached to \nit. It is not my intention to overburden the maritime industry with an \nexpensive requirement to install technology. In fact, the legislation \nstates that the final ballast water technology standard must be based \non ``best available technology economically achievable.'' That means \nthat the EPA must consider what technology is available, and if there \nis not economically achievable technology available to a class of \nvessels, then the standard will not require ballast technology for that \nclass of vessels, subject to review every 3 years. I do not believe \nthis will be the case, however, because the approach creates a clear \nincentive for treatment vendors to develop affordable equipment for the \nmarket. Since ballast technology will be always evolving, it is \nimportant that the EPA review and revise the standard so that it \nreflects what is the best technology currently available and whether it \nis economically achievable. Shipowners cannot be expected to upgrade \ntheir equipment upon every few years as technology develops, however, \nso the law provides an approval period of at least 10 years.\n  There are other important provisions of the bill as well. The bill \nrequires the Army Corps of Engineers to construct and operate the \nChicago Ship and Sanitary Canal project which includes the construction \nof a second dispersal barrier to keep species like the Asian carp from \nmigrating up the Mississippi through the canal into the Great Lakes. \nEqually important, this barrier will prevent the migration of invasive \nspecies in the Great Lakes from proceeding into the Mississippi system. \nThe bill establishes an experimental ballast treatment approval process \nto take effect immediately so that the treatment technology industry \ncan begin full-scale experimental installations of treatments on ships. \nThe bill authorizes additional funding for better coordinated research \nto find effective means of combating invasive species. It would help \nFederal, State, and regional authorities guard against future invasions \nby developing early detection monitoring and rapid response plans. And \nit provides funding for outreach and education programs to inform the \npublic and marina owners about the dangers of inadvertently carrying \naquatic invaders on the hulls of recreational boats or dumping bait \nbuckets into the Lakes.\n  Invasive species threaten the region's biological diversity and are \nan economic drain. Estimates of the annual economic damage caused \nnationwide by invasive species go as high as $137 billion. Because of \nthe system of canals connecting the Great Lakes to the Mississippi \nRiver and the Atlantic Ocean, there are no physical barriers to block \nthe spread of invasive species, making the Great Lakes highly \nvulnerable. Because of the frequency of ships entering into the Great \nLakes, though, our region is often ``ground zero,'' and once an exotic \nspecies establishes itself, it is almost impossible to eradicate and \nsometimes difficult to prevent from moving throughout the nation. \nTherefore, prevention is the key to controlling new introductions.\n  All in all, the bill would cost between $160 million and $170 million \neach year. This is a lot of money, but it is a critical investment. As \nthose of us from the Great Lakes know, the economic damage that \ninvasive species can cause is much greater. However, compared to the \n$137 billion annual cost of invasive species, the cost of this bill is \nminimal. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation \nand work to move the bill swiftly through the Senate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, from Pickerel Pond to Lake Auburn, from \nSebago Lake to Bryant Pond, lakes and ponds in Maine are under attack. \nAquatic invasive species threaten Maine's drinking water system, \nrecreation, wildlife habitat, lakefront real estate, and fisheries. \nPlants, such as variable leaf milfoil, are crowding out native species. \nInvasive Asian shore crabs are taking over southern New England's tidal \npools, and just last year began their advance into Maine--to the \npotential detriment of Maine's lobster and clam industries.\n  Maine and many other States are attempting to fight back against \nthese invasions. Unfortunately, their efforts have frequently been of \nlimited success. As with national security, protecting the integrity of \nour lakes, streams, and coastlines from invading species cannot be \naccomplished by individual States alone. We need a uniform, nationwide \napproach to deal effectively with invasive species.\n  Today I am pleased to join Senator Levin in introducing the National \nAquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003. This bill would create the most \ncomprehensive nationwide approach to date for combating alien species \nthat invade our shores.\n  The stakes are high when invasive species are unintentionally \nintroduced into our Nation's waters. They endanger ecosystems, reduce \nbiodiversity, and threaten native species. They disrupt people's lives \nand livelihoods by lowering property values, impairing commercial \nfishing and aquaculture, degrading recreational experiences, and \ndamaging public water supplies.\n  In the 1950s, European green crabs swarmed the Maine coast and \nliterally ate the bottom out of Maine's soft-shell clam industry by the \n1980s. Many clam diggers were forced to go after other fisheries or \nfind new vocations. In just one decade, this invader reduced the number \nof clam diggers in Maine from nearly 5,000 in the 1940s to fewer than \n1500 in the 1950s. European green crabs currently cost an estimated $44 \nmillion a year in damage and control efforts in the United States.\n  Past invasions forewarn of the long-term consequences to our \nenvironment and communities unless we take steps to prevent new \ninvasions. It is too late\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nto stop European green crabs from taking hold on the east coast, but we \nstill have the opportunity to prevent many other species from taking \nhold in Maine and the United States.\n  Three months ago, in the town of Limerick, ME, one of North America's \nmost aggressive invasive species--hydrilla--was found in Pickeral Pond. \nHydrilla can quickly dominate its new ecosystem--already hydrilla \ncovers 60 percent of the bottom of Pickerel Pond from the shoreline out \nto 6 feet deep. Never before detected in Maine, this stubborn and fast-\ngrowing aquatic plant threatens Pickerel Pond's recreational use for \nswimmers and boaters, and could spread to nearby lakes and ponds. \nUnfortunately, eradication of hydrilla is nearly impossible, so we must \nnow work to prevent further infestation in the State.\n\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003 is the most \ncomprehensive effort ever to address the threat of invasive species. By \nauthorizing $836 million over 6 years, this legislation would open \nnumerous new fronts in our war against invasive species. The bill \ndirects the Coast Guard to develop regulations that will end the easy \ncruise of invasive species into U.S. waters through the ballast water \nof international ships, and would provide the Coast Guard with $6 \nmillion per year to develop and implement these regulations.\n  The bill also would provide $30 million per year for a grant program \nto assist State efforts to prevent the spread of invasive species. It \nwould provide $12 million per year for the Army Corps of Engineers and \nFish and Wildlife Service to contain and control invasive species. \nFinally, the Levin-Collins bill would authorize $30 million annually \nfor research, education, and outreach.\n  The most effective means of stopping invading species is to attack \nthem before they attack us. We need an early alert, rapid response \nsystem to combat invading species before they have a chance to take \nhold. For the first time, this bill would establish a national \nmonitoring network to detect newly introduced species, while providing \n$25 million to the Secretary of the Interior to create a rapid response \nfund to help States and regions respond quickly once invasive species \nhave been detected. This bill is our best effort at preventing the next \nwave of invasive species from taking hold and decimating industries and \ndestroying waterways in Maine and throughout the country.\n  One of the leading pathways for the introduction of aquatic organisms \nto U.S. waters from abroad is through transoceanic vessels. Commercial \nvessels fill and release ballast tanks with seawater as a means of \nstabilization. The ballast water contains live organisms from plankton \nto adult fish that are transported and released through this pathway. \nThe bill we are introducing today would establish a framework to \nprevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species by ships.\n  Currently, the U.S. is in negotiations with the international \ncommunity on the development and implementation of an international \nprogram for preventing the unintentional introduction and spread of \nnon-indigenous species through ballast water. I commend American \nnegotiators for working with the international community to address \nthis global problem. This legislation offers a strong framework that \nthe U.S. should use as a model in negotiating this important \ninternational convention. The U.S. Government must ensure that the \ninternational convention will be at least as protective as the \nlegislation we are introducing today. The United States must take the \nmost protective action possible to protect our waters, ecosystems, and \nindustries from destructive invasive species before it is too late.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003, NAISA.\n  During the 107th Congress, I introduced S. 1034, the Great Lakes \nEcology Protection Act which sought to curb the influx of invasive \nspecies into the Great Lakes. This is an immense task, as more then 87 \nnonindigenous aquatic species have been accidentally introduced into \nthe Great Lakes in the past century. I am proud to say that this bill \nhad strong bipartisan support with 12 Great Lakes Senators as original \ncosponsors.\n  Today, I am proud to join Senator Levin as an original cosponsor of \nNIASA which will provide a national strategy for preventing invasive \nspecies from being introduced in the Great Lakes and our Nation's \nwaters. I am pleased that NIASA incorporates many of the ideas from the \nGreat Lakes Ecology Protection Act in formulating a national standard.\n  Invasive species have had a devastating economic and ecological \nimpact on the United States. They have already damaged the Great Lakes \nin a number of ways. They have destroyed thousands of fish and \nthreatened our clean drinking water.\n  For example, Lake Michigan once housed the largest self-producing \nlake trout fishery in the entire world. The invasive sea lamprey, which \nwas introduced from ballast water almost 80 years ago, has contributed \ngreatly to the decline of trout and whitefish in the Great Lakes by \nfeeding on and killing native trout species.\n  Today, lake trout must be stocked because they cannot naturally \nreproduce in the lake. Many Great Lakes States have had to place severe \nrestrictions on catching yellow perch because invasive species such as \nthe zebra mussel disrupt the Great Lakes' ecosystem and compete with \nyellow perch for food. The zebra mussel's filtration also increases \nwater clarity, which may be making is easier for predators to prey upon \nthe yellow perch. Moreover, tiny organisms like zooplankton that help \nform the base of the Great Lakes food chain, have declined due to \nconsumption by exploding populations of zebra mussels.\n  We have made progress on preventing the spread of invasive species, \nbut we have not yet solved this problem. NIASA will create a mandatory \nnational ballast water management program to prevent the introduction \nof invasive species into our waters, as well as, encourage the \ndevelopment of new ballast treatment technology to eliminate invasive \nspecies. NIASA also will greatly increase research funding for these \ntreatment and prevention technologies, and provide necessary funding \nand resources for invasive species rapid response plans. In addition, \nthe bill will increase outreach and education to recreational boaters \nand the general public on how to prevent the spread of invasive \nspecies.\n  As Members of the U.S. Congress, we have a responsibility to share in \nthe stewardship of our Nation's natural resources. As a Great Lakes \nSenator, I feel a particularly strong responsibility to protect a \nresource that is not only a source of clean drinking water for more \nthan 30 million people in the Great Lakes, but is vital to Michigan's \neconomy and environment. I am proud to support a bill that will provide \ninnovative solutions and necessary resources to this longstanding \nenvironmental problem, and will also protect our precious water \nresources for the enjoyment and benefit of future generation of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Levin and Senator Snowe in introducing the ``National Aquatic \nInvasive Species Act of 2003.''\n  The waters of the United States continue to face threats from aquatic \ninvasive species. Invasive species take both an economic and an \nenvironmental toll. The United States and Canada are spending $14 \nmillion a year just to try to control sea lamprey, a species that has \ninvaded Lake Champlain and the Great Lakes. The environmental costs are \nalso staggering. Invasive species usually have high reproductive rates, \ndisperse easily, and can tolerate a wide range of environmental \nconditions, making them very difficult to eradicate. They often lack \npredators in their new environment and out-compete native species for \nprey or breeding sites.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will build on programs \nestablished over the last decade and focus much of our attention and \nresources on preventing invasive species from entering our aquatic \necosystems. This legislation establishes a mandatory ballast water \nmanagement program for the entire country; makes federal funds and \nresources available for rapid response to the introduction of invasive \nspecies and for prevention, control and research.\n  Increased funding and resources for dispersal barrier projects and \nresearch to prevent the interbasin transfer of\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\norganisms is of particular importance in my State of Vermont. We, along \nwith New York, are home to one of this country's most beautiful lakes--\nLake Champlain. However, zebra mussels, Eurasian water milfoil, water \nchestnuts, and sea lamprey have invaded Lake Champlain and are having a \ndevastating impact. Like most who visit Lake Champlain, these species \nwant to call it home, but we cannot compromise the health of the lake. \nExamining the feasibility and effectiveness of a dispersal barrier in \nthe Lake Champlain Canal to control the dispersal of invasive species \nin the lake is another avenue toward preventing further destructive \ndispersal of these species.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and in the Senate to move this important \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Coleman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to Medicare+Choice plans for special needs medicare \nbeneficiaries by allowing plans to target enrollment to special needs \nbeneficiaries; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed \nto provide assistance to vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries: the \nMedicare Improvements for Special Needs Beneficiaries Act of 2003. This \nlegislation will improve access to health care for frail and elderly \nMedicare beneficiaries who reside in nursing homes or their local \ncommunities.\n  Approximately 6 million Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid coverage. Known as ``dual eligibles,'' these \nbeneficiaries are the most vulnerable group of Medicare recipients. \nThey are elderly or disabled and poor. Many have serious health \nconcerns and complex medical, social, and long-term care needs. As a \nresult, dual eligibles represent a disproportionate share of Medicare \nspending.\n  To address the concerns of dual eligibles, a small number of health \nplans specialize in providing quality coordinated care to frail, \nelderly Medicare beneficiaries through demonstrations and the \nMedicare+Choice Program. These specialized plans include innovative \nclinical models of care that improve care and health outcomes while \nreducing medical costs. Today, approximately 25,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries, most of whom reside in nursing homes, receive their \nhealth care through these specialized plans.\n  Through these plans, physicians and nurse practitioners work together \nto provide as much primary, preventive, and acute care as possible on \nsite--in a nursing home facility or in the patient's home. For those \nbeneficiaries residing in nursing homes, this means fewer trips to the \nemergency room; for those still living at home, it delays nursing home \nplacement. If enrollees can be treated successfully without a trip to \nthe hospital or placement in a nursing home, they remain healthier and \ncosts to the Medicare Program are reduced.\n  Currently, these specialized plans are facing regulatory barriers \nthat prevent them from becoming permanent Medicare+Choice Program \noptions. The Medicare Improvements for Special Needs Beneficiaries Act \nprovides improved beneficiary access to Medicare+Choice plans by \nremoving these barriers and allowing plans to specialize in serving \ndual eligible, institutionalized, and other frail beneficiaries. \nSpecifically, the bill would allow a special Medicare+Choice program \ndesignation so these plans may continue to target enrollment to the \nfrail elderly and provide appropriate health care to this vulnerable \npopulation.\n  Both the President and Members of Congress have stated their \ncommitments to improving services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. \nIn fact, when President Bush visited Minneapolis last July, he \nexpressed his strong support for the Evercare program by saying that \n``government should act to strengthen these private health insurance \noptions, not replace them. By relying on competition and patient's \nchoice and innovative programs like Evercare, we will protect our \nseniors now, and offer many new lifesaving services to seniors in the \nfuture and preserve our private health care system.''\n  These specialized programs are fulfilling the original promise of the \nMedicare+Choice Program to not only protect our Medicare beneficiaries \nbut, in addition, these program improve health care quality and lower \nhealth care costs. This legislation is a no-cost way to continue this \neffort. Evercare plans serve a unique and valuable purpose for a \nvulnerable segment of our society. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 528. A bill to reauthorize funding for maintenance of public roads \nused by school buses serving certain Indian reservations; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian \nSchool Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2003. This bill \ncontinues an important Federal program begun in TEA-21 that addresses a \nunique problem with the roads in and around the Nation's single largest \nIndian reservation and the neighboring counties. Through this program, \nNavajo children who had been prevented from getting to school by \nfrequently impassable roads are now traveling safely to and from their \nschools. Because of the unusual nature of this situation, I believe it \nmust continue to be addressed at the Federal level.\n  I would like to begin with some statistics on this unique problem and \nwhy I believe a Federal solution continues to be necessary. The Navajo \nNation is by far the Nation's largest Indian reservation, covering \n25,000 square miles. Portions of the Navajo Nation are in three States: \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. No other reservation comes anywhere \nclose to the size of Navajo. To give you an idea of its size, the State \nof West Virginia is about 24,000 square miles. In fact, 10 States are \nsmaller in size than the Navajo reservation.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about 9,800 miles of \npublic roads serve the Navajo Nation. Only about one-fifth of these \nroads are paved. The remaining 7,600 miles, 78 percent, are dirt roads. \nEvery day schoolbuses use nearly all of these roads to transport Navajo \nchildren to and from school.\n  About 6,400 miles of the roads on the Navajo reservation are BIA \nroads, and about 2,500 miles are State and county roads. All public \nroads within, adjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including \nBIA, State, and county roads are considered part of the Federal Indian \nreservation road system. However, only BIA roads are eligible for \nFederal maintenance funding from BIA. Moreover, construction funding \nand improvement funding from the Federal Lands Highways Program in TEA-\n21 is generally applied only to BIA or tribal roads. Thus, the States \nand counties are responsible for maintenance and improvement of their \n2,500 miles of roads that serve the reservation.\n  The counties in the three States that include the Navajo reservation \nare simply not in a position to maintain all of the roads on the \nreservation that carry children to and from school. Nearly all of the \nland area in these counties is under Federal or tribal jurisdiction.\n  For example, in my State of New Mexico, three-quarters of McKinley \nCounty is either tribal or Federal land, including BLM, Forest Service, \nand military land. The Indian land area alone comprises 61 percent of \nMcKinley County. Consequently, the county can draw upon only a very \nlimited tax base as a source of revenue for maintenance purposes. Of \nthe nearly 600 miles of county-maintained roads in McKinley County, 512 \nmiles serve Indian land.\n  In San Juan County, UT, the Navajo Nation comprises 40 percent of the \nland area. The county maintains 611 miles of roads on the Navajo \nNation. Of these, 357 miles are dirt, 164 miles are gravel, and only 90 \nmiles are paved. On the reservation, the county has three high schools, \ntwo elementary schools, two BIA boarding schools and four preschools.\n  The situation is similar in neighboring San Juan County, NM, as well, \nApache, Navajo, and Coconino Counties, AZ. In light of the counties' \nlimited resources, I do believe the Federal\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nGovernment is asking the States and counties to bear too large a burden \nfor road maintenance in this unique situation.\n  Families living in and around the reservation are no different from \nfamilies anywhere else; their children are entitled to the same \nopportunity to get to school safely and to get a good education. \nHowever, the many miles of unpaved and deficient roads on the \nreservation are frequently impassable, especially when they are wet, \nmuddy, or snowy. If the schoolbuses don't get through, the kids simply \ncannot get to school.\n  These children are literally being left behind.\n  Because of the vast size of the Navajo reservation, the cost of \nmaintaining the county roads used by the school buses is more than the \ncounties can bear without Federal assistance. I believe it is essential \nthat the Federal Government help these counties deal with this one-of-\na-kind situation.\n  In response to this unique situation, in 1998 Congress began \nproviding direct annual funding to the counties that contain the Navajo \nreservation to help ensure that children on the reservation can get to \nand from their public schools. The funding was included at my request \nin section 1214(d) of TEA-21. Under this provision, $1.5 million is \nmade available each year to be shared equally among the three States. \nThe funding is provided directly to the counties in Arizona, New \nMexico, and Utah that contain the Navajo reservation. I want to be very \nclear: these Federal funds can be used only on roads that are located \nwithin or that lead to a reservation, that are on the State or county \nmaintenance system, and that serve as schoolbus routes.\n  This program has been very successful. For the last 6 years, the \ncounties have used the annual funding to help maintain the routes used \nby school-buses to carry children to school and to Head Start programs. \nI had an opportunity in 1998 to see first hand the importance of this \nfunding when I rode in a schoolbus over some of the roads that are \nmaintained using funds from this program.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides a simple 6-year \nreauthorization of that program, with a modest increase in the annual \nfunding to allow for inflation and for additional roads to be \nmaintained in each of the three States.\n  I believe that continuing this program for 6 more years is fully \njustified because of the vast area of the Navajo reservation--by far \nthe Nation's largest--and the unique nature of this need that only the \nFederal Government can deal with effectively.\n  I don't believe any child wanting to get to and from school safely \nshould have to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly \nin rural and remote areas, face enough barriers to getting a good \neducation. I ask all Senators to join me in assuring that Navajo \nschoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school safely and get \nan education.\n  My bill has the support of the Southeastern Utah Association of Local \nGovernments and the Tri-State County Association of New Mexico, \nArizona, and Utah. I ask unanimous consent that letters and resolutions \nfrom New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  I am pleased that Congressmen Tom Udall of New Mexcio, Rick Renzi of \nArizona, and James David Matheson of Utah are introducing a companion \nbill today in the House.

Jeff Bingaman\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Hon. Jeff Bingaman: The Gallup McKinley County Schools \n     serve over 15 thousand students, of which over 10 thousand \n     are bussed daily. Our District's school buses travel 9,250 \n     miles daily, one way. Several miles of these roads are \n     primitive dirt roads with poor or no drainage. Several do not \n     have guard rails and some are not maintained by any entity. \n     The inability to safely negotiate school buses over these \n     roads during wet, muddy and snowy conditions greatly \n     restricts our ability to provide adequate services for \n     families living along these particular roadways. Funding for \n     school bus route road maintenance is vital to providing safe \n     and efficient transportation for thousands of students \n     throughout our County.\n       The School bus route maintenance programs have helped \n     tremendously. Our County Roads Division (McKinley County) has \n     been extremely helpful in maintaining hundreds of miles of \n     bus route roads. The route improvements completed recently in \n     the North Coyote Canyon, Mexican Springs, Johnson loop, \n     Tohlakal, CR-1, Crestview, lyanbito and Bluewell have \n     provided us with the ability to safely negotiate these areas \n     and transport hundreds of students to various schools.\n       The School bus route program is a very important program. \n     Our County Roads division worked diligently to provide safe \n     access and passage for our school districts 160 school buses. \n     Without the school bus route program, it would be impossible \n     to maintain safe conditions on these roads. To insure the \n     safety of our school children and families, it is imperative \n     that the reauthorization of the TEA-21 Bill be realized.\n       Your help in sponsoring Bills, which address the unique \n     situations with respect to school bus route roads, have been \n     greatly appreciated. Your continuing support of the school \n     bus route program (TEA-21 Bill) will enable us to continue to \n     safely and efficiently transport our students. It is through\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n     these cooperative efforts that we are able to serve the \n     hundreds of families living in our County. Thank you for your \n     continued efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ben Chavez,\n     Support Services Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           County of McKinley,\n\n                                  Gallup, N.M., December 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re: Indian School Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of \n         2003.\n\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Board of Commissioners supports \n     your proposed Bill entitled, Indian School Bus Route Safety \n     Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n       Currently, TEA-21 has provided a pilot program for the \n     Counties in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah with funds to help \n     maintain school routes accessing the Navajo Nation. This \n     support has allowed McKinley County to improve an average of \n     six miles per year.\n       The Gallup McKinley County Schools operates 143 school \n     buses on a weekday basis traveling 16,070 miles daily. The \n     Navajo Nation also operates a bus network for their Headstart \n     Programs.\n       Our residents who live in the rural areas of our County \n     depend on these same roads to shop, access medical services \n     and jobs. Improved roads are critical to our region.\n       I appreciate your sponsorship of the Indian School Bus \n     Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Earnest C. Becenti, Sr.,\n     Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           County of McKinley,\n\n                                  Gallup, N.M., December 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC. 20510\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We want to take this opportunity to \n     let you know how grateful McKinley County residents are for \n     your past efforts in obtaining the federal funding received \n     under the TEA-21 Bill. These funds have improved \n     approximately 30 miles of school bus routes that could not \n     have been a reality without them. These roads were improved \n     to all weather standards at an average cost per mile of \n     approximately $60,000. We have enclosed a recap identifying \n     the type of improvements made and expenditures. We have also \n     enclosed a letter from the Gallup-McKinley County Schools \n     identifying the enhancement of these improvements that \n     contribute to the safe transportation of students throughout \n     the County.\n       McKinley County has a total of 511.746 miles of maintained \n     roads that lead to or are within Indian Lands that qualify \n     under the TEA-21 funding. This total reflects that \n     approximately 90 percent of McKinley County roads on the \n     maintenance system serve the vast Indian population in rural \n     McKinley County. The TEA-21 funding received thus far has \n     improved approximately 5 percent of these miles; leaving \n     approximately 95 percent of the remaining miles to be \n     improved. As you can see, the miles improved thus far are \n     small in comparison to the vast needs of McKinley County.\n       The unimproved roads continue to contribute to the number \n     of school days missed during inclement weather at all grade \n     levels, which ultimately contribute to the illiteracy of our \n     young people, and to the high level of unemployment in this \n     area. It is difficult to change these statistics with the \n     insurmountable miles of unimproved roads and the lack of \n     sufficient funding sources. It is also very difficult to \n     attract economic growth to McKinley County and improve the \n     job market and quality of life for families throughout rural \n     McKinley County.\n       We strongly solicit support for the continuation of the \n     TEA-21 allocation for the improvement of school bus routes in \n     our area. Thank you once again for your past and continued \n     support in meeting the needs of McKinley County.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David J. Acosta,\n     Road Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Gallup-McKinley County\n\n\n                                               Public Schools,\n\n                                                December 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Regarding the reauthorization of \n     TEA-21 legislation, I would like to be up front in support of \n     this bill. Our Gallup-McKinley County School District cannot \n     function without a decent roads maintenance program. Our \n     school district has established a good partnership with the \n     McKinley County Commissioners Office. Mr. Irvin Harrison, \n     McKinley County Manager, is very instrumental in addressing \n     the many roads maintenance issues. Of course, the money to do \n     the actual maintenance work comes from the Indian School Bus \n     Route Safety Reauthorization Act.\n       Let me explain why the Gallup-McKinley County Schools \n     consider TEA-21 is practically indispensable. Our district \n     daily transports 9,089 students and covers 16,070 miles. The \n     9,089 students are almost all Native Americans residing on \n     Indian Reservation land or Checker Board Areas. The majority \n     of the roads are dirt or unimproved. Our bus fleet totals 146 \n     and 27 buses are equipped with lifts. Senator, you can \n     imagine how delicate it is to make sure the roads are safe \n     and all-weather condition. On an annual basis, our miles \n     driven exceed 3,047,269. Without the county's roads \n     maintenance program, our buses would deteriorate as quickly \n     as we buy them and absenteeism would climb astronomically. \n     What is so unique about our district is, it's 5000 square \n     miles size and reported unpaved road transportation nears \n     400,000 miles. What the McKinley County Roads Department \n     maintains include grading, placing gravel with some degree of \n     compaction, repair work on drainage appurtenances and \n     providing drainage solutions to rain damaged areas. Gallup-\n     McKinley County School District is still expanding. A new \n     high school is under design in Pueblo Pintado. A safe bridge \n     is absolutely essential right next to the new school site.\n       Senator, I recall 3 years ago that you took a ride in one \n     of our buses west of Gallup. I understand you enjoyed the \n     rough ride. I thank you for taking the time from your busy \n     schedule to visit our school district.\n       I am confident that the reauthorization of TEA-21 will be \n     an historic event because this piece of legislation indeed \n     relates to the No Child Left Behind initiative. All weather \n     and safe roads provide the means to get the children to \n     school on time. Absentees and tardiness are discouraged with \n     a reliable transportation to school. I urge your colleagues \n     to jump on the bandwagon and support the Indian School Bus \n     Route Safety Reauthorization Act of 2003. Please call me if \n     you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen S.

The Rock Springs Chapter is a certified chapter and \n     recognized by the Navajo Nation Council, pursuant to CAP-34-\n     98, the Navajo Nation Council adopted the Navajo Nation Local \n     governance act (LGA) which directs local chapters to promote \n     all matters that affect the local community members and to \n     make appropriate decisions, recommendation and advocate on \n     their behalf, and;\n       2. The Rock Springs Chapter is requesting and recommending \n     to the United States Senators, Honorable Jeff Bingaman and \n     Honorable Pete Dominci to Re-authorize the TEA-21 bill for \n     Continued funding to the County of McKinley, State of New \n     Mexico for improvement of school bus routes leading to and \n     within the Navajo Indian Reservation which is supported by \n     Rock Springs Chapter Community, and;\n       3. The Rock Springs Chapter is established to plan, \n     promote, and coordinate the community, economic, and social \n     development for the community, including an oversight of \n     coordinator and support for federal, state, tribal, and other \n     programs and entities; and\n       4. The Rock Springs Chapter Community are highly concerned \n     of their students attendance due to poor road conditions, \n     lack of improving and maintaining bus routes and how it \n     effects the daily transports of students as well as daily \n     travel for community members, and:\n       5. There are vest miles of (dirt roads) school bus routes \n     that still require improvement. Poor roads contribute to poor \n     education, health issues, economic growth, unemployment, and \n     fatalities in our rural (community) county.\n       Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved:\n       1. The Rock Springs Chapter strongly supports the foregoing \n     resolution to the United States Senators, Honorable Jeff \n     Bingaman and Honorable Pete Dominici to Re-authorize the TEA-\n     21 Bill for Continued funding to the County of McKinley, \n     State of New Mexico for improvement of school bus routes \n     leading to and within the Navajo Indian Reservation.\n       2. The Rock springs Chapter Community hereby supports the \n     continuation of improving and upgrading the vast miles of \n     dirt roads school bus routes.\n\n\n                              certification\n\n       We, hereby certify that the foregoing resolution was duly \n     presented and considered by the Rock Springs Chapter at duly \n     called chapter meeting at Rock Springs Chapter, New Mexico \n     (Navajo Nation) at which a quorum was present and the same \n     was passed with a vote of 33 in favor, 00 opposed and 00 \n     abstained on this 18th of February, 2003.\n     Raymond Emerson,\n       Chapter President.\n     Harriett K.

Jeff Bingaman\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Indian School Bus Route Safety Reauthorization Act of \n         2003.\n\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: San Juan County, Utah wants to \n     express our appreciation to you for your efforts to secure \n     funding to improve the Indian School Bus Routes. San Juan \n     County has approximately 25% of the total land area on the \n     Utah portion of the Navajo Nation.\n       The County is currently maintaining 611 miles of roads on \n     the Navajo Nation. 357 miles are natural surface, 164 miles \n     are of a gravel surface and 90 miles are paved. Most of these \n     roads are used by school bus in the transportation of \n     students to and from the different schools.\n       The County has three high schools that are operated by the \n     San Juan School District on the Utah portion of the Navajo \n     Nation (Whitehorse High School in Montezuma Creek, Monument \n     Valley High School in Monument Valley and Navajo Mountain \n     High School in Navajo Mountain). In addition, the school \n     district has two elementary schools located in Halchita, near \n     Mexican Hat and in Montezuma Creek. The Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs has two boarding schools that also operate within the \n     County boundaries at Aneth and Navajo Mountain. In addition \n     there are pre-schools that are located in Monument Valley, \n     Halchita, Toda, and montezuma Creek.\n       One major example of these funds that have been previously \n     used was to pave the nearly six mile section of road in the \n     Navajo Mountain area. Navajo Mountain is an isolated \n     community located in the southwestern corner of San Juan \n     County. There is a single highway in and out of the \n     community, with the nearest community located over seventeen \n     miles to the south in Arizona. The road still is dirt for ten \n     miles south of the Utah boundary, but the County was able to \n     pave the road on the Utah side this past year making the road \n     passable year round and greatly improving the safety for the \n     students and residents.\n       We would strongly encourage the \n     re-authorization of these funds for this important need.\n       Very truly,\n     Ty Lewis,\n       Commissioner.\n     Manuel Morgan,\n       Commissioner.\n     Lynn H. Stevens,\n       Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              San Juan County,\n\n                                       Aztec, NM, January 9, 2003.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Hon. Senator Bingaman:\n       We are aware that Congress will be considering bills to \n     reauthorize the TEA-21 funding for local roads that provide \n     access to the Navajo Reservation. These funds are of special \n     significance to San Juan County.\n       The Public Works Department of San Juan County regularly \n     maintains over 400 miles of roads that are adjacent to or \n     provide access to the Navajo Reservation. These roads are \n     critical to the population in the service areas. School buses \n     depend on our County workers to keep the roads maintained and \n     to provide other essential services.\n       Over the past five years, we have received $953,688 from \n     the TEA-21 program for the maintenance of roads and bridges \n     in these areas. The assistance received under this program \n     will be crucial if we wish to continue to provide these much \n     needed services to the residents on the Navajo Reservation \n     and their visitors.\n       I would like to thank you for your hard work on behalf of \n     the citizens on San Juan County and urge you to support \n     legislation that would extend the TEA-21 Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tony Atkinson,\n     County Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Navajo County Board of Supervisors,\n\n                                  Holbrook, AZ, December 18, 2002.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: TEA-21 Funding for Maintenance of School Bus Routes.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Navajo County has used the TEA-21 \n     funding since its inception to maintain school bus routes \n     located on reservation lands within the county. In order to \n     best use these funds, we have entered into agreements with \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs and various established school \n     districts. These agreements allow us to expand the budgets \n     for roads in the school districts and receive maximum benefit \n     for funds spent.\n       The funding to date has been spent as follows: Funding of \n     road worker salaries--$63,226; Purchase of road working \n     equipment--$215,651; Purchase of road building materials--\n     $173,313.\n       The material, labor and equipment helps to maintain over \n     1,300 miles of school bus routes. Even though these funds are \n     extremely helpful, the current amount of funding is \n     inadequate to meet the needs that are encountered in these \n     remote lands.\n       Navajo County fully supports your efforts to not only \n     continue the present funding, but also the efforts to \n     increase the annual amount. If this funding was not \n     available, the school children on the reservation would be \n     the ones who suffer.\n       Please continue your efforts to enhance the TEA-21 funds. \n     If you need further information, please call me at (928) 524-\n     4053.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jesse Thompson,\n     Supervisor.\n                                  ____\n\n\nResolution of the Tri-State County Association (New Mexico, Arizona and \n                                 Utah)\n\n       Whereas, the Tri-State County Association met on September \n     20, 2002, in St. Michael's Arizona, to discuss the proposed \n     Bill by Senator Jeff Bingaman cited as the ``Tribal \n     Transportation Program Improvement Act of 2002''; and,\n       Whereas, Counties in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, are \n     faced with maintaining miles of unpaved roads serving \n     Federally owned land or Indian Reservations; and\n       Whereas, Section 1214 of Transportation Equity Act for the \n     21st Century priovided $1.5 Million per year beginning \n     October 1, 1998, for six years; to eligible Counties to \n     maintain public raods which provide access to an Indian \n     Reservation or is used by school buses to transport children \n     to Headstart Programs; and,\n       Whereas, Congress has designated the Secretary of \n     Transportation to divide each fiscal year the $1.5 Million \n     equally between the States of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, \n     through the State Highway Department of State Department of \n     Transportation to eligible Counties (San Juan and McKinley, \n     NM; Navajo, Apache, Coconino, AZ; and San Juan, UT.); and,\n       Whereas, Each County receiving the special appropriation \n     were able to complete additional schools bus route \n     improvements on roads that would not have been improved \n     otherwise; and\n       Whereas, the need for school bus route improvements greatly \n     exceed the annual allocation provided for each County and the \n     allocation should be increased under the reauthorization of \n     the Transportation Bill.\n       Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, by the Tri-State County Association, to support \n     the ``Tribal Transportation Program Improvement Act of \n     2002,'' as proposed by Senator Jeff Bingaman, which includes \n     additional funding for maintenance of school bus routes on \n     Indian Reservations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 State of New Mexico County of McKinley\n\n       Whereas, the Board of Commissioners did meet in regular \n     session on February 27, 2001; and\n       Whereas, Section 1214(d) of the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21) provides additional funding for \n     States that have within their boundaries all or part of an \n     Indian Reservation having a land area of 10,000,000 acres or \n     more; and,\n       Whereas, the only Indian Reservation meeting this criteria \n     is the Navajo Indian Reservation in Arizona, New Mexico and \n     Utah; and ,\n       Whereas, the three States equally divide the $1,500,000 \n     among the various Counties to maintain public roads which are \n     within, adjacent to, or accessing the Navajo Indian \n     Reservation which are used to transport children to or from a \n     school or Headstart Program and are maintained by the County; \n     and\n       Whereas, McKinley County has demonstrated the fiscal \n     capacity to implement and administer funds allocated through \n     the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department to \n     complete 19.3 miles through FY-00.\n       Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, by the Board of Commissioners or McKinley County, \n     to request Congressional support to increase the allocation \n     under Section 1214(d) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (TEA-210 to improve school bus routes \n     within, adjacent to, or accessing, the Navajo Reservation \n     after FY-03.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Smith, \n        Mr. Wyden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, and \n        Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 529. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income loan payments received under the National Health \nService Corps Loan Repayment Program established in the Public Health \nService Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Craig Thomas \nto introduce legislation that would exclude loan repayments made \nthrough the National Health Service Corps from taxable income. I am \npleased that Senators Leahy, Smith, Wyden, Snowe, Durbin, Hagel, \nRoberts, and Chambliss are also cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  There have been many developments in the area of health care in the \nlast few years from managed care reform, to increases in biomedical \nresearch, the mapping of the human genome, and the use of exciting new \ntechnologies in both rural and urban areas such as telemedicine. In \nfact, it seems that almost every day we hear of astounding new \nscientific breakthroughs. But unfortunately, while we are making great\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nstrides in the quality of health care, we are losing ground on the \naccess to health care for so many.\n  The sad truth is that there are currently 38.7 million Americans \nwithout health insurance coverage--9.2 million of whom are children. In \nWashington, before the recession, 13.3 percent of the population, and \n155,000 children, lacked health insurance. That is undoubtedly higher \ntoday.\n  Access to health insurance for the uninsured is of the utmost \nimportance--we know that at the very least, health insurance means the \ndifference between timely and delayed treatment and at worst between \nlife and death. In fact, the uninsured are four times as likely as the \ninsured to delay or forego needed care--and uninsured children are six \ntimes as likely as insured children to go without needed medical care.\n  But even insurance isn't enough if there are no available providers. \nHospitals and other health care providers across the country are facing \nan increasingly uncertain future. The sad truth is that it is \nincreasingly more difficult to recruit health care providers to work \nwith underserved communities--especially in rural areas. In addition to \neconomic pressures, rural areas must overcome the environmental issues \ninvolved with recruiting a doctor who may have been raised, educated, \nand trained in an urban setting.\n  The National Health Service Corps was created in 1970 by Senator \nWarren Magnuson, one of the most distinguished Senators to come from \nWashington State. He saw the need to put primary care clinicians in \nrural communities and inner-city neighborhoods, and developed this \nprogram to fill that need.\n  Since then, the Corps has placed over 22,000 health professionals in \nrural or urban health professions shortage areas. There is no doubt \nthat National Health Service Corps has been extremely successful. In \nfact, the most recent available data show that more than 70 percent of \nproviders continued to provide services to underserved communities \nafter their Corps obligation was fulfilled--80 percent of these health \ncare providers stayed in the community in which they had originally \nbeen placed.\n  During the last August recess, I had the opportunity to travel \nthroughout Washington State and held 15 community discussions on health \ncare. I met patients who would not have access to health services but \nfor the providers there through the Corps and I met many doctors who \nhave been living in our rural communities for years because of their \nCorps' placements. And because it has been so successful--right now in \nWashington State there are 75 physicians or other health professionals \nworking in underserved areas that would not otherwise be here--we must \ndo everything possible to support this program.\n  Under current law, the National Health Service Corps provides \nscholarships, loan repayments, and stipends for clinicians who agree to \nserve in urban and rural communities with severe shortages of health \ncare providers. In 1986 the IRS ruled that all payments made under the \nprogram are considered taxable income. Understanding the immediate \ndetriment to scholarship recipients, who were forced to pay the tax out \nof their own pockets, Congress eliminated the scholarship tax in 2001. \nAnd while the scholarship program is now not considered taxable income \nto the IRS, the loan repayments and stipends are.\n  By statute, the current loan program awards also include a tax \nassistance payment equal to 39 percent of the loan repayment amount, \nwhich is to be used by the recipient offset his or tax liability \nresulting from the loan repayment ``income.'' This means that nearly 40 \npercent of the Federal loan repayment budget goes to pay taxes on the \nloan repayment ``income'' alone. If these Federal payments were not \ntaxed, and the funding was freed up, more health professions students \ncould take advantage of the loan repayment program, and could be placed \nin shortage areas, thereby increasing access to health care in both \nurban and rural areas.\n  This is not a new problem. The tax burden that accompanies the \nNational Health Service Corps loan payments is a significant deterrent \nto increasing the number of clinicians enrolling in the Corps. I do not \nwant to see a situation where, as happened several years ago, over 300 \napplicants actually left underserved areas because the Corps could not \nfully fund the loan repayment program.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, the National Health Service \nCorps Loan Repayment Act, would address this disincentive, making the \nCorps available to more medical and health professionals, and thereby \nbringing more providers into underserved areas. If loan repayments are \nexcluded from taxation, the National Health Service Corps will have \ngreater resources to provide aid to health professionals seeking loan \nrepayment, and will be able to increase the number of providers in \nunderserved areas.\n  There is no doubt that strengthening the National Health Service \nCorps is a win-win situation. Corps scholarships help finance education \nfor future primary care providers interested in serving the \nunderserved. In return, graduates serve those communities where the \nneed for primary health care is greatest.\n  The bill is supported by over 20 national organizations including the \nNational Rural Health Association, the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers, the Association of American Medical Colleges, \nand the American Medical Student Association. I am especially pleased \nthat the Washington State Medical Association is supporting this bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that the complete list be included in the \nRecord after my statement.\n  I understand that there are no easy solutions to the health care \nproblems we are facing right now. But we need to do something--even if \nit is taking small steps forward, and come in at this problem from many \ndifferent angles.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this bill and to join us in expanding \nthis vitally important and immediately successful program.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am pleased to rise today to introduce the National \nHealth Service Corps Loan Repayment Act with my colleague from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell. Specifically, this legislation will exclude \nloan repayments made through National Health Service Corps, NHSC, \nprogram from taxable income. Enactment of the National Health Service \nCorps Loan Repayment Act would increase the amount of Federal dollars \navailable so more students could participate in the NHSC program.\n  Under current law, the NHSC provides scholarships, loan repayments, \nand stipends for clinicians who agree to serve in national designated \nunderserved urban and rural communities. The tax law changes in 1986 \nresulted in the IRS ruling that all NHSC payments were taxable. \nCongress eliminated the tax on the scholarship in 2001, but the loan \nrepayments and stipends continue to be taxed.\n  To assist loan repayment recipients with their tax burden, the NHSC \nloan program includes an additional payment equal to 39 percent of the \nloan repayment amount so the loan repayment recipient can pay his or \nher taxes. Close to 40 percent of the NHSC Federal loan repayment \nbudget goes to pay taxes on the loan repayment ``income.'' The current \nsituation should not be allowed to continue. Given the fiscal \nrestraints we are facing, we must ensure that Federal dollars are spent \nefficiently and effectively. It is obvious that today's NHSC loan \nrepayment structure does not meet that goal. Our legislation resolves \nthis issue.\n  For over 30 years, the National Health Service Corps, NHSC, program \nhas literally been a lifeline for many underserved communities across \nthe country that otherwise would not have a heath care provider. I know \nthis program is critically important to my State of Wyoming and to many \nother rural States that have difficulties recruiting and retaining \nprimary health care clinicians.\n  There are 2,800 health professional shortage areas, 740 mental health \nshortage areas and 1,200 dental health shortage areas now designated \nacross the country. However, the NHSC program is meeting less than 13 \npercent of the current need for primary care providers and less than 6 \npercent of need for mental health and dental services. The National \nHealth Service Corps Loan Repayment Act would increase\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nthe number of students in the program and allow more providers to be \nplaced in these shortage areas.\n  The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Act is crucial to \nthe future well-being of many of our rural communities. I strongly urge \nall my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 530. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to create a \npresumption that a disability or death of a Federal employee in fire \nprotection activities caused by any of certain diseases is the result \nof the performance of such employee's duty; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of thousands of Federal firefighters and emergency response \npersonnel worldwide who, at great risk to their own personal health and \nsafety, protect America's defense, our veterans, Federal wildlands, and \nnational treasures. Although the majority of these important Federal \nemployees work for the Department of Defense, Federal firefighters are \nalso employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Park \nService. From first response emergency care services on military \ninstallations around the world to front-line defense against raging \nforest fires here at home, we call on these brave men and women to \nprotect our national interests.\n  Yet under Federal law, compensation and retirement benefits are not \nprovided to Federal employees who suffer from occupational illnesses \nunless they can specify the conditions of employment which caused their \ndisease. This onerous requirement makes it nearly impossible for \nFederal firefighters, who suffer from occupational diseases, to receive \nfair and just compensation or retirement benefits. The bureaucratic \nnightmare they must endure is burdensome, unnecessary, and in many \ncases, overwhelming. It is ironic and unjust that the very people we \ncall on to protect our Federal interests are not afforded the very best \nhealth care and retirement benefits our Federal Government has to \noffer.\n  Today, I introduced legislation, the Federal Fire Fighters Fairness \nAct of 2003, which amends the Federal Employees Compensation Act to \ncreate a presumptive disability for firefighters who become disabled by \nheart and lung disease, cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, and \ninfectious diseases like tuberculosis and hepatitis. Disabilities \nrelated to the cancers, heart, lung, and infectious diseases enumerated \nin this important legislation would be considered job related for \npurposes of workers compensation and disability retirement--entitling \nthose affected to the health care coverage and retirement benefits that \nthey deserve.\n  Too frequently, the poisonous gases, toxic byproducts, asbestos, and \nother hazardous substances with which Federal firefighters and \nemergency response personnel come in contact, rob them of their health \nlivelihood, and professional careers. The Federal Government should not \nrob them of necessary benefits. Thirty-eight States have already \nenacted a similar disability presumption law for Federal firefighters' \ncounterparts working in similar capacities on the State and local \nlevels.\n  The effort behind the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2003 marks \na significant advancement for firefighter health and safety. Since \nSeptember 11, there has been an enhanced appreciation for the risks \nthat firefighters and emergency response personnel face every day. \nFederal firefighters deserve our highest commendation and it is time to \ndo the right thing for these important Federal employees.\n  The job of firefighting continues to be complex and dangerous. The \nnationwide increase in the use of hazardous materials, the recent rise \nin both natural and manmade disasters, and the threat of terrorism pose \nnew threats to firefighter health and safety. The Federal Fire Fighters \nFairness Act of 2003 will help protect the lives of our firefighters \nand it will provide them with a vehicle to secure their health and \nsafety.\n  I urge my colleagues to embrace this bipartisan effort and support \nthe Federal Fire Fighters Fairness Act of 2003 on behalf of our \nNation's Federal firefighters and emergency response personnel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 531. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \nthe Missouri River Monitoring and Research Program, to authorize the \nestablishment of the Missouri River Basin Stakeholder Committee, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Tim Johnson, is joining me today in introducing this \nMissouri River Enhancement and Monitoring Act of 2003, and I thank him \nfor his efforts in working with me on this legislation. This bill will \nestablish a program to conduct research on, and monitor the health of, \nthe Missouri River to help recover threatened and endangered species, \nsuch as the pallid sturgeon and piping plover.\n  This bill will enable those who are active in the Missouri River \nBasin to collect and analyze baseline data, so that we can monitor \nchanges in the health of the river and in species recovery in future \nyears, as river operations change.\n  The program would also provide an analysis of the social and economic \nimpacts along the river. And it would establish a stakeholder group to \nmake recommendations on the recovery of the Missouri River ecosystem.\n  The bill establishes a cooperative working arrangement between State, \nregional, Federal, tribal entities that are active in the Missouri \nRiver Basin. I look forward to working with all of the stakeholders in \nthe basin to implement this important legislation.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation is supported by a broad \nrange of stakeholders, including the North Dakota State Water \nCommission; the North Dakota Game and Fish Department; the Missouri \nRiver Natural Resources Committee; the Missouri River Basin \nAssociation; the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks; \nAmerican Rivers; and Environmental Defense.\n  I am confident this legislation will enjoy bipartisan support because \nof its significance in helping to monitor and restore the health of \nthis historic river. Lewis and Clark traveled on this river. This river \nalso contributes to $80 million in recreation, fishing, and tourism \nbenefits in the basin. I look forward to participating in hearings on \nthis bill and hope we will be able to pass it into law in the near \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the capacity of organizations working in \nthe United States-Mexico border region to develop affordable housing \nand infrastructure and to foster economic opportunity in the colonias; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto improve the deplorable housing situation in the valley region of the \nTexas border with Mexico. Our colonias are among the most distressed \nareas of the country.\n  In 1993 when I ran for the Senate, I visited with a woman named Elida \nBocanegra who led me through the streets of the colonia where she \nlived. Elida showed me her community and, quite frankly, I couldn't \nbelieve I was in America. Since my election to the Senate, I have \nworked to improve living conditions and the quality of life for people \nsuch as Elida, helping to secure more than $615 million for the \ncolonias of my State. In fact, my first amendment as a Senator \nauthorized $50 million for a colonias clean-up project.\n  Despite third world living conditions, colonias, or underdeveloped \nsubdivisions, have grown in population. Along the 1,248 mile stretch \nfrom Cameron County to El Paso County in Texas, there are more than \n1,400 colonias that suffer from such conditions as open sewage, a lack \nof indoor plumbing, and poor housing construction.\n  The Colonias Gateway Initiative Act establishes annual competitive \ngrants for nonprofit organizations which work to develop affordable \nhousing, improve infrastructure, and foster economic opportunities. My \nbill would authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to \naward $16 million in the fiscal year 2004 and appoint a nine-member \nadvisory board consisting of colonias residents and service providers \nto facilitate communication. This bill will bring quality-of-life \nimprovements to those who need it most, providing\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nthe most basic services like indoor plumbing. It will also provide \nfunds to build affordable housing. This piece of legislation I \nintroduce today will fulfill the most basic needs of these communities. \nAs you can see, the Colonias Gateway Initiative Act will assist our \nneediest people, foster economic opportunity, and vastly improve the \nquality of life. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (E) meet such other criteria as the Secretary may specify.\n       (4) Distribution of funding.--In making the selection under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that--\n       (A) each State in the United States-Mexico border region \n     receives a grant under this Act;

A bill to provide Capitol-flown flags to the families of law \nenforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fallen Law \nEnforcement Officers and Firefighters Flag Memorial Act of 2003.\n  This bill would help honor the sacrifice of the men and women who \nlost their lives in the line of duty by providing Capitol-flown flags \nto the families of deceased law enforcement officers and firefighters.\n  Under this legislation, the family of a deceased law enforcement \nofficer can request from the Attorney General that a flag be flown over \nthe U.S. Capitol in honor of the slain officer. The Department of \nJustice shall pay the cost of the flags, including shipping, out of \ndiscretionary grant funds, and provide them to the victim's family.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know firsthand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face every day on the frontlines protecting our \ncommunities. I also have great appreciation, as the cochair of the \nCongressional Fire Caucus, for the service that our Nation's \nfirefighters provide, day in and day out, and that all too often, they \nend up sacrificing their lives while saving others.\n  I believe providing a Capitol-flown flag is a fitting way to show our \nappreciation for fallen officers and firefighters who make the ultimate \nsacrifice. It also lets their families know that Congress and the \nNation are grateful for their loved one's service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Fallen Law Enforcement Officers and \nFirefighters Flag Memorial Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Law Enforcement \n     Officers and Firefighters Flag Memorial Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CAPITOL-FLOWN FLAGS FOR FAMILIES OF DECEASED LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--The family of a deceased law enforcement \n     officer may request, and the Attorney General shall provide \n     to such family, a Capitol-flown flag, which shall be supplied \n     to the Attorney General by the Architect of the Capitol. The \n     Department of Justice shall pay the cost of such flag, \n     including shipping, out of discretionary grant funds.\n       (2) Effective date.--Paragraph (1) shall take effect on the \n     date on which the Attorney General establishes the procedure \n     required by subsection (b).\n       (b) Procedure.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall establish a \n     procedure (including any appropriate forms) by which the \n     family of a deceased law enforcement officer may request, and \n     provide sufficient information to determine such officer's \n     eligibility for, a Capitol-flown flag.\n       (c) Applicability.--This Act shall only apply to a deceased \n     law enforcement officer who died on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Capitol-flown flag'' means a United States \n     flag flown over the United States Capitol in honor of the \n     deceased law enforcement officer for whom such flag is \n     requested; and\n       (2) the term ``deceased law enforcement officer'' means a \n     person who was charged with protecting public safety, who was \n     authorized to make arrests by a Federal, State, Tribal, \n     county, or local law enforcement agency, and who died while \n     acting in the line of duty.\n\n     SEC. 3. CAPITOL-FLOWN FLAGS FOR FAMILIES OF DECEASED \n                   FIREFIGHTERS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The family of a paid or volunteer \n     firefighter who dies in the line of duty may request, and the \n     Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall \n     provide to such family, a capitol-flown flag, which shall be \n     supplied to the Director by the Architect of the Capitol. The \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency shall pay the cost of \n     such flag, including shipping, out of discretionary grant \n     funds.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     date on which the Attorney General establishes the procedure \n     required by section 2(b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Voinovich, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 536. A bill to establish the National Invasive Species Council, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \nLevin, Collins, Reed, Voinovich, and Stabenow, to introduce the \nNational Invasive Species Council Act--a bill to permanently establish \nthe National Invasive Species Council. The National Invasive Species \nCouncil was established by an Executive order so that the Federal \nGovernment can better coordinate to combat the economic, ecologic, and \nhealth threat of invasive species.\n  Invasive species are a national threat. Estimates of the annual \neconomic damages caused by invasive species in this Nation are as high \nas $137 billion. To combat the serious threats posed by invasive \nspecies, we need Federal coordination and planning. Our bill would \nprovide just that--on a permanent basis. Under this legislation, the \nSecretaries of State, Commerce, Transportation, Agriculture, Health & \nHuman Services, Interior, Defense, and Treasury, along with the \nAdministrators of EPA and USAID, would continue to work together \nthrough the Council to develop a National Invasive Species Management \nPlan.\n  Though the Council can continue to operate and develop invasive \nspecies management plans as they currently do, the GAO reported last \nyear that implementing the national invasive species management plan is \ndifficult because the Council does not have a congressional mandate to \nact. GAO also reported that most of the agencies that have \nresponsibilities under the National Invasive Species Management Plan \nhave been slow to complete activities by the due date established under \nthe plan and the agencies do not always act in a coordinated manner. As \nmy colleagues who are cosponsoring this bill know, invasive species are \ntoo great of a problem to be left unmanaged.\n  The duties of the Council are generally to coordinate Federal \nactivities in an effective, complementary, cost-efficient manner; \nupdate the National Invasive Species Management Plan; ensure that \nFederal agencies implement the management plan; and develop \nrecommendations for international cooperation. Agencies that do not \nimplement the recommendations of the National Invasive Species \nManagement Plan must report to Congress as to why the recommendations \nwere not implemented. The Council is directed to develop guidance for \nFederal agencies on prevention, control, and eradication of invasive \nspecies so that Federal programs and actions do not increase the risk \nof invasion or spread nonindigenous species. And finally, the bill also \nestablishes an Invasive Species Advisory Committee to the Council.\n  Ultimately, with a congressional mandate, the Council can enhance its \neffectiveness and better protect our environment from invasive species. \nI urge my colleagues to cosponsor this measure so that the Federal \nGovernment can improve its response to invasive species threat.\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \nAquatic Invasive Species Act and the National Invasive Species Council \nAct. As a Senator representing a Great Lake State, I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of both of these bills that are critical to the \nfuture of the Great Lakes ecosystem.\n  In my 36 years of public service, one of my greatest sources of \ncomfort and accomplishment has been my work to help clean up and \nprotect the environment, particularly Lake Erie.\n  Lake Erie's ecology has come a long way since I was elected to the \nstate legislature in 1966. During that time, Lake Erie formed the \nnorthern border of my district and it was known worldwide as a dying \nlake, suffering from eutrophication. Lake Erie's decline was covered \nextensively by the media and became an international symbol of \npollution and environmental degradation. I remember the British \nBroadcasting Company even sending a film crew to make a documentary \nabout it. One reason for all the attention is that Lake Erie is a \nsource of drinking water for 11 million people.\n  Seeing firsthand the effects of pollution on Lake Erie and the \nsurrounding region, I knew we had to do more to protect the environment \nfor our children and grandchildren. As a State legislator, I made a \ncommitment to stop the deterioration of the lake and to wage the \n``Second Battle of Lake Erie'' to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great \nLake. I have continued this fight throughout my career as County \nCommissioner, state legislator, Mayor of Cleveland, Governor of Ohio, \nand United States Senator.\n  It is comforting to me that 36 years since I started my career in \npublic service, I am still involved, as a member of the United States \nSenate and our Committee on Environment and Public Works, in the battle \nto save Lake Erie.\n  Today in Ohio, we celebrate Lake Erie's improved water quality. It is \na habitat to countless species of wildlife, a vital resource to the \narea's tourism, transportation, and recreation industries, and the main \nsource of drinking water for many Ohioans. Unfortunately, however, \nthere is still a great deal that needs to be done to improve and \nprotect Ohio's greatest natural asset.\n  Our current enemy is the aquatic invasive species that threaten the \nhealth and viability of the Great Lakes fishery and ecosystem. I am \nworried about these aquatic terrorists in the ballast water that enter \nthe Great Lakes system through boats from all over the world. These \nspecies are already wreaking havoc in the lakes and will continue to do \nso until they are stopped.\n  Since the 1800s, over 145 invasive species have colonized in the \nGreat Lakes. Since 1990, when legislation to address aquatic nuisance \nspecies was first enacted, we have averaged about one new invader each \nyear. Clearly, we have not closed the door to invasive species. I am \ndeeply troubled by the surge in new invasive species in Lake Erie, \nbecause once a species establishes itself, there is virtually no way to \neliminate it.\n  As Mayor of Cleveland in the 1980s, I was alarmed about the \nintroduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes and conducted the \nfirst national meeting to investigate the problem. It is a complicated \nsituation and we are still learning how invasive species like the zebra \nmussel affect the ecosystem.\n  In early August, for example, I conducted a field hearing of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to examine the increasingly \nextensive oxygen depletion or anoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie. \nThis phenomenon has been referred to as a ``dead zone.'' Anoxia over \nthe long term could result in massive fish kills, toxic algae blooms, \nand bad-tasting or bad-smelling water.\n  Anoxia is usually the result of decaying algae blooms which consume \noxygen at the bottom of the lake. In the past, excessive phosphorus \nloading from point sources such as municipal sewage treatment plants \nwere greatly responsible for algae blooms. Since 1965, the level of \nphosphorus entering the Lake has been reduced by about 50 percent. \nThese reductions have resulted in smaller quantities of algae and more \noxygen into the system.\n  In recent years, overall phosphorus levels in the Lake have been \nincreasing, but the amount of phosphorus entering it has not. \nScientists are unable to account for the increased levels of phosphorus \nin the Lake. One hypothesis is the influence of two aquatic nuisance \nspecies the zebra and quagga mussels. Although their influence is not \nwell understood, they may be altering the way phosphorus cycles through \nthe system.\n  Another way zebra mussels could be responsible for oxygen depletion \nin Lake Erie is due to their ability to filter and clear vast \nquantities of lake water. Clearer water allows light to penetrate \ndeeper into the Lake, encouraging additional organic growth on the \nbottom. When this organic material decays, it consumes oxygen.\n  The possible link between Lake Erie's ``dead zone'' problem and \naquatic nuisance species like the zebra mussel should underscore the \nimportance of our legislation, the National Aquatic Nuisance Species \nAct. Over the last 30 years, we have made remarkable progress in \nimproving water quality and restoring the natural resources of our \nNation's aquatic areas, and we need to prevent any backsliding on this \nprogress.\n  While aquatic invasive species are a particular problem because they \nreadily spread through interconnected waterways and are difficult to \ntreat safely, they represent only one piece of the problem. Both \nterrestrial and aquatic invasive species cause significant economic and \necological damage throughout North America. Recent estimates state that \ninvasive species cost the U.S. at least $138 billion per year and that \n42 percent of the species on the Threatened and Endangered Lists are at \nrisk primarily due to invasive species.\n  In 1999, President Clinton issued an Executive Order creating the \nNational Invasive Species Council to develop a national management plan \nfor invasive species and bring together the federal agencies \nresponsible for managing them. This was a promising action that has \nnever been fully implemented. The National Invasive Species Management \nPlan was issued in 2001, but agencies with responsibilities under the \nplan have been slow to complete activities by the established due dates \nand the agencies do not always act in a coordinated manner.\n  The General Accounting Office released a report in October 2002 that \nclaimed that implementing the Management Plan was being hampered by the \nlack of a congressional mandate for the Council. It is disturbing to me \nthat this Council exists but is not making substantial progress. Make \nno mistake about it; these species are not waiting for the Federal \nGovernment to get all of its ducks in a row. They are continuing to \ntake over the waters and lands of the U.S.\n  The National Invasive Species Council Act will fix this problem by \nlegislatively establishing the Council. Because timing is so important, \nI urge my colleagues to act quickly on both of these bills to ensure \nthat the National Invasive Species Management Plan is updated and fully \nimplemented.\n  We must act quickly to strengthen the oversight of efforts preventing \ninvasive species from wreaking havoc on the Great Lakes' aquatic \nhabitat and throughout the U.S.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate \nto move these bills forward. I understand that both bills will be \nreferred to the Environment and Public Works Committee today, and I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Inhofe to move them expeditiously \nthrough committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 538. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nprogram to assist family caregivers in accessing affordable and high-\nquality respite care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act of 2003 today, a bill to establish the availability of \nrespite services for our family caregivers, and to increase \ncoordination of these programs so that caregivers will be better able \nto access them.\n\n[[Page S3191]]\n\n  As a nation, we rely on family caregivers. Twenty-six million \nAmericans care for an adult family member who is ill or disabled, \nEighteen million children have a condition that place significant \ndemands on their parental caregivers. Four million Americans with \nmental retardation or a developmental disability rely on family members \nfor care and supervision. If services provided by family caregivers \nwere replaced by paid services, it would cost nearly $200 billion \nannually.\n  But these are just numbers. Every member has a human face. Let me \ntell you about Heather Thoms-Chelsey. I met Heather last year at a \npress conference announcing the Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002. At \nthat press conference I also met Heather's then 4-year-old daughter, \nVictoria, who as Rett syndrome. Victoria is totally dependent on family \ncaregivers for all basic living skills: dressing, feeding, bathing and \ntoileting. She also engages in self-injurious behaviors, hand-biting, \nhead banging, body slamming, hair pulling. She has to be monitored all \nthe time for her protection. Heather says, ``I feel tired and exhausted \nafter only less than 5 years, what will I be like in 15? Or even 20?''\n\n  Heather is very resourceful. She has managed to find some respite \ncare--164 hours per year--through her State's department of hygiene and \nmental health. She used 4 hours of her allotted time to bring a respite \ncare worker with her to the press conference so she could tell us her \nstory. The State allows Heather a maximum payment of $7.50 per hour for \nrespite services. It is difficult to find someone who can care for a \nchild with such complicated needs for that. Most of the time, Heather \nuses the respite care dollars to hire someone to help her care for \nVictoria in the home or on an outing. Very rarely does Heather actually \nget to leave the house and take a real break. Some would say Heather is \none of the lucky ones. She actually has some respite care. Many people \nhave none.\n  Heather's story is repeated all across this country. Some people are \ncaring for children or grandchildren with special needs and elderly \nparents at the same time. Some have called these people the \n``sandwich'' generation, sandwiched between the caregiving demands of \nchildren or grandchildren and the caregiving demands of elderly \nparents.\n  Just because family caregiving is unpaid does not mean it is \ncostless. Caregiving is certainly personally rewarding but it can also \nresult in substantial emotional and physical strain and financial \nhardship. Many caregivers are exhausted and become sick themselves. \nMany give up jobs to care for loved ones, putting their own financial \nsecurity in jeopardy.\n  I believe that our country is suffering not just from a budget \ndeficit, but what Mona Harrington has called, ``a care deficit.'' \nEverywhere we look--nursing, childcare, teaching, long-term care--we \nsee shortages and looming crises that threaten the provision of care on \nwhich our children, our parents, and our families all depend. \nCaregiving is undervalued, underfinanced, and too often uncompensated. \nFamily caregiving seems almost ``invisible'' in our society, perhaps \nbecause it is work that women perform in the home.\n  It is time we recognize the heroic effort of our family caregivers \nand provide them the kind of support they need before their own health \ndeteriorates. One way to do that is through respite care. Respite care \nprovides a much needed break from the daily demands of caregiving for a \nfew hours or a few days. These welcome breaks help protect the physical \nand mental health of the family caregiver, making it possible for the \nindividual in need of care to remain in the home.\n  Unfortunately, respite care is hard to find. Many caregivers do not \nknow how to find information about services available. Even when \ncommunity respite care services exist, there are often long waiting \nlists. For example, the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Nassau \nCounty on Long Island, provides respite service to 70 people but they \nhave had a 200-person waiting list since 1995. In the same community, \nthe Association for the Help of Retarded Children serves 140 \nyoungsters; 200 children are on their waiting list. Variety \nPreschoolers serves 150 toddlers with special needs; 120 children are \non their waiting list. The list goes on and on.\n  But, this is not a problem isolated to Long Island, NY. It is \nhappening all across the America. There are more caregivers in need of \nrespite care than there are respite care resources available. Part of \nthe problem is funding and part of the problem is staffing.\n  Children and adults with special needs require trained caregivers. \nParents and spouses and other family caregivers are understandably \nhesitant to leave their loved ones with untrained staff. But training \nstaff costs money and trained staff are going to be reluctant to work \nfor as little as $7-8 an hour. Until we recognize the value of \ncaregiving and pay for it as a valued service, we are going to continue \nto face shortages: shortages in respite care but also shortage in \ncaregiving in a larger sense.\n  We don't have enough teachers. We don't have enough nurses. We don't \nhave enough childcare workers. We don't have enough trained workers to \ncare for our elderly. And we don't have enough trained staff to provide \nrespite care.\n  It is time that we, as a nation, face this care deficit and do \nsomething about it.\n  Today, I, along with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Mikulski, Snowe, \nBreaux, Jeffords, Murray, Collins, Kennedy, and Smith, are introducing \nthe Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2003. This bill would provide over $90 \nmillion in grants annually to develop a coordinated system of respite \ncare services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs \nregardless of age. Funds could also be used to increase respite care \nservices or to train respite care workers or volunteers.\n  Some of my colleagues have questioned the pricetag of this \nlegislation. I ask them to do the math. With 26 million caregivers of \nadults and 18 million caregivers of children with special needs, $90 \nmillion dollars amounts to $2.05 per caregiver. If anything, we should \nbe investing more in respite care, not less. Estimates place the cost \nof current family caregiving at $200 billion annually. We simply cannot \nafford to continue to ignore this issue.\n  I remain committed to the concerns of family caregivers and to their \nneed for respite care in particular. Together, I believe we can pass \nrespite care legislation.\n  But, our work cannot stop there. The need of family caregivers for \nrespite care is just one important piece of a larger complex picture. I \nam asking you to join me in a longer term effort to put the care \ndeficit--in childcare, in teaching, in nursing, in long-term care, as \nwell as in family caregiving--on the national agenda.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Murray, Mr. McCain, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 539. A bill to authorize appropriations for border and \ntransportation security personnel and technology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of \ncritical importance to our Nation's economic well-being and the \nsecurity of our borders: the Border Infrastructure and Technology \nModernization Act.\n  No American border has under gone a comprehensive infrastructure \noverhaul since 1986, when Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and I put \nforth a $357 million effort to modernize the southwest border. That \nbill pertained only to the southwest border, and a great deal was \nchange since 1986.\n  More importantly, much has changed since September 11, 2001. It is \nnow critical that we look at the big picture and give our northern and \nsouthwestern borders the resources they need to address security \nvulnerabilities and facilitate the flow of trade.\n  Two years ago, the General Services Administration completed a \ncomprehensive assessment of infrastructure needs on the southwestern \nand northern borders of the United States. This assessment found that \noverhauling both borders would require $784 million.\n  Since the publication of that assessment in February 2001, many of \nthe needs identified remain outstanding. Many have grown, and new needs \nhave\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\narisen as the task of making border trade flow faster has become more \ncomplicated in the face of unprecedented security concerns.\n  In response to our Nation's heightened security concerns, we created \nthe Department of Homeland Security, an agency affecting virtually \nevery Federal entity involved in border operations. Congress must give \nthis new Department adequate resources and tools to achieve the \nnecessary balance between security and trade considerations. The Border \nInfrastructure and Technology Modernization Act proposes a number of \nmeasures meant to increase the speed at which trade crosses the border \nas well as beefing up security at vulnerable points on our land \nborders.\n  In the recently passed omnibus appropriations bill, I secured \nlegislative language asking the General Services Administration, in \ncooperation with the other border agencies involved, to complete an \nupdated assessment of needs on our borders. The information contained \nin this assessment will provide a blueprint for comprehensive, targeted \nimprovements to border infrastructure and technology. The bill I am \nintroducing today provides $100 million per year for 5 years to \nimplement these improvements.\n  Congress has already passed legislation to improve security at \nairports and seaports, but we have not yet addressed the needs of our \nbusiest ports, located on the United States' northern and southwestern \nland borders. Traditionally, tighter security requirements have come at \nthe expense of efficient commerce across our borders. With the \nimprovements we are proposing today, we mean to move toward a day when \nwe can say that higher security does not penalize trade.\n  America's two biggest trading partners are not across an ocean--they \nlie to the north and south of our country. In the past decade, U.S.-\nCanada trade has doubled, and in the same time period, trade between \nthe United States and Mexico tripled. At the same time, our \ninfrastructure is weakest on our land borders, and we must act quickly \nand decisively to prevent terrorists from exploiting this weakness.\n  To address this threat, the Border Infrastructure and Technology \nModernization Act provides for a coordinated Land Border Security Plan, \nincluding cooperation between Federal State and local entities involved \nat our borders, as well as the private sector.\n  When it comes to security, everybody has a role to play, not just the \ngovernment. We must enlist the help of the private sector to address \nsecurity concerns on our borders. Trade and industry have made this \ncountry the economic powerhouse it is today, and we must fully involve \nthem in protecting our country through government trade and industry \npartnership programs.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has already started this process. I commend \nthem for their quick action after the September 11 terrorist attacks in \nenlisting the support of private industry by quickly developing the \nCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, C-TPAT. We need to expand \nthese programs, especially along the northern and southwestern borders. \nThis bill authorizes an additional $30 million and additional staff to \naccomplish this task.\n  Finally, equipment and technology alone will not solve the trade and \nsecurity problems on our borders. The border agencies of the Department \nof Homeland Security need sufficient personnel levels, and training to \nensure the implementation and use of modern technology. I am pleased \nthat the administration has taken the first step to meet this objective \nby announcing that they will add 1,700 new inspectors to the Bureau of \nCustoms and Border Security of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act increases \nthe number of inspectors and support staff in this bureau by an \nadditional 200 each year for 5 years. This bill also adds 100 more \nspecial agents and support staff each year for 5 years to the Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the investigative arm of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I am pleased to introduced this bill today to devote greater \nresources to maximizing the economic possibilities of the trade flowing \nacross our borders, while addressing the security vulnerabilities on \nour land borders. I am convinced that these goals are not mutually \nexclusive, but instead must be realized in concert.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Domenici, \nDorgan, Kyl, Feinstein, Murkowski, Burns, and Murray to introduce the \nBorder Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act. For most of us, \nthis is not a new issue. I have worked closely with many of my \ncolleagues to address concerns regarding the protection of our Nation's \nborders, particularly the problems associated with illegal immigration.\n  The bill we are introducing today addresses border infrastructure, to \nensure that our Nation's borders, both southern and northern, are as \nsecure and up to date as possible. This bill will authorize. the Bureau \nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement to address staffing shortages \nand hire additional agents, inspectors, and support staff. It will also \nauthorize several studies and demonstration programs to improve \ninfrastructure, security, facilitate trade, and expand the use of \ntechnology along the borders.\n  Cross-border commerce suffers greatly due to backups at our ports of \nentry. Two and three hour delays hinder the transport of goods from \nMexico into the United States. Improving infrastructure at our ports of \nentry will increase our capability to screen trucks and individuals \ncoming into the country in a more efficient manner, reducing the \nbackups along the border and improving the free flow of commerce.\n  As undocumented aliens take increasingly desperate measures to cross \nour border with Mexico, the burden borne by States along the \nsouthwestern border continues to grow. The Federal Government's attempt \nto stem illegal immigration in Texas and California has made it \nincreasingly difficult to cross the border in these States and has \ncreated a funnel effect, giving Arizona the dubious distinction of \nbeing the location of choice for illegal border crossings.\n  Reports suggest that at least one in three of the illegal border \ncrossers arrested traversing the U.S.-Mexico border are stopped in \nArizona. Last year approximately 320 people died in the\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\ndesert trying to cross the border. Additionally, the number of attacks \non National Park Service officers has increased in recent years. \nProperty crimes are rampant along the border, leaving Arizona with the \nhighest per capita auto theft rate in the Nation. Times have become so \ndesperate that vigilante groups have begun to form with the goal of \ndoing the job the Federal Government is failing to do.\n  We must do all we can to improve the ports of entry along our borders \nwith both our northern and our southern neighbors. Technology is the \nkey to that goal, and this bill takes a big step toward ensuring that \ntechnological needs are assessed and that technology is improved.\n  There are between 7-9 million people in this country illegally. Many \nof these people entered our country legally but have overstayed their \nvisas. By upgrading the technology for our ports of entry and further \ndeveloping the entry-exit system we will have a way to better monitor \nthese individuals. During this year's appropriations bill, I sponsored \nan amendment along with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to restore $165 \nmillion to entry-exit system and help the INS establish four pilot \nprojects on the borders to effectively track and monitor immigration. \nThis bill and the amendment we passed recently are both important ways \nto increase the resources available to the border.\n  Beyond the improvement of infrastructure, technology and security \nalong the border, we must also address illegal immigration through a \nguest worker program. As long as there are jobs to be had on this side \nof the border, people will continue to attempt to cross illegally, and \nour national security will remain at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to move expeditiously on this important piece of \nlegislation, in order to ensure that in a time of new global threats, \nour Nation's borders are as safe as possible and American citizens are \nprotected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Graham of Florida, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 543. A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environmental and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto designate the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge as wilderness.\n  America's dependence on foreign oil is an urgent and stubborn \nproblem. But the answer isn't in the ground. It's in our heads. We have \nto apply the genius of America to engineer a solution to energy \nindependence, not hope that we will magically find one in the deposits \nunder Alaska.\n  The facts on this are clear. Alaska has at a most 6 month supply of \noil--not a drop of which will be available for a decade. The United \nStates Energy Information Administration--part of the Bush \nadministration--itself concluded that full development of the Refuge \nwould reduce our projected dependence on foreign oil from 62 to 60 \npercent at the very most, and not until 2020.\n  For that, is it worth forever losing a national treasure, one of our \nlast great wild places? I say no. Instead, I say yes to a smart, \nforward-looking strategy to wean our economy off its addiction to \nforeign oil without sacrificing our natural treasures.\n  Despite my colleagues arguments to the contrary, I believe it is \nfinally established that there is no way--no way--to drill in the \nArctic without disrupting and essentially destroying that precious \nplace. For too long, drilling advocates have attempted to raise \nquestions about the impacts of drilling. It is time for the facts to \ncarry the day.\n  In fact, just today, the National Academies of Science released a \nreport detailing the cumulative impacts of oil development on Alaska's \nNorth Slope. The NAS not only found that Arctic oil development has \nadversely impacted populations of caribou, birds and bowhead whales--\nmore importantly, they said that future drilling would pose grave \nthreats to the Arctic's environmental health. As the report stated in a \nsection entitled ``The Essential Trade-Off,'' the question for Congress \nis whether the available oil is worth the ``inevitable accumulated \nundesirable effects.'' With so little impact on our oil dependence \npredicted, the answer is clearly no.\n  In every poll, we see that the majority of Americans oppose ruining \nthe Arctic for oil. And, as we established last year, the majority of \nthe U.S. Senate agrees with them. Once and for all, let's respect that \ndesire, and let's protect this precious place. Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PORTION OF ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE \n                   REFUGE AS WILDERNESS.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Designation of Certain Land as Wilderness.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a portion of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska comprising \n     approximately 1,559,538 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled `Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--1002 Area. \n     Alternative E--Wilderness Designation, October 28, 1991' and \n     available for inspection in the offices of the Secretary, is \n     designated as a component of the National Wilderness \n     Preservation System under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 \n     et seq.).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sarbanes, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 544. A bill to establish a SAFER Firefighter Grant Program; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nWarner, Senator Hollings, Senator Reed, Senator Daschle, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Clinton, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Landrieu to \nintroduce the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, SAFER, \nAct. This legislation will help to remedy a critical shortage in the \nfire service and help ensure that America's firefighters have the \nstaffing they need to safely do their jobs.\n  Every day approximately one million firefighters put their lives on \nthe line to protect the people of our great Nation. I firmly believe \nthat in recognition of that fact, our Nation has an obligation to \nensure that the brave men and women of the fire service have the tools, \nthe training, and the staffing they need to do their jobs safely.\n  In recent years, the Federal Government has recognized that it can \nand should be a better partner with local firefighters. In 2000, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Levin, Senator Warner, and I worked \nsuccessfully to help create the FIRE Act. This law stood as the first \nFederal grant program explicitly designed to help fire departments \nthroughout America obtain better equipment, improved training, and \nneeded personnel. Since September 11, 2001, Congress and the \nadministration have provided billions of dollars to help local \nfirefighters purchase equipment and training to respond to acts of \nterrorism, accidental fires, chemical spills, and natural disasters. \nOver the last 2 years, the Federal FIRE Act grant initiative has \nprovided nearly half a billion dollars in direct assistance to local \nfire departments across the country and the FIRE Act will provide \nanother $750 million this year. We are beginning to significantly \nimprove the quality of the equipment available to firefighters in every \nState and in communities large and small. Unfortunately, the FIRE Act \nhas not improved staffing conditions for America's fire service. Severe \nstaffing shortages still plague departments across the country.\n  Currently two-thirds of all fire departments operate with inadequate \nstaffing. And the consequences are often tragic. According to testimony \nby Harold Schaitberger, General President of the International \nAssociation of Firefighters, presented before the\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nSenate Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee on October 11, 2001, \nunderstaffing has caused or contributed to firefighter deaths in \nMemphis, Tennessee; Worcester, Massachusetts; Keokuk, Iowa; Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania; Chesapeake, Virginia; Stockton, California; Lexington, \nKentucky; Buffalo, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and \nWashington, D.C. In each case, firefighters went into dangerous \nsituations without the support they needed and they paid the ultimate \nprice.\n  The unfortunate reality is that our local communities have not been \nable to maintain the level of staffing necessary to ensure the safety \nof our firefighters or the public. Since 1970, the number of \nfirefighters as a percentage of the U.S. workforce has steadily \ndeclined and the budget crises that our state and local governments are \nenduring has made matters worse. Across the country today, firefighter \nstaffing is being cut and fire stations are even being closed because \nof state and local budget shortfalls. All of this at a time when the \nthreats of terrorism are placing unprecedented demands on our fire \nservice.\n  According to a ``Needs Assessment Study'' recently released by the \nU.S. Fire Administration, USFA, and the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, NFPA, understaffing contributes to enormous problems. For \nexample, USFA and NFPA have found that only 11% of our Nation's fire \ndepartments have the personnel and equipment they need to respond to a \nbuilding collapse involving 50 or more occupants. The USFA and NFPA \nalso found that there are routine problems that threaten the health and \nsafety of our first responders. In small and medium-sized cities, \nfirefighters are too often compelled to respond to emergencies without \nsufficient manpower to protect those on the ground. More often than \nnot, firefighters in too many of our communities respond to fires with \nfewer than the four firefighters per truck that is considered to be the \nminimum to ensure firefighter safety.\n  The USFA/NFPA study also suggests that shortages of personnel prevent \nmany firefighters from taking time off to receive training and too few \ndepartments can afford to hire dedicated training staff. As a result, \nnearly three-quarters of all fire departments cannot comply with EPA \nand OSHA regulations that require formal hazardous materials response \ntraining for front-line firefighters.\n  The SAFER Act is a national commitment to hire the firefighters \nnecessary to protect the American people from the consequences of \nterrorist attacks and from more ordinary, but often equally \ndevastating, events. This legislation will put 75,000 new firefighters \non America's streets over the next 7 years and will help provide \nAmericans with the level of protection they need and deserve.\n  As I have said before, just as we have called up the National Guard \nto meet the increased need for more manpower in the military, we need \nto make a national commitment to hire firefighters to protect the \nAmerican people here at home. In these difficult times, it is both \nnecessary and proper for us to send for reinforcements for our domestic \ndefenders. The SAFER Act will make that commitment.\n  In closing let me say that this legislation honors America's \nfirefighters. It acknowledges the men and women who charge up the \nstairs while everybody else is running down them. But it does more than \nthat. This legislation is an investment in America's security, an \ninvestment to ensure the safety of our firefighter as well as American \nfamilies and their homes and businesses.\n  Both the International Association of Firefighters and the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs have expressed their strong \nsupport for this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join those of us \nwho have introduced this measure today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague \nSenator Dodd in the introduction of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and \nEmergency Response Act. The SAFER Act establishes a new grant program \nthat will provide direct funding to fire and rescue departments though \nthe new Department of Homeland Security. This funding will help to \ncover some of the costs associated with hiring and training new \nfirefighters.\n  Our Nation's fire departments must be able to hire the necessary \npersonnel in order to meet the ever increasing demands on local first \nresponders. Many Americans are not aware of the staffing shortages we \nmay face in our fire and rescue departments. The role of firefighter in \nour communities is far greater than most realize. They are first to \nrespond to hazardous materials calls, chemicals emergencies, biohazard \nincidents, and water rescues. These are dangers which our fire rescue \npersonnel deal with on a daily basis.\n  The National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit organization \nwhich develops and promotes scientifically based consensus codes and \nguidelines, issued minimum staffing standards of at least four \nfirefighters per apparatus. Furthermore, local departments are expected \nto comply with Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \nOSHA, standards, which require a minimum of two qualified firefighters \ninside and two qualified firefighters outside of a structure fire or \nsimilar incident. Except in cases of a known need for rescue, a fire \ncompany with less than four personnel cannot enter that structure to \nfight a fire or respond to an incident until additional firefighters \narrive on the scene, ready to go.\n  I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure not only \nbecause of the firefighters role in our homeland security endeavors, \nbut also in recognition of the critical day-to-day services they \nprovide in our Nation's communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/05/senate-section/article/S3196-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3196-S3202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 74--TO AMEND RULE XLII OF THE STANDING RULES ON THE \n  SENATE TO PROHIBIT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE SENATE BASED ON \n                           SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Daschle, Ms. Landrieu, \nMr. Breaux, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nDurbin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Collins, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Schumer, \nand Mrs. Clinton) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE.\n\n       Paragraph 1 of rule XLII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate is amended by striking ``or state of physical \n     handicap'' and inserting ``state of physical handicap, or \n     sexual orientation''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nprohibit employment discrimination in the Senate based on sexual \norientation.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, as well as \nmy other colleagues who join me in introducing this resolution.\n  The resolution would amend the Standing Rules of the Senate by adding \n``sexual orientation'' to ``race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, age, or state of physical handicap'' in the antidiscrimination \nprovision of rule 42, which governs the Senate's employment practices.\n  By amending the current rule, it would forbid any Senate Member, \nofficer, or employee from terminating, refusing to hire, or otherwise \ndiscriminating against an individual with respect to promotion, \ncompensation, or any other privilege of employment, on the basis of \nthat individual's sexual orientation.\n  Senate employees currently have no recourse available to them should \nthey become a victim of this type of employment discrimination.\n  If the rules are amended, any Senate employee that encountered \ndiscrimination based on their sexual orientation would have the option \nof reporting it to the Senate Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee \ncould then investigate the claim and recommend discipline for any \nSenate Member, officer, or employee found to have violated the rule.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate is already well behind other establishments \nof the U.S. Government in this area of antidiscrimination.\n  By 1996, at least 13 Cabinet level agencies, including the \nDepartments of Justice, Agriculture, Transportation, Health and Human \nServices, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Energy, \nin addition to the General Accounting Office, General Services \nAdministration, Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Reserve System, \nOffice of Personnel Management, and the White House had already issued \npolicy statements forbidding sexual orientation discrimination.\n  In 1998, Executive Order 13087 was issued to prohibit sexual \norientation discrimination in the Federal executive branch, including \ncivilian employees of the military departments and sundry other \ngovernmental entities.\n  That Executive order now covers approximately 2 million Federal \ncivilian\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nworkers. Yet more than 4 years later, there are still employees of the \nSenate that are unprotected.\n  In taking this step toward addressing discrimination, the Senate \nwould join not only the executive branch, but also 308 Fortune 500 \ncompanies, 23 State governments and 262 local governments that have \nalready prohibited workplace discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  Currently, 65 Senators have already adopted written policies for \ntheir congressional offices indicating that sexual orientation is not a \nfactor in their employment decisions.\n  Now, I urge my colleagues to join me by making this policy universal \nfor the Senate, rather than relying on a patchwork of protection that \nonly covers some of the Senate's employees.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein in introducing a resolution to prohibit employment \ndiscrimination in the Senate based on sexual orientation.\n  Senate rules currently prohibit employment discrimination based on \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or state of physical \nhandicap. I believe that it is time for us to add sexual orientation to \nthat list.\n  As a cosponsor of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, I have stood \nbehind the principle that employment discrimination against any person \nis hurtful to society as a whole, and if I am going to hold the private \nsector accountable for its actions, I should certainly promote the same \nprinciples in the U.S. Senate.\n  It is important to note that the Senate is lagging behind the rest of \nthe Federal Government in prohibiting employment discrimination based \non sexual orientation. Since 1996, 13 Cabinet level agencies and the \nWhite House have had anti-discrimination policies, and in 1998, \nPresident Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting sexual \norientation discrimination in the Federal Executive Branch, including \ncivilians in the military. That executive order now covers 2 million \nFederal employees, but people who work in the Senate do not enjoy those \nsame protections.\n  Many of my colleagues already have written policies indicating that \nsexual orientation is not a factor in their employment decisions, and \nit is past time that we make this non-discrimination policy a part of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate. I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, for her leadership in this issue, and \nurge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 75--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. Miller, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas more than 145 peace officers across the Nation were \n     killed in the line of duty during 2002, well below the \n     decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop \n     from 2001 when 230 officers were killed, including 72 \n     officers in the September 11th terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction \n     in deaths, including better equipment and the increased use \n     of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison \n     terms for violent offenders, and advanced emergency medical \n     care;\n       Whereas every year, 1 out of every 9 peace officers is \n     assaulted, 1 out of every 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 \n     out of every 4,400 peace officers is killed in the line of \n     duty somewhere in America every other day; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2003, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2003, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch and \nLeahy, along with 16 other Senators, in introducing this resolution to \nkeep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment \nof those law enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their \ncommunities. Specifically, this resolution would designate May 15, \n2003, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face every day on the frontlines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this \nNation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in \nAmerica every other day. There are few communities in this country that \nhave not been impacted by the words: ``officer down.''\n  On September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died at the World Trade \nCenter in New York City as a result of a cowardly act of terrorism. \nThis single act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace \nofficers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this \ncountry. Before this event, the greatest loss of law enforcement in a \nsingle incident occurred in 1917, when nine Milwaukee police officers \nwere killed in a bomb blast at their police station.\n  In 2002, more than 145 Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficers gave their lives in the line of duty, well below the decade-\nlong average of 165 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a \ntotal of 230 officers were killed. A number of factors contributed to \nthis reduction including better equipment and the increased use of \nbullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison terms for \nviolent offenders, and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, \nmore than 15,000 men and women have made the supreme sacrifice.\n  The chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nCraig W. Floyd, reminds us that ``a police officer is killed in the \nline of duty somewhere in America nearly every other day. More than \n800,000 officers put their lives at risk each and every day for our \nsafety and protection. National Police Week and Peace Officers Memorial \nDay provide our Nation with an important opportunity to recognize and \nhonor that extraordinary service and sacrifice.''\n  On May 15, 2003, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to \ngather in our Nation's Capital to join with the families of their \nfallen comrades who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their \nresponsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their \ncommunities. In doing so, these heroes have established for themselves \nan enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and \nsecurity of all citizens. This resolution is a fitting tribute for this \nspecial and solemn occasion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nimportant resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 76--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n POLICY OF PREEMPTION, COMBINED WITH A POLICY OF FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR \nWEAPONS, CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS \n  DESTRUCTION, ESPECIALLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE \n                LONG-TERM SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas press reports show that the December 31, 2001 \n     Nuclear Posture Review states that the United States might \n     use nuclear weapons to dissuade adversaries from\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\n     undertaking military programs or operations that could \n     threaten United States interests;\n       Whereas the Nuclear Posture Review, according to such \n     reports, goes on to state that nuclear weapons could be \n     employed against targets capable of withstanding non-nuclear \n     attack;\n       Whereas the Nuclear Posture Review is further reported to \n     state that, in setting requirements for nuclear strike \n     capabilities, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya are \n     among the countries that could be involved in immediate, \n     potential, or unexpected contingencies;\n       Whereas the September 17, 2002 National Security Strategy \n     of the United States of America states that ``[a]s a matter \n     of common sense and self-defense, America will act against \n     such emerging threats before they are fully formed,'' and \n     that ``[t]o forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our \n     adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act \n     preemptively'';\n       Whereas the December 2002 National Strategy to Combat \n     Weapons of Mass Destruction states that ``[t]he United States \n     will continue to make clear that it reserves the right to \n     respond with overwhelming force--including through resort to \n     all of our options--to the use of [weapons of mass \n     destruction] against the United States, our forces abroad, \n     and friends and allies'';\n       Whereas United States nuclear policy, outlined in 1978 and \n     restated in 1995 and 2002, includes, in the context of \n     gaining other nations' support for the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a ``negative security \n     assurance'' that the United States would not use its nuclear \n     force against a country that does not possess nuclear weapons \n     unless that country was allied with a nuclear weapons \n     possessor;\n       Whereas the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \n     International Security, John Bolton, recently announced the \n     Administration's abandonment of the so-called ``negative \n     security assurance'' pledge to refrain from using nuclear \n     weapons against non-nuclear nations;\n       Whereas reports about the Stockpile Stewardship Conference \n     Planning Meeting of the Department of Defense, held on \n     January 10, 2003, indicate that the United States is engaged \n     in the expansion of research and development of new types of \n     nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas this expansion of nuclear weapons research covers \n     new forms of nuclear weaponry that threaten the limitations \n     on nuclear weapons testing that are established by the \n     unratified, but previously respected, Comprehensive Nuclear \n     Test-Ban Treaty;\n       Whereas these policies and actions threaten to make nuclear \n     weapons appear to be useful, legitimate, first-strike \n     offensive weapons, rather than a force for deterrence, and \n     therefore undermine an essential tenet of nonproliferation; \n     and\n       Whereas the cumulative effect of the policies announced by \n     the President is to redefine the concept of preemption, which \n     had been understood to mean the right of every state to \n     anticipatory self-defense in the face of imminent attack, and \n     to broaden the concept to justify a preventive war initiated \n     by the United States, even without evidence of an imminent \n     attack, in which the United States might use nuclear weapons \n     against non-nuclear states: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President's policy of preemption, combined with a policy of \n     first use of nuclear weapons, creates an incentive for \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially \n     nuclear weapons, and is inconsistent with the long-term \n     security of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 77--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ONE OF \nTHE MOST GRAVE THREATS FACING THE UNITED STATES IS THE PROLIFERATION OF \nWEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE \n     STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THIS THREAT, AND TO SET FORTH BASIC \n             PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD UNDERPIN THIS STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Reid, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Carper, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kennedy, and \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nCorzine, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Jeffords, and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following \nresolution;

Terrorists worldwide have ready access to \n     information on chemical, biological, radiological, and \n     nuclear weapons via the internet'';\n       Whereas the Treaty on Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \n     Offensive Arms, with Annexes, Protocols, and Memorandum of \n     Understanding, signed at Moscow on July 31, 1991 (START \n     Treaty) addresses a narrow aspect of the threat posed by \n     weapons of mass destruction--deployed strategic nuclear \n     weapons--and fails to address other aspects of the nuclear \n     threat as well as the threat posed by biological or chemical \n     weapons or materials;\n       Whereas in a recent bipartisan report, former Senators \n     Warren Rudman and Gary Hart concluded that ``America remains \n     dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a \n     catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil'';\n       Whereas the United States Government last month raised the \n     terrorist threat level and, according to the Director of \n     Central Intelligence, did so in part ``because of threat \n     reporting from multiple sources with strong al Qaeda ties . . \n     .and to plots that could include the use of radiological \n     dispersion devices as well as poisons and chemicals'';\n       Whereas shortly before the inauguration of President George \n     W. Bush, a bipartisan task force chaired by former Majority \n     Leader of the Senate Howard Baker and former White House \n     Counsel Lloyd Cutler reported that ``the most urgent unmet \n     national security threat to the United States today is the \n     danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable \n     material in Russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or \n     hostile nation states and used against American troops abroad \n     or citizens at home'';\n       Whereas other states of concern continue their drive to \n     acquire a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capability as \n     evidenced by the observation of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence, in testimony before the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate, that the intelligence community \n     has ``renewed concern over Libya's interest in WMD'';\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has \n     been told by Iran that it will not accept the strengthened \n     safeguard protocol of the Agency and is committed to \n     acquiring the ability to independently produce enriched \n     uranium;\n       Whereas the Bush Administration has failed to begin direct \n     talks with North Korea in spite of the assessment of the \n     United States Government that North Korea may produce \n     sufficient additional nuclear material for six to eight \n     nuclear weapons within six months and the decision of North \n     Korea to expel IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon complex, to \n     restart its nuclear reactor, to begin moving formerly secure \n     spent nuclear fuel rods, to leave the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow, July 1, 1968 (Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or \n     NPT), and to test a new cruise missile;\n       Whereas the December 2002 National Strategy to Combat \n     Weapons Of Mass Destruction states that ``[w]eapons of mass \n     destruction represent a threat not just to the United States, \n     but also to our friends and allies and the broader \n     international community. For this reason, it is vital that we \n     work closely with like-minded countries on all elements of \n     our comprehensive proliferation strategy.'';\n       Whereas newspaper accounts of the December 2001 Nuclear \n     Posture Review state that the review concludes the United \n     States might use nuclear weapons to dissuade adversaries from \n     undertaking military programs or operations that could \n     threaten United States interests, that nuclear weapons could \n     be employed against targets able to withstand non-nuclear \n     attack, and that in setting requirements for nuclear strike \n     capabilities, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya are \n     among the countries that could be involved in immediate, \n     potential, or unexpected contingencies;\n       Whereas the September 17, 2002, National Security Strategy \n     of the United States states that ``[a]s a matter of common \n     sense and self-defense, America will act against such \n     emerging threats before they are fully formed'' and ``[t]o \n     forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, \n     the United States will, if necessary, act preemptively'';\n       Whereas General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated that ``[a]ny activities \n     that erode the firebreak between nuclear and conventional \n     weapons or that encourage the use of nuclear weapons for \n     purposes that are not strategic and deterrent in nature would \n     undermine the advantage that we derive from overwhelming \n     conventional superiority'';\n       Whereas the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \n     International Security implied the abandonment by the Bush \n     Administration of the so-called ``negative security\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\n     assurance'' pledge to refrain from using nuclear weapons \n     against any non-nuclear nation unless that state was allied \n     with a possessor of nuclear weapons, a policy that had been \n     in place for 25 years and endorsed by successive Republican \n     and Democratic Administrations;\n       Whereas documents recently made public from the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Conference Planning Meeting of the Department of \n     Defense held on January 10, 2003, indicate that the United \n     States is moving toward expansion of research and development \n     of new types of nuclear weapons and has sought repeal of the \n     ban on research and development of new low-yield nuclear \n     weapons;\n       Whereas the United States remains dangerously vulnerable to \n     future terrorist attacks, and Bush the Administration has \n     failed to spend homeland security funds provided by Congress \n     and has repeatedly opposed efforts to increase funding for \n     such homeland security activities as State and local first \n     responders, border security, and food and water safety;\n       Whereas the Bush Administration has repeatedly failed to \n     meet the funding benchmarks recommended by former Majority \n     Leader of the Senate Howard Baker and former White House \n     Counsel Lloyd Cutler for the nonproliferation programs of the \n     Department of Energy;\n       Whereas notwithstanding the transformation of the strategic \n     environment after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, a \n     policy that moves toward the goal of the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, and away from the increased reliance \n     on and the importance of nuclear weapons, will serve to \n     further the United States goal of preventing the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas in a discussion of the grave threat posed the \n     United States by weapons of mass destruction, President Bush \n     has stated that ``[h]istory will judge harshly those who saw \n     this coming danger but failed to act'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the grave \n     threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction demands that the United States develop a \n     comprehensive and robust nonproliferation strategy, \n     including--\n       (1) the establishment of a broad international coalition \n     against proliferation;\n       (2) the prevention of the theft or diversion of chemical \n     weapons from existing stockpiles--\n       (A) by greatly accelerating efforts to destroy such weapons \n     under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention in the \n     United States, Russia, and other nations; and\n       (B) by strengthening and enforcing existing treaties and \n     agreements on the elimination or limitation of nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons;\n       (3) the termination of the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and the systems to deliver such weapons, by the \n     reinforcement of the international system of export controls \n     and by the immediate commencement of negotiations on a \n     protocol to interdict shipments of such weapons and delivery \n     systems;\n       (4) an engagement in direct and immediate talks with North \n     Korea, coordinated with United States regional allies, to \n     secure the peaceful end to the nuclear programs and long-\n     range missile programs of North Korea;\n       (5) the elimination of excess nuclear weapons in Russia, \n     and the security of nuclear materials in Russia and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union, by the end of the decade \n     in order to prevent the theft or sale of such weapons or \n     materials to terrorist groups or hostile states, including \n     for that purpose--\n       (A) the provision of levels of funding for the \n     nonproliferation programs of the Department of Energy as \n     called for in the report of former Majority Leader of the \n     Senate Howard Baker and former White House Counsel Lloyd \n     Cutler; and\n       (B) the provision of increased funding for the Cooperative \n     Threat Reduction (CTR) program of the Department of Defense;\n       (6) the expansion of the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     program to include additional states willing to engage in \n     bilateral efforts to reduce their nuclear stockpiles;\n       (7) the provision of adequate funds for homeland security, \n     including the provision of funds to State, local, and tribal \n     governments to hire, equip, and train the first responders \n     required by such governments; and\n       (8) the enhancement of the capability of the United States \n     and other nations to detect nuclear weapons activity by the \n     pursuit of transparency measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 13--CONDEMNING THE SELECTION OF LIBYA TO \n  CHAIR THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, \nand Mr. Corzine) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas ordered held at the desk:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 13\n\n       Whereas on January 20, 2003, Libya, a gross violator of \n     human rights and State sponsor of terrorism, was elected to \n     chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (the \n     ``Commission''), a body charged with the responsibility of \n     promoting universal respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms for all;\n       Whereas according to the rotation system that governs the \n     selection of the Executive Board of the Commission, 2003 was \n     designated as the year for the Africa Group to chair the \n     Commission, and the Africa Group selected Libya as its \n     candidate;\n       Whereas South Africa's Democratic Alliance spokeswoman, \n     Dene Smuts, was quoted by the British Broadcasting \n     Corporation as saying that the Government of South Africa's \n     decision to support the election of Libya was an insult to \n     human rights and that African countries ``should have \n     supported a candidate of whom all Africans could be proud'';\n       Whereas Amnesty International has repeatedly documented \n     that the human rights situation in Libya continues to \n     seriously deteriorate, with systematic occurrences of gross \n     human rights violations, including the extrajudicial \n     execution of government opponents and the routine torture, \n     and occasional resulting death, of political detainees during \n     interrogation;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch recently declared that ``[o]ver \n     the past three decades, Libya's human rights record has been \n     appalling'' and that ``Libya has been a closed country for \n     United Nations and nongovernmental human rights \n     investigators'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch further asserted that ``Libya's \n     election poses a real test for the Commission,'' observing \n     that ``[r]epressive governments must not be allowed to hijack \n     the United Nations human rights system'';\n       Whereas the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights urged that \n     ``the Government of Libya should not be entrusted by the \n     United Nations to lead its international effort to promote \n     human rights around the world'';\n       Whereas Freedom House declared that ``[a] country [such as \n     Libya] with such a gross record of human rights abuses should \n     not direct the proceedings of the United Nation's main human \n     rights monitoring body'' because it would ``undermine the \n     United Nation's moral authority and send a strong and clear \n     message to fellow rights violators that they are in the \n     clear'';\n       Whereas on November 13, 2001, a German court convicted a \n     Libyan national for the 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco \n     club in Berlin which killed two United States servicemen, and \n     the court further declared that there was clear evidence of \n     responsibility of the Government of Libya for the bombing;\n       Whereas Libya was responsible for the December 21, 1988, \n     explosion of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 (``Pan Am \n     Flight 103'') en route from London to New York City that \n     crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 passengers and \n     crew and 11 other people on the ground;\n       Whereas a French court convicted 6 Libyan government \n     officials in absentia for the bombing of UTA Flight 772 over \n     Niger in 1989;\n       Whereas, in response to Libya's complicity in international \n     terrorism, United Nations Security Council Resolution 748 of \n     March 31, 1992, imposed an arms and air embargo on Libya and \n     established a United Nations Security Council sanctions \n     committee to address measures against Libya;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 883 of \n     November 11, 1993, tightened sanctions on Libya, including \n     the freezing of Libyan funds and financial resources in other \n     countries, and banned the provision to Libya of equipment for \n     oil refining and transportation;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1192 of \n     August 27, 1998, reaffirmed that the measures set forth in \n     previous resolutions remain in effect and binding on all \n     Member States, and further expressed the intention of the \n     United Nations to consider additional measures if the \n     individuals charged in connection with the bombings of Pan Am \n     Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772 had not promptly arrived or \n     appeared for trial on those charges in accordance with \n     paragraph (8) of that Resolution;\n       Whereas in January 2001, a three-judge Scottish court \n     sitting in the Netherlands found Libyan Abdel Basset al-\n     Megrahi guilty of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, sentenced \n     him to life imprisonment, and said the court accepted \n     evidence that he was a member of Libya's Jamahariya Security \n     Organization, and in March 2002, a five-judge Scottish \n     appeals court sitting in the Netherlands upheld the \n     conviction;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731, \n     748, 883, and 1192 demanded that the Government of Libya \n     provide appropriate compensation to the families of the \n     victims, accept responsibility for the actions of Libyan \n     officials in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, provide a full \n     accounting of its involvement in that terrorist act, and \n     cease all support for terrorism;\n       Whereas Libya remains on the Department of State's list of \n     state-sponsors of terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States found the selection of Libya to \n     chair the Commission to be an affront to international human \n     rights efforts and, in particular, to victims of Libya's \n     repression and Libyan-sponsored terrorism, and therefore \n     broke with precedent and called for a recorded vote among \n     Commission members on Libya's chairmanship;\n       Whereas Canada and one other country joined the United \n     States in voting against Libya, with 17 countries abstaining \n     from the recorded vote among Commission members on Libya's \n     chairmanship of the Commission;\n       Whereas the common position of the members of the European \n     Union was to abstain\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\n     from the recorded vote on the selection of Libya as chair of \n     the Commission;\n       Whereas 33 countries ignored Libya's record on human rights \n     and status as a country subject to United Nations sanctions \n     for the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and voted for \n     Libya to lead the Commission;\n       Whereas the majority of the countries that voted for Libya \n     are recipients of United States foreign aid;\n       Whereas the selection of Libya to chair the Commission is \n     only the most recent example of a malaise plaguing the \n     Commission that has called into question the Commission's \n     credibility as the membership ranks of the Commission have \n     swelled in recent years with countries that have a history of \n     egregious human rights violations;\n       Whereas the challenge by the United States to the selection \n     of Libya is part of a broader effort to reform the \n     Commission, reclaim it from the oppressors, and ensure that \n     it fulfills its mandate;\n       Whereas on January 20, 2003, Ambassador Kevin Moley, United \n     States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and \n     Other International Organizations in Geneva, emphasized that \n     the United States ``seek[s] to actively engage and strengthen \n     the moral authority of the Commission on Human Rights, so \n     that it once again proves itself a forceful advocate for \n     those in need of having their human rights protected'' and \n     that ``[w]e are convinced that the best way for the \n     Commission to ensure the ideals of the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights over the long-term is to have a membership \n     comprised of countries with strong human rights records at \n     home'';\n       Whereas a majority of the 53 member states of the \n     Commission are participants in the Community of Democracies \n     and signed the Community of Democracies Statement on \n     Terrorism (the ``Statement on Terrorism'') on November 12, \n     2002, at the Second Ministerial Conference of the Community \n     of Democracies held in Seoul, South Korea (the ``Seoul \n     Ministerial''), calling upon democratic nations to work \n     together to uphold the principles of democracy, freedom, good \n     governance, and accountability in international \n     organizations;\n       Whereas the Seoul Ministerial participants declared in the \n     Statement on Terrorism that they ``strongly denounced \n     terrorism as a grave threat to democratic societies and the \n     values they embrace[,] . . . reaffirmed that terrorism \n     constitutes a threat to international peace and security as \n     well as to humanity in general and indeed to the very \n     foundation on which democracies are built[,]'' and stated \n     that ``[t]he most recent terrorist attacks confirm that \n     international cooperation against terrorism will remain a \n     long-term effort and requires a sustained universal \n     commitment'';\n       Whereas the United Nations sanctions against Libya, though \n     suspended, remain in effect; and\n       Whereas Libya's continued status as an international outlaw \n     nation and its continued unwillingness to accept \n     responsibility for its terrorist actions provide ample \n     justification for barring Libya from consideration as a \n     candidate for membership in the United Nations Security \n     Council or any other United Nations entity or affiliated \n     agency: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the selection of Libya to chair the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights (the \n     ``Commission'');\n       (2) commends the President for the principled position of \n     the United States in objecting to and calling for a vote on \n     Libya's chairmanship of the Commission;\n       (3) commends countries that joined the United States in \n     objecting to Libya's selection as chair of the Commission;\n       (4) expresses its dismay at the European Union countries' \n     common position of abstention on the critical vote over \n     Libya's chairmanship;\n       (5) expresses its shock and dismay over the support \n     provided to Libya in its efforts to lead the Commission;\n       (6) highlights its grave concern over the continuing \n     efforts of countries violating human rights and terrorist \n     countries to use international fora--\n       (A) to legitimize their regimes; and\n       (B) to continue to act with impunity;\n       (7) calls on the President to raise United States \n     objections to such efforts during bilateral and multilateral \n     discussions and to direct pertinent members of the \n     President's Cabinet to do the same;\n       (8) calls on countries at various stages of democratization \n     to--\n       (A) demonstrate their commitment to human rights, \n     democracy, peace and security; and\n       (B) support efforts to reform the Commission;\n       (9) calls on the President to instruct the Secretary of \n     State to consult with the appropriate congressional \n     committees, within 60 calendar days after the adoption of \n     this resolution, regarding the priorities and strategy of the \n     United States for the 59th session of the Commission on Human \n     Rights and its strategy and proposals for reform of the \n     Commission;\n       (10) calls on the President to issue an objection to the \n     continued suspension of United Nations sanctions against \n     Libya until the Government of Libya--\n       (A) publicly accepts responsibility for the bombing of Pan \n     American World Airways Flight 103;\n       (B) provides appropriate compensation to the victims of the \n     bombing; and\n       (C) fully complies with all of the other requirements of \n     the United Nations sanctions imposed as a result of Libya's \n     orchestration of the terrorist attack on Pan American World \n     Airways Flight 103; and\n       (11) calls on the Secretary of State to engage Member \n     States of the United Nations to support efforts to ensure \n     that states that are gross violators of human rights, \n     sponsors of terrorist activities, or subjects of United \n     Nations sanctions are not elected to--\n       (A) leadership positions in the United Nations General \n     Assembly; or\n       (B) membership or leadership positions on the United \n     Nations Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations \n     Security Council, or any other United Nations entity or \n     affiliate.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncondemning the recent selection of Libya to chair the 59th session of \nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights. If it was not so tragic, \nthis selection would be a joke. That session begins in just a few days, \non March 17.\n  Joining me as cosponsors are Senators Smith, Kennedy, Feinstein, and \nCorzine.\n  The reason I say it would almost be a joke is that it is \nunconscionable that a human rights abuser such as Libya, and a country \nthat has been the subject of United Nations sanctions because of its \nlinks to terrorist activities, would be selected to lead an \ninternational human rights organization. Talk about the fox in the \nchicken coop, this is an exact replication of what that old saw is. \nLibya has not even complied with the Commission's own recommendations \non how to improve its own dismal human rights record.\n  We are talking about a country that was responsible for downing a \npassenger airliner and the bombing of a discotheque in Europe.\n  Libya's selection to the chairmanship undermines the credibility of \nthis Commission and threatens the international community's \nresponsibility to protect human rights. How can the Commission retain \nany credibility with Libya at the helm?\n  I want to review Libya's human rights record over the past three \ndecades, which Human Rights Watch characterizes as ``appalling.'' This \nrecord includes the abduction, forced disappearance, and assassination \nof political opponents. In Libya today, hundreds of people remain \narbitrarily detained, and some have been so for over a decade. Human \nrights monitors have registered concern about the use of physical and \npsychological torture in detainment, leading to the deaths of some \ndetainees.\n  Additionally, the Libyan Government restricts freedom of speech, \npress, assembly, association, and religion.\n  Does a government with such a record merit the chair of a Commission \nthat was established in 1946, in the wake of the atrocities of World \nWar II, specifically to protect the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights? Libya should not chair this Commission. If anything, it should \nbe under investigation by it.\n  In 2000, after years of investigations and appeals, two Libyan \nintelligence officers were found guilty by Scottish judges in the \nattack on Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270 people, including 38 from \nNew Jersey and citizens from over 20 other countries.\n  Just as the international community was finally sentencing the \nLibyans responsible for this 1988 tragedy, and beginning to bring them \nto justice, General Qadhafi was planning Libya's ascent to lead the \nCommission on Human Rights. He gained the African nomination for chair \nagainst the wishes of many fellow African leaders, some of whom are \nmaking genuine strides toward improving their countries' human rights \nrecords.\n  At the time, a spokeswoman from South Africa's opposition group, the \nDemocratic Alliance, said:\n\n       African countries should have supported a candidate of whom \n     all Africans could be proud.\n\n  For the first time in the history of the Commission on Human Rights, \nthe United States--appalled by the African Union's nomination of \nLibya--called for a vote. On January 20 of this year, only Canada and \none other country joined the United States in voting against Libya's \nchairmanship. Many of the 33 countries that voted in favor of Libya are \nrecipients of United States direct foreign assistance. Imagine, we are \ngiving them aid, and these countries are supporting the chairmanship\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nof a country that is an abuser of human rights of the first order. Many \nof our European allies abstained from the vote.\n  The resolution I am introducing with my colleagues, Senators Smith, \nKennedy, Feinstein, and Corzine, condemns Libya's selection as chair. \nIt asserts that the manipulation of the Commission by a gross human \nrights violator undermines the credibility of the body while \nlegitimizing regimes that continue their oppressive activities.\n  This resolution calls on countries throughout the world to renew \ntheir commitment to human rights. The resolution also calls on the \nPresident and the Secretary of State to object strongly to the United \nNations' current suspension of its sanctions against Libya. These \nsanctions should remain in place until Libya complies with the \nrequirements of multiple U.N. resolutions, one of which calls on Libyan \nleader Muammar Qadhafi to acknowledge responsibility for the 1988 Pan \nAm terrorism attack--something he has refused to do so far, despite the \nincontrovertible evidence.\n  Finally, in this resolution, I call on the Secretary of State to work \nwith other members of the United Nations to reform that Commission and \nto ensure that governments that violate human rights, sponsor terrorist \nactivities, and are subject to U.N. sanctions cannot be elected to \nleadership positions in the Commission and other U.N. bodies in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg in expressing our deepest \nconcern that Libya will chair the next session of the United Nations \nHuman Rights Commission.\n  We know that Libya has supported, trained, and harbored some of the \nmost notorious terrorists in the world. Libya is on the Department of \nState's list of nations that sponsor terrorism. To allow Libya to chair \nthe UN Human Rights Commission is a serious and shameful mistake.\n  At this difficult time, the United Nations needs the highest possible \ncredibility as it struggles to deal effectively with so many vital \nissues affecting nations throughout the world.\n  In fact, Libya continues to be in violation of multiple United \nNations resolutions. It still has not complied with Security Council \nResolution 748 to `'accept complete responsibility for the actions of \nLibyan officials.''\n  Libya still has not complied with the resolution to ``commit itself \ndefinitively to cease all forms of terrorist action and all assistance \nto terrorist groups and promptly, by concrete actions, demonstrate its \nrenunciation of terrorism.'' We have received nothing concrete \nrenouncing terrorism.\n  The international community is still waiting for Libya to accept \nresponsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, a bombing \nthat murdered 270 innocent persons, including 89 Americans and 13 from \nMassachusetts. Until September 11th, the Pan Am bombing had killed more \nAmericans than any other terrorist atrocity in our history.\n  Clearly, Libya should not have been appointed to chair an \ninternational human rights commission. Yet, in a secret ballot, 33 \ncountries voted in favor of Libya, 17 abstained, and only the United \nStates and Canada voted against Libya.\n  Fourteen years later, the families and the world community are still \ntrying to find justice. We are still trying to hold Libya accountable \nfor this atrocity, and we are still asking Libya to renounce terrorism \nand pay appropriate compensation to the victims' families.\n  Colonel Qadhafi still has not acknowledged that he ordered the \nattack. The victims still have not been compensated. The Libyans are \nstill demanding that international economic sanctions be lifted, and \nthat the Libyan government receive a clean bill of health on terrorism \nbefore it provides compensation to the families.\n  This choice of Libya should be a wakeup call for this administration. \nIt shows the need for our own genuine participation in the UN--not the \narrogant attitude the administration so often uses in its relations \nwith other nations. We cannot expect to have good ties, even with our \nallies, if we do not treat them with respect.\n  I urge the Senate to support this proposal that requests President \nBush and Secretary of State Powell to object strongly to the UN's \ncurrent suspension of sanctions against Libya and to work with other \nmembers of the UN to reform the Human Rights Commission. Terrorism \ndeserves no support from any nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 14--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n   REGARDING THE EDUCATION CURRICULUM IN THE KINDGOM OF SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nFeingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the terrorist attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, were carried out by 19 hijackers, \n     including 15 Saudi Arabian nationals;\n       Whereas the Government of Saudi Arabia controls and \n     regulates all forms of education in public and private \n     schools at all levels;\n       Whereas Islamic religious education is compulsory in public \n     and private schools at all levels in Saudi Arabia;\n       Whereas the religious curriculum is written, monitored, and \n     taught by followers of the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, \n     the only religious doctrine that the Government of Saudi \n     Arabia allows to be taught;\n       Whereas rote memorization of religious texts continues to \n     be a central feature of much of the educational system of \n     Saudi Arabia, leaving thousands of students unprepared to \n     function in the global economy of the 21st century;\n       Whereas the Government of Saudi Arabia has tolerated \n     elements within its education system that promote and \n     encourage extremism;\n       Whereas some of the textbooks used in schools in Saudi \n     Arabia foster a combination of intolerance, ignorance, and \n     anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-Western views;\n       Whereas these intolerant views make students in whom they \n     are instilled prime recruiting targets of extremist groups;\n       Whereas extremism endangers the stability of the Kingdom of \n     Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region and threatens global \n     security;\n       Whereas the events of September 11, 2001, have created an \n     urgent need to promote moderate voices in the Islamic world \n     as an effective way to combat extremism; and\n       Whereas the Government of Saudi Arabia is currently \n     conducting a review of its education curriculum: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) supports the review by the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     of its education curriculum;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Saudi Arabia to ensure that \n     such review is thorough, objective, and public;\n       (3) requests the United States Representative to the United \n     Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n     (UNESCO) to--\n       (A) address the issue of the educational curriculum reform \n     at the 2003 session of the UNESCO General Conference; and\n       (B) encourage UNESCO to examine the educational system in \n     Saudi Arabia and monitor the progress of the efforts to \n     reform the curriculum; and\n       (4) urges the Government of Saudi Arabia to reform its \n     education curriculum in a manner that promotes tolerance, \n     develops civil society, and encourages functionality in the \n     global economy.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \nresolution on behalf of myself and Mr. Schumer that brings to light \npervasive messages of intolerance in Saudi Arabia's education \ncurriculum and the need for reform of that curriculum. We are joined in \nthis effort by Mr. Corzine, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wyden.\n  There have been recent studies that reveal that school textbooks in \nSaudi Arabia often foster anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-Western \nviews. We might all recall that 15 of the 19 hijackers responsible for \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks were Saudi Arabian nationals. It is \nabsolutely critical that we and others in the United States work to \nensure that radical doctrines and messages of hate are not present in \nany child's education, and that the values taught in Saudi Arabia's \nschools in particular do not turn innocent children into prime \ncandidates to commit terrorist acts as adults.\n  There is no question of who is responsible for any messages of hate \nthat might appear in Saudi textbooks. The Saudi Arabian Government \ncontrols and regulates all forms of education in\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\npublic as well as in private schools. The religious curriculum is \nwritten, monitored, and taught by followers of the Wahhabi \ninterpretation of Islam--the only religious doctrine the Government of \nSaudi Arabia allows to be taught.\n  Our important resolution calls for Saudi Arabia to thoroughly review \nits education curriculum and to reform it in a manner that promotes \ntolerance, develops civil society, and encourages functionality in the \nglobal economy. It is in the interest of security and peace that we end \nany educational malpractice in Saudi Arabia that might lead to more \ntragedy and terror.\n  Finally, the resolution also calls upon the United States \nRepresentative to UNESCO to urge that the U.N. body take up the \ntextbook issue and monitor reform of the education curriculum in Saudi \nArabia.\n  Mr. President, I also urge my respected colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--COMMEMORATING THE 140TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n             THE ISSUANCE OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\n\n  Mr. ALLEN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the \n     United States, issued a proclamation on September 22, 1862, \n     declaring that on the first day of January, 1863, ``all \n     persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of \n     a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against \n     the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever \n     free'';\n       Whereas the proclamation declared ``all persons held slaves \n     within the insurgent States''--with the exception of \n     Tennessee, southern Louisiana, and parts of Virginia, then \n     within Union lines--``are free'';\n       Whereas, for two and half years, Texas slaves were held in \n     bondage after the Emancipation Proclamation became official \n     and only after Major General Gordon Granger and his soldiers \n     arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, were African-\n     American slaves in that State set free;\n       Whereas slavery was a horrendous practice and trade in \n     human trafficking that continued until the passage of the \n     Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ending \n     slavery on December 18, 1865;\n       Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation is historically \n     significant and history is regarded as a means of \n     understanding the past and solving the challenges of the \n     future;\n       Whereas one hundred and forty years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans have \n     integrated into various levels of society; and\n       Whereas commemorating the 140th anniversary of the \n     Emancipation Proclamation highlights and reflects the \n     suffering and progress of the faith and strength of character \n     shown by slaves and their descendants as an example for all \n     people of the United States, regardless of background, \n     religion, or race: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historical significance of the 140th \n     anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation as an important \n     period in the Nation's history; and\n       (2) encourages its celebration in accordance with the \n     spirit, strength, and legacy of freedom, justice, and \n     equality for all people of America and to provide an \n     opportunity for all people of the United States to learn more \n     about the past and to better understand the experiences that \n     have shaped the Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 16--HONORING THE LIFE AND WORK OF MR.

Res. 16\n\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in \n     1928;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers earned a degree in music composition, \n     studied child development at the University of Pittsburgh, \n     attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, and was ordained a \n     Presbyterian minister;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers created ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' in \n     1966, and hosted the program through the Public Broadcasting \n     Service (PBS) from 1968 through 2000;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' is the longest-running \n     program on PBS;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' was created and filmed \n     in Fred Rogers' hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers' caring, genuine spirit reflects the \n     values shared by the people of southwestern Pennsylvania and \n     by so many neighborhoods throughout the country;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' continues to be a \n     nurturing, educational program for children emphasizing the \n     value of every individual and helping children understand how \n     they fit into their families, communities, and country;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was appointed Chairman of the Forum on \n     Mass Media and Child Development of the White House \n     Conference on Youth in 1968;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' won 4 Emmy Awards, \n     ``Lifetime Achievement'' Awards, and 2 George Foster Peabody \n     Awards;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers won every major award in television for \n     which he was eligible;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall \n     of Fame in 1999;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush awarded Mr. Rogers the \n     Presidential Medal of Honor in 2002;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was also a prolific songwriter and \n     author; and\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was presented with over 40 honorary \n     degrees from colleges and universities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress recognizes and honors Mr. Fred \n     McFeely Rogers for--\n       (1) dedicating his career to the educational and \n     imaginative children's program ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'';\n       (2) the accomplishments of this influential program and the \n     emphasis it places on the value of each individual within his \n     or her community; and\n       (3) the compassionate, moral example he set for millions of \n     American children for over 30 years.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FRED McFEELY ROGERS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 16 submitted \nearlier today by Senators Santorum and Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 16) honoring the life \n     and work of Mr. Fred McFeely Rogers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute \nto Mr. Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the Public Broadcasting \nService, PBS children's television program, Mister Rogers' \nNeighborhood.\n  For more than 30 years, America has been fortunate to have one of the \nmost caring and dedicated neighbors in Mr. Rogers. His soft-spoken and \npatient manner put viewers at ease and allowed Mr. Rogers to \ncourageously address adult topics such as death, divorce, and anger. \nThe neighborhood of make believe residents helped to illustrate \ndifferences in people and teach children the importance of cooperation. \nFrom King Friday and Queen Sara Saturday to Henrietta Pussycat and \nDaniel Stripped Tiger, diversity, tolerance, and problem solving were \nnot only taught, but celebrated.\n  Mr. Rogers is a role model for people and parents everywhere. His \nability to communicate with children offered them a place, every \nmorning, where they felt accepted and understood. Mr. Rogers, dressed \nin his signature cardigan sweater and tying his tennis shoes, often \nsang the song ``You Are Special'' in which he said, ``You are my \nfriend. You are special to me. You are the only one like you. Like you, \nmy friend, I like you.'' I cannot think of a more important lesson to \nteach children than the lesson of self-esteem. Mr. Rogers taught self-\nesteem, but he was never limited in his lessons. Just as importantly, \nhe helped his viewers explore subjects they were curious about and \ndevelop their own sense of self and creativity through imagination, all \nthe while helping to teach self-discipline.\n  Mr. Rogers was much more than simply a great neighbor. Born in \nLatrobe, PA, on March 20, 1928, Fred Rogers began his television career \nin New York City in 1951. With a music composition degree from Rollins \nCollege, Mr. Rogers served as an apprentice at NBC managing the musical \nselections for some of the network's earliest shows. In 1953, after \nmarrying college sweetheart Sara Joanne Byrd, Mr. Rogers returned to \nPennsylvania to develop programming at WQED in Pittsburgh. It was at \nWQED that Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood really flourished. After working as \na puppeteer, Mr. Rogers had the opportunity to develop his own 15 \nminute segment that eventually became the Mr. Rogers Neighborhood that \nAmerica knows and loves today. Over thirty years and almost 900 \nepisodes later, the messages that Mr. Rogers delivered are as vital now \nas they were in 1960.\n  Mr. Rogers' accomplishments reach far beyond the boundaries of the \nneighborhood. Ordained by the Pittsburgh Presbytery in 1962, Mr. Rogers \nwas active in child and family advocacy on all levels. In 1972, Mr. \nRogers formed Family Communications, Inc. to produce educational \nentertainment for children and families and resources for teachers. Mr. \nRogers most recently partnered with the Western Pennsylvania Caring \nFoundation to establish the Caring Place for grieving children in an \neffort to make sure that children who experienced a loss did not feel \nso alone.\n  During his career of service to children, families, and communities, \nMr. Rogers was the recipient of two George Foster Peabody Awards, four \nEmmys, and two ``Lifetime Achievement Awards'' from the National \nAcademy of Television Arts and Sciences and the TV Critics Association. \nIn July 2002, Mr. Rogers was awarded the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom--the Nation's highest civilian honor--for his dedication to the \nwell-being of children and for a career that demonstrates the \nimportance of kindness, compassion, and learning. All of these awards \nadded to the 30 honorary degrees that Mr. Rogers received throughout \nthe years.\n  Mr. Rogers was no stranger to Capitol Hill. After testifying before \nthe Senate in 1969, Mr. Rogers made an almost annual visit to Capitol \nHill to express how deeply he believed in the importance of education. \nI was honored to have Mr. Rogers as a guest in my office during his \nmany visits to the Senate. While walking around the U.S. Capitol with \nhim, my Senate colleagues and their staff flocked to Mr. Rogers as if \nhe were royalty, which he most certainly was. Always kind enough to \nstop and say hello or pose for a picture, Mr. Rogers truly epitomized \nthe quintessential teacher, father, friend, guide, and neighbor.\n  Mr. Rogers' ability to talk about the things that really matter in \nchildhood have made him an inspiration to two generations of children \nalready, and to countless generations to come. Our nation's children \nare better today for having had the counsel and wisdom of Pittsburgh's \nown Mr. Rogers. All of us were truly fortunate to have had the best \nneighbor in Mr. Rogers.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 16) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in \n     1928;\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n       Whereas Fred Rogers earned a degree in music composition, \n     studied child development at the University of Pittsburgh, \n     attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, and was ordained a \n     Presbyterian minister;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers created ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' in \n     1966, and hosted the program through the Public Broadcasting \n     Service (PBS) from 1968 through 2000;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' is the longest-running \n     program on PBS;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' was created and filmed \n     in Fred Rogers' hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers' caring, genuine spirit reflects the \n     values shared by the people of southwestern Pennsylvania and \n     by so many neighborhoods throughout the country;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' continues to be a \n     nurturing, educational program for children emphasizing the \n     value of every individual and helping children understand how \n     they fit into their families, communities, and country;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was appointed Chairman of the Forum on \n     Mass Media and Child Development of the White House \n     Conference on Youth in 1968;\n       Whereas ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' won 4 Emmy Awards, \n     ``Lifetime Achievement'' Awards, and 2 George Foster Peabody \n     Awards;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers won every major award in television for \n     which he was eligible;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall \n     of Fame in 1999;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush awarded Mr. Rogers the \n     Presidential Medal of Honor in 2002;\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was also a prolific songwriter and \n     author; and\n       Whereas Fred Rogers was presented with over 40 honorary \n     degrees from colleges and universities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress recognizes and honors Mr. Fred \n     McFeely Rogers for--\n       (1) dedicating his career to the educational and \n     imaginative children's program ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'';\n       (2) the accomplishments of this influential program and the \n     emphasis it places on the value of each individual within his \n     or her community; and\n       (3) the compassionate, moral example he set for millions of \n     American children for over 30 years.\n\n     SEC. 2.
