Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume the \nconsideration of S. 3, the partial-birth abortion bill. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Murray will be prepared to offer an amendment \nthis morning. The majority leader has stated it is his intention to \nfinish this important legislation by the end of the week. Senators \nwishing to offer amendments to the bill are encouraged to notify the \nmanagers of their intent so that we can proceed to an orderly \nconsideration of the amendments.\n  Under the previous unanimous consent agreement, at 11 a.m. today the \nSenate will return to the Estrada nomination and begin a discussion of \nthe Senate's constitutional role of advise and consent. Members are \nencouraged to come to the Chamber and engage in this discussion.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party \nlunches. Following the recess, the Senate will return to the \nconsideration of the partial-birth abortion bill. Additional amendments \nare expected and therefore Members should anticipate votes this \nafternoon.\n  Lastly, I know it was the hope of the majority leader to schedule a \nvote on a district judge on the calendar this morning. We attempted to \nschedule a vote at 10:30. At this point, we understand there is an \nobjection to setting the vote on Ralph Erickson of North Dakota to be a \nU.S. District Judge for the District of North Dakota. We will continue \nto and hopefully work out a unanimous consent agreement. We will \ncertainly notify Members if we are able to succeed in getting a vote \nset sometime this morning.\n  I thank all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to the manager of this bill, first, \nwe would probably agree to the judge without a vote. We are trying to \nrun that through to find out if we would agree to the judge without a \nvote.\n  Secondly, we have a finite list of amendments we have received on our \nside. We have run that through to the floor staff on the other side. We \nunderstand, rightfully so, that Senators want to see the amendments \nbefore there is an agreement on whether or not we could proceed on that \nbasis. Yesterday, the majority leader indicated to me and to the \nDemocratic leader that he wanted to finish this bill and could we \ncooperate and have a finite list of amendments. We have given those to \nthe other side and we hope we can move forward.\n  We have had a number of our Members who wanted to bring up amendments \nthat are not related to this issue and we have worked to have them not \ndo that. So we hope those amendments could be reviewed quickly. We will \ntry to get all the amendments. The first amendment Senator Murray is \ngoing to offer, we hope there will be agreement that there would be no \nsecond-degree amendments to that. She is not going to offer it until \nthere is some agreement to that effect. We hope to get that done \nquickly. We just gave the Senator the amendment. We understand it needs \nto be looked over.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I have not had a chance to see the \namendment, but I want to thank the leader for his willingness to come \nforward and offer a set of amendments. It is a reasonable set of \namendments, from my estimation. We have not run a check on our side to \nsee if there are any amendments. We are in the process of doing that. I \ndo not anticipate very many, if any, at this point.\n\n  We are going to look at the amendment of Senator Murray. If we can, \nwe will certainly allow that to go forward and we will certainly \nconsider all the other amendments. If my colleagues can get them to us, \nI think we can fairly quickly enter into a unanimous consent agreement \nand move forward on this legislation. Again, I thank the Senator from \nNevada for his willingness to come forward last night with this consent \nagreement. We are off to a\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\ngood start in trying to get this bill done in a timely fashion this \nweek, and I thank him for his cooperation.\n  With respect to the issue of the judge, if the Senator does not want \nto vote on a judge, I know our leader would like to have a vote this \nmorning, whether it is on a judge or some procedural matter. The leader \nwould like to get Members to the Chamber for this discussion. \nObviously, this is a vitally important discussion. The role of advise \nand consent is one of the more fundamental issues we have to grapple \nwith, and our leader would like to have as much participation as \npossible. As is the case in the Senate, we usually cannot get that \nparticipation unless Senators are in the Chamber for a vote, and I \nthink that is his intention.\n  We will certainly work with the other side in making sure we can come \nup with some accommodation that will suit both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3422-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3) to prohibit the procedure commonly known as \n     partial-birth abortion.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We resume today the debate on the issue of partial-\nbirth abortion and Congress's fourth attempt to ban this procedure. \nThere have been comments in the past about some of the descriptions we \nhave used on the floor as to whether they are accurate, and whether \nsome of the charts we have used are medically accurate charts. Some \nsuggested in the line drawings we had depicted a fetus that was larger \nthan the size of most in partial-birth abortions. In working with \npeople from the medical community, we have come up with more realistic \ndrawings to depict the actual procedure so people can graphically \nunderstand what is described in this legislation.\n  I will read the description in the legislation and show how the chart \nbehind me is representative of this description. We have tightened the \ndefinition. The reason we tightened the definition was in response to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court that found the original definition in the \ncongressional bill, which is similar to the one in Nebraska, was unduly \nvague, and, therefore, unconstitutional because of vagueness. We have \ntaken further steps to make sure that by banning this procedure we are \nnot including any other procedure that is used for late-trimester, \nlate-term abortions.\n  Let me read what is in the legislation today and then go through the \ncharts to show how that comports with this definition.\n\n       (1) the term ``partial-birth abortion'' means an abortion \n     in which--\n       (A) the person performing the abortion deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the \n     case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is \n     outside the body of the mother . . .\n\n  Now, I break from the text as to what partial-birth abortions are. \nThe procedure itself is done in a breech position, but there may be a \ncase--and this is what we are taking into consideration, here, the \npresentation--where the doctor makes a mistake and cannot deliver the \nchild for some reason in a breech position. As I know, having been the \nfather of seven children, you do not want a breech delivery. That is a \ndangerous delivery. That is not a normal delivery.\n  To authorize or to start a delivery in breech is a higher risk to the \nmother, No. 1. No. 2, for purposes of this procedure, that is what is \ndescribed, that is what the doctors have said is the procedure which \nthey would recommend. But there are always, in these medical \nprocedures, chances for things to go awry so we take into consideration \nthat if for some reason during this procedure the head is presented \nfirst, that will still be covered.\n\n       or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the \n     fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother \n     for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person \n     knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and\n       (B) performs the overt act, other than completion of \n     delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\n\n  Now, that is the description that is in the bill.\n  Let me show graphically the process by which this abortion takes \nplace. This is a picture of a fetus inside the mother's uterus with the \ngestational age of roughly 24 weeks. The gestational period is 40 weeks \nfor normal development. We are talking about now 24 weeks, or better \nthan halfway through the pregnancy. That is when the vast majority of \npartial-birth abortions occur. In fact, all of them occur after 20 \nweeks. Most of them occur 22, 24, 26 weeks.\n\n  In the first picture we see the baby in the womb, in the normal fetal \nposition. What has happened before this procedure occurs is the mother \npresents herself to the abortionist. And the abortionist, in making a \ndetermination to do a partial-birth abortion, gives the mother a \nmedication to dilate her cervix so this procedure can then be \nperformed. This dilation occurs over a 2-day period. The woman presents \none day, the next day she stays at home, and the third day she arrives \nat the abortion clinic.\n  I use abortion clinic advisedly because this procedure is not \nperformed in hospitals. It is not taught at medical schools. It is done \nsolely at abortion clinics. The doctor who created this procedure \ntestified that the reason he created this procedure was not because \nthis was a better medical procedure for women. This was not designed \nfor women's health. He said, and I am quoting him, he designed this \nprocedure because other late-term abortions, when women presented \nthemselves into his office, took 45 minutes. He could do this procedure \nin 15 minutes. Therefore, he said, he can do more abortions; he can \nmake more money. So the person who designed this procedure, the person \nwho put the medical literature out on this procedure is very clear as \nto why he designed this procedure. It is quick. It is easier for him. \nAnd he can make more money because he can do more abortions in a day.\n  So the mother, having been presented at the abortion clinic 2 days \nbefore, takes this drug. We heard from the Senator from Ohio yesterday, \nSenator DeWine, of instances where mothers in Ohio, two cases--\nremember, this procedure was invented by a doctor in Ohio--two cases \nfrom a Dayton abortion clinic where the mother was given medicine to \ndilate her cervix and in two separate cases, because of the dilation, \nlabor was induced and two different women delivered babies. One named \nBaby Hope lived 3\\1/2\\ hours and was not given medical treatment. I \ndon't know all the facts as to why. Maybe it was an assessment that the \nchild was too premature to live. The second baby, Baby Grace, was born \nand survived as a result of the live birth.\n  So we are talking about children here. This is very important. We are \ntalking about this little infant here, this fetus, that would otherwise \nbe born alive. The definition of the bill, I repeat one more time, of a \nbaby delivered in a breech position:\n\n       . . . any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside \n     the body of the mother for the purposes of performing an \n     overt act that . . . will kill the . . . fetus.\n\n  You cannot kill a fetus if it is not alive. So this is a very \nimportant part of this definition. When the baby is delivered, the baby \nmust be alive. If the baby is dead, we are not talking about an \nabortion because the baby is already dead. We are talking about a \nliving fetus, living baby.\n  The first step now, the women presents herself, the cervix has been \ndilated, the physician goes in and grabs the baby's foot and begins to \npull the baby into the birth canal in a breech position. Again, I \nrepeat, no one preferably delivers a child in a breech position. It is \njust not what is medically recommended, but in this case we have the \nchild being presented in a breech position.\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\n  Again, you can see the size of the baby in relationship to the size \nof the hand of the doctor. Some will say, well, that baby is much \nbigger than a baby. This is a blown-up chart. Of course it is bigger. \nLook at the size of the child relative to the size of the hand of the \nphysician who is performing this abortion. You will see the size is \nabout the size of the hand, 8, 9 inches in length, which is roughly the \nsize of a child at that gestational age.\n  The child is pulled through the birth canal and presented.\n  Remember, here is the child outside of the mother as described in the \nbill, outside of the mother beyond the navel. The child is alive. The \nchild is alive and is being delivered in this breech position. But the \nchild is alive at this point in time.\n\n  But for what I am going to describe in charts 4 and 5, this child \ncould be born alive. It would be born alive. It had the potential to \nsurvive. But that doesn't occur in the case of the partial-birth \nabortion.\n  What happens next is the abortionist takes a pair of sharp scissors \nand, probing with their fingers to find the base of the baby's skull, \nthe softer point here, below the bone that protects the brain, finds a \nsoft spot and thrusts a pair of scissors into the base of a living \nchild's head who would otherwise be born alive.\n  One of the nurses who testified before Congress said she witnessed a \npartial-birth abortion and she witnessed the reaction of a child who \nwas killed by one of these procedures and she said she saw the child's \narms go out, flinch like a baby would do if you dropped it--sort of let \nit go. They let their arms and legs sort of go out. That is what this \nlittle child will go through as a result of this procedure.\n  Can this child feel pain? Most assuredly. Its nervous system is \ndeveloped. In fact, going back to the first chart, when the doctor is \nreaching in to try to grab the leg, as has been described in testimony, \nthe child tries to get away from the instrument that is grabbing its \nfoot. The scissors are thrust into the base of the skull. That very \nwell may kill the child. I don't know. In some cases it probably would. \nProbably in most cases it would.\n  But we are not done yet. We have to add insult to the injury. The \ndoctor takes a suction catheter and, through the hole which is now in \nthe base of the child's skull, he inserts a suction tube, and with that \nsuction--tube he turns it on and suctions out the baby's brain. It \ncollapses the baby's skull.\n  For those of you who have held newborns, you know that their skull is \nvery soft, pliable. So without anything inside, it has been suctioned \nout through force, the baby's head collapses, and the rest of the baby \ncan be delivered.\n  This is a procedure that is barbaric. It is barbaric. On a little \nbaby who would otherwise be born alive--and if there is any question \nabout that, I point to you Baby Hope and Baby Grace, who were ticketed \nfor partial-birth abortions but were delivered prior to that.\n  What we have suggested in the Senate now, for the fourth Congress in \na row, is that a procedure that was developed by a doctor who testified \nthat the reason he developed this procedure was that he could do more \nabortions, make more money, is not medically necessary under any \ncircumstances.\n  I have a quote here from Warren Hern. Warren Hern is a noted third-\ntrimester abortionist. He has written books on late-term abortions. He \ndoes a lot of them. When he says, ``I have very serious reservations \nabout this procedure . . . you really can't defend it . . . I would \ndispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use . . . '' \nthis isn't Rick Santorum who has trouble with abortion, period--I admit \nthat--this is someone who does abortions. This is someone who does \nlate-term abortions. As I said, Dr. Warren Hern is the author of the \nstandard textbook on abortion procedures. We have a situation where \nthis procedure was designed simply so they could do more late-term \nabortions quicker.\n  There is plenty of evidence--I will get into this later--that this \nprocedure has profound, long-term health consequences to women. This is \nnot, as Dr. Hern says, the safest procedure for women.\n\n  There is no case--and I am going to underscore this 100 times, and I \nchallenge anyone who opposes this legislation--anyone: If you are on \nthe floor of the Senate, listening back home, listening--if anyone \nhere, anyone across America, anyone around the world--and I want the \nSupreme Court to hear this--anyone can present to me a case, a factual \nsituation where a partial-birth abortion is medically necessary vis-a-\nvis other types of abortions, if you can present to me one case, I will \nbe shocked. That is because I have been asking this question for 7 \nyears here on the floor of the Senate, outside, to groups--the folks \nwho agree with me, the folks who disagree with me.\n  I have asked one question: Tell me why this is medically necessary. \nTell me why, when even abortionists say it is not medically necessary, \nwhere no medical school in the country teaches this procedure, tell me \nwhy we have to keep this brutality of killing a child literally inches \naway from being born, why we have to keep up this brutality that is \ndone purely so doctors who are abortionists can make more money, legal \nin America.\n  I ask again, anybody who comes here to the floor to debate this \nissue, who says we need a health exception, give me one case--one case. \nSeven years I have asked this question. Seven years I have asked this \nquestion. One case. Never has anyone even tried to put one together \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will act on this bill. I am happy the \nminority whip, Senator Reid, has given us a list of amendments so we \ncan proceed in an orderly fashion on this legislation.\n  I see the Senator from Washington is here to offer her amendment. I \ncertainly want to give her the opportunity to do that. I am looking \nforward to debate, not only on these amendments but to have a really \ngood, honest debate--I underscore the word ``honest.'' There has been a \nlot of information--I will go through that, too--that has been put out \nby people who oppose this ban, everything from saying the anesthesia \nkills the baby to on down the line. There has been a lot of information \nthat has been erroneous that has been put out by the other side.\n  I am looking forward to a good, honest debate on this issue. I hope \nwe can get an overwhelming vote in the Senate to ban a procedure that \nis horrific, brutal, and never medically necessary for any purpose. It \nis only necessary so we can have abortionists who do late-term \nabortions earn more money, and that isn't a good reason to allow this \nbarbaric procedure to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 258\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the availability of contraceptives for women)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, here we are, once again debating this \nissue. Since we began debating how to criminalize women's health \nchoices yesterday, the Dow Jones has dropped 170 points; we are 1 day \ncloser to a war in Iraq; we have done nothing to stimulate the economy \nor create any new jobs or provide any more health coverage. But here we \nare, debating abortion in a time of national crisis.\n  Since we are debating S. 3, I want to expose this proposal for what \nit is. It is deceptive, it is extreme, and it is unconstitutional.\n  First of all, it is deceptive. The other side wants you to think that \nthis just affects one procedure performed in the third trimester, but \nthat is not true. We need to remember what Roe v. Wade clearly spells \nout. Up to viability, a woman and her doctor make the choice. However, \nany late-term abortion can only be performed to save the life or health \nof the woman. But the language in S. 3 is broad. It is so broad as to \napply to many procedures, and it would impact women in the second \ntrimester.\n  That is exactly why the Supreme Court struck down a similar State law \nin Nebraska. It is deceptive because it would not just be limited to \nwhat the other side implies it does.\n  Partial-birth is a political term. It is not a medical term. Despite \nall of the hot rhetoric we hear, this bill is neither designed nor \nwritten to ban only one procedure. It would also apply well before \nviability and could ban possibly more than one procedure.\n  Second, this bill is extreme. It is just the first in a long march to \ndismantling a constitutionally protected freedom. Don't take my word \nfor it. Listen\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nto the President of the United States who declared in 1994:\n\n       I will do everything in my power to restrict abortion.\n\n  On the issue of women's reproductive freedom, the President has kept \nhis word. He and his staff have worked tirelessly to turn back the \nclock on women's health choices. In only 2 years, the President has \nissued a rash of executive actions that could severely restrict stem \ncell research, thus threatening lifesaving medical advances; reimposed \nthe global gag rule on international family planning programs; made a \nfetus eligible for health insurance but not the pregnant woman who is \ncarrying the fetus; packed the Federal courts with anti-choice judges; \nand appointed stanch opponents of reproductive choice throughout all \nlevels of the executive branch.\n  We will hear the Republicans use the most graphic and disturbing \ndescriptions they can find to try to sour the public on something that \nwas decided by the U.S. Supreme Court years ago. And it still opens the \ndoor to future politicians banning additional safe and legal \nprocedures.\n  Third, this ban is unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court has \nalready ruled that this very type of restriction violates the \nConstitution. Last year, in the case of Stenberg vs. Carhart, the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled a similar law at the State level unconstitutional \nfor two reasons.\n  First, the language is so broad that it bans other constitutionally \nprotected procedures. The Supreme Court's rulings state:\n\n       Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D, its language \n     makes clear it also covers a much broader category of \n     procedures.\n\n  The bill before us is similarly unconstitutional because it covers \ntoo many constitutionally protected procedures.\n  Second, the Supreme Court found the State law unconstitutional \nbecause it did not contain an exception to protect the woman's health. \nLet me read that part of the ruling.\n\n       The governing standard requires an exception where it is \n     necessary and appropriate medical judgment for the \n     preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the \n     process of regulating the method of abortion impose \n     significant health risks.\n\n  Guess what. The Republican bill before us fails the same \nconstitutional test. It is too broad, and it does not contain an \nexception to protect the health of the mother. And the Supreme Court \nhas said it is unconstitutional.\n  We have Republicans offering today a clearly unconstitutional bill on \nat least two counts. Proponents of the ban will argue that they have \naddressed the concerns addressed by the Supreme Court. However, a \nstatement of congressional findings is not binding on the Court. The \nother side is using misleading and deceptive arguments to ram through \nan extreme and unconstitutional measure.\n\n  If the goal of the Republican Senate, the Republican House, and the \nRepublican White House is to have fewer abortions in this country, then \nlet us have an honest attempt to accomplish that goal. To show a real \ncommitment to reducing abortion, my colleagues should support the \namendment I will offer. It will help prevent unintended pregnancies and \nabortions in the first place.\n  The Murray-Reid amendment which we intend to offer would do three \nthings: It would reduce unintended pregnancies, reduce the number of \nabortions, and improve the health of low-income women.\n  I will offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Reid and myself. \nSenator Reid has been a long-time champion of women's health issues, \nand especially for access to family planning. I thank Senator Reid for \nhis leadership on the amendment I will offer.\n  The Murray-Reid amendment would raise awareness about emergency \ncontraceptives and ensure that insurance companies treat contraceptives \nfairly and ensure that low-income women have access to health care \nbefore, during, and after pregnancy.\n  First of all, the Murray-Reid amendment would reduce the number of \nabortions in America. I think that is something we can all agree on, \nand it is something we all would support.\n  By educating women about the availability of emergency contraception, \nan emergency contraceptive known as an EC could help prevent a \npregnancy when taken within 72 hours. It is sometimes called the \nmorning-after pill. An EC does not induce an abortion. An EC is not RU-\n486. It is simply a high dose of conventional birth control taken soon \nafter contraceptive failure, unprotected sex, or rape.\n  ECs are safe and they are legal. They reduce the number of abortions \nand unintended pregnancies.\n  In fact, a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute found that \nemergency contraception prevented 51,000 abortions in 2000. \nUnfortunately, too few women know that they are available. It has been \nreported that 50 percent of all pregnancies in our country are \nunintentional. The best way to ensure a healthy child and reduce the \ninfant mortality rate or birth defects is to ensure that the woman is \nhealthy prior to pregnancy. Public awareness campaigns targeting women \nand health care procedures will help remove many of the barriers to \nemergency contraception and will help bring this important means of \npreventing unintentional pregnancies to American women.\n  My amendment simply improves the awareness about emergency \ncontraceptives.\n  According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nonly one-third of women of reproductive age know about emergency \ncontraception.\n  Mr. President, again I will be offering my amendment shortly. One of \nthe provisions will be to improve awareness about emergency \ncontraceptives. As I said, according to the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, only a third of women of reproductive \nage know about emergency contraception, and only one in five physicians \nregularly discuss it with their patients.\n  What the Murray-Reid amendment does is improve awareness about \nemergency contraceptives by providing $10 million in each of the next 5 \nyears to establish a public education program. It will educate women \nand medical professionals across the country about the use of emergency \ncontraceptives. It will allow the Department of Health and Human \nServices to provide grants to groups of providers working on this \neducation campaign.\n  Not long ago I visited an organization in my State that provides \nbilingual pamphlets to clinics and providers in eastern Washington on \nthe availability of ECs and how the drug combinations work to prevent \npregnancy. I also know that Planned Parenthood of Washington is working \nto provide education on ECs as part of their overall family planning \ncounseling.\n  State public health agencies could also apply for a funding grant to \nfurther their efforts to educate women on this safe and effective means \nof preventing pregnancy.\n  My amendment also makes emergency contraceptives available to victims \nof rape in the emergency room. When a woman has been raped and is \nbrought to the emergency room, she may not even be aware that there is \na safe and legal way to prevent her from becoming pregnant. We know \nthat counseling in many emergency rooms on the availability of safe and \neffective contraceptives is simply being ignored. Providing emergency \ncontraceptives or even information about them is still, amazingly, not \nstandard protocol for treating a rape victim. Educating women will \nensure that women are more aware. The unfortunate truth is that rape \nvictims are not getting the care they need. Our amendment would allow \ndoctors in the emergency room to just simply tell a rape victim about \nthis safe and legal alternative to abortion.\n  Let me turn to the second part of my amendment, which requires \ninsurance companies to treat contraceptives fairly. Today, amazingly, \nmany insurance companies will cover drugs such as Viagra, but they will \nnot cover contraceptives. We should eliminate this discrimination in \ninsurance and improve women's health.\n  Today, 20 States, including Washington State, do have some form of \ncontraceptive equity requirement. Recently, a court decision in my home \nState of Washington affirmed access to contraceptives as a civil rights \nprotection. Most Americans would agree that when you talk about \npreventing unintentional pregnancies and protecting women's health, you \nmust have contraceptive equity.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  The average annual cost of oral contraceptives can range from $400 to \n$700 a year. Women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than men \non out-of-pocket health care services. While there are several factors \nthat cause this disparity, the lack of contraceptive equity plays a \nvery big role. A recent survey of health plans showed that 49 percent \nof large group plans do not routinely cover a contraceptive method. \nMany States, including my own State of Washington, have taken steps to \ncorrect this obvious inequity. But without Federal legislation, the \nchange will be slow, and it will lack a comprehensive commitment to \nprotecting women's health.\n\n  This debate is not about costly new mandates or even about moral \njudgments; rather, it is about eliminating economic discrimination and \nprotecting women's health.\n  Under my amendment, if health insurance plans offer prescription \ndrugs, they would have to cover contraceptives and treat them equally. \nIf we are going to jeopardize women's health by banning certain safe \nand legal procedures, then we must ensure access to contraceptives and \neffective family planning services.\n  Finally, my amendment would increase health coverage for low-income \nwomen through all stages of pregnancy. Not long ago, the administration \nsaid States should use SCHIP dollars for the care of the unborn fetus, \nbut it did not extend that to the pregnant woman. That is ridiculous. \nThe clinical guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics both indicate that \nthe woman and the fetus should be treated together. It just makes \nsense.\n  So my amendment would ensure States can provide medical coverage for \npregnant women from the SCHIP fund. That will help reduce infant \nmortality and ensure that both the woman and the child get the medical \ncare they need.\n  This part of my amendment comes from a bipartisan bill, the Mothers \nand Newborns Health Insurance Act, that was introduced by Senators \nBingaman, Lincoln, and Corzine, who have been huge champions of this \nissue.\n  Before I end this morning, I just want to share a story with my \ncolleagues of a 34-year-old woman named Audrey Eisen. She and her \nhusband Tom desperately wanted to have children. After trying for 2 \nyears, they became pregnant. And after experiencing the sadness of a \nmiscarriage in July of last year, Audrey and Tom were elated to learn \nthey were pregnant. The checkups during the first few months indicated \nthat the embryo was developing normally. At 13 weeks, they planned to \nhave a special ultrasound. Unfortunately, they discovered the fetus was \ndeveloping an abnormal number of fingers and toes and that the \ncondition could indicate a much more serious complication, trysomy 13.\n  Trysomy 13 is a chromosomal condition in which there are three, \nrather than two, of the 13th chromosome. This syndrome is characterized \nby multiple abnormalities, many of which are not compatible with life \nbeyond a couple of months. Most fetuses with trysomy 13 die in utero. \nOf those who make it to birth, almost half do not survive past the \nfirst month, and roughly three-quarters die within 6 months, and long-\nterm survival is 1 year.\n  Unfortunately, neither life nor death comes easily for these \nchildren. It is a painful existence, marked by periods of breathing \ncessation and seizures. When Audrey returned for another ultrasound to \nget a better image of the fetal brain, her worst fears were confirmed. \nHere is what Audrey wrote:\n\n       The first thing my OB examined during the ultrasound was \n     the fetal brain. He did not say anything. I could tell he was \n     holding something back and asked that he tell me what he saw. \n     He said: ``It is not normal.'' The rest of the scan was a \n     blur as tears ran down my cheeks and those of my mother and \n     husband who had accompanied me. Following the scan, the \n     doctor left us alone to compose ourselves, after which we met \n     with the genetic counselor. I cried with my whole body from \n     the depths of my soul.\n\n  Audrey underwent additional testing in which she found that their \nfetus had a complete duplication of the 13th chromosome. It also \nexhibited a failure of the forebrain to properly develop and separate \nfrom the rest of the brain, a ventricular septal defect in the heart \nand a herniation of a portion of the abdominal organs into the \numbilical cord.\n  Audrey's letter continues:\n\n       At this point we discussed our options with the genetic \n     counselor. My husband and I both felt strongly that it was in \n     both the child's and our best interest to terminate as \n     quickly as possible. The genetic counselor told us that we \n     could either have a D or be induced. My doctor prescribed \n     both procedures and we decided that a D was clearly best \n     for me. The procedure was performed four days later on the \n     first day of my 16th week of pregnancy. I don't think that I \n     really understood this issue emotionally or intellectually \n     until I was in the position of having to terminate my much \n     desired pregnancy. Along with my sadness came a realization \n     that if such legislation passed, the right to safe second \n     trimester termination of pregnancies might not remain \n     available to those women who come after me. In this event, I \n     don't know how these women will endure. I don't know how I \n     could have endured.\n\n  Audrey Eisen had to make a terrible decision that no mother ever \nwants to make. But this Senate wants to inject itself between Audrey \nEisen and her doctor.\n  As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, I find it outrageous that \nas our Nation stands on the brink of war and our citizens struggle with \na stagnant economy, the Republican Senate can find no more important \ntopic to debate than criminalizing women's health decisions. When a \nwoman is lying in pain in the operating room and doctors are telling \nher that her dream of a healthy baby has been replaced by a nightmare \nof medical complications and that under these harrowing circumstances \nshe must immediately make a life altering decision that could determine \nwhether she lives or dies or whether she can have children ever again, \nthat woman should be able to make that decision with her family, her \ndoctor, and her faith. The Senate should not make that decision for \nher.\n  This bill is an unconstitutional, extreme measure being sold through \nmisleading arguments. If the proponents truly are interested in \nreducing unwanted pregnancies and reducing the number of abortions, \nthey should support the Murray-Reid amendment which would also improve \nhealth care for low-income women. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nunderlying bill. The Senate should not substitute its judgment for the \njudgment of a woman in one of the most intensely personal decisions she \nis ever likely to make. But if the Senate is going to ram through this \nunconstitutional, extreme measure, the least we can do is temper it \nwith safe, responsible access to emergency contraceptives, fair \ntreatment of contraceptives by insurers, and health care for low-income \npregnant women.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Reid, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 258.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for this \namendment. I appreciate very much the leadership she has shown in \nproviding a real opportunity to prevent late-term abortions to begin \nwith. That is exactly what this amendment does. I appreciate very much \nher willingness to step forward.\n  I want to quickly state three things prior to the time that we have \nthe opportunity to hear from Senator Murray more extensively about the \nimportance of this amendment.\n  No. 1, I can recall so vividly on so many occasions over the last \ncouple of years when Republicans cried crocodile tears about \nlegislation that came to the floor without having first gone through \ncommittee. Crocodile tears. They did everything but throw things on the \nSenate floor, they were so upset, every single time somebody would \nsuggest that amendments or bills be offered that had not been \nconsidered in committee. Yet right out of the box, one of the very \nfirst pieces of legislation presented to our colleagues today\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nis legislation that didn't go through committee. That was rule under \nrule 14 on the floor. The double standard and the hypocrisy is amazing \nto me.\n  The second issue I think ought to be stated is that we may be going \nto war within the next 10 days. I hope not. I have said publicly and \nprivately I hope we never consider war inevitable. But I must say, as \nwe consider what is now occurring in North Korea, as we consider the \nextraordinary repercussions of what may occur in Iraq, as we consider \nthe constant deliberations in the United Nations with regard to our \nactions, you would think the Senate would express itself, if not \nthrough resolutions, at least with our dialog, with our consideration \nof these issues, with our opportunities to express ourselves, and with \nmore opportunity to avoid concern for all of these issues and others \ngoing into such a dramatic historic and consequential moment in our \nNation's history. And yet we find ourselves debating this issue. I \nthink it is an ironic juxtaposition. And I am disappointed we would be \nspending our time on it this week, given all of the other issues we \nhave to address.\n\n  The third thing I would simply say is that, as with so many issues on \nthe Senate floor, this issue is packed with emotion on both sides. We \nare the Nation's leaders. We set the tone. We are the ones who create a \nsense of perspective with regard to these debates. The more shrill we \nare, the more shrill we can expect the American people to be. The more \nconfrontational and personal we are, the more confrontational and \npersonal we can expect the American people to be.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as we go through this emotional debate, to \ndemonstrate civility, to demonstrate a recognition that it is very easy \nto generate emotional fervor on this issue. It is out there already. I \nhope, in the tradition of the Senate, a debate as important as this \nwould recognize our responsibility to deal with these issues \nsensitively, to deal with them in a way that recognizes the importance \nof civility, to recognize, as well, that tone can be an important \nfactor in effecting substance.\n  So I only urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize, \nto accept our responsibility to debate this issue with civility, with \nrespect, with sensitivity, and with a recognition that our voices are \nheard way beyond these Chambers.\n  I thank again the Senator from Washington and again applaud her for \nher efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his \ncomments and his timely reminders, and I appreciate his comments at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the time \nfrom 11 to 12:30, the time for the Democrats be divided with Daschle, \n10 minutes; Leahy, 10 minutes; Kennedy, 10 minutes; Durbin, 5 minutes; \nSchumer, 5 minutes; and Reid, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a great Nation such as ours, we are \nfortunate to have democratic values and institutions so American \ncitizens can openly and freely voice their opinions and attempt to \ninfluence government policies. The abortion debate has been a divisive \none for our Nation for many years. People on both sides of this issue \nfeel strongly and have argued, demonstrated, and protested with emotion \nand passion.\n  We all recognize that the issue is not going to go away anytime soon. \nOne side will not be able to suddenly convince the other to drop its \ndeeply held beliefs. But there is a need and, I believe, an opportunity \nfor us to find common ground and take steps toward a goal all of us \nshare; that is, reducing the number of unintended pregnancies in \nAmerica.\n  I believe it is both possible and necessary for us to come together \nand enact effective legislation that will prevent unintended \npregnancies, reduce the number of abortions performed, and address \nunmet health needs of American women.\n  We cannot only find common ground, but also commonsense solutions in \nthe women's health amendment that Senator Murray and I have offered \nthis morning. Our amendment will help to reduce the staggering rates of \nunintended pregnancies and reduce abortions. Our women's health \namendment will also improve access to prenatal and postpartum care for \npregnant women.\n  Specifically, our amendment will: No. 1, end insurance discrimination \nagainst women. Let me say that this amendment was offered many years \nago by Senator Snowe and me. I express my appreciation for her tireless \nefforts, for working with us in ending insurance discrimination against \nwomen. The Senator from Maine has been a stalwart in this regard.\n  No. 2, our amendment will improve awareness and understanding of \nemergency contraception and ensure that rape victims have information \nabout and access to emergency contraception.\n  Lastly, it will promote healthy pregnancies in babies by allowing \nStates to expand coverage for prenatal and postpartum care.\n  This is really unbelievable, but it is true: About half of all \npregnancies in our country are unintended and about half of those will \nend in abortions. We must work together on this public health problem. \nIt does not have to be this way. Most of these unintended pregnancies \nand resulting abortions can be prevented.\n  One of the most important steps we should take to prevent unintended \npregnancies is to make sure that American women have access to \naffordable, effective contraception. I have been in a number of debates \non this issue about contraceptive use. I can remember on a national \nradio program a woman called in from Texas. She said: I am now pregnant \nwith my fourth child. I have diabetes. She went on to outline the many \nproblems she would have having this baby. But she did say that the \nreason she is pregnant is because she and her husband could not afford \nprescription contraception. They tried other things that didn't work, \nand, as a result, she was going through this pregnancy.\n  What our amendment is all about is allowing women to have the choice \nto have contraceptives that work. Insurance companies, as the Senator \nfrom Washington so well outlined, provide money for all kinds of \nthings. Why not contraceptives? It would be cheaper and certainly save \na lot of money and aggravation in the long run.\n  As a result of medical innovation and pharmaceutical research, there \nare numerous forms of safe and highly effective contraception that are \navailable by prescription. If used correctly, they would greatly reduce \nthe rate of unintended pregnancies. However, one of the greatest \nobstacles to the usage of prescription contraception by American women \nis their cost.\n  The woman who called in to the national radio show is only one \nexample. There are all kinds of examples of people who have insurance \nand do not have access to, for example, the pill--which is so effective \nin preventing women from becoming pregnant.\n  We know that women, on average, earn less than men. Yet they must pay \nfar more than men for health-related expenses. According to the Women's \nResearch and Education Institute, women of reproductive age pay 68 \npercent more in out-of-pocket medical expenses than men. Why? A lot of \nreasons, but one is due to their reproductive health care needs. \nBecause many women cannot afford to pay for the prescription \ncontraceptives they would like to use, many go without it, resulting in \nunintended pregnancies. Far too often that is the case.\n  This week is Cover the Uninsured Week--a major effort by a coalition \nof groups from all over the country to raise awareness to one of the \nfundamental problems of our society. About 44 million Americans lack \nhealth insurance. In addition to the 44 million, many other Americans \nare underinsured. The number who have no health insurance includes \nwomen and children. Most of the families affected are working families.\n  This is a tragedy that demands our attention. We have tried to get \ntheir attention, but we have not done very well. The high cost of \nprescription contraceptives is not only a problem for the millions of \nwomen without health insurance, it is also for millions of women who \nhave health insurance because even having a plan that includes a \nprescription drug benefit does not\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\nguarantee that the prescription drugs you rely on are included.\n  Such is the case for a majority of women in this country who are \ncovered by health insurance plans that do not provide coverage for \nprescription contraceptives. As a result, women are forced to either do \nwithout contraceptives or to bear this expense out of pocket. This is \nunfair to women and unfair to families. It is bad policy that causes \nadditional unintended pregnancies, adversely affecting women's health.\n  As I indicated earlier, I have been trying since 1997 to remedy this, \nand we have accomplished a few things. We have been able to get women \nwho work in the Federal sector to have their insurance cover this, but \nwe have been unable to get it for the rest of the country. That is too \nbad.\n  Today, as part of our women's health amendment, we are again \nproposing commonsense legislation that has received bipartisan support \nin the past. The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \nCoverage Act, or EPICC, as we call it, requires insurance plans that \nprovide coverage for prescription drugs to provide the same coverage \nfor prescription contraceptives.\n  The woman in Texas--I cannot adequately convey to you the desperation \nin this woman's voice when she called in saying: I am a sick woman. All \nI needed was the ability to have a prescription where I would get a \ncontraceptive that would work, but I didn't, and I am pregnant. It is \ngoing to affect my health adversely, and I don't know what will happen \nto the baby. I cannot convey in words the desperation, the concern in \nthis woman's voice.\n  We are not asking for special treatment of contraceptives--only \nequitable, fair treatment within the context of an existing \nprescription drug benefit. This legislation will help increase the \nplaying field a little bit for women. They spend more for their health \ncare costs. This will help a little bit. Making contraception more \naffordable and available will enable more women to use safe and \neffective means to prevent unintended pregnancy. I hope that is a goal \nwe all share. I believe it is.\n  Contraceptive coverage is much cheaper than other services. As the \nSenator from Washington pointed out, it is certainly cheaper than \nperforming an abortion; it is cheaper than sterilizations and tubal \nligations, and most insurance companies routinely cover these.\n\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs, which has provided \ncontraceptive coverage for several years as a result of an amendment we \noffered on the floor, shows that adding such coverage doesn't make the \nplan more expensive. In fact, it saves money. Unintended pregnancies \ncost society money, cost families money.\n  As I indicated, this was first introduced by Senator Snowe and me 6 \nyears ago. We have been working across party lines and across the \nideological spectrum to gain support in the Senate. It had 44 \ncosponsors last year in the Senate.\n  This is commonsense, cost-effective legislation that is long overdue. \nPromoting equity in health insurance coverage for American women, while \nworking to prevent unintended pregnancies and improve women's health \ncare, is the right thing to do. We should also take additional steps \nthat would improve women's health and further reduce unintended \npregnancies.\n  Our amendment would increase the awareness and availability of \nemergency contraception, an important yet poorly understood form of \ncontraception.\n  I have never said this publicly, and I will not use her name, but she \nknows who she is. A very good friend of mine who worked for me for many \nyears--she started off in high school as a runner in my office. She \ncame to me one day, and I knew something was wrong. I said: What is the \nmatter?\n  She looked at me with tears in her eyes and said: I was jumped last \nnight.\n  I never heard that term before, but she was driving through a rough \nneighborhood and they stopped her car and she was raped--a teenager, \nMr. President. I didn't know what to do or say. I called my wife's \ngynecologist/obstetrician, who is a friend of mine, and I said: Doctor, \nhere is the situation . . . will you see her?\n  He said: Of course, I will see her.\n  So she went to him. She didn't become pregnant, but that is \nfortunate. Now, I wished, then, we had the ability to have emergency \ncontraception. It would have relieved everybody's mind and made \neverybody feel better. I will never forget that. That was a traumatic \nnight in her life, to say the least.\n  We have made progress since then--scientific progress--to make \nproblems like that one something that can be dealt with. She would not \nhave had to come to someone like me, her employer, and be humiliated by \ntelling some one older than her about the problem. But she was one of \nthe fortunate ones. She had somebody she could come to, and I had the \nopportunity to send her to my wife's gynecologist.\n  So, in effect, our amendment would increase the awareness and \navailability of emergency contraception, an important, yet poorly \nunderstood form of contraception. Approved for use by the FDA, \nemergency contraception pills work to prevent pregnancy, and they \ncannot interrupt or disrupt an established pregnancy. That is a \nscientific fact.\n  A woman could use emergency contraception in an emergency, such as if \nshe had been raped and doesn't want to become pregnant.\n  The availability of an emergency contraception is particularly \nimportant for women who survive sexual assault, like my friend.\n  It is difficult to imagine the physical, psychological, and emotional \npain that a woman who is raped endures. In addition to the violent \nattack to which these women have been subjected, they must also \nconsider the possibility that in addition to the trauma of the rape, \nthey could become pregnant as a result.\n  Compassion is a word we have heard a lot from political leaders in \nrecent times. Actions speak louder than words. Surely, I acknowledge--\nand I think we should all acknowledge--it would be compassionate to \nmake emergency contraception available to women to prevent them from \nbecoming pregnant by the rapist who brutalized and traumatized them.\n  It would be compassionate to make emergency contraception available \nto a woman to prevent her from becoming pregnant by the rapist who \nbrutalized and traumatized her.\n  I hope we can all agree on this legislation which would require \nhospitals receiving Federal health dollars to provide information about \nemergency contraception and make it available to sexual assault \nsurvivors when they are being treated in the emergency room.\n  Simply put, emergency contraception should be made available in every \nemergency room in America. Women who have been raped should be informed \nof all their options, including learning about emergency contraception. \nIf they choose emergency contraception, it should be made available to \nthem. It should be a choice.\n  Women who have been raped should be informed of all their options, \nincluding learning about emergency contraception, and if they so \nchoose, it should be made available to them.\n  EC, emergency contraception, has been studied extensively and has \nbeen regarded as a safe and effective method to prevent unintended \npregnancies.\n  Once I was on a radio show talking about my contraceptive coverage \nlegislation. Someone called in and said: I think it is awful, and I am \nopposed to contraception of any kind. Mr. President, that is a person's \nright. Some people do not believe in contraception, and that is their \nright. Nothing in our legislation forces a woman to take any form of \ncontraception. That should be a choice of a woman who has a health plan \nor a woman who has been raped. That is all we are saying.\n  EC has been studied extensively and regarded as a safe and effective \nmethod to prevent unintended pregnancies, I say again. Its use has been \nrecommended by leading American authorities, including the American \nMedical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, and it has been approved by the Federal Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  It is believed this would prevent hundreds of thousands of \npregnancies and likely hundreds of thousands of abortions in America \neach year. Unfortunately, however, emergency contraception remains, for \nthe most part, a well-kept secret. Most of the women who would benefit \nfrom it and would use it\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\nin an emergency to prevent an unintended pregnancy are unaware of its \nexistence or do not know where to get it, where it is available. Even \nmany health care providers do not understand what it is, how it works, \nand who could use it.\n  To reduce unintended pregnancy by raising awareness of emergency \ncontraception, Senator Murray and I are proposing in this amendment to \nauthorize $10 million in funding for the Centers for Disease Control \nand the Health Resources and Services Administration to develop and \ndistribute information about emergency contraception to public health \norganizations, health care providers, and the public. This would \nprevent hundreds of thousands of unintended pregnancies and, of course, \nabortions.\n  These are just some of the simple, but I think necessary, steps we \ncan and should take to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce \nabortions.\n  To further improve the health of women and children, we should give \nStates the option of covering pregnant women in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, called SCHIP, for the full range of their \nhealth needs, including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care.\n  A number of years ago, a couple of neonatologists came to visit me. \nThey were Nevadans. One was with a public hospital in southern Nevada. \nThey had a number of messages. They wanted to see if we could get money \nto build a neonatal unit there. We have done that at the University \nMedical Center in southern Nevada. It is wonderful to go there and see \nthose babies being saved because of modern technology.\n\n  Another message they wanted to deliver to me is that children are \nhaving children, and many of these children having children come to the \nemergency room--and they have never seen a doctor--to deliver the baby. \nThey have never seen a doctor. It happens all the time. They were \nsaying: We need to do something to allow these children to have a place \nthey can go to get the care. Why don't they get care? There are a lot \nof reasons, but mainly it is a money situation.\n  I think this amendment is wonderful, and I like this part of our \namendment very much, but I personally believe every woman in America, \nwhether it is the wife of a billionaire or a woman who is on welfare \nand has nothing, and is 12 years old or 14 years old, should all be \nable to have free prenatal care. Every woman in America should be able \nto have free prenatal care. It would save this country so much money.\n  These doctors told me when they came to visit me that there are many \nmillion-dollar babies who, because of lack of prenatal care, are born \nwith all kinds of problems. Had they had some prenatal care--some of \nthese girls do not realize they should not smoke or take dope. They do \nnot know. These are kids. If they had a place to go for prenatal care--\nthere are grown women who need advice and counseling as to what should \nand should not be done during pregnancy.\n  I really believe all women should have free prenatal care. There \nshould not be means testing. I think every woman should have free \nprenatal care in our country. We would save so much money as a society \nby doing that. That is another battle down the road some other day.\n  This amendment would give States the option of covering women in the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program for the full range of their \nhealth needs, including prenatal delivery and postpartum care. The \nmortality rates for infants and for mothers remain alarmingly high in \nthe United States. We can, we should, and we must reduce these rates by \nextending coverage for prenatal care and pregnancy-related services. \nUnfortunately, the administration imposed a regulation last year that \nallows the fetus to be insured through SCHIP but excludes--excludes--\nthe mother from coverage. Let me say that again. Through an \nadministrative fiat, regulation, order, mandate, this administration \nimposed a regulation last year that allows a fetus to be insured \nthrough SCHIP, but excludes the mother of that fetus from coverage. Try \nto logically figure that one out. This is illogical, I think it is \nshameful, and I think it is absurd.\n  It, in effect, punishes women and certainly does not improve their \nhealth care. In any case, how can one claim to care about the health of \nan unborn child and not provide for the health and needs of his or her \nmother? The administration's policy means pregnant women are not \ncovered during their pregnancy for medical emergencies, accidents, \nbroken bones, mental illness, cancer, or even lifesaving surgery. Only \nprocedures considered medically necessary for the fetus are covered. No \npostpartum care, of course, is included.\n  Remarkably, Health and Human Services Secretary Thompson tried to \ndefend this policy by suggesting--listen to this--that the regulation \nwhich explicitly denies postpartum care is more comprehensive than \nlegislation which provides full coverage including postpartum care. \nThat is what he said. Do not try to figure out what it means because I \ncannot. This strains the credulity of anyone reading this and studying \nthis situation. It flies in the face of common sense. We cannot have \nhealthy babies if we ignore the health of the expectant mother. So \nStates should be able to provide pregnant women with a full range of \nhealth services through SCHIP.\n  We should embrace these measures to protect the health of women and \nbabies, prevent unintended pregnancies, and reduce abortions.\n  I am very happy to work with the distinguished Senator from the State \nof Washington, who is always on the cutting edge of things that relate \nto being compassionate and caring about people. It is an honor to join \nwith her in helping us find common ground, commonsense solutions and \nshow some compassion.\n  Let us find common ground. Let us agree on commonsense solutions and \nlet us show compassion. There are four elements of this amendment. I \nhope we will move on and pass this unanimously. I do not know how \nanyone could oppose these commonsense amendments, but time will only \ntell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have roughly 10 minutes before we \nproceed to a debate on the constitutional role of the Senate in the \nadvise and consent process. I do not have a sufficient amount of time \nto respond to all of the comments made by my colleagues from Washington \nand Nevada. We are looking at the amendment. We may have some \namendments to it. My understanding is there are two jurisdictional \npieces to this amendment. One is in the Finance Committee. The other is \nin the HELP Committee. We are still getting feedback from those \ncommittees.\n  My understanding is that some of these provisions have been offered \nat the committee level previously and the chairmen of those respective \ncommittees are letting us know what they would like to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator tell me if the underlying legislation, \nS. 3, went through the committee before it came to the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As the Senator from Illinois knows, this is the fourth \nCongress in which this legislation has been considered. It has gone \nthrough committee in previous Congresses. As I mentioned before, there \nare some changes to this legislation, but the basic underlying \nprocedure that we attempt to ban is one that is very familiar to the \nSenator from Illinois and very familiar to other Members. It is \nobviously familiar to members of the committee. While this is a bill \nthat, again, I would argue has some differences in it that are \nimportant from a constitutional perspective, this is an issue very \nfamiliar to every Member of the Senate and there was not really a sense \nthat this was one that needed to go through the process again.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for two brief questions, and I \nwill not dwell on this any longer.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator please tell us when was the last time \nthis bill went through the committee process, for example, the \nJudiciary Committee? Secondly, has this bill, which is virtually \nidentical to the Nebraska statute rejected by the Supreme Court, gone \nthrough committee hearings since the Supreme Court rejected this very \nsame language in the Nebraska statute?\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will get the answer to the first question. I do not \nhave the answer, but I will get that, No. 1. No. 2, this is different \nthan the Nebraska statute. In fact, it was drafted in response to the \nSupreme Court's ruling in the Carhart v. Stenberg case.\n  To the other question, have there been hearings conducted about it, \nthe answer is, no, there have not been hearings in the Senate. I do not \nknow whether the House has conducted hearings on this language or not, \nbut I can certainly find that out.\n  We are making the case and we will continue to make the case, and I \nassume those who oppose this legislation will make their case, as to \nthe constitutionality of this legislation in its amended form that was \nstruck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. I will go through those \narguments repeatedly. I do not have time now because we only have about \n5 minutes and I do have some other things I want to say.\n  Clearly, we believe we have addressed the issue of health. The \nSupreme Court, in the Carhart v. Stenberg case, took the record of the \nlower court. The lower court found that the health exception was needed \nbased on the record, and the U.S. Supreme Court took the findings of \nfact from the district court and applied the standard that they would \napply to this case, that the district court was clearly erroneous in \ncoming to that decision. They did not find that standard to be met and \nso they accepted the underlying premise.\n  Congress has, on repeated occasions, made findings of fact in \npreparation for review by the courts, and in a vast number of these \ncases, the courts have been very deferential to Congress, as a body, \nthat gets into much more detail through the process of hearings. We \nhave had numerous hearings about this procedure in both the Senate and \nthe House.\n  So while the Senator from Illinois has asked if we have had any \nrecent hearings, we have had plenty of hearings on this issue and \nplenty of hearings about the medical necessity of this procedure. I ask \nthe Senator from Illinois or any Senator who opposes this legislation, \nplease come to the floor and present one case where this procedure is \nmedically necessary. I do not think we need any more hearings. All I \nneed is one case where this procedure would be medically necessary. In \n7 years, no one has come to the floor of the Senate, no one has come to \na hearing, no one has come before a hearing, no one has come anywhere, \npublicly, privately or otherwise, and presented a case where this is \nmedically necessary for the health of the mother. So if there are no \ncases where it is medically necessary for the health of the mother, it \nis by definition outside of the rubric of Roe v. Wade. Now, that is a \nfinding of Congress. That is a finding of Congress that is continuing \nto be substantiated by the inaction of those who oppose this to come up \nwith a case.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say, through the Chair, to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the manager of this bill, the majority leader asked \nSenator Daschle and I to try to do something to move this legislation \nalong. In good faith, we have narrowed the number of amendments to \nseven or eight that we have offered. The reason Senator Murray and I \ndid this amendment is we thought we would get all the prevention issues \nout of the way quickly.\n  The point I am trying to make to my friend is that we are going to \noffer these together or separately. We are going to have votes on these \namendments one way or the other. That is why we have asked that there \nbe no second-degree amendments. Everyone should understand that we will \ncome back and reoffer these.\n  In good faith, we are trying to move this legislation along. There is \nno effort to stall or to delay in any way. In good faith, we are trying \nto work this out with the other side. I only say this because the \nSenator said the committees wanted to look this over. Senator Murray \nand I are going to get a vote on these four issues. We would like to do \nit all at once. That would be the best way to do this. I want to make \nsure the leader hears from us what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I certainly respect the desire of the Senator from \nNevada to get votes on these amendments, and we may well be able to \naccommodate that in a clean fashion directly, but I do not know the \nanswer to that. I am still waiting to hear from the chairmen who have \njust seen this amendment a few minutes ago, to get a sense as to \nwhether they believe there are some things that can be done to improve \nupon this recommended language.\n  The second point, in response to the Senator from Illinois, is the \nissue of vagueness. That was the other issue with which the Supreme \nCourt dealt. We have come up with a much clearer definition.\n  The Senator from Washington said this is a deceptive amendment, that \nthis language is very broad language and it does not limit it to a \npartial-birth abortion. I ask the Senator from Washington, or the \nSenator from California who was on the floor last night with the same \nargument, if they could describe a procedure that would be banned by \nthe language in this bill. Give me another procedure and give me the \ndefinition of that procedure and tell me how that procedure would be \nbanned by this bill.\n  The Senator from Washington brought in a case which certainly is a \nvery distressing case, one that I can relate to on a personal basis, of \na child who was discovered in utero with a fetal abnormality. The \nabortion performed on that child was done at 16 weeks. It was not a \npartial-birth abortion and under this legislation would continue to be \nlegal. So we did not restrict at all the procedures that are done in \nany hospital in this country, because hospitals do not do this \nprocedure. Abortion clinics do this procedure.\n  As I have said many times, they do it for one reason: the convenience \nof the abortionist to do more abortions in a shorter period of time. \nThe doctor who developed this procedure developed it, in his words, so \nhe could do more late-term abortions. He said this procedure takes 15 \nminutes. The other one takes 45. So he could do more abortions in 1 \nday. That does not strike me as one that was developed for medical \nnecessity or to protect the health of women, but to protect the \npocketbook of an abortionist, and that is not the kind of medicine that \nwe should confirm or affirm in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3429-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3429-S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thank you for presiding this morning. I \nappreciate your participation as our Presiding Officer in what we all \nrecognize is an important moment for the Senate, the Senate that we all \nserve.\n  I have asked for this session over approximately the next hour and a \nhalf because one of our most important roles as Senators is to vote on \nexecutive nominations, including judges, lifetime appointees, who serve \nsuch a vital role in our constitutional design.\n  Because of the current debate, I have looked to our Founders for some \nguidance. John Adams, who helped create our Federal judiciary with his \nindependence and its lifetime appointments, gave us a guide. He wrote \nthat judges should be:\n\n       Men of experience on the laws, of exemplary morals, \n     invincible patience, unruffled calmness, indefatigable \n     application. . . (and) subservient to none.\n\n  This is a high standard for a nominee and one I believe that Miguel \nEstrada has met. But it is also a charge for our Senate as the steward \nof an independent judiciary. Has the Senate met\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nthe Adams test or has this unprecedented filibuster and delay brought \nus all to the point of failing to meet that charge of John Adams?\n  Elected by my constituents, I am a Senator. Selected by my \ncolleagues, I serve as Republican leader. Recognized by the Chair, I \nact as majority leader. With these responsibilities, I am entrusted as \na guardian of the Senate. Its institutions, its traditions, its \nobligations are my unique charge, not only as leader but as a Member.\n  I am sensitive to this serious responsibility and I look forward to \nthe discussion over the next hour and a half as we elevate the debate \nto what was intended under advise and consent as spelled out in the \nConstitution. As we move forward in the conversation over the course of \nthe morning, with not just this nomination at issue but, really, our \noverall function as an institution under scrutiny, I will listen to all \nto hear their concerns and ideas about how best to move forward in a \nway that does justice to this nominee, but also to our institution and \nour Constitution.\n  To that end, our president, George Bush, has sent a letter to Senator \nDaschle and myself on this topic. Among his observations, he wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       I ask Senators of both parties to come together to end the \n     escalating cycle of blame and bitterness and to restore \n     fairness, predictability, and dignity to the process. I ask \n     that the Senate take action, including adoption of a \n     permanent rule, to ensure timely up or down votes on judicial \n     nominations both now and in the future, no matter who is \n     President or which party controls the Senate. This is the \n     only way to ensure that our judiciary works and that good \n     people remain willing to be nominated to the Federal bench.\n       All senators should have a chance to have their voices \n     heard and their votes counted. All Presidents should have \n     their judicial nominees considered and voted upon in a \n     reasonable time. All nominees considered and voted upon in a \n     reasonable time. All nominees should have the certainty of an \n     up-or-down Senate vote within a reasonable time. All judges \n     should have the assurance that vacancies on their courts will \n     not persist for years. And all Americans should have the \n     assurance that the federal courts will remain open and fully \n     staffed to resolve their disputes and protect their rights \n     and liberties.\n\n  As leader, I tend to listen closely and patiently to the deeply held \nopinions expressed on the floor in hopes we can rise above the moment \nand act as our Founders intended. I ask unanimous consent the letter \ndated March 11 to myself and Senator Daschle from the President of the \nUnited States be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The Senate is debating the nomination \n     of Miguel A. Estrada to be a Judge of the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Miguel Estrada's \n     life is an example of the American Dream. He came to this \n     country from Honduras as a teenager barely speaking English \n     and went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School. \n     He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the United \n     States and served in the United States Department of Justice \n     under Presidents of both political parties. The American Bar \n     Association has given him its highest rating. When appointed, \n     he will be the first Hispanic ever to serve on the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n       I submitted Mr. Estrada's nomination to the Senate on May \n     9, 2001. But his nomination has been stalled for partisan \n     reasons for nearly 2 years in which the Senate has not held a \n     vote either to confirm or to reject the nomination.\n       The Senate has a solemn responsibility to exercise its \n     constitutional advice and consent function and hold up or \n     down votes on judicial nominees within a reasonable time \n     after nomination. Senators who are filibustering a vote on \n     Miguel Estrada are flouting the intention of the United \n     States Constitution and the tradition of the United States \n     Senate. The filibuster is the culmination of an escalating \n     series of back-and-forth tactics that have marred the \n     judicial confirmation process for years, as many judicial \n     nominees have never received up or down Senate votes. And \n     now, a minority of Senators are threatening for the first \n     time to use ideological filibusters as a standard tool to \n     indefinitely block confirmation of well-qualified nominees \n     with strong bipartisan support. This has to end.\n       The judicial confirmation process is broken, and the \n     consequences for the American people are real. Because of the \n     Senate's failure to hold timely votes, the number of judicial \n     vacancies has been unacceptably high during my Presidency and \n     those of President Bill Clinton and President George H.W. \n     Bush. The Chief Justice has warned that the high number of \n     judicial vacancies, when combined with the ever-increasing \n     caseloads, leads to crowded courts and threatens the \n     administration of justice. When understaffed, the Federal \n     courts cannot act in a timely manner to resolve disputes \n     that affect the lives and liberties of all Americans. The \n     courts cannot decide constitutional cases promptly, which \n     harms people seeking to vindicate and protect their \n     rights, and the courts cannot rule on commercial cases \n     efficiently, which hurts the economy, businesses, and \n     workers. Our system of equal justice under law \n     administered fairly and efficiently is at risk. The \n     American Bar Association in 2002 accurately described the \n     situation as an ``emergency.''\n       My concern about the state of the judicial confirmation \n     process is not new. In June 2000, I proposed timely votes for \n     all nominees, stating that the confirmation process ``does \n     not empower anyone to turn the process into a protracted \n     ordeal of unreasonable delay and unrelenting investigation.'' \n     In May 2001, when I announced my first judicial nominations, \n     I urged the Senate to rise above the bitterness of the past \n     and again asked that every judicial nominee receive a timely \n     up or down vote. In October 2002, after nearly two additional \n     years in which too many nominees did not receive votes, I \n     proposed a specific, commonsense plan involving all three \n     Branches that, among other steps, would ensure that all \n     judicial nominees receive an up or down Senate vote within \n     180 days of nomination.\n       Over the years, many Senators of both political parties \n     have publicly agreed with the principle that every judicial \n     nominee should receive a timely up or down Senate vote. \n     Similarly, the Federal Judiciary, speaking through the Chief \n     Justice in his 2001 Year-End Report, has stated that the \n     Senate should ``schedule up or down votes on judicial \n     nominees within a reasonable time after receiving the \n     nomination.''\n       I ask Senators of both parties to come together to end the \n     escalating cycle of blame and bitterness and to restore \n     fairness, predictability, and dignity to the process. I ask \n     that the Senate take action, including adoption of a \n     permanent rule, to ensure timely up or down votes on judicial \n     nominations both now and in the future, no matter who is \n     President or which party controls the Senate. This is the \n     only way to ensure that our Judiciary works and that good \n     people remain willing to be nominated to the Federal bench.\n       All Senators should have a chance to have their voices \n     heard and their votes counted. All Presidents should have \n     their judicial nominees considered and voted upon in a \n     reasonable time. All nominees should have the certainty of an \n     up or down Senate vote within a reasonable time. All Judges \n     should have the assurance that vacancies on their courts will \n     not persist for years. And all Americans should have the \n     assurance that the Federal courts will remain open and fully \n     staffed to resolve their disputes and protect their rights \n     and liberties.\n       As I stated last October, the current state of affairs in \n     the United States Senate is not merely another round of \n     political wrangling. It is a disturbing failure to meet a \n     responsibility under the Constitution. Our country deserves \n     better, the process can work better, and we can make it \n     better. The Constitution has given us a shared duty, and we \n     must meet that duty together. Thank you for your attention to \n     this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will designate Senator Hatch to be in \ncontrol of the remaining time on the Republican side.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I regret to say that the White House and \nmany of our Republican colleagues have twisted this debate beyond all \nrecognition. It is sadly ironic that Republicans now seek to cast this \nas a debate about constitutionality, for it is Republicans who \nevidently are quite ready to throw over our Constitution's enduring \nprinciples merely because they do not fit the politics of the moment.\n  Democrats have been accused of subverting the Constitution for mere \npolitical gain. We have been accused of subjecting a nominee to \n``unprecedented obstructionism.'' We have been accused of employing \nthese tactics in the service of racism. Enough is enough. It is time to \ncall the rhetoric of some of our Republican colleagues for what it is: \nRank hypocrisy and cynical manipulation of fact.\n  While in the majority, Democrats facilitated the confirmation of 100 \nof the President's nominees to the Federal bench. After proving our \ncooperation, we now have the temerity to ask one nominee a series of \nsimple questions that go directly to the question of his qualifications \nand judicial temperament.\n  We asked the administration to provide the documents the nominee \ndrafted during his tenure at the Department\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nof Justice, documents that have been provided by both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations in the past. We ask these questions not to \nscore cheap political points but to fulfill our solemn obligations \nunder the Constitution.\n  The Senate, not just the Senate majority but the entire Senate, is \nrequired under the Constitution to provide advice and consent to the \nPresident on his nominations. All we have asked is that we be given the \ninformation necessary to provide that informed consent. Mr. Estrada, \nhowever, has chosen not to cooperate.\n  That is his right. But it is our constitutional duty to reserve our \njudgment until we know the whole picture.\n  Imagine a job applicant refusing to fill out the last four pages of a \nfive-page application.\n  You couldn't get a job flipping burgers with that response. Surely, \nthe American people would not reward such intransigence with a lifetime \nappointment to the second-most powerful court in the land.\n  Republicans disagree, and so it is the recalcitrance of the nominee \nand the administration, not Democratic opposition, that is responsible \nfor this delay today.\n  Today, Republicans, one after another, will come to this chamber to \nclaim that they are shocked that any nominee could be treated to this \nunprecedented obstructionism.\n  Let me be charitable and say that only willful amnesia allows our \ncolleagues to levy such charges.\n  In 1994, Senate Republicans stood before this chamber trying to \npersuade their colleagues to filibuster one of President Clinton's \nnominations to the Federal bench.\n  The current Chairman of the Judiciary Committee said then that the \nminority has to protect itself and those the minority represents.''\n  In 2000, the Senate was forced to vote on cloture because for 4 \nyears, Republicans filibustered judicial nominee, Richard Paez and, for \ntwo years, Marsha Berzon.\n  Fifteen Republican Senators, including Senator Frist, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Craig, Senator Brownback, Senator DeWine, and others voted to \ncontinue the filibuster of Richard Paez.\n  Thirty Senators voted to ``indefinitely postpone``--quoting from the \nresolution--Mr. Paez's nomination, which had then been pending for more \nthan 1,500 days. That's right, 1,500 days.\n  No Republicans objected then. No Republican expressed concern for the \nunprecedented obstructionism that could endanger the Constitution that \nwe are likely to hear about this morning.\n  No Republican dared to castigate his colleagues by calling the \nopposition to Mr. Paez ``anti-Hispanic.''\n  But the truth is, by comparison to the treatment of other nominees by \nthe Republican majority, Mr. Paez and Ms. Berzon could almost be \nconsidered fortunate; at least their nominations made it to the floor.\n  Under the Republican majority, more than 50 different Clinton \nadministration judicial nominees saw their nominations killed, not \nbecause of the shared objections of 41 Republican Senators, but because \na single Senator chose to place an anonymous hold on their nomination. \nThese nominations never received a hearing or a vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee, let alone consideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  By describing this sad history, I do not mean to indicate how the \nconfirmation process should work. It should not.\n  The President promised he would work with us on his judicial \nnominees. But instead he continues to nominate many extraordinarily \ncontroversial candidates.\n  We stand ready to cooperate in the nomination and confirmation of \nqualified judges who will enforce the law and protect the rights of all \nAmericans. We demonstrated that on many occasions already in this \nCongress.\n  But we fear that we will be kept waiting.\n  The suggestion that the Democratic request for information is \ninappropriate is equally ludicrous.\n  When Robert Bork was nominated to the Supreme Court, the Senate \nsought and received his memos as Solicitor General, including one to \nthe President on the application of Executive privilege to the case of \nthe Nixon audiotapes.\n  When Justice William Rehnquist was nominated to the Supreme Court, \nthe Senate sought and received all of the memos that he had written as \na clerk to Justice Robert Jackson.\n  When Stephen Trott was nominated to the Ninth Circuit, the Senate \nsought and received line attorney memos regarding the appointment of \nspecial prosecutors.\n  When Benjamin Civiletti was nominated to be Attorney General, the \nSenate sought and received his line attorney memos regarding anti-trust \nsettlement recommendations.\n  And when William Bradford Reynolds was nominated for Associate \nAttorney General, the Senate sought and received his memos to the \nSolicitor General regarding a discrimination case, a school prayer \ncase, and internal legal memos on a redistricting case.\n  Our request for information from Mr. Estrada is both appropriate and \nwell-grounded in precedent. Yet because that precedent stands in the \nway of their political ends, Republicans now seek to deny their own \nwords and their own actions.\n  They are here today claiming that the Constitution is threatened by \nthe very same procedures they themselves employed. They are here today \nclaiming that the Constitution can be threatened by the very same \npowers that it grants.\n  The Constitution is secure. The Democrats support it by refusing to \nlet one third of our Government become a rubber stamp.\n  Alexander Hamilton, foremost among the Framers in his support for a \nstrong presidency, wrote in the Federalist Papers that the Senate's \nrole in confirmations was an indispensable check on executive power.\n  In explaining the advise and consent clause, he wrote:\n\n       Might not [the President's nomination] be overruled? I \n     grant that it might. . . . [but] if by influencing the \n     President be meant restraining him, that is precisely what \n     must have been intended.\n\n  Mr. President, every Member of this body took an oath ``to uphold and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' That is exactly what \nDemocrats are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to the distinguished \nmajority leader, and I have been very interested in what he has had to \nsay. The fact is, in spite of what he has said, there has never been a \nfilibuster that has been successful against a circuit court of appeals \nnominee--never--in the history of the Senate.\n  During the time President Clinton was President of the United States, \nI was chairman of the committee for 6 years. I admit there were some on \nour side who wanted to filibuster some of his nominees. I worked very \nhard and diligently to make sure no filibuster could succeed. As a \nmatter of fact, I don't think there was a serious, true filibuster at \nany time against any of the Clinton nominees.\n  I suppose people can have their own viewpoint, but the fact is that \nwe helped to make sure no filibuster would succeed. We on this side \nmade sure--the leadership on this side, including myself as leader of \nthe Judiciary Committee--that no filibuster would succeed.\n  In fact, there is only one filibuster in the history of the country \nthat has succeeded, and that was against Justice Fortas, back in 1968. \nI do not agree with that. I think it was the wrong thing then. It is \nthe wrong thing now. It is really the big issue we are talking about \ntoday.\n  With regard to the request for additional information from Mr. \nEstrada and the unfortunate claim that he has not cooperated with the \nother side, look at the transcript--almost 300 pages long. It is one of \nthe longest hearings on a circuit court of appeals nominee in history. \nJust look at the transcript. He answered question after question after \nquestion.\n  Then every Democrat on the committee was given an opportunity to \nsubmit written questions. Only two did. The others didn't avail \nthemselves of that opportunity. They called that hearing a very fair \nhearing. It was conducted by them. It could have gone on longer. They \ncould have gone on another day if they had wanted to, or more than 1 \nday, more than 2 days. They didn't do it. The reason they\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\ndidn't is that they thought they would never call him up anyway. \nUnfortunately for them, they lost the election and today the \nRepublicans are in control and he has been called to the floor. Once \ncalled to the floor, he deserves an up-or-down vote under our laws.\n  They are saying that, in spite of an almost 9-hour committee hearing, \nin spite of having all of his briefs and his oral arguments before the \nSupreme Court in 15 cases, in spite of the fact that he has the \nunanimously well qualified highest recommendation of their gold \nstandard, the American Bar Association, in spite of the fact that they \nhave numerous other documents and records and have documented his \ncases, they are saying they do not know enough about Mr. Estrada so \nthey have to go into the highly privileged matters concerning \nrecommendations for appeals, certiorari, and amicus curiae matters, \nsome of the most privileged documents in the history of the country, in \nthe Solicitor General's Office, in spite of the fact that seven living \nformer Solicitors General have said that should never be allowed.\n  In each of the cases that the distinguished majority leader has cited \nwhere some documents have been given, these documents were given \npursuant to specific requests for documents.\n  In this case, we have the generalized request of a fishing expedition \ninto virtually every document he ever worked on at the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. No one has ever allowed a fishing expedition into \nthese privileged documents of the Justice Department, let alone the \nSolicitor General's Office.\n  I join my colleagues here to voice grave concern over what appears to \nme to be a system in serious danger of breaking. I am talking about the \nsystem by which the Senate exercises its constitutional obligation to \nprovide advice and consent on judicial nominees.\n  At the outset of my remarks, let me take a moment to set straight the \nproper role of the Senate in the confirmation of judicial nominees, \nstarting with the text of the Constitution. In its enumeration of \npresidential powers, the Constitution specifies that the confirmation \nof judges begins and ends with the President. The Senate has the \nintermediary role of providing advice and consent. Here is the precise \nlanguage of Article II, Section 2:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \n     of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for, and which shall be established by Law.\n\n  There is no question that the Constitution squarely places the \nappointment power in the hands of the President. As Alexander Hamilton \nexplained in The Federalist No. 66:\n\n       It will be the Office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have \n     made.\n\n  It is significant that the Constitution outlines the Senate's role in \nthe appointments process in the enumeration of presidential powers in \nArticle II, rather than in the enumeration of congressional powers in \nArticle I. This choice suggests that the Senate was intended to play a \nmore limited role in the confirmation of Federal judges.\n\n  Hamilton's discussion of the Appointments Clause in The Federalist \nNo. 76 supports this reading. Hamilton believed that the President, \nacting alone, would be the better choice for making nominations, as he \nwould be less vulnerable to personal considerations and political \nnegotiations than the Senate and more inclined, as the sole decision \nmaker, to select nominees who would reflect well on the presidency. The \nSenate's role, by comparison, would be to act as a powerful check on \n``unfit'' nominees by the President. As he put it,\n\n       [Senate confirmation] would be an excellent check upon a \n     spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly \n     to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  This is a far cry from efforts we've seen over the past couple of \nyears to inject ideology into the nominations process, and to force \nnominees to disclose their personal opinions on hot-button and divisive \npolicy issues like abortion, gun control, and affirmative action which \nundoubtedly will come before the courts.\n  Historically, deliberation by the Senate could be quite short, \nespecially when compared to today's practice. Take, for example, the \n1862 nomination and confirmation of Samuel F. Miller to the United \nStates Supreme Court. He was nominated, confirmed, and commissioned all \non the same day! The Senate formally deliberated on his nomination for \nonly 30 minutes before confirming him. His experience was not the \nexception. Confirmations on the same day, or within a few days, of the \nnomination were the norm well into the 20th century.\n\n  Contrast the Estrada nomination. He waited nearly a year and a half \nfor his confirmation hearing, which lasted for hours. His nomination is \nnow in its fifth week of debate on the Senate floor, nearly 2 years \nafter the President nominated him. Clearly, this is a far cry from the \nrole for the Senate that the Framers contemplated. What was enumerated \nin the Constitution as advice and consent has in practice evolved to \nnegotiation and cooperation in the best cases, and delay and \nobstruction in the worst cases--like that of Mr. Estrada.\n  The Estrada nomination illustrates what is wrong with our current \nsystem of confirming judicial nominees. Despite a bipartisan majority \nof Senators who stand ready to vote on his nomination, a vocal minority \nof Senators is precluding the Senate from exercising its advice and \nconsent duty. This is tyranny of the minority, and its is unfair.\n  It is unfair to the nominee, who must put his life on hold while he \nhangs in endless limbo, wondering whether he will be confirmed. It is \nunfair to the judiciary, our co-equal branch of government, which needs \nits vacancies filled. It is unfair to our President, who has a \njustified expectation that the Senate will give his nominees an up-or-\ndown vote. And it is unfair to the majority of Senators who are \nprepared to vote on this nomination.\n  The filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination also represents a new low \nin the annuals of judicial confirmations. If Mr. Estrada is not \nconfirmed, he will be the first lower court judicial nominee defeated \nthrough a filibuster. More broadly, he will be the first judicial \nnominee, period, defeated through a party-line filibuster, since the \nfilibuster of the Fortas nomination for Chief Justice was supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. This bipartisan opposition was \napparently well grounded, since Justice Fortas ultimately resigned from \nthe Supreme Court amid allegations of ethical misconduct.\n  Of course, no such allegations of misconduct surround Mr. Estrada--\nonly pure partisan politics can be blamed for the obstruction of a vote \non his nomination. Let me take a moment to illustrate.\n  What does it take? There are so many Republican efforts to confirm \nMiguel Estrada that the nomination is in the fifth week of debate on \nthe Senate floor. There is no end in sight. Seventeen attempts for \nunanimous consent to end the debate and have the vote were all rejected \nby our colleagues on the other side. The White House offer for Mr. \nEstrada to answer written questions was rejected by all but one \nDemocratic Senator--all but one when they offered him to answer written \nquestions. The White House offer for Estrada to meet with Senators was \nrejected by all but one Democratic Senator.\n  It doesn't sound to me as if they really want to know what is on his \nmind. In my opinion, they could easily do so by merely meeting with him \nand asking him any questions they want.\n  Of course, cloture filed to end the debate was rejected.\n  The system is broken. This case illustrates it more than any other \ncase that has ever come before the Senate.\n  There can be little doubt that the breakdown in the Senate's advice \nand consent role is not limited to Mr. Estrada's nomination. All \nnominees for the circuit courts of appeals have suffered, as these \ncharts illustrate.\n  Let me just go through this. I am talking about a system in danger of \nbreaking. I think it is broken. This\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nshows the average days pending for circuit court nominees for the first \n2 years of a President's tenure. In the case of Ronald Reagan, it took \nan average of 51 days for circuit court nominees to be pending before \nthey got to a vote on the floor. In the case of President George \nHerbert Walker Bush, it took an average of 83 days in order to get a \njudge pending. In the case of President Clinton, it did go up. It took \nan average of 107 days. With George W. Bush, the current President, it \nhas taken 355 days.\n  That is a system in need of repair. What we are seeing is a slowdown \nin the confirmation of Federal judges.\n  Look at this: Again, a system in danger of breaking.\n  The confirmation rate of circuit court nominees for the first 2 \nyears: Reagan, 95 percent; Bush, 96 percent; and, Clinton, 86 percent \nof his circuit court nominees were confirmed. George W. Bush has 53 \npercent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nDoes the Senator have a chart that would indicate the very same \ninformation but would take the Clinton nominees in the first 2 years \nwhen the control of the Senate was in the Senator's party?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't have that chart.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Wouldn't that be a more pertinent chart?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me put it this way: If we had not gone through--\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator picked the Clinton years when his own party \nwas in the majority.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is happening here--my perception, at least--is \nthat what the Senator is now complaining about is a tactic which was \ninstituted by the other side of the aisle in the very recent past.\n  Now we are being told this isn't the right way to do business. But no \none on that side of the aisle said it wasn't the right way to do \nbusiness only a few years ago when they were doing exactly the same \nthing.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I reclaim my time?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator has questions, I will be happy to take \nthem. In the case of President Clinton, yes, in the first 2 years it \nwas 86 percent. Yes, Joe Biden was chairman at that time. Yes, the \nRepublicans cooperated to make sure those circuit court nominees went \nthrough. In the first 2 years of George W. Bush, the Democrats were in \ncontrol of the committee. We cooperated all we could. That is the best \nwe could get done. I think those statistics still stand up very \nstrongly.\n  What we are seeing is a slowdown in the confirmation of Federal \njudges--a systematic and calculated effort to block the nominees of the \nPresident of this country from the Federal bench. It is time to stop \nit. It is time to reform the system, to de-escalate. The first step, of \ncourse, is to vote on Mr. Estrada's confirmation. But there is much \nmore that we can do to ensure that no other judicial nominee repeats \nthis experience. I urge my colleagues to join me in my efforts to put \nan end to partisan politics in the confirmation process.\n  I have to say, both sides have not been right in this process in the \npast years. I am not trying to just find fault there, but one fault I \ncan find: Never in the history of this country has there been a \nfilibuster succeed against a circuit court of appeals nominee. To argue \nthat he has not provided enough documentation or enough answers when \nthey refused to meet with him, refused to submit written questions, \nwhen they had one of the longest hearings on record for a circuit court \nof appeals nominee, when they have a massive amount of documents, not \nonly all the arguments he made before the Supreme Court but his briefs \nas well and a tremendous, almost 300-page record of proceedings before \nthe committee, it certainly makes my point.\n  To come here and say that we now have to have privileged records on a \nfishing expedition that doesn't name anything specifically seems to me \nto fly in the face of what is right and proper.\n  As I understand it, we will go back and forth. I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Republicans claim that we do not have a \nright to an extended debate on a judicial nominee lacks any foundation. \nThe Constitution gives a strong role to the Senate in confirming \nfederal judges. Both the text of the Appointments Clause of the \nConstitution and the debates over its adoption make clear that the \nSenate should play an active and independent role in selecting judges.\n  The Constitutional Convention met Philadelphia from late May until \nmid-September of 1787. On May 29, 1787, the Convention began its work \non the Constitution with the Virginia Plan introduced by Governor \nRandolph, which provided ``that a National Judiciary be established, to \nbe chosen by the National Legislature.'' Under this plan, the President \nhad no role at all in the selection of judges.\n  When this provision came before the Convention on June 5th, several \nmembers were concerned that having the whole legislature select judges \nwas too unwieldy. James Wilson suggested an alternative proposal that \nthe President be given sole power to appoint judges. That idea had \nalmost no support. Rutledge of South Carolina said that he ``was by no \nmeans disposed to grant so great a power to any single person.'' James \nMadison agreed that the legislature was too large a body, and stated \nthat he was ``rather inclined to give [the appointment power] to the \nSenatorial branch'' of the legislature, a group ``sufficiently stable \nand independent'' to provide ``deliberate judgments.''\n  A week later, Madison offered a formal motion to give the Senate the \nsole power to appoint judges and this motion was adopted without any \nobjection. On June 19, the Convention formally adopted a working draft \nof the Constitution, and it gave the Senate the exclusive power to \nappoint judges.\n  On July 18, the Convention reaffirmed its decision to grant the \nSenate the exclusive power. James Wilson again proposed ``that the \nJudges be appointed by the Executive'' and again his motion was \noverwhelmingly defeated. The issue was considered again on July 21, and \nthe Convention again agreed to the exclusive Senate appointment of \njudges. In a debate concerning the provision, George Mason called the \nidea of executive appointment of Federal judges a ``dangerous \nprecedent.''\n\n  Not until the final days of the Convention was the President given \npower to nominate Judges. On September 4, 2 weeks before the \nConvention's work was completed, the committee proposed that the \nPresident should have a role in selecting judges. It stated: ``The \nPresident shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate shall appoint judges of the Supreme Court.''\n  The debates, make clear, however, that while the President had the \npower to nominate judges, the Senate still had a central role. That is \nwhat the debate made clear. For instance, Governor Morris of \nPennsylvania described the provision as giving the Senate the power \n``to appoint Judges nominated to them by the President.\n  The Convention, having repeatedly rejected proposals that would lodge \nexclusive power to select judges with the executive branch, could not \npossibly have intended to reduce the Senate to a rubber stamp role.\n  The reasons given by delegates to the Convention for making the \nselection of judges a joint decision by the President and the Senate \nare as relevant today as they were in 1787. The Framers refused to give \nthe power of appointment to a ``single individual.'' They understood \nthat a more representative judiciary would be best served by giving \nMembers of the Senate a major role.\n  The Senate has never hesitated to fully exercise this power. During \nthe first 100 years after ratification of the Constitution, 21 of 81 \nSupreme Court nominations--one out of four--were rejected, withdrawn, \nor not acted on. During these confirmation debates, ideology often \nmattered. John Rutledge, nominated by George Washington, failed to win \nconfirmation as Chief Justice in 1795. Alexander Hamilton and other \nFederalists opposed him because of his position on the controversial \nJay Treaty. A nominee of President James Polk was rejected because of \nhis anti-immigration position. A nominee of President Hoover was \nrejected because of his anti-labor view.\n  A very substantial number of us believe that we are facing another \nhistoric constitutional confirmation which only the Senate's power and \nprocesses can resolve. Our President\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\nhas embarked on a course that threatens the balance of powers and the \nindependence of the judiciary. His legal advisors have set him on a \ncourse to stack the U.S. Courts with judges who will judge in \naccordance with a narrow and extreme set of views, views outside of the \njudicial mainstream and aimed at making draconian and sudden changes in \nthe direction of life and liberty in this Nation. President Bush is not \nthe originator of this court-stacking plan. It began decades ago with \nhis predecessors in the White House and Justice Department. It has been \nenabled by the successful efforts of some in our own body to retard the \nfilling of judicial vacancies over the past two presidential terms.\n\n  The White House and its allies have not been bashful about admitting \ntheir radical goal. Our own respect for the judiciary leaves no doubt \nthat our President was lawfully elected. But there is not the slightest \nbasis for the argument that any popular mandate supports such a massive \nshift in judicial direction.\n  As Senators we have the power, and the responsibility to ourselves, \nour constituencies and our institution, to resist revolutionary change \nin the balance of power. We have the power--and responsibility--to \nreject the notion that a President can suddenly fashion the judiciary \nin his own image. We have a special responsibility to do so when the \nSenate is so evenly divided that, after due consideration and debate \nbased on all the necessary information, the switch of a few votes could \nchange the result. We certainly have the obligation to do so when the \nExecutive Branch prevents us from exercising our assigned \nconstitutional powers of advice and consent by depriving us of any \naccess to the only documents which might tell us what kind of a judge a \nnominee will be--the very documents which the President's lawyers used \nto select and vet the nominee.\n  The issue before us today is about much more than Miguel Estrada. It \nis about the essential nature of our government; it is about the core \nvalues of the Senate; it is about our history and our legacy.\n  We must not let the Founders down. We must not let our predecessors \ndown. We must not let our constituents down. We must not let our Nation \ndown.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I begin by taking direct issue with the \narguments by the Senator from Massachusetts. The advice and consent \nfunction set forth in the Constitution has been consistently \ninterpreted for 216 years to confirm Presidential nominations, unless \nthere is a reason not to. That has been the practice. Now we have a new \nposition advocated by the Democrats, saying if there are 41 \nobstructors, then the Democrats want an equal share in the process of \njudicial selection.\n  The Senator from South Dakota raised the consideration that no one on \nthis side of the aisle had spoken up, when in effect the shoe was on \nthe other foot when the Democrats controlled the White House and \nRepublicans controlled the Senate. There were those on this side of the \naisle who spoke up and said worthy nominees submitted by President \nClinton should be confirmed. I was one of them. We did confirm a number \nof contested nominations: Judge Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon, Roger \nGregory, and others.\n  So it is true there have been delays when one party has controlled \nthe White House and the other party has controlled the Senate. And \nRepublicans are not blameless in this process. But I submit that in the \n107th Congress, with President Bush in the White House and the \nDemocrats in control of the Senate, the process has been carried to \ngreat extreme. This year, with the Republicans controlling both the \nWhite House and the Senate, we have had the unprecedented position of a \nfilibuster on a judge for the court of appeals.\n  In the history of the judicial confirmation process, there has been \nonly one prior filibuster, and that was on Justice Abe Fortas, \nnominated to be Chief Justice. That involved an issue of integrity, and \nthat was a bipartisan filibuster. We had, perhaps, the most bitter \ncontest on confirmation when Circuit Judge Clarence Thomas was up for \nconfirmation to the Supreme Court. Within 50 minutes, let alone 5 \nminutes, I could not begin to summarize the contest there on the \nbitterness of the proceedings. Justice Thomas was confirmed 52-48. But \nno one suggested there ought to be a filibuster. The regular rule was \nfollowed. Even though there was a tie vote in the Judiciary Committee, \nwhich would not customarily, under Judiciary Committee rules, permit \nthe matter to be advanced to the full body, it did come to the full \nSenate and there was no filibuster, and Justice Thomas was confirmed.\n  When the Democrats--and I very much deplore the partisan nature of \nthis debate, but it is a matter of Democrats versus Republicans, and it \nis my hope we will find a way to solve it. When the Democrats raise \nissues about Miguel Estrada answering more questions, or raise the \ncontention that his work as an assistant Solicitor General ought to be \ndisclosed, they are, pure and simple, red herrings.\n  A long litany of nominees have come before the Judiciary Committee \nwho have declined to answer questions and have been confirmed. In the \njudicial process, judges are not expected to give opinions until there \nis a case in controversy, until there are facts, until briefs are \nsubmitted, until there is oral argument, until there is deliberation \namong the judges, then a decision is made--not to answer a wide variety \nof hypothetical questions that are posed in nomination proceedings.\n  On the confirmation process of Merrick Garland, I asked the question: \nDo you favor, as a personal matter, capital punishment?\n\n  Mr. Garland replied: This is really a matter of settled law now. The \nCourt has held that capital punishment is constitutional and lower \ncourts are expected to follow the rule.\n  Because of time limitations, I shall not go into detail on that. When \nMarsha Berzon appeared before the committee, she was asked by Senator \nRobert Smith about the abortion issue. Marsha Berzon was later \nconfirmed.\n  I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Marsha Berzon responded that the matter was settled, \nregardless of what her views were. A similar response was given by \nJudith Rogers to questions by former Senator Cohen.\n  With respect to Miguel Estrada's work as an Assistant Solicitor \nGeneral, seven former Solicitors General wrote to Senator Leahy, laying \nout the fact that it is of ``vital importance of candor and \nconfidentiality in the Solicitor General's decision-making process that \nMiguel Estrada's work should not be disclosed.''\n  I am delighted that we have been joined by a number of Senators from \nthe other side of the aisle. It is my hope that we will yet get five \nadditional Senators who will break the deadlock and we will move to \ncloture and we will end this debate.\n  This controversy is poisoning the Senate beyond any question. It is \ndistracting the Senate from other very important business. I hope we \nwill find a way out promptly and ultimately establish a protocol so \nmany days after a nomination is submitted, a hearing by the Judiciary \nCommittee; so many days later, a committee vote; so many days later, \nfloor action; so that regardless of what party controls the White House \nand what party controls the Senate, the public business will be \nattended to and the partisanship will be taken out of the selection and \nconfirmation of Federal judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the Senator from Nevada \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that the \nSenate's extended debate over Mr. Estrada's nomination is somehow \nunconstitutional. This is, at the very least, curious. They say Senate \nrule XXII, which allows for cloture on judicial nominations, is \nunconstitutional. Very curious. That rule provides that a vote of 60 \nMembers of this body may end debate.\n  They point to the Constitution which provides several examples where \na supermajority is required to approve a measure. Since nominations are \nnot mentioned, they argue, only a simple majority should be required.\n  But the majority's focus on the vote count misses the point. If \ncloture had\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nnot been extended to nominations, among other things, in 1949, what \nwould be the result? Well, maybe a single Senator could engage in \nunlimited debate. There would be no provision whatsoever to cut off \nthat debate. There would be no provision to get to a vote--whether it \nbe a supermajority or a majority vote.\n  Surely my colleagues do not argue that extended debate in the world's \ngreatest deliberative body is unconstitutional.\n  We will continue to exercise our right to debate this nominee until \nhe answers the Judiciary Committee's questions and provides the \ncommittee with his memoranda.\n  The vigorous debate we continue to have on the Estrada nomination \nreflects our fidelity to our constitutional obligations to advise and \nconsent to Presidential judicial nominees.\n  It is that role that is the proper subject of a constitutional \ndebate.\n  What did the Founding Fathers have in mind when they made that \nprovision? In the Federalist Paper No. 47, James Madison, quoting \nMontesquieu, stated:\n\n       There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive \n     powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates.\n  In Federalist No. 76, Alexander Hamilton was more specific when he \nexplained that the Senate's role:\n       [w]ould be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism \n     in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the \n     appointment of unfit characters [while serving as an] \n     efficacious source of stability in the Administration.\n\n  In a lecture at the Heritage Foundation in 1993, David Forte said, in \nFederalist No. 10 and 51, Madison proposed division within the central \ngovernment into a complex separation of powers. Forte said:\n\n       The liberties of the people would therefore be protected, \n     first by the residuum of sovereignty left to the states, and \n     secondly, by tying different constituencies to separate parts \n     of the federal government--House of Representatives, Senate, \n     Executive, and Judiciary--and giving each branch some part of \n     each other's powers in order to defend itself against any \n     branch's aggrandizement of its own powers.\n  As Justice Brandeis said in Myers v. United States:\n\n       The doctrine of separation of powers was adopted by the \n     Convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency, but to preclude \n     the exercise of arbitrary power.\n\n  Justice Brandeis went on to say:\n\n       The purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the \n     inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the \n     governmental powers among three departments, to save the \n     people from autocracy.\n\n  Indeed, this is the heart of the Estrada debate. The administration \nhas advised this nominee not to answer our questions. It refuses to \nturn over documents which have been provided in the past and which \nwould help evaluate this nominee.\n  The administration has made it impossible for the Senate to fulfill \nits constitutional duty. The White House seeks to wield unchecked power \nover the appointment of lifetime Federal judges, but that is not what \nthe Founders of our country had in mind or what the Constitution \nprovides. The Constitution divides power over nominations between the \nPresident and the Senate.\n  In an article in the Emory Law Journal, Professor Carl Tobias \ndiscussed how that intent of the Constitution's drafters has been \ncarried out:\n\n       The Senate has actively participated in naming judges since \n     the chamber's creation because members of this body have a \n     significant stake in affecting . . . appointments.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       There has also been a venerable tradition in the senatorial \n     involvement in the choice of nominees. . . . The state's \n     senators or senior elected officials who are members of the \n     President's political party have ordinarily recommended \n     candidates whom the Chief Executive in turn has nominated.\n       In short, judicial selection has been a shared \n     responsibility of the President and the Senate. . . .\n\n  I would add that this is as the Founders intended.\n  The Cato Institute's ``Handbook for Congress'' puts it quite nicely:\n\n       More important than knowing a nominee's ``judicial \n     philosophy'' is knowing his philosophy of the Constitution. \n     For the Constitution, in the end, is what defines us as a \n     nation.\n\n  The Constitution defines the role of the President and the role of \nthe Senate--\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy used all his time. I ask for \nan additional minute.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Continuing with the quote:\n\n       More important than knowing a nominee's ``judicial \n     philosophy'' is knowing his philosophy of the Constitution. \n     For the Constitution, in the end, is what defines us as a \n     nation.\n\n  The Constitution defines the role of the President and the role of \nthe Senate in the process of selecting lifetime Federal judges. It is a \nshared responsibility. This administration and this nominee seek to \nexercise near total power over that process. If there is something \nunconstitutional afoot in the consideration of Mr. Estrada's \nnomination, it is that the President seeks to prevent the Senate from \nexercising its constitutional duty.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Daniel Webster once said that ``justice is the \ngreatest interest of man on Earth.'' I cannot help but think of that \nphrase as I read from today's letter from President George W. Bush, \nwhich was previously admitted as part of the Record, when he says:\n\n       The Chief Justice warns that the high number of judicial \n     vacancies, when combined with the ever-increasing caseloads, \n     leads to crowded courts and threatens the administration of \n     justice.\n\n  It has also long been recognized that ``justice delayed is justice \ndenied,'' and that is exactly what is happening to American citizens \nthroughout this country, while President Bush's judicial nominees are \nbeing filibustered and slow boated. The President is being denied his \nprerogative of choosing his nominees for Federal benches subject to the \nadvice and consent, the proper constitutional role of the Senate, being \nexercised.\n  I rise this morning with great concern about the state of our \njudicial confirmation process, something that Senator Specter and \nothers have commented on. They have called for reform, for a fresh \nstart, and I believe that is called for.\n  The Constitution makes clear that the President appoints judges with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. It has long been established, by \nconstitutional text, by Senate tradition, and by Supreme Court \nprecedent, that that means a majority of the Senate. But today, a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate is being denied the opportunity to \nvote on Miguel Estrada, by a minority that is intent on changing the \nrules, applying a double standard, and denying Miguel Estrada an up-or-\ndown vote in this Chamber.\n  Somehow, this process has disintegrated to the point where a partisan \nminority of the Senate will not even allow a bipartisan majority to \nvote. This, of course, is not what the Constitution says or what the \nFounders had in mind. Our Founders never intended that the judicial \nconfirmation process would become so poisonous as it has today.\n  This filibuster, this act of preventing a bipartisan majority from \nexpressing its consent to Mr. Estrada's nomination, is, as we have \nheard, without precedent.\n  I could not help but think also about last year's debate over the \nconfirmation of another nominee of President Bush, someone with whom I \nserved on the Texas Supreme Court, and that is Justice Priscilla Owen, \nwho will come up again this Thursday for another hearing in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Some people during that process criticized the Texas system of \nelecting judges, one that has been established in our constitution \nsince Reconstruction and which also is replicated in the constitutions \nof other States.\n  Justice Owen has, as I have, long been an advocate for reforming the \nway in which Texas selects judges. But, Mr. President, whatever the \nproblems the various States may have in their judicial selection \nsystems, nothing--absolutely nothing--compares to how badly broken the \nsystem of judicial confirmation is here in Washington, DC.\n  In Texas, at least, the people are given a choice of judicial \nnominees and there is an opportunity for debate and\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\ndiscussion and, at long last, there is a vote. Whatever you can say \nabout the process, we always get there. We always hold a vote.\n  Somehow we have lost our way in the Senate. When the President \nnominates individuals of high caliber to serve the American people \nthrough an appointment to the Federal bench, and bipartisan majorities \nof the Senate stand enthusiastically ready to confirm those \nindividuals, the process of confirming these highly qualified nominees \nis simply obstructed.\n  As I say, I have long believed we need a fresh start, as articulated \nby others, to the judicial confirmation process, and the first step \nwould be to bring this fine judicial nominee, Miguel Estrada, to a \nvote. It has already been too long. It is time to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time?\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Illinois is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a curious situation: A person with an \nextraordinary background, Miguel Estrada, coming to the United States \nas an immigrant with limited knowledge of English, in a few years rises \nto the top of the Harvard Law School; he then goes on to work in the \nSolicitor General's Office dealing with Supreme Court decisions, \nworking in the Department of Justice at the very highest levels.\n  It is an extraordinary story of personal achievement, academic \nachievement, and professional achievement. That is why the conduct of \nMiguel Estrada during this confirmation process has been so puzzling.\n  I believe he has received bad advice. I think the people at the \nDepartment of Justice who said to him, whatever you do do not answer \nquestions directly, they were not fair to Miguel Estrada.\n  When you consider the questions which he refused to answer, these \nwere not unreasonable questions. My colleague and friend from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions, regularly asked Democratic nominees the same \nquestions we asked of Miguel Estrada in reference to Supreme Court \nJustices whom he admired, in reference to Supreme Court decisions with \nwhich he agreed or disagreed. No one argued that this was out of bounds \nor unfair. They said Senator Sessions was entitled to ask that of \njudicial nominees.\n  I have before me Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon, all of the different \nDemocratic nominees who faced those very questions and answered them, \nas they should have.\n  When the same questions were posed to Miguel Estrada, his handlers at \nthe Department of Justice said: Stay away from those questions. Do not \nanswer those questions.\n  When Senator Schumer of New York asked Miguel Estrada about Supreme \nCourt decisions that he would take exception to within the last 40 \nyears, or even beyond, he went on to say:\n\n       I ought not to undertake to, in effect, hold the Court to \n     task for the purpose of having gotten something wrong when I \n     haven't been in their shoes in the sense of having had access \n     to all of the materials, argument, research, and deliberation \n     that they had.\n\n  He ducked the question, a question so basic that a law student in a \nconstitutional law course would answer that question. But Miguel \nEstrada refused. And that raises another question. I think he has \nreceived poor advice from the White House, because the White House has \nsaid that he cannot produce for us documentation that really tells the \nstory of his legal views, documentation that has been presented by many \nnominees. They have said, no, we are stonewalling it; we are not going \nto release that information to Congress. So now Miguel Estrada is \nstalled in the Senate because he has refused to cooperate in the \nquestioning, refused to produce the documents, refused to answer basic \nquestions which Republican Senators asked time and again of Democratic \nnominees, fair questions, reasonable questions.\n  This last weekend, I went to Alabama. It was my first visit to that \nState ever. I went with a group known as Religion in Politics, with \nCongressman John Lewis and Senator Sam Brownback, to visit in \nMontgomery, Selma, and Birmingham, the sites of some of the most \ndramatic historic events in the civil rights movement in America. It \nwas something to stand on Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma with John Lewis \non Saturday near the 38th anniversary of that march, at the exact spot \nwhere he was beaten down, hit in the head, suffered a concussion. John \nLewis said to me: There never would have been a Selma to Montgomery \nmarch were it not for the courage of one Federal district court judge, \nFrank Johnson. Frank Johnson, a Republican appointee under the \nEisenhower administration, stood up for what was right in the civil \nrights movement. With his courage, he not only had death threats on a \nregular basis, his mother's home was fire bombed. This man had the \ncourage to stand up for the right thing.\n  When he passed away, Senator Hatch was right to introduce a \nresolution honoring Frank Johnson for his courage, saying that he had \nthe courage to stand up against Plessy v. Ferguson, separate but equal. \nHe had the courage to argue for one man one vote before its time had \ncome.\n  I put that experience in the context of this conversation. This is \nnot a routine decision. This is not another thing that the Senate \nshould consider as part of some process that really we do not have to \ndwell on. We are appointing men and women to positions on the bench \nwhere they can make historic decisions. Frank Johnson did.\n  The court that Miguel Estrada aspires to is an even higher court, the \nsecond highest court in the land. Would it not have been reasonable for \nMiguel Estrada to have said that he disagreed with Plessy v. Ferguson, \nthe basis of segregation in America for almost 100 years? He refused, \nand that is why his nomination languishes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I have been in the \nSenate now for a couple of months at most--it seems longer--and I am \nbearing witness to a change in the Constitution I never envisioned I \nwould be a witness to.\n  The minority on the other side, not all of them because some of them \nvoted to allow Miguel Estrada a vote up or down, are, in effect, \nchanging the Constitution. We can have an academic debate whether it is \nlegal or not, but there are five situations in the Constitution where \nthe Framers required a supermajority vote. Confirming a judge was not \none of them. We are witnessing and we are part of a change to our \nConstitution by the fact that they are filibustering this judge \nrequiring 60 votes to confirm a judge.\n  Why is this happening? What is going on? It is not about the way \nquestions were answered. It is not about getting memos that no \nSolicitor General would allow to be released on their watch, Democrat \nor Republican. This is a calculated effort by our friends on the other \nside post-2002 election to go after our President.\n  They had a meeting before Miguel Estrada had a hearing, and their \nmeeting was about: You are laying down too much for President Bush. You \nneed to stand up to him.\n  They made a calculated decision to stand up to him by going after his \njudges. They are, in effect, changing the Constitution, and this is \nwrong. It is wrong politically and it is wrong constitutionally. \nWhether it is illegal, I do not know, but I know it is going to hurt \nour country and history will judge us poorly for allowing this to \nhappen.\n  This is an effort to go after the President in a way that no other \nparty has ever gone after a President before, and we will pay a price \nas a nation if this is successful.\n  I know my colleagues are better than this. I know they are capable of \ndoing better than this because I can read what they said on other \noccasions when the shoe was on the other foot.\n  When I came to the Chamber a few minutes ago, the Senator from \nMassachusetts was giving us a history lesson about the role of the \nSenate and the President in confirming judges. This is what he said on \nMarch 7, 2000: Over 200 years ago, the Framers of the Constitution \ncreated a system of checks and balances to ensure that excessive power \nis not concentrated to any branch of the Government. The President was \ngiven the authority to nominate Federal judges with the advice\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nand consent of the Senate. The clear intent was for the Senate to work \nwith the President, not against him, in the process. In recent years, \nhowever, by refusing to take timely action on so many of the \nPresident's nominees, the Senate has abdicated its responsibility.\n  He was right then. He could see at that moment the problems that were \nbeing created for this country if we overly played politics with \njudicial nominations. He is wrong today because he is blinded by the \npolitics of 2002.\n  We owe it to Americans across the country to give these nominees a \nvote. If our Republican colleagues do not like them, do not like their \nanswers, do not like the way they are behaving, do not like the advice \nthey are getting--I am adding this now--vote against them, but give \nthem a vote. That was Senator Kennedy, February 3, 1998.\n  If Senators want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I \nrespect that. State their reasons. I respect that. But do not hold up a \nqualified judicial nominee.\n  Senator Leahy said: I have stated over and over again on this floor \nthat I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \nwhether somebody I opposed or somebody I support. I thought the Senate \nshould do its duty by giving them a vote.\n  They were right then. They could see clearly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator happened to mention my name. I ask if the \nSenator will yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator be willing to state the whole quote? He \nhas left out a very significant part in that quote. Is he willing to \nput the whole quote, the accurate quote?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I will be glad to do that. Could I, in \nturn, ask the Senator a question?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield time for the question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Is Senator Leahy willing to answer my \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, whose time is this on?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the Senator from North Carolina going to answer the \nquestion I asked him? Is he willing to read the whole quote? The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. South Carolina.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I beg your pardon. I apologize. Will the Senator from \nSouth Carolina be willing to read the whole quote?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely. Rather than taking the \ntime, I will put it in the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would read the whole quote in context, I am \nhappy to answer any questions he has. If he is unwilling--\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely, I will. I do not have it, \nbut if somebody will give it to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is obvious that the Senator from South Carolina did not \nhave the whole quote or he would not have quoted me out of context so \nbadly.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The additional time of the Senator from South \nCarolina has expired.\n  Who yields time? Under the previous order, the Senator from New York \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield time for the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina to complete his question, and I hope the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont will answer his question.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I do not want to misquote the Senator. \nI do not want to put words in his mouth. I do not want to take one part \nof his quote to suggest it means something that it really does not.\n  My question simply put: In June 1998, was the Senator trying to tell \nthe Senate that it is wrong to filibuster a judge?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I responding on the time of the Senator \nfrom Utah?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would read the whole quote, he would \nunderstand I was talking about the anonymous holds on Judge Sotomayor, \nand anonymous holds were being used as a filibuster. I made that very \nclear in that statement.\n  Interestingly enough, even though we have corrected the record a \nnumber of times on the floor, pointing out when that misstatement has \nbeen made, apparently those were times when the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina was not on the floor.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time of the Senator is expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am so glad to see so many of my \ncolleagues in the Chamber today, although I wish they were here to \ndebate the issues the American people are asking us about. What is \nhappening with the impending war in Iraq? How will we pay for it? What \nis happening with stimulating the economy? What are we going to do to \nhave average working men and women gain jobs? We have lost 2 million \njobs.\n  Let the record show the reason we are not talking about those issues \nand we are continuing to talk about Mr. Estrada is that is what the \nRepublican majority wants to do.\n  Mr. Estrada has a job. I think he probably gets paid a very nice \nsalary, and he deserves it. But what about the 2 million Americans who \ndo not have jobs, who have lost jobs since President Bush became \nPresident? Why can't we be debating that issue? I urge my colleagues to \nstart talking about that and how we will stimulate the economy; and to \nstart talking about how we will gain more allies in our struggle with \nIraq; and to start talking about how we will pay for postwar Iraq.\n  It is at the insistence of my colleagues that we continue to debate \nthis issue, although we have reached an impasse. We are not going to \nyield on something we think is a constitutional principle. We can sit \nhere and debate and debate and debate, but you will not change anyone's \nvoting. The reason is very simple. The reason is we believe sincerely \nand firmly this is not about any one individual, but this is about the \nconstitutional process of advise and consent. This is about learning \nwhat potential judges think before they go to the bench to make \ndecisions that affect our lives for a generation. We are entitled to do \nthat. That is what the Founding Fathers intended, it is clear.\n  In the first nomination to the Supreme Court, where many of the \noriginal Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution were present, Mr. \nRutledge, the nominee of President Washington, was turned down because \nthey did not agree with his views on the Jay Treaty.\n  The other side wanted debate; when they had nominees, they \nquestioned. People asked, what is the difference? My colleagues on the \nother side knew Judge Paez's record and they knew Judge Berzon's \nrecord, and they chose to vote against him. That is fair. We all let \nideology enter into the way we vote. Those who deny it are being less \nthan candid. Otherwise, the votes would be sprinkled evenly between \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  When the other side was there, let me read a quote from Senator \nHatch, a man I greatly respect and regard as a friend.\n\n       The careful scrutiny of judicial nominees is one important \n     step in the process, a step reserved to the Senate alone . \n     . . I have no problem with those who want to review these \n     nominees with great specificity.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are simply carrying \nout what Senator Hatch said was perfectly appropriate, what he had no \nproblem with. We have not learned anything about Miguel Estrada's views \nwith great specificity. And what we fear--and you will regret it if \nthere comes a Democratic president--is that nominees will refuse to \nanswer all questions, as Miguel Estrada did, and they will have no \ntrack record, and Presidents will endeavor to find people who have no \nknown views when they nominate them to the bench.\n  My guess is the White House knows Miguel Estrada's views. My guess is \nthey carefully researched it. When it comes time to make those views \npublic, part of the constitutional process,\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\nwe are denied that right by a nominee who stonewalls and does not \nanswer the most obvious questions, and by a White House that will not \nrelease documents that have been released--in the cases of Mr. Bork, \nJustice Rehnquist, Mr. Civiletti, and Mr. Reynolds. All of them \nreleased the same documents the White House refuses to release now.\n  I ask the American people, ask yourselves a question, my friends. Why \nare they so afraid to reveal Miguel Estrada's record? If he proves to \nbe a mainstream conservative, he will pass this Chamber. I have voted \nfor over 100 of the 110 nominees. I disagree with most of them, but I \ndon't think they are out of the mainstream, and the President deserves \nsome benefit. But if Mr. Miguel Estrada's record shows he is so far \nbeyond the mainstream that he will try to make law from the bench and \nnot interpret the law, which those who are on the far left and far \nright tend to do, he should not be made a judge. The bottom line is, we \nhave no way of answering that question until we follow Senator Hatch's \nmandate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask if the manager will give me a minute or two?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Virginia yield so we can enter into a \nunanimous consent request?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent debate on this \nmatter be extended until the hour of 12:50 with the time equally \ndivided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague--\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. You brought up the history of Rutledge. I discussed this \nat length last night on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, that is on the time of the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. WARNER. You brought up the very important case of George \nWashington's nomination, Rutledge, who had been a constitutional \nFramer, and his colleagues in this Chamber, some of whom were \nconstitutional Framers, turned him down, correct--but they did it by a \nvote. Am I not correct on that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. You are correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the essence of what we are trying to establish \nhere, namely that a vote is what the Framers envisioned when they put \nin the supermajority, as the Senator from South Carolina put it. They \ndid not put a supermajority in for nominations, the concept being that \nthe President and the Senate would work together. Otherwise, the \nPresident could thwart the process by putting no one up for judicial \nnomination, thinking that the Senate would be arbitrary, and the Senate \ncould arbitrarily, as I think we are doing now, turn them down.\n\n  As I mentioned last night on the Senate floor, unless we work \ntogether under the doctrine of checks and balances, which is inherent \nin the Constitution, we could thwart the ability of this Nation having \nany Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might answer briefly, my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. On your own time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was asked a question.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time of the Senator has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might answer my good friend from Virginia, I have \ntremendous respect for his integrity.\n  Yes, there was a vote on Mr. Rutledge--after he revealed his views on \nthe Jay Treaty and other issues. Of course, we should have a vote on \nMiguel Estrada. I don't disagree with that. But not until we know how \nhe feels on the vital issues of the day.\n  How does he feel about the first amendment? How does he feel about \nthe commerce clause? Does he believe, like some on the bench, that the \ncommerce clause has been expanded too broadly and we ought to go back \nto regulation by the 50 States?\n  I have no idea, I say to my friend from Virginia. I have no idea of \nhow he feels.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield one more minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no idea how he feels about the first amendment or \nabout the 11th amendment, and the balance between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, the very issues the Founding Fathers wanted \nus to know.\n  The judiciary, and I know my colleague knows this, is the one \nnonelected branch of the government. The advice and consent clause----\n  Mr. HATCH. I can speak for Mr. Estrada. I know he feels very good \nabout the first amendment. All of us do. I don't think that is the \nquestion.\n  The Senator has a right to ask written questions and meet with him \npersonally to ask how he feels about something. I am sure he feels very \ngood about him.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I have 1 minute?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield an additional 1 minute.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If Mr. Estrada feels good about the first amendment, I \nask my colleague, why can't he tell us? And why can't he elaborate? \nWhat does he feel about Buckley v. Valeo, a case we debated here for a \nlong time? It is a past case. How far does he feel the first amendment \nought to go?\n  It is certainly not good enough, not only for the Senators but for \nthe American people to hear my friend from Utah say he feels good about \nthe first amendment, I say to my colleagues, or the second, or the \nfourth, or any of the other vital amendments.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is not a laughing matter. This is \nserious stuff about the one nonelected branch of Government.\n  The Founding Fathers wanted, in the advice and consent process, \nserious questions. Just as Senator Hatch said, it was a part of the \nprocess to ask those questions when President Clinton's nominees were \nbefore us. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. I yield.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I want to place this debate in historical \ncontext. The tradition of the Senate has been to confirm judicial \nnominations of the President if the nominees were competent, if they \nwere qualified, if they were honest, if they had a record and \nbackground in the law, in the practice of law or on the bench or in \nacademia, that suggested they could live up to the standards of the \njudiciary. If they did, they were confirmed and confirmed without \nhaving to answer questions that nobody ever has had to answer and would \nusurp and undermine the executive branch and the Solicitor General's \nOffice if they had to answer it. Under those standards, hundreds of \npeople in Miguel Estrada's circumstances have been confirmed without \neven any controversy, much less a filibuster, and everybody here knows \nit.\n  You can always invent a reason to be opposed to somebody. Senators on \nthe other side have been good at doing that with regard to Miguel \nEstrada, but he ought to be confirmed. At least he ought to have a \nvote, if we are going to follow the traditions of the Senate.\n  Now those traditions have broken down to the point we not only are \nvoting not to confirm people, we are not even allowing a vote. We have \nSenators conducting a filibuster on somebody because they suspect they \nmight disagree with his jurisprudence.\n  What is it we are so afraid Miguel Estrada might believe; a man who \nwent to Harvard Law School, was an editor of the Law Review, served in \nthe Solicitor General's Office, has been given high marks by everybody \nwho has ever supervised him? Of course he is in the mainstream.\n\n  In the past, we gave people the benefit of the doubt. We don't have \ntime, with every judicial nominee, to go through everything they might \nbelieve about every particular judicial issue. The fact is, if we were \napplying the traditions of the Senate, or anything close, this man \nwould be confirmed and we could move on. Now we cannot even get a vote, \nand everybody here knows that.\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\n  The Senate is broken. It is broken at a time where we may be going to \nwar. The economy is in trouble. Of course we need to move on. I hear \nSenators from the other side saying we should not be debating this, we \nshould be moving on. Yes. Exactly. But you can't stand up and conduct a \nfilibuster and then say you are not obstructing. You are. Let us have a \nvote on this man. He will probably carry. Other nominees we have votes \non may not carry. Let's get the Senate working together.\n  It is not the end of the world if somebody gets on the court of \nappeals that you don't like. He is not going to change the \nConstitution. He is on the court of appeals. Let's vote on him and \nlet's move on.\n  What concerns me is something to which the Senator from New York \nreferred. I am concerned that a few years from now a Democratic \nPresident may get elected and he is going to start nominating people \nand we are going to get back on this, except from this side of the \naisle. It would be wrong.\n  I have three kids. They are 12, 10, and 6.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. TALENT. Can I have another minute to talk about my family?\n  Mr. HATCH. I grant the Senator 1 more minute.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. I appreciate it. Sometimes I go down to our little rumpus \nroom and they are arguing about something, and the one thing I tell \nthem I don't want to hear is: They started it. He started it.\n  There is a code of conduct to which you should adhere. Let's adhere \nto it. That is in the interest of this Senate. It is in the interests \nof the Constitution and the interests of the people. What must the \npeople think when they see us doing this on an appellate court \nnomination? I ask my friends from the other side of the aisle, I know \nit was done--not to this extent but from this side of the aisle--to \nsome of President Clinton's nominees. Let's go back to the standard we \nalways followed. Let's make the Senate work. Let's keep it from being \nbroken.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to both sides?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority has 10 minutes 13 seconds; the \nminority, 14 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I welcome the distinguished Presiding Officer to the Senate today in \nhis capacity as President of the Senate. It is not often we see the \nVice President in the chair of the Senate. With the U.N. Security \nCouncil meeting today, the OPEC meeting, the unsettled and threatening \ncircumstances in so many parts of the world from the Middle East to the \nKorean peninsula to Iran and Iraq, we should feel very honored that the \nVice President would take time out of his schedule related to those \nkinds of issues to be with us today.\n  I hope he will come back to the Senate when we debate the disastrous \neconomic situation in the country, the loss of 2.5 million jobs in the \nlast 2 years following 8 years of a million new jobs being added every \nyear, or the 300,000 lost last month.\n  I know Senator Daschle sought for weeks to proceed to debate on S. \n414, the Economic Recovery Act of 2003, which among other things \nincludes the First Responders Partnership Grant Act, something that we \ncould use in Vermont and Utah and Wyoming and everywhere else, but the \nSenate Republican majority has blocked debate and action on the \nEconomic Recovery Act.\n  So, today, instead of debating the international situation, the need \nto pass an economic stimulus package, the need for an increased \ncommitment to homeland defense, the need for legislation to provide a \nreal prescription drug benefit for seniors or the many other matters so \ndeeply concerning Americans, Republicans are insisting on returning \nagain in some form to debate the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  I wonder if I might have order, Mr. President?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I note that what has impeded a Senate vote on the Estrada \nnomination has been the political game being played by the White House \nwith this nomination. It is part of an effort to pack the Federal \ncourts.\n  In many ways, the debate has been in the hands of the White House. \nThis is a debate that could have ended at any time the White House \nwanted it to end. We wonder, is there something in Mr. Estrada's \nwritings that the White House doesn't want us to see? The White House \ncould have long ago solved this impasse by letting the Senate have \naccess to Mr. Estrada's memos, especially since Mr. Estrada said he is \nperfectly willing to have us see those memos. We have plenty of \nquestions we wanted to ask about it but we have to have the paperwork. \nHe told us even though he said under oath he is willing to let us see \nit, the White House told him he could not.\n  So really this debate is in the control of the White House, not in \nthe control of the leaders of the Senate. Past administrations provided \nlegal memos in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork, William \nRehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott, and Benjamin Civiletti, and \nthis administration actually provided White House Counsel's office \nmemos of its nominee to the EPA.\n  Our request for his memos was made nearly one full year ago, Mr. \nPresident. The White House also could have helped resolve this impasse \nthrough instructing the nominee to answer questions about his views at \nhis hearing, to act consistent with last year's Supreme Court opinion \nby Justice Scalia in a case the Republican Party won to allow judicial \ncandidates to share their views, and to stop the pretense that he has \nno views. The White House is using ideology to select its judicial \nnominees but is trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology \nof these nominees when it evaluates them.\n\n  Instead, it appears that the Senate Republican majority, at the \ndirection of the White House, chose to extend this debate because its \npolitical operatives hope to use it to falsely paint those who will not \nbe steam rolled as somehow being ``anti-Hispanic.'' The Republicans' \nresort to partisanship regarding this nomination disregards the \nlegitimate concerns raised by many Senators as well as by respected \nHispanic elected officials and Hispanic civil rights leaders. Moreover, \nthe Republican approach and the President's approach has been to \ndivide: to divide the Senate, to divide the American people and, on \nthis particular nomination, to divide Hispanic Americans against each \nother.\n  That is wrong. It is wrong because the President campaigned on a \nplatform of uniting, not dividing. It is wrong because our country \nneeds us to build consensus and work together, especially in these most \nchallenging times.\n  Instead of bringing up legislation that could unite us or setting \naside time for debate on the international and domestic challenges our \ncountry is facing, the Republicans have again returned to the \nnomination of Mr. Estrada and they have set aside an hour and one-half \nthis morning for a constitutional debate. Many Democratic Senators have \nalready spoken about the Senate's proper role in the confirmation \nprocess under the Constitution. I recall, in particular, statements by \nSenators Daschle, Reid, Bingaman, Boxer, Clinton, Corzine, Dodd, \nDorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Feinstein, Harkin, Johnson, Kennedy, \nKohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Mikulski, Sarbanes and Schumer, among many \nothers.\n  What is disconcerting about the recent debate is what appears to be \nthe Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the constitutional \nauthority of the Senate as a check on the power of the President in the \narea of lifetime appointments to our federal courts. I fear, Mr. \nPresident, that the Republican majority's efforts to re-write Senate \nhistory in order to rubber-stamp this White House's federal judicial \nnominees will cause long-term damage to this institution, to our \ncourts, to our constitutional form of government, to the rights and \nprotections of the American people and to generations to come. I have \nserved in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have never seen \nsuch stridency on the part of an executive administration or such \nwillingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition \nand upset\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\nthe balances embedded in our Constitution so as to expand presidential \npower.\n  In the time set aside by the Republican majority for this debate \ntoday, I welcome the opportunity to shed light on the fiction that \ncloture votes, extended debate, and discussion of the views of nominees \nare anything new or unprecedented. What I do find unprecedented is the \ndepths that the Republican majority and this White House are willing to \ngo to override the constitutional division of power over appointments \nand longstanding Senate practices and history. It strikes me that some \nRepublicans seem to think that they are writing on blank slate and that \nthey have been given a blank check to pack the courts. They show a \ndisturbing penchant for reading our Constitution in isolation from its \nhistory and the practices that have endured for two centuries, in order \nto suit their purposes of the moment.\n\n  A few years ago, when Republicans were in the Senate minority and a \ndemocratically elected Democratic President was in the White House, \ncolumnist George Will, for example, had no complaint about a super-\nmajority of 60 votes being needed to get an up or down vote on \nlegislation or nominations proposed by the President. In fact, \nreflecting Republican sentiment at the time, what he said in his \ndefense of the Republican filibuster of President Clinton's proposals, \nwas the following:\n\n       The Senate is not obligated to jettison one of its defining \n     characteristics, permissiveness regarding extended debate, in \n     order to pander to the perception that the presidency is the \n     sun about which all else in American government--even \n     American life--orbits.\n\n  This is from the Washington Post on April 25, 1993. It apparently did \nnot trouble him or other Republicans when they were in the Senate \nminority that the Constitution expressly requires more than a simple \nmajority for only a few matters. In fact, Mr. Will wrote: ``Democracy \nis trivialized when reduced to simple majoritarianism--government by \nadding machine. A mature, nuanced democracy makes provision for \nrespecting not mere numbers but also intensity of feeling.''\n  Of course, that was in 1993 and President Clinton's proposals and a \nDemocratic Senate majority were being contested by Republican \nfilibusters. What is different a mere 10 years later? Just that the \nparties have switched roles and this year Democrats are in the Senate \nminority and a Republican occupies the White House. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a recent article by Edward Lazarus that critiques Mr. \nWill's new position be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 25, 1993]\n\nGeorge Will, Miguel Estrada, and the Cloture Vote: How Will's Flip-Flop \n of Positions Illustrates the Increasing Collapse of the Politics/Law \n                              Distinction\n\n                           By Edward Lazarus\n\n       The flurry over Miguel Estrada's controversial nomination \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     continues on. So does the Senate Democrats' filibuster to \n     stop Estrada from being confirmed.\n       Meanwhile, a rarely-invoked Senate Rule on the cloture vote \n     has once again become a hot political football. Senate Rule \n     XXII requires 60 votes of the Senate's 100 to stop debate, \n     and break a filibuster.\n       Rule XXII's constitutionality is debated. Some believe that \n     votes must be by a simple majority of 51, not a supermajority \n     of 60, except in the limited cases in which the Constitution \n     imposes a different rule.\n       Attorney Lloyd Cutler has put the argument as follows: \n     ``The text of the Constitution plainly implies that each \n     house must take all its decisions by majority vote, except in \n     the five expressly enumerated cases where the text itself \n     requires a two-thirds vote: the Senate's advice and consent \n     to a treaty, the Senate's guilty verdict on impeachments, \n     either house expelling a member, both houses overriding a \n     presidential veto and both houses proposing a constitutional \n     amendment.''\n       It's an interesting argument. Even more interesting is that \n     the high priest of conservative columnists, George F. Will, \n     has, over time, taken both sides of it--first attacking it, \n     and now recently embracing it.\n       What spurred Will's change of mind? Sadly, it seems to be \n     purely politics. That would be fine if it were an issue of \n     policy, and politics. But it's not: It's an issue of \n     constitutional law, which is supposed to have an answer \n     deriving from history and precedent--an answer that \n     transcends politics.\n\n\n              George Will's Flip-Flop on the Cloture Vote\n\n       Will, a historian of sorts, frequently opines on legal and \n     constitutional issues. He generally holds himself out, as \n     most commentators do, as an honest broker of ideas, albeit a \n     broker with a distinct perspective.\n       In that role, Will has twice addressed the issue of Rule \n     XXII.\n       The first time was in 1993. At the time, Democratic \n     stalwarts, such as Cutler, were challenging Rule XXII. They \n     feared that, despite Democratic majorities in both the House \n     and Senate, Republicans would use the filibuster to frustrate \n     the agenda of the new Democratic president, Bill Clinton.\n       At the time, Will took Cutler to task for his doubts about \n     the constitutionality of Rule XXII. He complained that taking \n     issue with the Rule was ``institutional tinkering'' that \n     ``would facilitate the essence of the liberal agenda--more \n     uninhibited government.'' And he took direct aim at Cutler's \n     argument about the Rule.\n       Specifically, Will argued that the five instances of \n     supermajority votes listed in the Constitution were the only \n     time supermajority votes could be used for externally-\n     oriented legislation--``the disposition by each house of \n     business that has consequences beyond each house, such as \n     passing legislation or confirming executive or judicial \n     nominees.'' However, ``procedural rules internal to each \n     house,'' according to Will, ``are another matter.'' And in \n     that sphere, a supermajority cloture vote was fine.\n       Indeed, Will pointed out, history supports this view: \n     ``[T]he generation that wrote and ratified the Constitution--\n     the generation whose actions are considered particularly \n     illuminating concerning the meaning and spirit of the \n     Constitution--set the Senate's permissive tradition regarding \n     extended debate. There was something very like a filibuster \n     in the First Congress.''\n       Fair enough. Until one reads the column Will published last \n     week in The Washington Post regarding the Estrada nomination. \n     Here's what Will has to say now (with emphases added):\n       ``The president, preoccupied with regime change elsewhere, \n     will occupy a substantially diminished presidency unless he \n     defeats the current attempt to alter the constitutional \n     regime here. If at least 41 Senate Democrats succeed in \n     blocking a vote on the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the Constitution \n     effectively will be amended.''\n       If Senate rules, exploited by an anti-constitutional \n     minority, are allowed to trump the Constitution's text and \n     two centuries of practice, the Senate's power to consent to \n     judicial nominations will have become a Senate right to \n     require a 60-vote supermajority for confirmations. By thus \n     nullifying the president's power to shape the judiciary, \n     the Democratic Party will wield a presidential power \n     without having won a presidential election.\n       Wait a second. So Will now agrees with Cutler? And not only \n     that, he reads both the Constitution's text and ``two \n     centuries of practice'' relating to filibusters entirely \n     differently than he once did? What's prompted his change of \n     mind? And doesn't he owe Cutler an apology?\n       Obviously, conscientious commentators do change their views \n     when they re-examine them and find them in error. I am no fan \n     of a ``foolish consistency'' in such matters. But this kind \n     of change of mind--without explanation or apology--is quite \n     troubling.\n       Also troubling is the fact that Will's close analysis of \n     the Constitution and the First Congress's proceedings, so \n     important to him in 1993, is entirely missing here. And his \n     venom--once directed at Cutler--now draws on Cutler (without \n     attribution) instead. Only one conclusion seems possible: \n     This is an exquisitely brazen example of intellectual flip-\n     floppery that has nothing to do with law or the Constitution, \n     or American history, and everything to do with conservative \n     politics.\n\n\n          what the flip-flop means for will, and for all of us\n\n       The flip-flop is an embarrassment to Will and his \n     reputation. Sadly, it may also be more than that as well. I \n     fear that Will's adventure in hypocrisy is emblematic of what \n     may well be the worst truth in American political discourse: \n     nothing is shameful anymore. And no sense of integrity--an \n     integrity that transcends politics--remains.\n       It seems especially ironic (or perhaps appropriate) that \n     Will should come to represent this problem. After all, he--\n     and commentators of his ilk--have spent the last decade or \n     two bemoaning the rise of moral relativism in our society. \n     They mourn the death of ``shaming'' as an instrument of \n     behavior modification for politicians and citizens alike.\n       In the culture wars, Will and others like him have been the \n     army defending such concepts as objective truth and personal \n     responsibility. They have been the ones saying there is a \n     right thing to do, independent of politics, independent of \n     the times. They have carried the banner of integrity, in \n     short. Now it's plain, though, that Will has torn up that \n     banner even while pretending to uphold it.\n       I confess that I'm a sucker. I believe in these kinds of \n     things--integrity, truth, certain absolute moral values, a \n     right thing to do. Maybe it's all that Plato I read in \n     college. I've always believed there is such a\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\n     thing as a ``true'' answer (even if we cannot know it with \n     certainty), and that there are ways of discerning better \n     from worse, whether in argument or music or literature.\n       Nowhere did these beliefs seem to be more important than in \n     the field of law. Courts wield great power to shape the \n     social order and control the destiny of individuals. Their \n     integrity rests ultimately on the belief that their decisions \n     are not merely just that--exercises of power--but are, in \n     addition, principled attempts to discern the proper meaning \n     of the law. And the idea that there is a ``proper meaning'' \n     in the first place, in turn presumes a universe that \n     recognizes a genuine ability to choose better arguments over \n     weaker ones, regardless of what one thinks of the results the \n     arguments lead us to.\n       In according with these principles, I've critiqued legal \n     reasoning even when I agree with its result, if I've felt the \n     reasoning itself was flawed. For instance, though I support \n     abortion rights, I've expressed strong qualms about Roe.\n       Now, however, it seems integrity is being radically \n     redefined, as pure loyalty--fealty to the party, the \n     political beliefs, the results that one prefers. Lying in the \n     service of a cause has become, in some circles, honorable to \n     do.\n\n\n    changing times have ushered in a norm of intellectual dishonesty\n\n       Intellectual dishonesty is pure poison to the enterprise of \n     the law. Yet countless examples show intellectual dishonesty \n     has now become a routine, expected part of American \n     discourse. The most obvious half-truths and hypocrisies are \n     greeted with shrugged shoulders and a grunt of ``what did you \n     expect?''\n       These dishonesties that we have come to accept too easily \n     range from the non-reasoning of Bush v. Gore, to the logic-\n     defying economic rationale for more tax cuts, to the ever-\n     shifting justification of war in Iraq. And they extend to \n     just about every other significant issue of law and policy \n     that affects American life.\n       Why does this happen? It cannot be because all the people \n     perpetrating these intellectual frauds are bad people. It's \n     been my experience (limited, I admit) that most people who go \n     into government or devote themselves to a life of public \n     policymaking or intellectualism, do so for the best of \n     reasons--because they want to help shape the world for the \n     better.\n       Then why? I found a partial answer watching, last night, an \n     old clip of Daniel Ellsberg being interviewed by Walter \n     Cronkite, in the wake of Ellsberg's controversial release of \n     the Pentagon Papers. To paraphrase, Ellsberg contended that \n     our society had become so divided, with each side so bent on \n     perpetuating itself in power, that government and the world \n     around it imposed a sustained and terrible pressure on good \n     people to make a choice. They could either leave that world \n     or, far worse, give up the search for truth, in exchange for \n     the search for victory.\n       That was more than 30 years ago. Has anything much changed?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As Mr. Will noted in 1993, one of the key attributes of \nthe Senate is the venerable tradition of extended debate and \ndeliberations. In fact, not until 1917 was there even a provision in \nthe Senate rules to allow for cloture, a procedure by which the Senate \nacts to cut off debate. The Senate first adopted the cloture rule in \n1917. At that time, cloture was limited to and could only be sought on \nlegislative matters. The cloture rule was extended in 1949 to include \nmeasures and matters, which includes judicial nominations. Thus, prior \nto 1949, there was no mechanism to limit debate on nominations, and in \nfact, disputes over nominations--to the few hundred seats in the \nfederal judiciary--were handled and resolved by Senators behind closed \ndoors.\n  Earlier in this debate today, one Senator indicated that all prior \nSupreme Court nominees had been given votes. I will just name a few \njudicial nominees who were not acted upon by the Senate earlier in \nAmerican history: John M. Read, nominated by President Tyler on \nFebruary 7, 1845; Edward Bradford, nominated by President Fillmore on \nAugust 16, 1852; Henry Stanbery, nominated by President Andrew Johnson \non April 16, 1866; and Stanley Mathews, nominated by President Hayes on \nJanuary 26, 1881. The facts are that many judicial or executive \nnominations were defeated in the Senate by inaction or by the threat of \na filibuster over the years.\n  Republicans resurrected and amplified those tactics in the years \n1995-2001 to defeat more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees and to delay for years the confirmation of many others. In \n1999, only 22 percent of President Clinton's circuit court nominees \nwere confirmed. That was the first time in recent memory that a circuit \ncourt nominee was substantially more likely not to be confirmed than to \nbe confirmed. For all of 1999 and 2000, only 44 percent of President \nClinton's circuit court nominees were confirmed, making it more likely \nthan not that his circuit court nominees would not be confirmed, unlike \nthe nominees of the prior three Presidents, even during their last \nyears in office. That is why vacancies on the circuit courts more than \ndoubled from 16 in 1995 to 33 when the Senate reorganized in the summer \nof 2001. That is why this President has had so many circuit vacancies \nto fill, and he has shown little bipartisanship in his choices. In \nfact, rather than uniting people with his choices for lifetime \nappointments, he has sent forward a slate of circuit court nominees \nthat has generated tremendous controversy and division.\n  In essence, until Republicans had a Republican President, Republicans \ninterpreted the Advice and Consent Clause of the Constitution to allow \na handful of anonymous Republican Senators to prevent an ``up or down'' \nvote by the full Senate on scores of qualified and moderate, mainstream \njudicial nominees of President Clinton. Now, when Democratic Senators \nhave expressed genuine concerns about the lack of information regarding \nMr. Estrada and have made a well-founded request to see his writings as \na public servant, Republicans claim it is wrong and unconstitutional \nfor Senators to act in accordance with Senate rules and tradition and \ntheir longstanding role as a check and balance on the President's \nappointment power.\n  The disregard for rules and traditions is especially unfortunate when \nwhat is at stake in judicial nominations are lifetime appointment for \njudges who will have the power to change how the Constitution is \ninterpreted and whether civil rights, environmental protections, \nprivacy and our fundamental freedoms will be upheld. With respect to \nthe Estrada nomination, what is at stake is a seat on the second \nhighest court in the country and the swing vote on that important \ncourt.\n\n  Most of the decisions issued by the D.C. Circuit in the nearly 1,400 \nappeals filed per year are final because the Supreme Court now takes \nfewer than 100 cases from all over the country each year. This court \nhas special jurisdiction over cases involving the rights of working \nAmericans as well as the right to a cleaner environment. This is a \ncourt where federal regulations will be upheld or overturned, where \nprivacy rights will either be retained or lost, and where thousands of \nindividuals will have their final appeal in matters that affect their \nfinancial future, their health, their lives and their liberty.\n  This is a court that has vacant seats due to anonymous Republicans \nblocking the last two nominees to this court by a Democratic President. \nThose nominees had outstanding legal credentials and qualifications but \nduring President Clinton's last term, the Republican-controlled Senate \nwould not proceed to an up or down vote on either of them.\n  The word ``filibuster'' derives from the Dutch word for piracy, or \ntaking property that does not belong to you. Under that ordinary \ndefinition, it would be accurate to say that at least two of the \nvacancies on the D.C. Circuit, for which Republicans blocked qualified \nnominees, were filibustered, as well. Republicans, who exploited every \nprocedural rule and practice to block scores of Clinton nominees \nanonymously from ever receiving an up or down vote, now want to change \nthe rules midstream, to their partisan advantage, again so that all of \ntheir nominees get votes as quickly as possible. The whole reason this \nPresident has so many circuit vacancies to fill is because this was the \nbooty of their piracy, their filibustering of judicial seats that arose \nduring the Clinton Administration while they prevented votes on that \nPresident's qualified nominees.\n  For example, a Mexican-American circuit court nominee of President \nClinton, Judge Richard Paez, was forced to wait more than 1,500 days to \nbe confirmed. Even after the Republican filibuster was broken by a \ncloture vote to end debate, many Republicans joined an unsuccessful \nmotion to indefinitely postpone his nomination. None of the more than \n30 Republicans who voted against cloture in connection with that \nnomination or who voted in favor of Senator Sessions unprecedented \nmotion ``to indefinitely postpone'' the vote on Judge Paez's \nnomination, which had been pending for more than 1,500 days, should be\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nheard to complain if Democratic Senators seek more information about \nthis President's nominees before proceeding to a vote for a lifetime \nappointment.\n  Senator Bob Smith, a straight talker from New Hampshire, outlined the \nSenate's history of filibusters of judicial nominees and said:\n\n       Don't pontificate on the floor and tell me that somehow I \n     am violating the Constitution . . . by blocking a judge or \n     filibustering a judge that I don't think deserves to be on \n     the court. That is my responsibility. That is my advise-and-\n     consent role, and I intend to exercise it.\n\n  Thus, the Republicans' claim that Democrats are taking \n``unprecedented'' action regarding the circuit court nomination of Mr. \nEstrada--much like the bogus White House claim that our request for Mr. \nEstrada's work while paid by taxpayers was ``unprecedented''--is simply \nuntrue. Republicans' desire to rewrite their own history is wrong. They \nshould come clean and tell the truth to the American people about their \npast practices on nominations. They cannot change the plain facts to \nfit their current argument and purposes.\n\n  Back in 2000, Senator Hatch candidly admitted after cloture was \ninvoked on the Paez nomination and Senator Sessions made his \nunprecedented motion to indefinitely postpone any vote on that judicial \nnomination that Judge Paez's nomination had been filibustered. He said:\n\n       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on a nomination. A parliamentary \n     ruling to this effect means that, after today, our cloture \n     rule is further weakened.\n\n  Republicans should not have come to the floor and told the American \npeople over the last month that Democratic Senators had done something \nunprecedented in debating and opposing the Estrada nomination. They \nthemselves did it quite recently and have done it repeatedly. Let us be \nhonest about this and straight with the American people. Given the time \nallotted for today's debate, I cannot discuss them all but I will \ninclude in the record some of the other examples of Republican \nfilibusters of presidential nominations from the nomination of Justice \nAbe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court \nthrough the nominations of Stephen G. Breyer, now Justice Breyer, to \nthe First Circuit; Rosemary Barkett to the 11th Circuit; H. Lee Sarokin \nto the 3rd Circuit; and Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez to the 9th \nCircuit.\n  Even more frequent during the years from 1995 through 2001, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate majority, were Republican efforts to \ndefeat President Clinton's judicial nominees through inaction and \nanonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be held \naccountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were \nnot acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton first \nnominated them, Republicans eventually defeated more than 50 judicial \nnominees without a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing \nto proceed with hearings and Committee votes due to the anonymous acts \nof one or more Republicans.\n  Beyond the question of judicial nominees, Republicans also \nfilibustered President Clinton's nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to \nbecome Surgeon General of the United States. This was an Executive \nBranch nominee that Republicans filibustered successfully in spite of \ntwo cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David Satcher's subsequent nomination \nalso required cloture but he was successfully confirmed.\n  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans \nincluded Walter Dellinger, whose name has been invoked with approval by \nRepublicans during the debate on the Estrada nomination. Mr. Dellinger \nwas nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel and two cloture petitions were required to be filed and both \nwere rejected by Republicans. In this case we were able finally to \nobtain a confirmation vote after significant efforts and Mr. Dellinger \nwas confirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He was never \nallowed to be a confirmed Solicitor General because Republicans had \nmade clear their opposition to him.\n  In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to State Department \nnominations and even the nomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the \nU.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in cloture petitions. In 1994, Sam \nBrown was nominated to be an Ambassador. After three cloture petitions \nwere filed, his nomination was returned to President Clinton without \nSenate action. This was another successful filibuster by Republicans, \nand this was to a short-term appointment to serve in the Executive \nBranch, not to a lifetime appointment. Also in 1994, Derek Shearer was \nnominated to be an Ambassador and it took two cloture petitions to get \nto a vote before he was confirmed. In 1994, Ricki Tigert was nominated \nto chair the FDIC and it took two cloture petitions to get to a vote \nand confirmation of that executive nomination.\n  In addition, some remember Republican unwillingness to allow a Senate \nvote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to serve as the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of \nJustice. He told the Judiciary Committee that he would follow the law \nand enforce the law. He was the choice of the President to serve in \nthat President's administration, but Republicans would not accord him \nan up or down vote before the United States Senate.\n  Republicans now claim that extended debate on this nomination is \nsomehow unprecedented. I would point out that we have had a lot of \nextended debates and cloture votes over the last decade. I lost count \nof the number of times we had to vote on cloture when President Clinton \nwas making nominations. This chart shows some of the Republican \nfilibusters of nominations, leaving out their filibusters of \nlegislation.\n  So when Republican Senators now talk about the Senate Executive \nCalendar and presidential nominees, it must be remembered that they \nrecently filibustered several nominees and they succeeded in blocking \nmany nominees by cloture votes and through anonymous holds. Here is a \nmore complete list of recent Republican filibusters:\n\n                   REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTERS OF NOMINEES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Cloture\n  Year                   Nominee and position                  petitions\n                                                                 filed\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  1968   Abe Fortas, Supreme Court...........................         *1\n  1980   William Lubbers, NLRB...............................          3\n  1980   Don Zimmerman, NLRB.................................          3\n  1980   Stephen Breyer, 1st Circuit.........................          2\n  1987   Melissa Wells, Ambassador...........................          1\n  1987   William Verity, Commerce............................          1\n  1993   Walter Dellinger, Justice...........................          2\n  1993   Five State Department Nominees......................          2\n  1993   Janet Napolitano, Justice...........................          1\n  1994   Larry Lawrence, Ambassador..........................          1\n  1994   Rosemary Barkett, 11th Circuit......................          1\n  1994   Sam Brown, Ambassador...............................         *3\n  1994   Derek Shearer, Ambassador...........................          2\n  1994   Ricki Tigert, FDIC..................................          2\n  1994   H.

It appears the Senate \nRepublican majority, at the direction of the White House, chose to \nextend this debate because political operatives hope to use it to \nfalsely paint those who were not to be steamrollered as somehow anti-\nHispanic. The Republican's approach of crass partisanship regarding \nthis nomination----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nThese were not times when Republicans were in charge, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Once I finish my speech I will be glad to yield to \nquestions. I control the floor. Once I have finished my speech I will \nbe glad to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will he yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just want to make sure the Record is correct because \nthe Senator said Republicans were in charge at that time.\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Vermont has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just want to make sure the Record is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The partisanship regarding this nominee disregards the \nlegitimate concerns raised by many Senators. It is wrong because \ndistinguished Latino leaders, who have spent their lives seeking \njustice and greater representation of Hispanic lawyers as judges, have \nbeen attacked by Republicans for showing courage and honesty in their \njudgment that this nomination is wanting. Joining the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, which previously wrote to the Senate \ndisassociating itself with Republican attacks on Democratic Senators, \nyesterday the National Council of La Raza issued a statement condemning \nthe treatment of Congressional Hispanic Caucus by Republicans. The NCLR \nstatement notes how ``deeply offended'' it is by Mr. Estrada's \nsupporters calling Congressional Hispanic Caucus members \n``tyrannical,'' ``racist,'' and ``anti-Latino''.\n  Moreover, the Republican approach and the President's approach have \nbeen to divide the Senate, to divide the American people--may I have \norder, Mr. President? May I have order?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor. He may \nor may not yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is wrong. The President campaigned on a platform of \nuniting, not dividing. It is wrong because our country needs us to \nbuild consensus and we should work together especially in these most \nchallenging times. These are the years of Republican filibusters of \njudicial or executive branch nominees: 1968, 1980, 1980, 1980, 1987, \n1987, 1993, 1993, 1993, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1995, 1998, \n2000, 2000.\n  For Republicans to claim that they have never filibustered a circuit \ncourt nominee is just incorrect. For them to claim that they have never \n``successfully'' filibustered a lifetime or short-term appointee's \nnomination is also incorrect. The debate on Mr. Estrada's nomination is \nimportant.\n  I think in the debate on this nomination, this is not a nomination \nthat unites rather than divides. Certainly within the Hispanic \ncommunity itself, highly respected members of the Hispanic community \noppose Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be glad to. Let me finish these comments, and then \nI will yield on the time of the Senator from Utah.\n  In this case, it appears to me that the White House really wants to \nplay politics. They could end this debate today if they wanted to. They \ncan make these papers available so that Miguel Estrada can be asked \nquestions based on them. Miguel Estrada has said under oath that he is \nperfectly willing to answer the questions, but the White House told him \nhe is not allowed to. Once they are willing to, let us have a hearing \nand then let us go forward on questions based on what is in there.\n  The administration, however, seems to believe that somehow the Senate \nis their own unit to be used for whatever type of politicking they \nwant. They renominated Judge Charles Pickering despite his ethical \nlapses. They renominated Justice Priscilla Owen despite her record as a \nconservative activist judge and after being rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Both of these nominees were rejected by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee after fair hearings and open debate last year. Sending these \nrenominations to the Senate is unprecedented. No judicial nominee who \nhas been voted down in Committee has ever been renominated to the same \nposition by the President. The White House in tandem with the new \nRepublican majority in the Senate is choosing these battles over \nnominations purposefully. Dividing rather than uniting has become their \nmodus operandi.\n  Among the consequences of this partisan strategy is that for the last \nmonth, the Senate has been denied by the Republican leadership \nmeaningful debate on the situation in Iraq. I commend Senator Byrd, \nSenator Kennedy and the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nhave nonetheless sought to have the Senate fulfill its constitutional \nrole as a forum for debate and careful consideration of our nation's \nforeign policy in accordance with the shared power provided in the \nConstitution. The decision by the Republican Senate majority to focus \non controversial nominations rather than the international situation or \nthe economy says much about their mistaken priorities. The Republican \nmajority sets the agenda and they schedule the debate, just as they \nhave here this morning.\n  Among the consequences of this partisan strategy, of course, what has \nhappened by the Republican scheduling of debate on this nomination is \nwe don't have sufficient time to debate the Iraq situation. We don't \ntalk about war in Iraq even though there is great division in this \ncountry. We don't talk about an administration which inherited the \nlargest surplus any administration has ever inherited. The Clinton \nadministration left the largest budget surplus to this administration \nthan any administration ever had, and now Republicans are creating the \nlargest deficit in history. The Clinton administration created a \nmillion new jobs a year. This administration is losing a million jobs a \nyear. But if the Republican controlled Senate continues to schedule \ndebate on Miguel Estrada, they will not have to talk about that.\n\n  That kind of tells me why they are doing this. Here is the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, and we don't have a debate on the war \nin Iraq. The Canadian Parliament does. The British Parliament does. The \nU.S. Senate does not.\n  I would be willing to yield to the Senator from Utah on his time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will ask the question on my time. Will the Senator \nanswer on his time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the time of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask the question on my time. I would like the \nanswer on the Senator's time.\n  As to the number of circuit court of appeals judges, No. 1, who was \nin charge of the Senate when Abe Fortas was defeated by a filibuster? \nNo. 2, were any of those circuit court nominees defeated by filibuster, \nor were they all confirmed?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will refer to this in my statement. All \nof these were Republican filibusters and a few times a few Democrats \njoined with the Republicans in their efforts to block these nominees. \nSome of the Republican filibusters were successful, and some were not, \nbut they all were filibusters and they all involved cloture petitions. \nA filibuster is still a filibuster even if it does not succeed in \nblocking the nominee forever. The Republican filibuster of Judge Paez's \ncircuit court nomination proves that.\n  I fear that what the Republican majority is trying to do is rewrite \nSenate history in order to rubberstamp the Federal judicial nominees of \nthis White House and that this will cause long-term damage to the \nSenate and the courts.\n  I have served in the Senate for 29 years. I have never seen a \nPresident so eager to divide rather than unite. I have never seen such \nstridency on the part of an executive administration or such \nwillingness as this Senate majority's to cast aside tradition, the \nrules, and those things that give us a check and balance. It is \nunfortunate because the country expects more of us.\n  We see the most deliberative body on Earth--the Senate--not even \ndebating the war we are about to go to in a matter of days, if the news \naccounts are correct, and we are talking about this because this is the \nRepublican agenda, packing the courts.\n  In the debate Republicans have insisted upon, a number of fictions \nhave been told. The cloture votes, the extended debate, and the \ndiscussion of the views of nominees is not anything new or \nunprecedented. What is going on here is unprecedented--with the \nRepublican blank slate, no past history, and they think they can do \nwhatever they want to do.\n  During the time when President Clinton was here and the Republicans \nwere in charge, there were scores of nominees on which we didn't even \nhave a vote. We had anonymous holds by Republicans. We didn't have up-\nor-down votes. Now, when we express genuine concern, now, when we say \nwhy can't Mr. Estrada show us the writings that he has said under sworn \ntestimony he is willing to show us but the White House blocks him from \nshowing us, somehow we are blocking. Maybe it appears that the \nRepublicans like the\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\nrules when they are using them, but they don't like the rules when we \nare using them.\n\n  Even though Republicans blocked some Hispanic nominees of President \nClinton and scores of others, I must add that the debate on the \nnomination of Mr. Estrada is not part of any retaliation. We have \ngenuine concerns about his nomination, his answers and the documents we \nhave requested to better understand his unvarnished views. In addition, \nwe worked hard to move quickly on the vast majority of this President's \njudicial nominations, to demonstrate our fairness and bipartisanship. \nIn just 17 months, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, even though Republicans averaged only 38 per \nyear. We more than doubled the rate of confirmation. We also held \nhearings for 20 circuit court nominees and confirmed 17 of them in just \n17 months, following on the heels of a Republican average of just 7 \ncircuit nominees confirmed per year, and one year in which they allowed \nzero circuit court nominees to be confirmed. So, we worked very hard to \nreturn the nomination process to a more consistent and steady pace, \nafter the obstruction in prior years. So far this year, 5 judicial \nnominees of this President have already been confirmed.\n  The confirmation of 100 judges nominated by this President was not \nenough for Republicans to be satisfied. They want every one of this \nPresident's judicial nominees to be confirmed no matter their ethical \nrecord or record of activism or their controversy. They want every \njudicial nominee on the courts immediately despite the serious concerns \nraised by Senators and citizens alike. They want to pack the court with \nmany divisive judicial nominees who will tilt the balance of the courts \nfor decades to come.\n  The fact is, it appears to me, the decision is being made not here in \nthe Senate but by a political arm of the White House.\n  They have made these controversial appointments despite the recent \nhistory of the moderate nominees to these circuits of President Clinton \nwho were blocked. If we use the ordinary definition of filibuster, we \ncould say that at least two of the vacancies on the District of \nColumbia Circuit were filibustered despite the well-qualified nominees \nsent up by President Clinton. They were never allowed to be voted on. \nThey didn't make it to the floor. Republicans blocked nominees in a far \neasier way. They didn't even bring them up. They were nonpersons--\nalmost like the old Soviet Union. When you looked at the picture of the \nPolitburo, you would find out the next year when the picture was shown \nthey were X'd out.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How many of these nominees were never brought up even \nfor debate? Does my colleague think it is even worse than trying to \nfigure out what his views are than never having the debate on the floor \nand never bringing them up and never giving them a chance?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Republicans wouldn't allow over 50 of President \nClinton's nominees to ever have a hearing or ever have a vote. Many of \nthese individuals were nominated years earlier. We never got to know \nwhat the reasoning behind the anonymous Republican holds was. Even when \nwe finally did, for example, a Mexican-American circuit court nominee \nof President Clinton, Judge Richard Paez, was forced to wait more than \n1,500 days to be confirmed. And even then, we had to vote in favor of \ncloture to get the up or down vote on his nomination. Fifteen \nRepublicans voted against cloture--after he waited more than 20 months \nfor a floor vote during the four-plus years he was pending before the \nSenate. In fact, one Republican Senator moved to indefinitely postpone \nJudge Paez's nomination, even though he had waited for 1,500 days, and \n31 Republicans voted in favor of indefinitely postponing that \nnomination in March of 2000. If they had had the votes they never would \nhave let him be confirmed. Not one Republican came to the floor during \nthe time Judge Paez was waiting for a vote and suggested that the \nRepublican filibuster during any of those 1,500 days was \nunconstitutional or anti-majoritarian.\n\n  In fact, today made me think of this when we have the two \ndistinguished Presiding Officers, the distinguished Vice President and \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama. The distinguished Senator from \nAlabama actually objected to the Vice President at that time being in \nthe chair in the closing moments of the debate on Judge Paez's \nnomination because the executive branch had nominated him and that was \na conflict of interest in his view. Of course, Republicans did not make \na similar motion today when it was a Republican Vice President in the \nchair during a debate about a Republican nominee.\n  Let us just be a little bit honest about what is going on here. This \nis sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander. And yet this \nAdministration and many Republicans have not acknowledged our effort to \nturn the other cheek and confirm 100 of this President's judicial \nnominees in the prior 17 months of Democratic leadership of the Senate. \nMany of those nominations were to seats that were blocked from being \nfilled during the prior period of Republican control of the Senate.\n  It cannot be that only the rules Republicans like at the times that \nthey like them are the rules that are followed in the Senate, but more \nand more that seems to be what the Republican majority is demanding. \nThey should not pretend the rules no longer apply simply because the \nRepublican majority finds them inconvenient, but that is happening more \nand more in the Senate. Regrettably, it has occurred recently in \nconnection with judicial nominees before the Judiciary Committee, when \nthe Republicans insisted on breaching Rule IV, a longstanding rule of \nour Committee that allows for extended debate, as well.\n  I would like to address a most troubling development that \ndemonstrates how Republicans are violating longstanding Senate rules to \nsuit themselves. Two weeks ago in a meeting of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the Chairman unilaterally declared the termination of debate \non two controversial circuit court nominations. Senator Daschle termed \nit deeply troubling and a ``reckless exercise of raw power by a \nChairman,'' and he is right. The Democratic Leader observed that the \nwork of this Senate has for over 200 years operated on the principle of \ncivil debate, which includes protection of the minority. When a \nChairman can on his own whim choose to ignore our rules that protect \nthe minority, not only is that protection lost, but so is an \nirreplaceable piece of our integrity and credibility.\n  The Democratic Leader noted that faithful adherence to rules is \nespecially important for the Senate and for its Judiciary Committee. He \nnoted ``how ironic that in the Judiciary Committee, a Committee which \npasses judgment on those who will interpret the rule of law,'' that it \nacted in conscious disregard of the rules that were established to \napply to its proceedings. If this is what those who pontificate about \n``strict construction'' mean by that term, it translates to winning by \nany means necessary. If this is how the judges of the judicial nominees \nact, how can we expect the nominees they support as ``strict \nconstructionists'' to behave any better? Given this action in \ndisrespect of the rights of the minority, how can we expect the \nJudiciary Committee to place individuals on the bench who respect the \nrule of law? In my 29 years in the Senate and in my reading of Senate \nhistory, I cannot think of so clear a violation of Senators' rights.\n\n  I am gravely concerned about this abuse of power and breach of our \nCommittee rules. When the Judiciary Committee cannot be counted upon to \nfollow its own rules for handling important lifetime appointments to \nthe federal judiciary, everyone should be concerned. In violation of \nthe rules that have governed that Committee's proceedings since 1979, \nthe Chairman chose to ignore our longstanding Committee Rules and \nshort-circuit Committee consideration of the nominations of John \nRoberts and Deborah Cook. Senator Daschle spoke to that matter that \nday. Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin have also \nspoken to the Senate about this breach of our rules as well as a number \nof other liberties that Republicans have been taking with the rules.\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n  This protection for the minority has been maintained by the Judiciary \nCommittee for the last 24 years under five different chairmen--Chairman \nKennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, under Chairman Hatch \npreviously and during my tenure as chairman.\n  Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee provides the minority with a right \nnot to have debate terminated and not to be forced to a vote without at \nleast one member of the minority agreeing. That rule and practice had \nuntil last month always been observed by the Committee, even as we have \ndealt with the most contentious social issues and nominations that come \nbefore the Senate.\n  Until last month, Democratic and Republican Chairmen had always acted \nto protect the rights of the Senate minority. The rule has been the \nCommittee's equivalent to the Senate's cloture rule. It had been \nhonored by all five Democratic and Republican chairman, including \nSenator Hatch, until last month.\n  It was rarely utilized but Rule IV set the ground rules and the \nbackdrop against which rank partisanship was required to give way, in \nthe best tradition of the Senate, to a measure of bipartisanship in \norder to make progress. That is the other important function of the \nrule.\n  Besides protecting minority rights, it enforced a certain level of \ncooperation between the majority and minority in order to get things \naccomplished. That, too, has been lost as the level of partisanship on \nthe Judiciary Committee and within the Senate reached a new low when \nRepublicans chose to override our governing rules of conduct and \nproceed as if the Senate Judiciary Committee were a minor committee of \nthe House of Representatives.\n\n  In fact, the only occasion I recall when Senator Hatch was previously \nfaced with implementing Committee Rule IV, he did implement it. In 1997 \nDemocrats on the Committee were seeking a Senate floor vote on \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. Then, \nSenator Hatch acknowledged: ``Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee rules \neffectively establishes a committee filibuster right . . . .'' In 1997, \nChairman Hatch acknowledged: ``Absent the consent of a minority member \nof the Committee, a matter may not be brought to a vote.'' In that \ncase, in 1997, Chairman Hatch followed the rules of the Committee.\n  Last month the bipartisan tradition and respect for the rights of the \nminority ended when Chairman Hatch decided to override the rule rather \nthan follow it. He did so expressly and intentionally, declaring: \n``[Y]ou have no right to continue a filibuster in this committee.'' He \ndecided, unilaterally, to declare the debate over even though all \nmembers of the minority were prepared to continue the debate and that \ndebate was, in fact, terminated prematurely. Senator Hatch completely \nreversed his own position from the Bill Lann Lee nomination and took a \nstep unprecedented in the history of the Committee.\n  In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch now contends \nthat he ``does not believe the Committee filibuster should be allowed \nand [he] thinks it is a good and healthy thing for the Committee to \nhave a rule that forces a vote.'' I ask that the exchange of letters \nbetween Senator Hatch and the Democratic Leader be included in the \nRecord.\n  Our Committee rule, while providing a mechanism for terminating \ndebate and reaching a vote on a matter, does so while providing a \nminimum of protection for the minority. It is even that minimum \nprotection that Chairman Hatch will no longer countenance. It is \nSenator Hatch who has ``turned Rule 4 on its head'' last month, after \n24 years of consistent interpretation and implementation by five \nchairmen. Never before his letter to Senator Daschle has anyone since \nthe adoption of the rule in 1979 ever suggested that its purpose was to \nbe narrowed and redirected to thwart what he called ``an obstreperous \nChairman who refuses to allow a vote on an item on the Agenda.'' After \nall, as Senator Hatch recognizes in his letter, it is the chairman's \nprerogative to set the agenda for the mark-up.\n  This revisionist reading of the rule is not justified by its adoption \nor its prior use and appears to be nothing other than an after the fact \nattempt to justify the obvious breaches of the longstanding Committee \nrule and practice that occurred last month. That novel interpretation \nwas not even articulated contemporaneously at the business meeting.\n  The Committee and the Senate have crossed a threshold of partisan \noverreaching to rubber-stamp judicial nominees that should never have \nbeen crossed. I urge the Republican leadership to recommit the \nnominations of Deborah Cook and John Roberts to the Judiciary Committee \nso that they can be considered in accordance with the Committee's \nrules. The action taken last month should be vitiated and order \nrestored to the Senate and to the Judiciary Committee. I urge the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate to rethink the misstep taken last \nmonth and urge the Chairman and the Committee to disavow the \nmisinterpretation and violations of Rule IV that occurred. Order and \ncomity need to be restored to the Judiciary Committee. An essential \nstep in that process is the restoration of minority rights under Rule \nIV and recognition of minority rights thereunder.\n\n  During the last four years of the Clinton Administration, his entire \nsecond term in office after being reelected by the American people, the \nJudiciary Committee refused to hold hearings and Committee votes on his \nqualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit and it refused to give hearings \nto three Sixth Circuit nominees in those four years as well as to \nnumerous other circuit nominees. Last month, in sharp contrast, this \nCommittee was required to proceed on two controversial nominations to \nthose circuit courts in contravention of the rules and practices of the \nCommittee. This can only be seen as part of a concerted and partisan \neffort to pack the courts and tilt them sharply out of balance.\n  In circumstances such as these, when the rights of the minority are \nbeing violated and Senate rules and longstanding practices are \nbreached, the minority is left with very few options and very little \nchoice in how it must proceed. This President has been the most \npolitically aggressive and the most unilateralist President I have seen \nin my 29 years in the Senate in his nominations. The Republican \nmajority is now choosing to abet his efforts at the expense of the \nSenate minority's rights and the constitutional role of the Senate. \nThat is most regrettable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes, 42 seconds; the other side has \n40 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to correct the Record. When all of those \ncircuit court judges were approved and confirmed, during the time when \nthe filibuster occurred on Fortas--the only filibuster which was really \na true filibuster--it was bipartisan and the Democrats controlled the \nSenate.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois earlier \nbrought up the distinguished late Judge Frank Johnson of Alabama and \ncommended him for doing the right thing. I wanted to remind the Senate \nof why Judge Johnson was able to do the right thing in desegregating \nthe south. It was because of John Minor Wisdom of Louisiana and John \nBrown of Texas and Elbert Tuttle of Georgia, who were Republican \nappellate court judges appointed by a Republican President named \nEisenhower at a time in the 1950s when the Democratic side of the \nSenate was using the filibuster to kill every important piece of civil \nrights legislation that was proposed in the Senate.\n  Senator Eastland of Mississippi, Senator Stennis of Mississippi would \nnever have approved Judge Wisdom's nomination or never have agreed with \nit if they had known that he and Judge Brown and Judge Tuttle would \norder the admission of James Meredith to the University of Mississippi.\n  So at a time when these distinguished former Democratic Senators were \nfilibustering every piece of civil rights legislation in the Senate, \nthey didn't even consider filibustering an appellate judge. That way \nJudge Wisdom, Judge Brown, and Judge Tuttle all were confirmed, and all \nordered James Meredith to be admitted.\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n  The relevance of the point of the Senator from Illinois is that \ntoday's Democrats, our friends on the other side, are going further \nthan the Democratic filibusters against the civil rights bills in the \n1950s. They are denying the President the traditional right to nominate \nand appoint judges. I don't know what happened in the past, but I know \nwhat this one Senator will do in the future. If there is a Democratic \nPresident and I am in this body, and if he nominates a judge, I will \nnever vote to deny a vote on that judge. If two or three more Senators \non both sides will do the same thing, we could go back to having more \nrespect for our judicial nominating process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, when the Founding Fathers wrote our \nConstitution, they said that judicial nominees would be confirmed by \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. Clearly that has always been a \nmajority vote. They specified in the Constitution when a larger vote \nwas necessary, such as treaties, which require two-thirds. In fact, \nwhen the 25th amendment to the Constitution was approved by the Senate \nin 1965, the Vice President of the United States, if appointed, would \nbe required to receive a majority vote of the House and Senate for \nconfirmation. So to say that a judge should require a supermajority is \nto amend the Constitution without going through the process.\n  That is what is happening today with Miguel Estrada. We are being \nrequired to muster 60 votes. We know we have 55 because we have had a \nvote now. We have had a cloture vote, and 55 people in the Senate \nbelieve Miguel Estrada should be confirmed for the Federal bench. And \nyet he is not confirmed because we have a higher threshold.\n  We can't amend the Constitution through a filibuster. We cannot take \naway the power of the President's appointments that are given in the \nConstitution with a filibuster. This is different from any other \nfilibuster. A filibuster on an issue is a legitimate tool. But a \nfilibuster on a judicial nominee takes the balance of power and skews \nit in favor of the legislature over the President's right to have his \npeople appointed to the Federal bench.\n  The Senate needs to look carefully at the precedent being set. It is \nnot right in a judicial nomination to hold a 60-vote threshold when the \nConstitution clearly says 51.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, many years ago when the Senate was the \nSupreme Court's upstairs neighbor in this building, a significant event \ntook place which provides us with a warning. A young Architect of the \nCapitol wanted to improve the sight lines in the Supreme Court Chamber \non the first floor. Calculating that one of the support pillars was \nunnecessary, he brought in a crew to remove it. Halfway through the \nproject, the ceiling fell in on the Supreme Court Chamber, which was \nalso the floor of the Senate above, destroying both Chambers for a \nperiod of time. The lesson is that when you tamper with one branch of \nGovernment, it can affect others in a way you cannot anticipate, and \nany attempt to tamper with the delicate balance of power must be met \nwith suspicion and repelled with conviction.\n  We are tampering with that balance when we now, through filibuster, \nrequire a supermajority to confirm a Federal court of appeals judge.\n  President Bush did not get all the popular votes or all the electoral \nvotes. The election was decided in an unprecedented manner. But when he \nwas sworn in, he received all the constitutional powers of the \nPresidency. His ability to be the Commander in Chief is not partial. \nHis ability to sign or veto legislation is not compromised. His ability \nto submit judicial nominees to this body for an up-or-down vote, \nsomething every President has exercised for over 200 years, is in no \nway limited.\n  Politics has its place, but not to the extent of stopping a vote on a \njudge at any and all costs. Let's discuss the merits of this nominee, \nhis qualifications, his judicial temperament, but then let us follow \nthe constitutional process we have followed for two centuries and vote \nyes or no on advice and consent for the President's nominee to the \ncourt of appeals.\n  For my colleagues who have concerns about Mr. Estrada's answers, or \nif you didn't like the things he didn't answer, vote against him. But \ngive him a vote. Let's follow the Constitution. Let's not change the \nconstitutional standing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I am now going to read a \nJune 18, 1998 statement of the Senator from Vermont involving Clarence \nSundram and other judges who were subject to discussion on that day:\n\n       If Senators are opposed to any judge, bring them up and \n     vote against them. But don't do an anonymous hold, which \n     diminishes the credibility and respect of the whole U.S. \n     Senate.\n       I have had judicial nominations by both Democrats and \n     Republican Presidents that I intended to oppose. But I fought \n     like mad to make sure they at least got a chance to be on the \n     floor for a vote.\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that I \n     would refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I \n     would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt \n     the Senate should do its duty.\n       If we don't like somebody the President nominates, vote him \n     or her down. But don't hold them to this anonymous \n     unconscionable limbo, because in doing that, the minority of \n     Senators really shame all Senators.\n\n  My statement is simply this: We are bearing witness to a \nconstitutional change. And having looked at the statement of Senator \nLeahy and his present conduct, we are bearing witness to a change on \nhis part. He was right in 1998 to oppose the filibusters. He is wrong \ntoday to engage in one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for being the first \nperson on his side of the aisle to actually read my whole statement. It \nis obvious I was speaking of a filibuster by an anonymous hold.\n  I welcome the Vice President to the Senate today in your capacity as \nPresident of the Senate. It is not often that we see the Vice President \nin the chair. With the meeting of the United Nations Security Council \ntoday and the OPEC meeting and the unsettled and threatening \ncircumstances in so many parts of the world, from the Middle East to \nthe Korean peninsula to Iran and Iraq, the Vice President has chosen to \nbe in the Senate this morning. I look forward to seeing him as well if \nthe Senate ever turns its attention to the disastrous economic \nsituation in this country and the loss of more than 2.5 million jobs in \nthe last two years and more than 300,000 last month. Senator Daschle \nand the Democratic leadership have sought for weeks to proceed to \ndebate on S. 414, the Economic Recovery Act of 2003, which includes the \nFirst Responders Partnership Grant Act, but the Senate Republican \nmajority has blocked debate and action. This morning, instead of \ndebating the international situation, the need to pass an economic \nstimulus package, the need for increased commitment to homeland \ndefense, legislation to provide a real prescription drug benefit for \nseniors or the other matters so deeply concerning Americans, we are \nreturning in some form to debate a nomination that we have debated for \nover a month and on which cloture was defeated last week.\n  I note that what has impeded a Senate vote on the Estrada nomination \nhas been the political game being played by the White House with this \nnomination as part of its effort to pack the Federal courts. The White \nHouse could have long ago solved this impasse by honoring the Senate's \nrole in the appointment process through providing the Senate access to \nMr. Estrada's legal work--just as past administrations have provided \nlegal memos in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork, William \nRehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott, and Ben Civiletti and this \nadministration did with a\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\nnominee to the EPA--and through instructing the nominee to answer \nquestions about his views--consistent with last year's Supreme Court \nopinion by Justice Scalia--and to stop pretending that he has no views. \nThe White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but \ntrying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these \nnominees when it evaluates them.\n  Instead, it appears that the Senate Republican majority, at the \ndirection of the White House, chose to extend this debate because its \npolitical operatives hope to use it to falsely paint those who will not \nbe steam rolled as somehow ``anti-Hispanic.'' The Republican's approach \nof crass partisanship regarding this nomination disregards the \nlegitimate concerns raised by many Senators as well as by respected, \nHispanic elected officials and Hispanic civil rights leaders. Moreover, \nthe Republican approach and the President's approach have been to \ndivide: to divide the Senate, to divide the American people and, on \nthis particular nomination, to divide Hispanics against each other.\n  That is wrong. It is wrong because the President campaigned on a \nplatform of uniting not dividing. It is wrong because our country needs \nus to build consensus and work together, especially in these most \nchallenging times. It is wrong because distinguished Latino leaders, \nwho have spent their lives seeking justice and greater representation \nof Hispanic lawyers as judges, have been attacked by Republicans for \nshowing courage and honesty in their judgment that this nomination is \nwanting. Joining the League of United Latin American Citizens, which \npreviously wrote to the Senate disassociating itself with Republican \nattacks on Democratic Senators, yesterday the National Council of La \nRaza issued a statement condemning the treatment of the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus by Republicans. The NCLR statement notes how ``deeply \noffended'' it is by Mr. Estrada's supporters calling Congressional \nHispanic Caucus members ``tyrannical,'' ``racist,'' and ``anti-\nLatino.''\n  This Administration has also shown disrespect for the concerns of \nSenators in renominating both Judge Charles Pickering, despite his \nethical lapses, and Justice Priscilla Owen, despite her record as a \nconservative ``activist'' judge, both of whom were rejected by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee after fair hearings and open debate last \nyear. Sending these re-nominations to the Senate is unprecedented. No \njudicial nominee who has been voted down has ever been re-nominated to \nthe same position by any President. The White House in conjunction with \nthe new Republican majority in the Senate is choosing these battles \nover nominations purposefully. Dividing rather than uniting has become \ntheir modus operandi.\n  Among the consequences of this partisan strategy is that for the last \nmonth, the Senate has been denied by the Republican leadership \nmeaningful debate on the situation in Iraq. I commend Senator Byrd, \nSenator Kennedy and the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nhave nonetheless sought to have the Senate fulfill its constitutional \nrole as a forum for debate and careful consideration of our Nation's \nforeign policy. The decision by the Republican Senate majority to focus \non controversial nominations rather than the international situation or \nthe economy says much about their mistaken priorities. The Republican \nmajority sets the agenda and they schedule the debate, just as they \nhave here this morning.\n  Many Democratic Senators have already spoken to the Constitution and \nthe Senate's proper role in the confirmation process. I recall, in \nparticular, statements by Senators Daschle, Reid, Bingaman, Boxer, \nClinton, Corzine, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Feinstein, \nHarkin, Johnson, Kennedy, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Mikulski, Sarbanes \nand Schumer, among many others.\n  What is disconcerting about the recent debate is what appears to be \nthe Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the constitutional \nauthority of the Senate as a check on the power of the President in the \narea of lifetime appointments to our Federal courts. I fear, Mr. \nPresident, that the Republican majority's efforts to re-write Senate \nhistory in order to rubber-stamp this White House's Federal judicial \nnominees will cause long-term damage to this institution, to our \ncourts, to our constitutional form of government, to the rights and \nprotections of the American people and to generations to come. I have \nserved in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have never seen \nsuch stridency on the part of an executive administration or such \nwillingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition \nand upset the balances embedded in our Constitution so as to expand \npresidential power.\n\n  In the time set aside by the Republican majority for this debate \ntoday, I am glad to have an opportunity to shed light on the fiction \nthat cloture votes, extended debate, and discussion of the views of \nnominees are anything new or unprecedented. What I do find \nunprecedented is the depths that the Republican majority and this White \nHouse are willing to go to override the constitutional division of \npower over appointments and longstanding Senate practices and history. \nIt strikes me that some Republicans seem to think that they are writing \non blank slate and that they have been given a blank check to pack the \ncourts. They show a disturbing penchant for reading our Constitution in \nisolation from its history and the practices that have endured for two \ncenturies to suit their purposes of the moment.\n  A few years ago, when Republicans were in the Senate minority and a \ndemocratically elected Democratic President was in the White House, \ncolumnist George Will, for example, had no complaint about a super-\nmajority or 60 votes being needed to get an up or down vote on \nlegislation or nominations proposed by the President. In fact, \nreflecting Republican sentiment at the time, what he said in his \ndefense of the Republican filibuster of President Clinton's proposals, \nwas the following:\n\n       The Senate is not obligated to jettison one of its defining \n     characteristics, permissiveness, regarding extended debate, \n     in order to pander to the perception that the presidency is \n     the sun about which all else in American government--even \n     American life--orbits. (Washington Post, April 25, 1993.)\n\n  It apparently did not trouble him or other Republicans when they were \nin the Senate minority that the Constitution expressly requires more \nthan a simple majority for only a few matters. In fact, Mr. Will wrote:\n\n       Democracy is trivialized when reduced to simple \n     majoritarianism--government by adding machine. A mature, \n     nuanced democracy makes provision for respecting not mere \n     numbers but also intensity of feeling.\n\n  Of course, that was in 1993 and President Clinton and a Democratic \nSenate majority were being contested by Republican filibusters. What is \ndifferent a mere 10 years later? Just that the parties have switched \nroles and this year Democrats are in the Senate minority and a \nRepublican occupies the White House. I ask unanimous consent that a \nrecent article by Edward Lazarus that critiques Mr. Will's new position \nbe included in the Record.\n  As George Will noted in 1993, one of the key attributes of the Senate \nis the venerable tradition of unlimited debate. In fact, not until 1917 \nwas there even a provision in the Senate rules to allow for cloture, a \nprocedure by which the Senate acts to cut off debate. The Senate first \nadopted the cloture rule in 1917. At that time, cloture was limited to \nand could only be sought on legislative matters. The cloture rule was \nextended in 1949 to nominations by amending it to include measures and \nmatters, which included judicial nominations. Thus, prior to 1949, \ndisputes over nominations--to the 100 seats in the Federal judiciary--\nwere handled and resolved by Senators behind closed doors and many \njudicial nominations were defeated in the Senate by inaction or the \nthreat of a filibuster. Republicans resurrected those tactics in the \nyears 1995-2001 to defeat more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees.\n  In essence, until they had a Republican President, Republicans \ninterpreted the Advice and Consent Clause of the Constitution to allow \na handful of anonymous Republican Senators to prevent an ``up or down'' \nvote by the full Senate on scores of qualified judicial nominees. Now, \nwhen Democratic Senators have expressed genuine concerns about the lack \nof information regarding Mr. Estrada and have made a well-founded \nrequest to see his\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nwritings, Republicans claim it is wrong and unconstitutional for \nSenators to act in accordance with Senate rules and tradition and their \nlongstanding role as a check and balance on the President's appointment \npower.\n  It cannot be that only the rules Republicans like at the times that \nthey like them are the rules that are followed in the Senate, but more \nand more that seems to be what the Republican majority is demanding. \nThey should not pretend the rules no longer apply simply because the \nRepublican majority finds them inconvenient, but that is happening more \nand more in the Senate. Regrettably, it has occurred recently in \nconnection with judicial nominees before the Judiciary Committee, when \nthe Republicans insisted on breaching Rule IV, a longstanding rule of \nour Committee that allows for extended debate, as well.\n\n  What is at stake in judicial nominations are lifetime appointment for \njudges who will have the power to change how the Constitution is \ninterpreted and whether civil rights, environmental protections, \nprivacy and our fundamental freedoms will be upheld. With respect to \nthe Estrada nomination, what is at stake is a seat on the second \nhighest court in the country and the swing vote on that important \ncourt.\n  Most of the decisions issued by the D.C. Circuit in the nearly 1,400 \nappeals filed per year are final because the Supreme Court now takes \nfewer than 100 cases from all over the country each year. This court \nhas special jurisdiction over cases involving the rights of working \nAmericans as well as the right to a cleaner environment. This is a \ncourt where Federal regulations will be upheld or overturned, where \nprivacy rights will either be retained or lost, and where thousands of \nindividuals will have their final appeal in matters that affect their \nfinancial future, their health, their lives and their liberty.\n  This is a court that has vacant seats due to anonymous Republicans \nblocking the last two nominees to this court by a Democratic President. \nThose nominees had outstanding legal credentials and qualifications but \nduring President Clinton's last term, the Republican-controlled Senate \nwould not proceed to an up or down vote on either of them.\n  The word ``filibuster'' derives from the Dutch word for piracy, or \ntaking property that does not belong to you. Under that ordinary \ndefinition, it would be accurate to say that at least two of the \nvacancies on the D.C. Circuit, for which Republicans blocked qualified \nnominees, were filibustered, as well. Republicans, who exploited every \nprocedural rule and practice to block scores of Clinton nominees \nanonymously from ever receiving an up or down vote, now want to change \nthe rules midstream, to their partisan advantage, again. The whole \nreason this President has so many circuit vacancies to fill is because \nthis was the booty of their piracy, their filibustering of judicial \nseats that arose during the Clinton Administration while they prevented \nvotes on that President's qualified nominees.\n  For example, a Mexican-American circuit court nominee of President \nClinton, Judge Richard Paez, was forced to wait more than 1,500 days to \nbe confirmed, and even after the Republican filibuster was broken by a \ncloture vote to end debate, many Republicans joined an unsuccessful \nmotion to indefinitely postpone his nomination. None of the more than \n30 Republicans who voted against cloture in connection with that \nnomination or who voted in favor of Senator Sessions' unprecedented \nmotion ``to indefinitely postpone'' the vote on Judge Paez's \nnomination, which had been pending for more than 1,500 days, should be \nheard to complain if Democratic Senators seek more information about \nnominations before proceeding to a vote for a lifetime appointment.\n  I also recall that during the closing moments of that debate Senator \nSessions objected that the Vice President of the United States was \npresiding over the Senate in his capacity as the President of the \nSenate. The Senator from Alabama objected that he should not be allowed \nto preside. I have not raised that objection to the Vice President \npresiding here today but have, instead, welcomed the Vice President. \nThis is further demonstration that Democrats have been more moderate \nand much more cooperative with this Administration than Republicans \nwere with the prior Democratic Administration.\n  I will include in my full statement for the Record the words of the \nRepublican Senators who filibustered President Clinton nominees. \nSenator Bob Smith, a straight talker from New Hampshire, outlined the \nSenate's history of filibusters of judicial nominees and said:\n\n       Don't pontificate on the floor and tell me that somehow I \n     am violating the Constitution . . . by blocking a judge or \n     filibustering a judge that I don't think deserves to be on \n     the court. That is my responsibility. That is my advise-and-\n     consent role, and I intend to exercise it.\n\n  Thus, the Republicans' claim that Democrats are taking \n``unprecedented'' action--much like the bogus White House claim that \nour request for Mr. Estrada's work while paid by taxpayers was \n``unprecedented''--is simply untrue. Republicans' desire to rewrite \ntheir own history is wrong. They should come clean and tell the truth \nto the American people about their past practices on nominations. They \ncannot change the plain facts to fit their current argument and \npurposes.\n  Senator Hatch candidly admitted after cloture was invoked on the Paez \nnomination and Senator Sessions made his unprecedented motion to \nindefinitely postpone any vote on that judicial nomination:\n\n       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on a nomination. A parliamentary \n     ruling to this effect means that, after today, our cloture \n     rule is further weakened.\n\n  Republicans should not have come to the floor and told the American \npeople over the last month that Democratic Senators had done something \nunprecedented in opposing the Estrada nomination. They themselves did \nit quite recently and have done it repeatedly. Let us be honest about \nthis and straight with the American people. Given the time allotted for \ntoday's debate, I cannot discuss them all but I will include in the \nRecord some of the other examples of filibusters of presidential \nnominations from the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief \nJustice of the United States Supreme Court through the nominations of \nStephen G. Breyer, now Justice Breyer, to the First Circuit; Rosemary \nBarkett to the 11th Circuit; H. Lee Sarokin to the 3rd Circuit; and \nMarsha Berzon and Richard Paez to the 9th Circuit.\n  Even more frequent during the years from 1995 through 2001, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate majority, were Republican efforts to \ndefeat President Clinton's judicial nominees through inaction and \nanonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be held \naccountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were \nnot acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton first \nnominated them and eventually defeated more than 50 judicial nominees \nwithout a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing to proceed \nwith hearings and Committee votes.\n\n  Beyond the question of judicial nominees, Republicans also \nfilibustered the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States. This was an executive branch nominee that \nRepublicans filibustered successfully in spite of two cloture votes in \n1995. Dr. David Satcher's subsequent nominaton also required cloture \nbut he was successfully confirmed. Other executive branch nominees who \nwere filibustered by Republicans included Walter Dellinger, whose name \nhas been invoked with approval by Republicans during the debate on the \nEstrada nomination. Mr. Dellinger was nominated to be Assistant \nAttorney General and two cloture petitions were required to be filed \nand both were rejected by Republicans. In this case we were able \nfinally to obtain a confirmation vote after significant efforts and Mr. \nDellinger was confirmed to that position with 34 votes against him. He \nwas never confirmed to his position as Solicitor General because \nRepublicans had made clear their opposition to him.\n  In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to State Department \nnominations and even the nomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the \nU.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in cloture petitions. In 1994, Sam \nBrown was nominated to be an Ambassador. After three cloture petitions \nwere filed, his nomination was returned to President\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nClinton without Senate action. Also in 1994, Derek Shearer was \nnominated to be an Ambassador and it took two cloture petitions to get \nto a vote before he was confirmed. In 1994, Ricki Tigert was nominated \nto chair the FDIC and it took two cloture petitions to get to a vote \nand confirmation of that executive nomination.\n  So when Republican Senators now talk about the Senate Executive \nCalendar and presidential nominees, they must be reminded that they \nrecently filibustered many, many qualified nominees. [chart] In \naddition, some of us remember Republican unwillingness to allow a \nSenate vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to serve as the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the \nDepartment of Justice. He told the Judiciary Committee that he would \nfollow the law and enforce the law. He was the choice of the President \nto serve in that President's administration, but Republicans would not \naccord him an up or down vote before the United States Senate.\n  Now let me turn to a most troubling development that demonstrates how \nRepublicans are violating longstanding Senate rules to suit themselves. \nTwo weeks ago in a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the \nChairman unilaterally declared the termination of debate on two \ncontroversial circuit court nominations. Senator Daschle termed it \ndeeply troubling and a ``reckless exercise of raw power by a \nChairman,'' and he is right. The Democratic Leader observed that the \nwork of this Senate has for over 200 years operated on the principle of \ncivil debate, which includes protection of the minority. When a \nChairman can on his own whim choose to ignore our rules that protect \nthe minority, not only is that protection lost, but so is an \nirreplaceable piece of our integrity and credibility.\n  The Democratic Leader noted that faithful adherence to rule is \nespecially important for the Senate and for its Judiciary Committee. He \nnoted ``how ironic that in the Judiciary Committee, a Committee which \npasses judgment on those who will interpret the rule of law,'' that it \nacted in conscious disregard of the rules that were established to \napply to its proceedings. If this is what those who pontificate about \n``strict construction'' mean by that term, it translates to winning by \nany means necessary. If this is how the judges of the judicial nominees \nact, how can we expect the nominees they support as ``strict \nconstructionists'' to behave any better? Given this action in \ndisrespect of the rights of the minority, how can we expect the \nJudiciary Committee to place individuals on the bench that respect the \nrule of law? In my 29 years in the Senate and in my reading of Senate \nhistory, I cannot think of so clear a violation of Senators' rights.\n  I am gravely concerned about this abuse of power and breach of our \nCommittee rules. When the Judiciary Committee cannot be counted upon to \nfollow its own rules for handling important lifetime appointments to \nthe federal judiciary, everyone should be concerned. In violation of \nthe rules that have governed that Committee's proceedings since 1979, \nthe Chairman chose to ignore our longstanding Committee Rules and \nshort-circuit Committee consideration of the nominations of John \nRoberts and Deborah Cook. Senator Daschle spoke to that matter that \nday. Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin have also \nspoken to the Senate about this breach of our rules as well as a number \nof other liberties that Republicans have been taking with the rules.\n  The protection for the minority has been maintained by the Judiciary \nCommittee for the last 24 years under five different chairmen--Chairman \nKennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, under Chairman Hatch \npreviously and during my tenure as chairman.\n  Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee provides the minority with a right \nnot to have debate terminated and not to be forced to a vote without at \nleast one member of the minority agreeing. That rule and practice had \nuntil last month always been observed by the Committee, even as we have \ndealt with the most contentious social issues and nominations that come \nbefore the Senate.\n  Until last month, Democratic and Republican Chairmen had always acted \nto protect the rights of the Senate minority. The rule has been the \nCommittee's equivalent to the Senate's cloture rule. It had been \nhonored by all five Democratic and Republican chairmen, including \nSenator Hatch until last month.\n  It was rarely utilized but Rule IV set the ground rules and the \nbackdrop against which rank partisanship was required to give way, in \nthe best tradition of the Senate, to a measure of bipartisanship in \norder to make progress. That is the other important function of the \nrule.\n  Besides protecting minority rights, it enforced a certain level of \ncooperation between the majority and minority in order to get anything \naccomplished. That, too, has been lost as the level of partisanship on \nthe Judiciary Committee and within the Senate reached a new low when \nRepublicans chose to override our governing rules of conduct and \nproceed as if the Senate Judiciary Committee were a minor committee of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In fact, the only occasion I recall when Senator Hatch was previously \nfaced with implementing Committee Rule IV, he did so. In 1997, \nDemocrats on the Committee were seeking a Senate floor vote on \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. Then, \nSenator Hatch acknowledged: ``Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee rules \neffectively establishes a committee filibuster right. . . .'' In 1997, \nChairman Hatch acknowledged: ``Absent the consent of a minority member \nof the Committee, a matter may not be brought to a vote.'' In that \ncase, in 1997, Chairman Hatch followed the rules of the Committee.\n  Last month the bipartisan tradition and respect for the rights of the \nminority ended when Chairman Hatch decided to override the rule rather \nthan follow it. He did so expressly and intentionally, declaring: \n``[Y]ou have no right to continue a filibuster in this committee.'' He \ndecided, unilaterally, to declare the debate over even though all \nmembers of the minority were prepared to continue the debate and it \nwas, in fact, terminated prematurely. Senator Hatch completely reversed \nhis own position from the Bill Lann Lee nomination and took a step \nunprecedented in the history of the Committee.\n  In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch now contends \nthat he ``does not believe the Committee filibuster should be allowed \nand [he] thinks it is a good and healthy thing for the Committee to \nhave a rule that forces a vote.'' I ask that the exchange of letters \nbetween Senator Hatch and the Democratic Leader be included in the \nRecord.\n  Our Committee rule, while providing a mechanism for terminating \ndebate and reaching a vote on a matter, does so while providing a \nminimum of protection for the minority. It is even that minimum \nprotection that Chairman Hatch will no longer countenance. It is \nSenator Hatch who has ``turned Rule 4 on its head'' last month, after \n24 years of consistent interpretation and implementation by five \nchairmen. Never, before his letter to Senator Daschle, has anyone since \nthe adoption of the rule in 1979 ever suggested that its purpose was to \nbe narrowed and redirected to thwart ``an obstreperous Chairman who \nrefuses to allow a vote on an item on the Agenda.'' After all, as \nSenator Hatch recognizes in his letter, it is the chairman's \nprerogative to set the agenda for the mark-up.\n  This revisionist reading of the rule is not justified by its adoption \nor its prior use and appears to be nothing other than an after the fact \nattempt to justify the obvious breaches of the longstanding Committee \nrule and practice that occurred last month. It was not even articulated \ncontemporaneously at the business meeting.\n  The Committee and the Senate have crossed a threshold of partisan \noverreaching that should never have been crossed. I urge the Republican \nleadership to recommit the nominations of Deborah Cook and John Roberts \nto the Judiciary Committee so that they can be considered in accordance \nwith the Committee's rules. The action taken last month should be \nvitiated and order restored to the Senate and to the Judiciary \nCommittee. I urge the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to rethink the \nmisstep taken last month and urge\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nthe Chairman and the Committee to disavow the misinterpretation and \nviolations of Rule IV that occurred. Order and comity need to be \nrestored to the Judiciary Committee. An essential step in that process \nis the restoration of minority rights under Rule IV and recognition of \nminority rights thereunder.\n  During the last four years of the Clinton Administration, his entire \nsecond term in office after being reelected by the American people, the \nJudiciary Committee refused to hold hearings and Committee votes on his \nqualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. Last \nmonth, in sharp contrast, this Committee was required to proceed on two \ncontroversial nominations to those circuit courts in contravention of \nthe rules and practices of the Committee. This can only be seen as part \nof a concerted and partisan effort to pack the courts and tilt them \nsharply out of balance.\n  In circumstances such as these, when the rights of the minority are \nbeing violated and Senate rules and longstanding practices are \nbreached, the minority is left with very few options and very little \nchoice in how it must proceed. This President has been the most \naggressive and unilateral I have seen in my 29 years in the Senate in \nhis nominations. The Republican majority is now choosing to abet his \nefforts at the expense of the Senate minority's rights and the \nconstitutional role of the Senate. That is all most regrettable.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in order to understand the constitutional \nproblem we face with the filibuster of Miguel Estrada, it is important \nfor the Senate and the public to focus on what is really going on here.\n  This filibuster is not a dispute about Mr. Estrada's answers to \nquestions. If it were about unanswered questions then more than two \nDemocrats would have taken up the White House's offer to pose new \nwritten questions to Mr. Estrada or to meet with him privately and ask \nthem in person. But they did not, and it is now clear that the repeated \nrefusal even to ask questions has exposed the emptiness of that \nargument. I hope we hear no more of it.\n  This filibuster also is not a dispute about confidential documents \nfrom the Solicitor General's office. Our filibustering colleagues must \nknow that for the administration to comply with this demand is to \nundermine the effectiveness of the Department of Justice and its \nability to defend the American people's interests in court. They must \nknow that the President will not jeopardize the people's interests and \nthat these confidential documents cannot be disclosed. So this document \nrequest is an unserious demand made precisely because the \nadministration will not comply--just as four former Democrat Solicitors \nGeneral have advised. No, this dispute is not about confidential memos.\n  The fact is that there is plenty of information available--more than \nenough information for a thoughtful Senator to make a decision whether \nto vote up or down. But don't take my word for it. Take Minority Leader \nDaschle's word for it. Last week the distinguished minority leader said \nthat Mr. Estrada is too conservative and that he opposes his \nconfirmation. How could the minority leader possibly have reached that \nconclusion if the record is so bare? How could he have reached any \nconclusion? The answer is obvious: Mr. Estrada's record is more than \nample for Senators to explore. Just as over 51 Senators have reviewed \nthe record to their satisfaction and concluded that Mr. Estrada is \nqualified and should be confirmed, so must Senator Daschle have \nreviewed the record and concluded that he should not be confirmed. He \ndid not need more information.\n  So, why are we still here? Why is does this debate continue? Let us \nput aside these arguments about supposedly unanswered questions and \ndisclosure of confidential memoranda, and let's focus on what this is \nreally about: power. An unprecedented power-play by a partisan minority \nto re-define our constitutional ``advice and consent'' obligation at \nleast for circuit court judicial nominees. This filibuster is about \nchanging the rules of the game forever.\n  For 214 years, the Senate has interpreted ``advice and consent'' to \nrequire majority approval for any judicial nominee who reaches the \nSenate floor. But if filibustering Democrats prevail here, that rule \nwill forever be changed. No longer will the ``advice and consent'' \nclause mean majority rule. Instead, it will mean 60 votes.\n  Now, my filibustering colleagues may say, ``well, no--we're not \ntrying to change the standard; we just want more information.'' The \ntime for dodging the essence of this constitutional moment has passed. \nThere can no longer be any question that the true goal of this \nfilibuster is to defeat Mr. Estrada's nomination by preventing a vote, \nto change the standard from a simple majority to a 60-vote requirement.\n  A month ago the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania called this power-\nplay a ``constitutional revolution,'' and it saddens me to say that I \nmust agree. A key part of our Constitution is its ordering of power \nbetween the different branches and parts of Government. Our \nConstitution is written, but we rely upon more than just the written \nword to understand its meaning. We rely upon the considered opinions of \nthose who are charged with its interpretation. In most cases, that is \nthe Supreme Court and the inferior courts that Congress establishes. \nBut the Supreme Court is not the only body charged with interpreting \nthe Constitution, because some areas of the Constitution are not \nsubject to conventional judicial review. One of those areas is the \n``advice and consent'' obligation of Congress. To understand that \nclause, the Senate must do the interpreting. The Senate has long had \nthe constitutional obligation to decide what those words mean.\n  Throughout our history the Senate has had one consistent answer to \nthe question of what ``advice and consent'' meant for lower court \njudicial nominees. That settled, bipartisan constitutional \nunderstanding of ``advice and consent'' was that only a majority vote \nis required. Now, a determined minority is determined to change the \nmeaning of those words. And that is indeed a ``constitutional \nrevolution,'' just as Senator Specter has said.\n  Let's turn to the Constitution. I know some of my Republican \ncolleagues have argued that the Constitution mandates ``advice and \nconsent'' by a simple majority vote. They may be right. As has been \nsaid, the Constitution contains seven provisions calling for a \nsupermajority from the legislature: overriding a veto, convicting on \nimpeachment, expelling members of the House or Senate, ratifying \ntreaties, proposing constitutional amendments, establishing \nPresidential incapacity, and during the Civil War era, removing the \ndisabilities of rebellious officeholders. But the Constitution is \nsilent as to ``advice and consent.'' The U.S. Supreme Court has \nobserved that a simple majority is the background rule in legislatures. \nIt is therefore understandable that many have concluded that ``advice \nand consent'' mandates a simple majority for confirmation. Certainly as \na democratically-elected body we should always have a strong \npresumption in favor of rule by simple majority. Only when an \nalternative supermajority rule is clear should we depart from that \ndemocratic tradition.\n  I also appreciate the argument that a filibuster in this context is \ndifferent than a filibuster on legislation because the appointment and \nconfirmation of judges is a shared responsibility we have with the \nPresident. Respect and comity demand that we give proper deference to \npresidential prerogatives. I certainly agree that filibustering a \npresidential judicial nominee endangers the traditional respect between \nthe branches of Government, and that as Senators we have a \nresponsibility to protect the relationship between the branches both \nfor present and future Senators and Presidents.\n  So it might be the case that the constitutional text and structure \nmandate a simple majority, but I must say that I am not 100 percent \nconvinced. It is possible that the Constitution's silence on this \nquestion was exactly that: silence. And it is possible that by \nremaining silent, the Founding Fathers intended to leave the question \nopen for its own interpretation. I think we should allow for that \npossibility. But my skepticism does not change my conclusion, which is \nthat we should apply a simple-majority requirement for confirmations.\n  Why do I reach this conclusion? Because the weight and precedent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nSenate's longstanding constitutional interpretation of its own ``advice \nand consent'' obligation compels it. Thus, even if the question was \nopen in 1789, we have 214 years of experience and tradition to tell us \nwhat the right interpretation was. And the right interpretation is that \nthe same interpretation that bipartisan majorities of the Senate have \nforever believed--that only a simple majority is required to confirm a \nlower court nominee.\n  The most obvious evidence of this tradition is the history itself. No \nlower court nominee has ever been rejected due to a heightened, 60-vote \nrequirement. To be sure, some Senators have contemplated this change \nbefore. Over 30 Democrats tried to filibuster J. Harvie Wilkinson in \n1984, Sidney Fitzwater in 1986, and Edward Carnes in 1992. A much \nsmaller group of my fellow Republicans tried to filibuster Marsha \nBerzon and Richard Paez in 2000. So the issue has been raised before, \nalthough never in such a dramatic and pointed fashion as it is today.\n  Let me address for a moment the unique case of Abe Fortas. In 1968, \nJustice Abe Fortas was nominated for the Chief Justice position. \nOpposition was roughly divided between the political parties, based \nsignificantly upon alleged improper financial dealings and other \nethical issues that eventually drove him to resign under threat of \nimpeachment. Unlike the case at hand, there is no record in that case \nof a Senate majority willing to confirm Mr. Fortas. The single cloture \nvote failed 45-43. So it cannot be said that the will of the majority \nwas thwarted, because no majority appears to have existed to confirm \nthat nomination. The President withdrew the nomination before we ever \nfound out the answer to that question. So unlike in the present case, \nthe majority was not thwarted by filibuster.\n  But returning to the more recent history, it is important to point \nout that in every one of those cases, however, cooler heads prevailed. \nThe Senate stepped back from that precipice and said ``No, this we will \nnot do. We will not filibuster judicial nominees.'' Senators such as \nthe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, were so \nopposed in principle to such a constitutional change that he declared \nthat he would ``object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \nwhether it is somebody I opposed or supported.'' The Washington Post \nreports that in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas nomination battle, \nSenator Leahy declared himself ``totally opposed'' to a filibuster, \neven as abortion activists urged such a step. And in 2000 a clear \nmajority of Republicans joined with Democrats and invoked cloture on \nthe Berzon and Paez nominations.\n  This is our tradition. We do not block judicial nominees by \nfilibuster. This isn't a Republican constitutional interpretation. It \nisn't a Democrat constitutional interpretation. It is the Senate's \ninterpretation. And in the Senate, where so much is based upon \ntradition, sometimes tradition is all we have to enforce constitutional \nnorms. We rely upon our colleagues to say, as Senator Leahy said, that \nthey will fight on principle against the abuse of process regardless of \nwhose particular ox is being gored. That is why I voted for cloture on \nthe Paez nomination, and against confirmation. I refused to upset 214 \nyears of settled constitutional interpretation and change our \nconstitutional norms forever. I was unwilling to risk the damage to the \nSenate and to the nominations process that would result.\n  Let there be no mistake about it: If a minority of Senators are able \nto force a change to our 214-year-old constitutional tradition, we do \ngreat damage to this body and to the process by which judges are \nnominated and confirmed. And those changes will be permanent.\n  Now, I am a conservative, and I naturally resist unnecessary \ntinkering with our constitutional system. But I also understand that \nconstitutional changes do happen, and that they are not always bad. I \nam an original sponsor of a constitutional amendment, S. 1, in this \nvery Congress. But we have an amendment process for changes to the \nConstitution. We require 2/3 of each House of Congress, and then \\3/4\\ \nof the States. We have a process, and our constitutional stability \ndepends on respecting that process.\n  This constitutional issue is unique, because the issue is probably \nnot justiciable. I do know that a few professors have concluded that a \njudicial nominee in Mr. Estrada's shoes may have standing to challenge \na filibuster, but the last thing we want is for a court to get \ninvolved. This is a Senate matter. And as a Senate matter, all we have \nis our wisdom and respect for a 214-year tradition to guide us. Can \ntraditions change? Of course they can. We should be very wary of \nupsetting settled traditions because for the most part, traditions \nexist for a reason, but we should always be open to improvement.\n  However, if we are going to upset 214 years of constitutional \ninterpretation and institutional tradition, shouldn't we require \nsomething more than the intransigence of 44 Senators who won't even \nadmit that they are trying to change the constitutional rule? The \nFounding Fathers recognized that when we change constitutional rules, \nwe should do so based on supermajority votes, not minorities' refusals \nto votes. As I said a moment ago, when we amend the Constitution, it \ntakes two-thirds of both Houses of Congress. Then if it passes, it \ncannot be enacted until three-quarters of the States support it. That \nis not minority rule, but supermajority rule. I might add that even \nwhen the Supreme Court changes its constitutional interpretations \nthrough its decisions, they have to act by majority vote or new law is \nnot created. Without a majority, there is no change to the \nconstitutional rule.\n  What is happening here is dramatically different. Here, a minority--\nnot a simple majority, and certainly not a supermajority--seeks to \nchange a settled constitutional rule and overturn 214 years of the \nSenate's constitutional interpretation. I submit that this fundamental \nchange to our constitutional understanding of the ``advice and \nconsent'' power must not be allowed to take effect. And it certainly \nshould not be undertaken by a minority of Senators for short-term gain. \nTo do so jeopardizes not only the Senate's relationship with the \nPresident, who has the constitutional obligation to make judicial \nnominations, and the Judiciary, which is understaffed and in desperate \nneed for a fair process consistent with our longstanding constitutional \nnorms. It jeopardizes the respect that future Senates will give to our \ntraditional constitutional norms. And it calls into question whether \nthe Senate can be trusted with its stewardship over those norms in the \nfuture. Will the Supreme Court ultimately become involved in Senate \naffairs? I certainly hope not, but I have less confidence today than I \ndid a month ago that no court would involve itself in these matters. \nAnd that is a day I do not want to see.\n  So, as I said, this is not about needing more information. The \ndistinguished minority leader made that clear last week. Senator \nDaschle has enough information. He opposes the nominee. This is about \npower--the power of the minority to change 214 years of constitutional \nnorms and interpretation. I urge my filibustering colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to step back, look at the history, and ask \nthemselves whether they truly believe that it should take 60 votes to \nconfirm a judge. And, equally important, whether they believe that a \nminority of Senators should be able to wash away the Senate's \nlongstanding traditional understanding of its advice and consent \nobligations. I submit that our obligation to the Constitution and to \nthe institution of the Senate demands more than what we are seeing \ntoday.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in response to my colleagues' \nassertions about the Senate's role in the judicial confirmation \nprocess. I am compelled by their statement to provide a more complete \nrecord on the origins of the Senate's constitutional obligation to \nprovide advice and consent on judicial nominees.\n  The constitutional duty of the President to nominate and appoint, and \nthe intervening duty of the Senate to provide advice and consent, is \nset forth in Article II, Section 2:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \n     of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for, and which shall be established by Law.\n\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have argued that the record of the \ndebate of the Constitutional Convention leads to the conclusion that \nthe Senate plays the central role in this process. This assertion is \nbased on the Convention's initial--and, I should add, temporary--\nadoption of proposals that a national judiciary be established to be \nchosen by the national legislature, and its concurrent rejection of \nproposals that the President be given the sole power to appoint judges. \nMy colleagues suggest that only in the final days of the Convention was \nthe President given a role--the power to nominate judges--and that \nsomehow this time line of events signals a more central role for the \nSenate than the actual text of the Constitution suggests.\n  It is first important to note that, contrary to the impression that \nmy colleague from Massachusetts may have left, the record of the \nConvention indicates that the discussion of the establishment of the \njudiciary was limited to only a few actual days. During that time there \nwere, indisputably, competing views as to how the judiciary should be \nestablished--by the Executive or by the legislature. But a careful \nreview of the notes of the Constitutional Convention leads to the \nconclusion that the Framers bestowed on the President the paramount \nrole in appointing judges.\n  There was significant opposition to the proposals to place the \nappointment power exclusively in the Senate. For example, according to \nthe notes from the Convention for July 18, 1787, a delegate from \nMassachusetts, Nathaniel Ghorum, suggested ``that the Judges be \nappointed by the Executive with the advice & consent of the 2d. branch, \nin the mode prescribed by the constitution of Masts. This mode had been \nlong practiced in that country, & was found to answer perfectly well.'' \nJames Wilson, one of the leading figures at the Convention, made a \nmotion ``that the Judges be appointed by the Executive.'' Mr. Wilson \nlater wrote, ``Instead of controlling the President still farther with \nregard to appointments, I am for leaving the appointment of all the \nprincipal officers under the Federal Government   solely   to   the   \nPresi-\ndent. . . .''\n  Thus the debate progressed over exclusive appointment by the \nlegislature versus exclusive appointment by the President. James \nMadison sought a compromise when he suggested the power of appointment \nbe given to the President with the concurrence of 1/3 of the Senate. \nThis is an interesting suggestion, given that we now face a virtual \nveto by a minority. Madison's proposed compromise has been turned on \nits head. Rather than a supermajority to disapprove the President's \nnominee, this Senate is demanding a supermajority for approval.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to want to \ncontinue the debate of the Constitutional Convention. That debate is \nover. The resolution of the respective roles of the President and the \nSenate are found in the language of the Constitution, which in Article \nII vests the nomination and appointment powers in the President.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist No. 66:\n  It will be the Office of the President to nominate, and, with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There will, of course, be \nno exertion of choice on the part of the Senate. They may defeat one \nchoice of the Executive, and oblige him to make another; but they \ncannot themselves choose they can only ratify or reject the choice he--\nmay have made.\n  The distinguished Assistant Democratic Leader referred to The \nFederalist No. 76, wherein Alexander Hamilton discussed the appointing \npower of the Executive. Hamilton stated ``To what purpose then require \nthe co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their \nconcurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \noperation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism \nin the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of \nunfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from \npersonal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, \nit would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.'' \nThis passage indicates the Founders' understanding of a limited role \nfor the legislature in the confirmation process. That role is for the \nSenate to act as a check on improper appointments resulting from \nfavoritism or unfit character by the President.\n  The treatment of Mr. Estrada by the Senate is far different from the \nadvice and consent role contemplated by the Framers. A vocal minority \nof Senators is blocking the majority, which stands ready to vote on his \nnomination. This is tyranny of the minority and it is unfair to all--to \nthe Senate, to the President, to the nominee, and to the Judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues who are denying an up or \ndown vote on the nomination of Mr. Estrada to let the Senate work its \nwill. The President has done his duty in nominating Mr. Estrada. It is \nnow our duty to consent or to withhold consent by an up or down vote. \nLet's end the debate on this nomination and proceed to that vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about charges that the \nongoing filibuster against Miguel Estrada is somehow unconstitutional, \nas some have claimed.\n  I take this job very seriously, and it is not often that I support \npreventing an up or down vote on any issue. In fact, this is the only \ntime I have ever supported a filibuster against a judicial nominee, and \nI do so for very specific reasons, as do so many of my Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  Contrary to the charges we have been hearing over the last few days, \nI believe this filibuster is precisely what the Founders of this Nation \nhad in mind when they created a three-branched system of government \nwith checks, balances, advice and consent.\n  This filibuster is not about preventing a conservative nominee from \ngetting onto the court. Rather, this filibuster is about a failure of \nthis administration to adequately seek the advice and participation of \nthe U.S. Senate in the judicial nominations process, particularly with \nregard to this nominee.\n  I have spoken several times about Mr. Estrada specifically, and each \ntime I have been clear, as have my colleagues--this is a nominee about \nwhom we know very, very little, and he and this administration have \nsimply not done enough to give us the kind of information we need to \nproperly perform our constitutional duty of advice and consent. Because \nwe are prevented from performing this constitutional duty, we have been \nforced to resort to a procedure, well within the Senate rules and by no \nmeans unprecedented, to enforce those rights.\n  The filibuster is one of the key devices throughout our nation's \nhistory that has protected the right of the minority party, or even of \none Senator. Without a filibuster right on nominations, there might \nnever be advice and consent at all. And that would turn the \nConstitution on its head.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to make \nmuch of the fact that the Constitution does not provide for a ``super-\nmajority'' vote on nominations, unlike constitutional amendments or \ntreaties. This is true--the Constitution is silent on the issue of how \nmany votes a nomination should take.\n  But the Constitution is equally silent about how many votes it would \ntake to proceed to other measures as well--a patient's bill of rights, \nfor example. Or a ban on human cloning. Or the assault weapons ban. Or \neducation bills. Or even major civil rights legislation. Yet nobody \nargues that it would be unconstitutional for one or more Senators to \nfilibuster these bills. Unwise, perhaps. Subject to public outcry, \nmaybe. A legitimate subject of reasoned debate, absolutely. But \nunconstitutional? No.\n  Now let me address the issue of whether this filibuster is \n``unprecedented,'' as some have charged. If we look at the facts, we \nsoon see that the only really unprecedented aspect of this filibuster \nmay be its success. Many have tried, but few have succeeded. And this \nmay be a good indication of how strongly we feel about enforcing our \nconstitutional role of advice and consent to this and other nominations \nnow before us.\n  The majority now argues that any filibuster of a judicial nominee is \nunconstitutional because it essentially establishes a new, 60-vote \nthreshold for judicial nominees. But this 60-vote threshold has long \nbeen in place for\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\ncontroversial nominees facing objections from one or more Senators.\n  Again, the only real difference between the situation with Miguel \nEstrada and the situations where cloture votes were required on other \nnominees is that here, today, there are not enough votes to meet that \n60-vote threshold.\n  The procedure is the same--a cloture vote.\n  The debate is the same--over a nomination to the federal judiciary.\n  Only the outcome is different, and I don't see how the outcome can \ndetermine the constitutionality of the process.\n  Let me list some other filibusters and cloture votes throughout \nrecent history.\n  In 1968, Abe Fortas was actually prevented from becoming Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court by filibuster. The other side may argue \nthat this was a bipartisan filibuster, and they are right--but this is \nnot the point. The point is, a filibuster was used as a tool, and the \nnomination failed.\n  In 1980, Stephen Breyer had to go through two cloture motions to \nobtain a seat on the First Circuit--to debate, Miguel Estrada has only \nhad one cloture vote.\n  In 1994, a cloture vote finally stopped a filibuster against Rosemary \nBarkett, a nominee to the 11th Circuit.\n  In 1994, H. Lee Sarokin's nomination to the Third Circuit required a \ncloture vote before it could proceed.\n  In 2000, the nominations of both Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--nominations which had been stopped \ndead in their tracks literally for years by that time--underwent \ncloture votes. Richard Paez had waited for more than 1,500 days before \nhe was given that cloture vote.\n  To be perfectly frank, hearing these charges from the other side of \nthe aisle is surprising given how many other Clinton nominees were \nstopped cold by secret holds and other parliamentary tactics, both in \ncommittee and on the floor.\n  For instance, Elena Kagan was a Clinton nominee to the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals--the same circuit to which Miguel Estrada is now \nnominated. In fact, Ms. Kagan was Miguel Estrada's supervising editor \non the Harvard law review, yet Republicans stopped her nomination cold \nwithout even getting to the point of a filibuster, or a public \naccounting of who was for, and who was against, that nominee.\n  Elena Kagan was never filibustered on the floor, but she was \neffectively ``filibustered'' in committee by one or two Senators who \nprevented a hearing or a committee vote.\n\n  Other nominees to the circuit courts who were denied hearings or \ncommittee votes include Helene White for the Sixth Circuit, Jorge \nRangel for the Fifth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell for the Eighth Circuit, \nand the list goes on and on. In fact, dozens of Clinton nominees were \nblocked in committee by anonymous holds or other obstructionist \ntactics, so there was no need for a filibuster on the floor.\n  It is most surprising to hear these charges of unconstitutionality \nfrom the other side of the aisle, given that many of my Republican \ncolleagues actually participated in filibusters against Clinton \nnominees.\n  Richard Paez, for example, was one of President Clinton's Hispanic \nnominees to the circuit court, and he could not move on the floor until \na cloture petition was filed. When the vote finally came to end the \nfilibuster, the majority of the Senate voted to do so and Richard Paez \nis now a federal judge.\n  But many of my Republican colleagues voted to continue that \nfilibuster, just three short years ago. Indeed, almost exactly three \nyears ago, on March 8, 2000, fourteen Republican Senators voted to \ncontinue the filibuster against Richard Paez, including some of those \nwho now argue that filibusters themselves are unconstitutional.\n  And when the cloture vote came on that same day for Marsha Berzon, \nanother Clinton nominee who waited years for a hearing and up or down \nvote, thirteen Republican Senators voted to continue that filibuster as \nwell.\n  How can these Senators now argue that this filibuster is \nunconstitutional? Is it only unconstitutional when Democrats filibuster \na nominee, but constitutional for Republicans to do the same? Is it \nonly unconstitutional if the filibuster succeeds?\n  The fact is, this filibuster is very constitutional, and in fact it \nmay even be necessary to enforce the constitution's other provisions, \nsuch as the advice and consent power granted to the U.S. Senate.\n  I do not relish where we find ourselves today, nor do any of my \ncolleagues--on either side of the aisle.\n  We stand poised to enter a war against Iraq, and under the constant \nthreat of international terrorism. Our budgets are running at record \ndeficits, the economy is still in trouble, and we recently reorganized \nour entire homeland security apparatus. All of these issues require the \nattention in this body.\n  The nominations debate is clearly very important to the future of our \njudiciary and to the rule of law for decades to come, and there is no \nquestion that this issue should not, can not, and will not, be ignored.\n  But we should be concentrating our efforts, and our limited resources \nin terms of time, staff and attention, on these other important issues \nas well.\n  It is clear now that Miguel Estrada will not become a federal judge \nunless our requests are met. Any further debate on this nominee is \nreally a distraction from the many other important issues we should \naddress.\n  I appreciate the attendance of the distinguished Vice President of \nthe United States here today, and I appreciate the gravity of this \ndebate.\n  But I urge the Republican leader and my colleagues to move beyond \nthis debate so we can resolve these other, very important issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration of both \nsides of the aisle. We extended the debate for an additional 20 \nminutes. Normally we would have completed at 12:30. I think that \nrepresents the fact that the debate has been valuable, informative, and \nI do appreciate so many Members on both sides of the aisle coming \nforward and speaking during this period of time where my objective, as \nI said 2 hours ago, was to elevate the debate and talk about advice and \nconsent as spelled out in the Constitution.\n  Much of what we have heard about is larger than any single nominee, \neven one as distinguished and compelling as Miguel Estrada. I think \nmost of us would agree that the process of advise and consent has gone \nawry. I suspect most of us will probably have different viewpoints on \nwhy that has happened, why it has evolved to the point where we are \ntoday. I respect those differing views.\n  One thing is clear to me--the system is not working well, it is \nbroken, and that is a disheartening thought on my part. But to America \nit is an unfortunate truth. I think it is coming to the time we need to \nstop blaming each other and find a way to fix the system itself. With \n17 unanimous consent requests, 100 hours of debate, still the nominee \nbeing subjected to a filibuster, where we don't see an end in sight, an \nup-or-down vote, I conclude the system is not working.\n  As has been pointed out, filibusters on executive nominations--until \nnow, recently--has been exceedingly rare. As leader, that strikes me as \na good thing. But it seems to be changing, and that is why it is \nimportant for us to carefully examine advise and consent as spelled out \nin the Constitution and our interpretation of that.\n  I do want to make a proposal for the other side of the aisle and I \nask the assistant minority leader to think about it. The proposal is \nnot in the form of a unanimous consent request at this point but \npossibly after lunch today. The proposal recognizes the context in \nwhich we find ourselves. It may be possible in the near future that we \nwill have a military conflict, although I hope and pray that is not the \ncase. But we need to begin later this week, and aggressively next week, \naddressing the issue surrounding the Federal budget. We want to focus \non the economy and get it moving again. We have Medicare and \nprescription drugs, which we must address. We have a lot to do. The \nproposal that I will make--and I would like for the other side of the \naisle to consider this--to the chairman and ranking member is that \narrangements will be made for Miguel Estrada to appear again before the \nSenate Judiciary\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nCommittee in exchange for a date certain for an up-or-down vote on his \nnomination.\n  The second hearing is something we had not believed was appropriate, \nbut I want to show both sides of the aisle that we are trying to reach \nout to do everything possible to go that extra mile and try to get an \nanswer that works.\n  This is not a formal unanimous consent request at this time, but I do \nwant to offer that opportunity. Again, it would be in exchange for a \nvote, up or down, at a time certain--to actually have another formal \nJudiciary Committee hearing with Miguel Estrada. It is my hope the \nother side of the aisle will decide it is time to conclude the debate \nand that we can focus on the challenges that lie ahead.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader allow me to respond? Otherwise, I will use \nleader time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that since being chosen majority leader the \nSenator from Tennessee has gone out of his way to make sure we have \nample debate. He has used the cloture motion rarely, and we appreciate \nthat very much. But I say, regarding the Estrada matter, we have been \nvery consistent in our requests. No. 1 is that he answer questions. The \nSenator said he would try to satisfy that. But until he supplies the \nmemoranda from the Solicitor's office, it is not going to change the \nposition of the people on this side of the aisle. So if he makes the \nunanimous consent request, we will simply renew our unanimous consent \nrequest, as we have done on other occasions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the distinguished majority leader \ntake a moment just to make a quick observation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield for 1 minute, and then we will \ngo to lunch.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the distinguished \nmajority leader trying to figure out a way to get through this impasse. \nIt is in the tradition of majority leaders, and I have served with \nevery majority leader since the time of Mike Mansfield. Majority \nleaders try to work these matters out, and I appreciate that.\n  I urge him, in doing so, to look at the fact that Miguel Estrada has \nsaid he is willing to discuss his papers and find a way that that could \nbe done. I think his suggestion of a hearing where questions would be \nasked based on that would be very workable. But I commend the \ndistinguished majority leader for doing what is the tradition of \nleaders--to try to find a way through this.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, with respect to the rejection of these five \nproposed unanimous consents, we do ask that the other side look at \nthese as individuals. Once again, I state the willingness on our side \nof the aisle to bring these forward. I mentioned 4 hours for debate \nequally divided. If it takes 8 hours or 10 hours of debate, I would put \nthat forward.\n  Rather than run through the unanimous consent request again, we will \ncontinue our conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair, I ask the leader this \nquestion: In regard to two of the names put forward, the woman from \nOhio and Roberts, the best way to alleviate a very serious problem that \nhas developed--and, you know, I think Senator Leahy is right on his \ninterpretation of the rules, but it really does not matter at this \nstage--why do we not have the Judiciary Committee reconvene regarding \nthose two judges? If there are some more questions the Judiciary \nCommittee members have, ask the questions and then those two matters, I \nam sure, will receive a number of Democratic votes, and we could have \nthese two people on the floor. That could be scheduled under whatever \nthe rules are in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think we are creating problems for ourselves. I know Senator Hatch \nfeels right the way he interprets the rules. We have people on this \nside who feel that he is wrong, and it would seem that an easy way to \navoid that problem would be to reconvene the Judiciary Committee, see \nif Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee want to ask any more \nquestions of those nominees, and we could move along. Otherwise, I am \nafraid that because of how we interpret the rules of the committee \nhaving been violated, it is going to unnecessarily throw another cloud \nover an already cloudy situation. I do not suggest the leader has to \nanswer that publicly, but I would hope that he would follow through on \nthat and see if that would be a way to avoid these problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, all five of these individuals are on the \nExecutive Calendar for consideration on the floor of the Senate. We can \ncontinue our conversations, but all of these have gone through the \nJudiciary Committee and have been presented on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3455-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3455-S3456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ------\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n         CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--Continued\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of the Estrada \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. \nEstrada, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier today we had a productive debate \nwith the Vice President in the Presiding Officer's chair. The debate \nwas constructive and did fulfill my goals to elevate the debate to the \nlevel of talking about advice and consent of the Constitution itself.\n  The nomination of Miguel Estrada has been pending before the full \nSenate for over a month. He was initially nominated 2 years ago. I have \ntried on numerous occasions to reach out for a time certain for a very \nsimple up-or-down vote. That is all we ask for after these 5 weeks of \ndebate. Each of the requests has been met with an objection from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  As I have stated, we are not going to give up on this nominee. We are \ngoing to continue to push for that very simple request that this \nnominee should have an up-or-down vote. He deserves an up-or-down vote, \nand I will continue to pursue every avenue possible in terms of \nreaching out. If the other side of the aisle says they want more \ninformation, we have responded by saying submit written questions and \nwe will get the answers. The White House has made Miguel Estrada \navailable individually to Senators to answer their questions, in an \neffort to keep this nomination moving forward.\n  Prior to lunch, I asked my Democratic friends if they would agree to \na time certain for an up-or-down vote if a further hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee is scheduled. If they think they need more \ninformation regarding this nomination, they would agree to a hearing to \nbe followed by an up-or-down vote. That would be another way to get \ninformation, if it really is the fact that the other side of the aisle \nwants more information. I hope it reflects to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle my attempt to reach out through every avenue \npossible to respond to their request for more information.\n  At the end of that hearing, I would expect as part of the proposal to \nhave an up-or-down vote. If people do not like what they hear or, after \nthat process, they say they do not know enough, then let them vote no, \nso they can express themselves with an up-or-down vote. I think it is \ntime for a vote.\n  I am happy to yield for a brief response to my Democratic colleague, \nif he would like to comment.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the leader. As I indicated this morning, we would \nbe willing to attend the hearing and ask questions of Mr. Estrada if, \nin addition to that, we had the documents that we have requested from \nthe Solicitor's Office while he worked there.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following a \nfurther hearing with respect to the Estrada nomination, there be an \nadditional 4 hours for debate equally divided in the usual form, and \nthe Senate then vote on the confirmation of the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nmodified to allow the provision of documents relevant to Mr. Estrada's \nGovernment service, which were first requested in May of 2001; that the \nnominee thereafter appear before the Judiciary Committee to answer \nquestions which we believe he failed to answer in his confirmation \nhearing and any additional questions that may arise after reviewing the \ndocuments we have requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as we have \nmentioned again and again, access to these SG confidential memorandum \nwould be unprecedented and would jeopardize the integrity of our \nsystem. Therefore, I object to the request for modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the initial request of the majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask a question of the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, has the Senator had an \nopportunity to look over the unanimous consent request that we \nsubmitted to staff earlier today regarding the late-term abortion \nmatter that is now before the Senate?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have been reviewing the one amendment. Has the \nSenator submitted all the other amendments? Only one amendment has been \nsubmitted, to my knowledge.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for that. I thought staff had all the \namendments, but the Senator does have our amendment, of course. It has \nbeen filed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have one amendment. That is the only one I am aware \nthat we have.\n  Mr. REID. We will make sure the Senator gets all the amendments. Can \nwe agree on a time on this amendment before us without any second-\ndegree amendments?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes. In fact, I just spoke to the Senator from \nWashington about this.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggested we would be willing to accept the \namendment. She has requested that we have a rollcall vote of some sort. \nI am happy to agree on a reasonable time agreement.\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine. We would be happy to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are working in good faith. I thank \nthe Democratic whip for his willingness to try to work through these \namendments. We are reviewing, on our side, the Murray amendment. There \nmay be some concerns about it. We are hopeful to get a resolution and \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement on the disposition of that \namendment.\n  We have just been handed another amendment. That is a positive step, \na step in the right direction. We are hopeful we can proceed with a \nvote on the Murray amendment sometime today, and maybe another vote \nlater this evening; if not, tomorrow morning. So there are fewer than a \nhalf dozen amendments we are aware of on this legislation. It looks as \nthough we are making some progress.\n  Again, I thank the other side of the aisle for their cooperation.\n  I want to go back and go over some of the issues that have been \ndiscussed today about the underlying bill, which is the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act, and provide the context in which this legislation \ncomes to the floor of the Senate.\n  Back three Congresses ago, in 1995 and 1996, this procedure had been \nunearthed, if you will. There was some medical literature that some \nMembers of Congress found so abhorrent, for obvious reasons, that there \nwas a strong belief that this procedure should be banned. So for three \nconsecutive Congresses, the House of Representatives and, for two of \nthose Congresses, the Senate debated this issue--always being blocked \nby the President of the United States and then, on the third attempt, \nby the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We are now here with a version of the bill that is different from the \nprevious versions. The version that was considered by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The reason we are back is not just to say the Court was wrong or that \nwe disagree with the Court's judgment on constitutionality, although I \ndo. I have to say the Court's view of the constitutionality of abortion \nstatutes is really quite remarkable. It is not, as has been depicted by \nmany on the other side with whom we have debated this issue in the \npast, that Roe v. Wade allows absolute freedom of choice in the first \ntrimester, provides some limitations in the second, greater limitations \nin the third trimester. Lots of statements have been made on the floor \nthat that is the case. Statements have been reported in the press. The \npress themselves have adopted this analysis of Roe v. Wade.\n  That is not what Roe v. Wade says--or Doe v. Bolton, its companion \ncase--and not what subsequent cases from the U.S. Supreme Court have \nheld. If that were the case, then the U.S. Supreme Court would have \nupheld the partial-birth abortion case.\n  Why? Because if there are legitimate restrictions on the right to \nabortion in the second and third trimester, I can't imagine a more \nlegitimate restriction. But that is not what the Court has said. The \nCourt has basically said there are no restrictions on abortion. It \nreally is quite amazing that a right that was created, as I understand, \nby judicial fiat, not by the legislative process and not by the \nconstitutional amendment process--I dare anyone to look at the U.S. \nConstitution and find the right to abortion. It does not exist in the \nU.S. Constitution. But by judicial fiat, by an act of judicial \nactivism, this right was created.\n  Interestingly enough, this right, since it was created by nine \npeople, they have no limitation on how they define it because there is \nnothing in the written Constitution that limits their own \ninterpretation. It is what they say it is. It is a pure case of \npositive law created by an unelected group of men at the time.\n  What they are saying is absolutely right. There are no restrictions--\nnone. I would challenge any of you to go through the Constitution, go \nthrough the Bill of Rights, and look at the rights within our \nConstitution and find another right in the Constitution that has no \nlimit, that has no restriction. Every other right written in the \nConstitution has a limit, has curbs. The courts have permitted it, \nexcept this right that doesn't exist in the Constitution.\n  When we approach this issue of partial-birth in trying to find, in a \nsense, a way to put this procedure outside of Roe, I would argue that \nwas the argument all along. And I believe back in 1996 when I argued \nthis, it did not belong under Roe v. Wade. There are no health concerns \nof the mother. That is what makes all of the abortion basically \nunlimited up until the moment that the child is separated from the \nmother; that there is always a reason for the health of the mother and \nhealth defined under Roe v. Bolton means anything--stress, anxiety, \nfear. Anything associated with mental or physical health counts for \nallowing abortion up to the time of the separation of the child from \nthe mother.\n  That is why I said there are simply no restrictions. We looked and \nquestioned whether the partial-birth abortion procedure affects the \nhealth of women. The answer is clearly no, It does not.\n  There is a huge amount of congressional testimony both here in the \nSenate, with debates on the floor, debates on the floor of the House, \ntestimony, overwhelming evidence, dispositive evidence that this \nprocedure is never--I underscore the word ``never''--medically \nnecessary to preserve the health of the mother. That is a strong word, \n``never.'' That is an absolute term--``never.'' I use it with complete \ncomfort--and have for 7 years here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I \ndid earlier today when I said, as I have repeated over and over again \nto those who believe that a health exception is necessary, give me a \nmedical case in which a partial-birth abortion is medically necessary \nto preserve the health of the woman. Give me a case where it is \npreferable--not just necessary, where it is preferable. I can give you \nquote after quote, from the AMA to C. Everett Koop to the experts in \nlate-term abortions, all of whom have said not only isn't it medically \nnecessary but it is bad medicine. It is unhealthy. It is \ncontraindicated.\n  The overwhelming body of medical evidence is that it is outside the \nscope of medicine. It is not taught in medical\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\nschools anywhere. It is not done in hospitals. It is done in abortion \nclinics. Why? Ask the doctor who designed the procedure. The doctor who \ndesigned the procedure said he did it for one reason. He could do more \nabortions in a day because this procedure took 15 minutes, and the \nother late-term abortion procedures took 40 minutes. He could do more \nabortions. He could make more money.\n  When we hear this debate from those on the other side who talk about \nhow we have to be compassionate for the health of mothers, let me \nassure you, as a father of seven children, I am very compassionate to \nthe health of mothers during pregnancy. This is not a procedure that \nwas contemplated to be helpful to the health of mothers or is necessary \nor is even preferable to preserve the health of mothers. This is a \nrogue procedure. This is a gruesome, brutal procedure where the doctor \ndelivers a child in a breech position.\n  I just try to imagine myself in that position, having been at the \nbirth of seven children, seeing that delivery, being there and seeing \nhow the doctor carefully handles the child being delivered. As you will \nsee in the chart, the doctor is holding this child alive. This baby is \nalive in the abortionist's hand. He has his hand wrapped around this \nchild, which is alive, moving, feeling, heart beating, and nerves \nfeeling.\n\n  As you can see on the chart, a doctor is holding the child in his \nhand.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is here, and I will yield to let him \nspeak.\n  But I know what doctors are instructed to do when faced with a living \nhuman being in their care. I know the instinct has to be, How can I \nhelp this patient? But in the case of a partial-birth abortion, this \nchild doesn't count as a patient. Nevertheless, it is a human being.\n  If you look at this chart, this is clearly a human being. This is a \nchild with 10 toes, 10 fingers, arms, and legs. This is a human being, \nand nothing but a human being.\n  Look at the hands of that doctor grasping this child, grasping this \nliving human being, holding it--a doctor who took a Hippocratic oath \nholding this human being in his or her hand.\n  I just try to imagine what goes through the doctor's mind when he \ntakes a pair of scissors and probes this living being whose nerves \nwork, whose brain functions, whose heart is beating, and finds the \nplace to thrust a pair of scissors into the baby's skull; holding this \nchild, feeling the child's pain, feeling its reaction to being \nexecuted, and then proceeding to suction the child's brains.\n  I am just troubled that we allow this to continue in America; that we \nallow this procedure to be used by people who are there to heal. What \nwe say to so many in our society is how we value life, and yet we let \nthe most vulnerable among us be treated in such a fashion.\n  Our leader is here. I will be happy to stop with my remarks and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act of 2003. I want to spend a few minutes discussing the \nunderlying bill, and then later have an opportunity to come back and \ntalk specifically about some amendments that will be coming to the \nfloor.\n  I will in part be talking about the procedure as a medical procedure, \nand also discuss some of the myths that surround the very specific \nprocedure that is defined in this particular bill.\n  I rise to speak on this particular issue with a deep passion not only \nfor the protection of life but also for the ethical practice of \nmedicine.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I had the opportunity to study and \npractice medicine for 20 years. Although I am not an obstetrician, I \nhave delivered many babies in the past. I have had the privilege, as a \ncardiovascular surgeon, to operate on a number of premature infants \nborn probably about 3 or 4 weeks later than the infant--or the fetus, \nin this case--that is depicted in this picture, about 3 weeks after \nthat.\n  I do speak as a surgeon and a board-certified surgeon. This is a \nsurgical procedure. I have had the opportunity to do thousands of \nsurgical procedures as well as mend the hearts and vascular systems on \nbabies this size.\n  As a surgeon, let me say that there are certain ethical bounds to the \napplication of surgical procedures, and these are bounds that in a \nmoral sense should never be crossed by a surgeon. It is interesting \nthat the people who developed this procedure, and its loudest \nproponents, are not surgeons but practitioners, and they are not board \ncertified in a field that would be consistent with performing \nprocedures such as this. That is important because people have this \nimage that once recognizing there are hundreds and indeed thousands of \nthese procedures, in all likelihood, performed every year, that you \nwould have certified surgeons performing them, but that is not the \ncase. For the most part, general practitioners are performing these \nprocedures.\n  From a medical standpoint, I took an oath to treat every human life \nwith respect, with dignity, and with compassion. Abortion takes life \naway, and partial-birth abortion, this particular procedure, does so in \na manner that is brutal, barbaric, and morally offensive to the medical \ncommunity.\n  I will not concentrate on the politics of partial-birth abortion, but \ntalk a little bit about the disturbing facts of partial-birth abortion \nas a surgical procedure, a procedure that clearly should and must be \nbanned.\n  The fact is that partial-birth abortion is a repulsive procedure. The \nprocedure is straightforward in description; people have seen the \nvarious charts. This depicts a late stage in that particular procedure. \nIt begins, as described by its greatest advocate, by, inside the \nuterus, manipulating the fetus and turning the fetus around so it can \nbe delivered feet first, delivering the feet through the uterus and \nthrough the cervical canal to the position that is depicted in this \nparticular diagram, and then taking scissors which are about 8 inches \nlong, called Metzenbaum scissors, and thrusting them into the back of \nthe base of the skull. Then, because that opening is not sufficient to \ndrain the brains from the fetus itself, it requires a forcible opening \nof the scissors. If you were to take a regular pair of scissors--\nalthough the Metzenbaum scissors are longer--forcibly opening those \nscissors so the end of the scissors will split the skull wider so the \nbrain can be evacuated and other contents within the skull.\n  Once the skull is allowed to collapse because of the evacuation of \nthe brain and the intracranial contents, the skull itself collapses. \nAnd you can see how large the skull is to actually come through the \ncervical canal and through the birthing canal. It is necessary at this \nlate stage because, as you can see, this, if born now, would be a \npremature infant. I will come to what the survival is if at this stage \nthis fetus was actually delivered alive instead of dead.\n  The thrusting of the scissors into the base of the skull and the \ncranium itself takes this living fetus and kills the fetus itself. One \nof the problems is at this late stage in development, the neurological \nsystem is fully developed, fully developed to the point that with \ncervical blocks, which is the type of anesthesia typically used, or as \nis described by the father to this procedure, the fetus itself will \nfeel that pain of thrusting the scissors in the back of the head.\n\n  This particular procedure is most commonly performed between 20 and \n27 weeks. That is in the second trimester of pregnancy. People ask how \nfar developed the fetus is. Pictorially, that gives you a pretty good \nidea of how well developed the fetus is. But to put that in \nperspective, 20 to 27 weeks, that is when most of these are performed. \nIf you look at the early side of that, between 20 and 23 weeks, if that \nfetus was not killed but was just delivered at that point in time, \noverall survival today is about 30 to 50 percent. If you go to the \nperiod of 24 to 25 weeks--remember, this procedure is performed between \n20 and 27 weeks--overall survival if the fetus had not been killed by \nusing the scissors, the survival rate would be around 60 to 90 percent.\n  So these are premature infants. That is why people such as Senator \nMoynihan, who used to be in this body, call it the equivalent of \ninfanticide, because these are performed at a time where if the infant \nwere not killed, the infant would be delivered and although, yes, \npremature, would have better than a 50/50 percent chance of survival.\n  So when you hear about the procedure itself and you listen to the \ndescription, it is hard to imagine a more\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\ngrotesque treatment or tortuous treatment of what, if delivered without \nbeing first killed, would face a fighting chance of being a healthy \nhuman being.\n  Partial-birth abortion exists today. The procedure is performed in \nAmerica every day. That is the reason this body, I believe strongly, \nmust act and act with a ban to put a stop to this morally offensive \nprocedure that is a fringe procedure, that is a rogue procedure that is \nbeing applied each and every day. We must stop it.\n  The reason I describe--it is worth looking at these pictures--this \nprocedure in detail is not to shock. That is not the purpose. It really \nis to inform. The description I gave you is a typical medical way of \ndescribing the procedure itself. I will say, being a physician and \nbeing board certified, it is my responsibility not to shock but to \ndepict the procedure as spelled out in the bill, a very specific \nprocedure as it really is, the reality of the procedure itself.\n  It is critical that we debate this in terms of that framework of \nreality, no matter how disturbing the reality is.\n  There are a number of arguments by people who say, no, we should \nallow this procedure, as morally offensive and repulsive as it is, to \ncontinue.\n  I would like to take some of those myths. I will present them as \nmyths because that is what they are. First, some say that partial-birth \nabortion may be necessary to preserve the health of the mother. That is \nnot true. Never has partial-birth abortion, the specific procedure that \nis described in the bill itself, never has it been the only procedure \nor the best procedure available in the case of a medical emergency. You \nhave to remember that this procedure takes 3 days. In fact, the \nalternative procedure--I am not an advocate of the alternative \nprocedure that is accepted within the medical community--does not take \n3 days. So when you are talking about medical emergencies and people \nsay, it is the best alternative out there, that is not true. It is a \ndangerous procedure.\n  The only advantage I can see of partial-birth abortion--which is a \ndisturbing advantage; therefore, I wouldn't call it an advantage or a \nbenefit--is the guarantee, by the thrusting of the scissors into the \nbrain and evacuation of the brain, of a dead infant.\n  Still, in the remote chance--and I argue hypothetical, because I have \nnot been able to talk to anybody today who has said partial-birth \nabortion would be required to save the life of a mother because, \nremember, it takes 3 days. When you have procedures that are within \nethical bounds, accepted by the medical profession and taught in \nmedical schools, you have alternative procedures. But in the remote \nchance--again I argue hypothetical--the ban would not apply if it were \nto save the life of the mother.\n  Second, some would say that partial-birth abortion is the best option \nto preserve the health of the mother. I argue, no, it is a dangerous \noption. Let me paraphrase an article in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, published on August 26, 1998. There are ``no \ncredible studies'' on partial-birth abortion that ``evaluate or attest \nto its safety'' for the mother. Partial-birth abortion, as described in \nthe bill, is more dangerous to the health of the mother than the \nalternative procedures. There is a much greater danger.\n  The cervix itself is right here on the chart. This is the uterine \ncavity. You see the size of the head and the instrumentation of the \nhand and the instruments, which expand the cervix, which is the \nsmallest part of the bottom of the uterus. When you overextend and \nexpand that, you come to what is called cervical incompetence. This \ncomes to the health of the mother long term, because cervical \nincompetence can have longstanding side effects to the mother.\n  Right here, those are the Metzenbaum scissors. It looks like a \nsuction device. You can see those are about 8 inches long. Metzenbaum \nwas the person who first described these scissors. The blunt \ninstrumentation is done blindly. You cannot see. What you are doing is \nputting two fingers down, pulling down on the shoulders, putting the \nscissors on the top, and feeling this little indentation and thrusting \ninside. It is all done blindly--the manipulation of the two fingers and \nthe manipulation of turning the fetus itself, as well as putting in the \nblunt instrument of the scissors. Once you insert the scissors that \ndeeply into the uterus blindly, forcibly into the skull, if it doesn't \ngo into the skull, it perforates the uterus.\n  The alternative procedures today--again, I am not supporting third \ntrimester abortions and, to me, they are all repulsive. But it is \nimportant for people to know the alterative procedures don't involve \nthe Metzenbaum scissors. It is done with an injection into the heart \nitself directly, or guided by ultrasound, very carefully controlled. It \nis not this blind procedure.\n  Comparing the various procedures is important because we keep hearing \nfrom certain people that this is the safest, or will be the safest or \nbest alternative. It is simply not true. It is more dangerous. There is \nthe danger of infection because of the increased manipulation that is \nrequired in this procedure itself, secondary to the performance of this \nprocedure.\n  The third myth is the medical community--I was jotting notes when \npeople were saying it infringes on the doctor-patient relationship. It \nsays specific medical procedures that should not be banned by Congress. \nYou know, first of all, that is not true. As a physician, you don't \nlike big government coming in and telling you what you can and cannot \ndo. Most people in life don't like Government intruding into their \nlives. And that doctor-patient relationship being as special as it is, \nyou don't want Government coming in and saying yes, no, come in with \nthat procedure. I feel the same way, generally. But as I opened up, I \nsaid there are certain ethical bounds and, yes, as a profession, we \ntake certain oaths. One of them is the Hippocratic oath of doing no \nharm. But there is a certain ethical boundary and framework that, no \nmatter who or what you are, you never go outside. But we have people \ngoing outside those ethical bounds. I argue that they are hurting \nwomen, when alternative procedures that are much safer are available. \nThus, we must put a stop to that. And because it is performed every \nday, and it is outside of the ethical bounds, we are obligated to \nredefine those bounds in this particular case.\n\n  The bill says this is a rogue procedure that is never medically \nnecessary and is condemned by the medical community. It has absolutely \nno place in the doctor-patient relationship. This is where the myth \ncomes in, because that relationship is built on trust. That is the \nwhole essence of the relationship between a woman and her physician, or \na patient and a doctor. That trust has got to be built on moral \nbehavior. What makes medicine a profession is this body of professional \nethics, coupled with the specialized knowledge; and this goes outside \nthe bounds of that framework of ethics, of morality.\n  Thus, I argue that this procedure, performed as it is across this \ncountry today, is offensive, is repulsive to this whole concept of the \ndoctor-patient relationship, which is built on trust and moral \nbehavior. This procedure is not moral.\n  People have made comments, ``Where is the AMA?'' There have been \nstatements that the AMA does not oppose partial-birth abortion, or \ndoes. Let me just say the American Medical Association has supported \nthis ban in the past. They oppose this specific procedure in this bill \nbetter, I would say, because it is more specifically defined than in \nthe past bills; they oppose this specific procedure.\n  People say, well, the AMA is not out there saying this is the \ngreatest bill on earth today. That is because it goes back to what I \nsaid, that they don't like the idea of anybody coming in and telling a \nprofessional what to do and what not to do. Let me leap back to what I \nsaid, and then I will go back.\n  The people who invented the procedure are not surgeons. They are not \nboard certified. They operate outside the peer-reviewed literature. You \ncannot really go and find--because it is not accepted--this particular \nprocedure in the peer-reviewed literature, which shows a certain amount \nof acceptance and respect in the mainstream community. It is simply not \nthere.\n  The fourth myth I want to comment on is that some say making these \nspecific techniques of partial-birth abortion a crime would make \nperforming all late-term abortions almost impossible, and it would \ndiscourage doctors from performing legal abortions in all \ncircumstances. I put this second to last\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nin terms of the myths. I oppose abortions, but for those people who \nbelieve in abortions, it is important for them to know this is a myth. \nI can say that because in the bill, the partial-birth abortion is very \nspecifically and tightly worded and described, so that the ban, or the \nprohibition, would be just on the techniques that were described \nearlier and that have been pictorially described on the floor of the \nSenate--that is, the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  There are alternative procedures, and I also find those offensive; \nbut some people do not find them offensive. Those would still be legal. \nSo this idea that a very tightly worded ban on a specific procedure, \nwhich is a subset of other types of procedures that are done, would \nstop, would make all abortions illegal, is simply not true. Again, I \ncome back to those alterative methods are safer.\n  The fifth and last myth is that some say partial-birth abortion is \naccepted as mainstream medicine. That is not true. This is a fringe \nprocedure. It is not found in the common medical gynecological \ntextbooks, obstetrics textbooks that our medical students are taught \nwith today. It is not taught in medical schools or surgical residency \nprograms. It is outside the mainstream. If one looks at all the \nobstetrics and gynecologic residency programs, only 7 percent provide \nroutine training for even mainstream third-trimester or late abortions. \nThat is only 7 percent. To the best of my knowledge, none--none--in the \nresidency programs teaches or would teach this specifically described \npartial-birth abortion procedure.\n\n  Today's doctors are simply not trained with this procedure--yet we \nhave people performing it--because it is dangerous, because it is a \nrogue procedure, and because it is outside the mainstream of generally \naccepted medical and surgical practice.\n  I will mention one last time, the most prominent practitioners of \npartial-birth abortions are not trained obstetricians, but are general \npractitioners. Partial-birth abortion is an affront to the safe and \nreputable practice of medicine.\n  The question often arises as to how often these abortions, using this \ntechnique, are performed. It is hard to get good data, but if we look \nat the data that is provided and that we can collect, it is not as \nuncommon a practice as one might think.\n  In 1996, the research arm of Planned Parenthood asked doctors for the \nfirst time a question on partial-birth abortion. The question produced \nan estimate at that point in time, 1996, that 650 such abortions were \nperformed using this technique annually in the United States. The same \nsurvey found that in the year 2000, over 2,200 partial-birth abortions \nwere performed in the United States--2,200 deaths purposely caused by \nthis technique, by this rogue procedure. That is why we have this call \nto action which we have debated on this floor now in this Congress and, \nindeed, in the last Congress and in the Congress before that.\n  An interesting side piece of data is that Kansas, the only State that \nrequires separate reporting for partial-birth abortions, in 1999 said \n182 procedures of partial-birth abortion were performed on viable \nfetuses. Of interest to all, 182 of those procedures were performed for \nmental health reasons, but not for physical health reasons--not for \nphysical health reasons. It is important to understand because we have \nan exclusion for life of the mother, but none of those was performed \nfor life of the mother. Why? Because there are alternative procedures \nthat are safer and quicker and less invasive for the mother.\n  A vast majority of Americans support a ban on partial-birth abortion. \nTheir will was reflected in the 104th Congress and in the 105th \nCongress, and in both of those Congresses the House of Representatives \npassed this ban and the Senate passed this ban. Sadly, both of those \nefforts were vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Today, partial-birth abortion remains the law of the land, and we are \ngoing to change that. It is going to be changed in this body, and \nhopefully we can complete this bill tomorrow night and then move to the \nHouse of Representatives and then a bill will be sent to the President \nwhich I expect will be signed.\n  Partial-birth abortion is a morally offensive procedure. It is time \nto ban it. We as a society respect human life far too much to let it be \nravaged in such an inhumane way: a living infant partially delivered, \nstabbed with 8-inch scissors, emptied of the contents of its skull, and \nthen pulled from its mother dead. Never has this procedure been the \nonly or the best one available to protect the health of the mother. In \nfact, as I pointed out, partial-birth abortion carries a greater risk \nof doing harm. That is why this procedure is morally offensive to \ndoctors, not only as individuals but as professionals.\n\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues, as we debate this bill, that we do \nso with the barbaric reality, with the brutal reality of this heinous \nprocedure in mind, and not be sidetracked by the myths of partial-birth \nabortion, especially that would in any way imply that this is an \naccepted mainstream medical procedure. It simply is not.\n  Instead, we need to ask one simple question: Does partial-birth \nabortion carry the danger of doing unnecessary harm to a mother, to an \ninfant, and to our conscience as a nation that values the sanctity of \nhuman life? The answer is yes. That is how I will vote, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a \nquestion without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. How did I vote on this question the last time we voted?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will find out shortly how the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia did vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am informed that in the 106th Congress, \nthe Senator from West Virginia voted yes to ban this procedure.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. President, I see two other Senators here who have been waiting. I \nhave the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I hope I can yield to the distinguished \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer--for how long?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Ten minutes, without losing my right to the floor, and then \nI may yield to the distinguished Senator from Ohio, my next-door \nneighbor, for 15 minutes, without losing my right to the floor, and \nthat I will then be recognized as I am now recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Chair please inform me when I have a minute \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when a bill that deals with a medical \nprocedure comes before the Senate, that in itself is very rare. When a \nbill comes before the Senate that bans a medical procedure that many \nwomen have stated saved their lives, preserved their fertility, stopped \nthem from having a severe health impact, I think it is important to \nturn to the people who know the most about this, and that is the OB/\nGYNs who choose, as their way of life, delivering children, who get \ntheir satisfaction in their work by staying close to a pregnant woman \nand seeing her through a pregnancy.\n  Hearing Senator Frist's comments is very interesting to me, but I \nhave to say I have read his bio, and there is nothing in here about \ndelivering babies. Maybe he did when he was in school or as a resident. \nBut what we are talking about here is OB/GYNs. What do they think? Why \nis that important? Because that is their life.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what the OB/GYNs say:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion does not exist.\n\n  They are not the only ones who say that. The fact is the Supreme \nCourt said that. They said the bill is so\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\nvague; it made up a term, ``partial-birth abortion.''\n  There is no such thing as partial-birth abortion, a very emotional \nterm. But what we are talking about is a procedure that is used in a \nsituation where any other procedure might cause grave harm to the \nwoman.\n  Now, the AMA does not support S. 3. I hope Senator Frist is aware of \nthis. He is busy talking, which is fine, but I ask unanimous consent \nthat the AMA statement that says they do not support S. 3 because it \nincludes a provision that would impose a criminal penalty on physicians \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                   March 10, 2003.\n       The Senate is considering a bill that would ban the \n     procedure known as intact dilation and extraction, more \n     commonly referred to as partial birth abortion. The American \n     Medical Association (AMA) has previously stated our \n     opposition to this procedure. We have not changed our \n     position regarding the use of this procedure.\n       The AMA also has long-standing policy opposing legislation \n     that would criminalize medical practice or procedure. Since \n     S. 3 includes a provision that would impose a criminal \n     penalty on physicians performing intact dilation and \n     extraction, the AMA does not support this bill.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I want to tell a story. My colleagues have an \nartist's rendering, but I want to show a photograph of a woman named \nCoreen Costello. I want my colleagues to listen to this because it is \nnot a made-up picture. It is a real picture of a real family and a real \nwoman. Why don't my colleagues listen to it because I think this is \nwhat we are supposed to be about, real people facing real problems and \nwhat we are about to do by passing radical legislation, which is \nunconstitutional on its face. It did not even go to the committee. I \nsay to my friends, it did not even go to the Judiciary Committee, \nalthough the Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional. The least they \ncould have done was bring it back to the committee and look at what the \nCourt said, that the definition was broad, it was vague, it could ban \nmore than one procedure and that it had no exception for the health of \na woman.\n  Listen to the story of Coreen Costello. She says:\n\n       I am writing to you on behalf of my family. I have \n     testified before both the Senate and the House concerning the \n     so-called partial-birth abortion ban. I have personal \n     experience with this issue for at 30 weeks pregnant I had a \n     procedure that would be banned by this legislation. When I \n     was 7 months pregnant, an ultrasound revealed that our third \n     child, a darling baby girl, was dying. She had a lethal \n     neurological disorder and had been unable to move any part of \n     her tiny body for almost 2 months. Her muscles had stopped \n     growing and her vital organs were failing. Her lungs were so \n     undeveloped, they barely existed. Her head was swollen with \n     fluid and her little body was stiff and rigid. She was unable \n     to swallow amniotic fluid and as a result, the excess fluid \n     was puddling in my uterus. When we learned about our baby's \n     condition, we sought out many specialists and educated \n     ourselves. Our doctors, five in all, agreed that our little \n     girl would come prematurely and there was no doubt that she \n     would not survive. It was not a matter of our daughter being \n     affected by a severe disability--her condition was fatal. Our \n     physicians discussed our options with us. When they mentioned \n     terminating the pregnancy, we rejected it out of hand.\n\n  I want my colleagues to hear this, and I ask that there be order in \nthe Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have listened to my colleagues, and I would appreciate \nit if they would hear a story of a woman named Coreen Costello, because \nif this procedure were to be banned--and I see that Dr. Frist has left \nthe floor--this woman could have died. But they leave the floor, and \nthat is their prerogative.\n  This is what Careen Costello writes:\n\n       We are Christians and we are conservative. We believe \n     strongly in the rights, value and sanctity of the unborn. \n     Abortion was simply not an option we would ever consider. \n     This was our daughter. Instead, we wanted our baby to come in \n     God's time and we did not want to interfere. We chose to go \n     into labor naturally. It was difficult to face life knowing \n     we were going to lose our baby but it became our mission to \n     make the last days of her life as special as possible. We \n     asked our pastor to baptize her in utero. We named her \n     Katherine Grace. Another ultrasound determined Katherine's \n     position in my womb. It was not conducive for delivery. Her \n     spine was so contorted it was as if she was doing a swan \n     dive, the back of her feet almost touching the back of her \n     head. Her head and feet were at the top of my uterus. Her \n     stomach was over my cervix. Due to swelling, her head was \n     already larger than that of a full-term baby.\n\n  I say to my friends, this is real life. This is a situation of a \nwoman who never, ever wanted an abortion. She said:\n\n       As my condition worsened, we again considered our options. \n     Natural birth or induced labor were not possible. We \n     considered a cesarean but the experts felt the risk to my \n     health and my life were too great.\n\n  We have a bill before us that makes no exception for the health of \nthe woman. I was in the Chamber yesterday. We had a very tough debate, \nand the question was asked, How low can we sink? I have to say, when we \nhear stories such as this, that happen to real people--and if this were \nour daughter or our wife or our aunt, would we not say, save her life \nand her health?\n  The bottom line is this: This woman had the procedure that would have \nbeen banned with this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the entire \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Testimony of Coreen Costello\n\n       My name is Coreen Costello and I am writing to you on \n     behalf of my family. I have testified before both the Senate \n     and the House concerning the so-called ``partial birth \n     abortion'' ban and my family was with the President when he \n     vetoed his legislation. I have personal experience with this \n     issue for at 30 weeks pregnant I had a procedure that would \n     be banned by this legislation.\n       On March 24, 1995, when I was seven months pregnant an \n     ultrasound revealed that our third child, a darling baby \n     girl, was dying. She had a lethal neurological disorder and \n     had been unable to move any part of here tiny body for almost \n     two months. Her muscles had stopped growing and her vital \n     organs were failing. Her lungs were so underdeveloped, they \n     barely existed. Her head was swollen with fluid and her \n     little body was stiff and rigid. She was unable to swallow \n     amniotic fluid and as a result, the excess fluid was puddling \n     in my uterus (a condition known as polyhydramnios). When we \n     learned about our baby's condition, we sought out many \n     specialists and educated ourselves to see what we could do to \n     save our child. My husband is a chiropractor and we are very \n     proactive about our health care. We are generally skeptical \n     about the medical profession and would never rely on the \n     advice or diagnosis of just one doctor. However, our doctors \n     (five in all) agreed that our little girl would come \n     prematurely and there was no doubt that she would not \n     survive. It was not a matter of our daughter being affected \n     by a severe disability--her condition was fatal.\n       Our physicians discussed our options with us. When they \n     mentioned terminating the pregnancy, we rejected it out of \n     hand. We are Christians and conservative. We believe strongly \n     in the rights, value and sanctity of the unborn. Abortion was \n     simply not an option we would ever consider. This was our \n     daughter.\n       Instead, we wanted our baby to come on God's time and we \n     did not want to interfere. We chose to go into labor \n     naturally. It was difficult to face life knowing we were \n     losing our baby. But it became our mission to make the last \n     days of her life as special as possible. We wanted her to \n     know she was loved and wanted. We asked our pastor to baptize \n     her in utero. We named her Katherine Grace--Katherine meaning \n     pure, and Grace representing God's mercy.\n       Another ultrasound determined Katherine's position in my \n     womb. It was not conducive for delivery. Her spine was so \n     contorted it was as if she was doing a swan dive, the back of \n     her feet almost touching the back of her head. Her head and \n     feet were at the top of my uterus. Her stomach was over my \n     cervix. Due to swelling, her head was already larger than \n     that of a full term baby. For two weeks I tried exercises in \n     an attempt to change her position, but to no avail. Amniotic \n     fluid continued to puddle into my uterus at a rate of great \n     concern to my doctors. I was carrying an extra nine pounds of \n     fluid. It became increasingly difficult to breathe, to sit or \n     walk. I could not sleep. My health was rapidly deteriorating. \n     My family and friends were much more aware of my health \n     decline than I was. My complete focus was on Katherine.\n       As my condition worsened, we again considered our options. \n     Natural birth or an induced labor were not possible due to \n     her position and the swelling of her head. We considered a \n     Cesarean section, but experts at Cedars-Sinai Hospital felt \n     that the risks to my health and possibly to my life were too \n     great. A Cesarean section is done to save babies. It can be a \n     life saving procedure for a child in stress or one who cannot \n     be delivered vaginally. It is not the safest for a woman. \n     There is an increased mortality rate with Cesarean section. \n     In my case, even if a Cesarean could be done, Katherine would \n     have died the moment the umbilical cord was cut. There was no \n     reason to risk my health or life, if there was no hope of \n     saving Katherine. She would never be able to take a breath.\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\n       Our doctors all agreed that an intact D procedure \n     performed by Dr. James McMahon was the best option. I was \n     devastated. I could not imagine delivering my daughter in an \n     abortion clinic. But Dr. McMahon was an expert in cases \n     similar to mine. My situation and Katherine's condition were \n     not new to him. He explained the procedure to us. My cervix \n     would be gently dilated to maintain its integrity. Once I was \n     dilated enough, Dr. McMahon could begin the procedure. In \n     order for Katherine to be delivered intact, cerebral fluid \n     would be removed, which would allow her head to be delivered \n     without damage to my cervix.\n       It took almost three hours to deliver our daughter. I was \n     given intravenous anesthesia. Due to Katherine's weakened \n     condition, her heart stopped beating during the procedure. \n     She was able to pass away peacefully in my womb.\n       Some who support his bill have stated that I do not fit \n     into the category of someone who had a so-called ``partial \n     birth abortion'' because I contend my baby died while still \n     in my womb. Is this relevant? When the procedure began, her \n     heart was still beating--who could predict for certain when \n     she would actually pass away? If this legislation were \n     passed, an intact D would not have been an option for me. \n     The fact is, I had the procedure outlined in this \n     legislation. Since I present the procedure as humane, \n     dignified, and necessary, somehow this means I must have had \n     a different procedure and am not relevant to this bill. This \n     is simply not true.\n       I come to you with no political motivation, rather I come \n     with the truth. I have experience of an intact D Some want \n     you to believe their horrific version of this procedure. They \n     have never experienced an intact D I have. This procedure \n     allowed me to deliver my daughter intact. My husband and I \n     were able to see and hold our daughter. I will never forget \n     the time I had with her, nor will I forget her precious face. \n     Having this time with her allowed us to start the grieving \n     process. I don't know how we would have coped if we had not \n     been able to hold her. Moreover, because I delivered her \n     intact, experts in fetal anomalies and genetics could study \n     her condition. This enabled them to determine that her \n     condition was not genetic. This was crucial for us in \n     deciding whether or not to have another child.\n       No one predict how a baby's anomalies will affect a woman's \n     pregnancy. Every situation is different. We cannot tie the \n     hands of physicians in these life and health saving matters. \n     It is simply not right.\n       With my health maintained, my cervix intact and my uterus \n     whole, we were able to have another child. On June 4, we were \n     blessed with a beautiful healthy baby boy. He is our delight! \n     He is not a replacement for his sister. There will always be \n     a hole in our hearts where Katherine Grace should be. He is, \n     to us, a sign that life goes on. We cherish every moment we \n     have with Tucker, and with our two other children, Chad and \n     Carlyn. What precious gifts God has given to us.\n       Losing our daughter was the hardest thing we have \n     experienced. It's been difficult to come to Washington and \n     relive our loss. And it's ironic that I, with my profound \n     pro-life views, would be defending an abortion procedure. God \n     knows I pray for the day when no other woman will need this \n     procedure. But until there is a cure for the cruel disorders \n     that can affect babies, women must have access to this \n     important medical option.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. She concludes:\n\n       Losing our daughter was the hardest thing we have ever \n     experienced. It has been difficult to come to Washington and \n     relive our loss.

The Senator from California has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In conclusion, in my last minute, I have told this story \nbecause what we are about to do, unless we adopt several of the \namendments we will be offering, would mean that another woman such as \nthis, another beautiful family such as this, might find that the woman \nhas life-threatening illnesses if, in fact, she cannot have the \nprocedure: hemorrhaging, uterine rupture, blood clots, embolism, \nstroke, damage to nearby organs, paralysis. This is what physicians \ntell us happens to women.\n  So my colleagues have a picture, and that is fine, although I have to \nsay I hope the pages who feel a little queasy on this will not be \nforced to stay in the Chamber, but we are dealing with a circumstance \nthat affects real people and these are the things that can happen to \nthese women. I believe we have to have a voice, and the Murray \namendment should pass because the Murray amendment would mean that \nwomen can have access to contraception and that abortion would become \nsafe, legal, and rare.\n  I yield the floor back to Senator Byrd, who I believe has the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio now has 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I will continue the debate in regard to \nthe partial-birth abortion ban. This afternoon, I will talk about the \nconstitutionality of this statute, S. 3. The argument has been made \nthat this statute is unconstitutional, but I differ with my colleagues \nwho make this argument.\n  Reference has been made to the Stenberg case that overturned the \nNebraska partial-birth abortion law. I argue that the law in front of \nus, or the statute in front of us, is fundamentally different.\n  First, the language is different. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \nof 2003 provides a very precise definition of partial-birth abortion so \nthat it is clear on the face of the legislation exactly what procedure \nis to be banned, unlike the Nebraska statute that was declared \nunconstitutional.\n  The bill would outlaw one, and only one, abortion procedure, and that \nis the D procedure, the partial-birth procedure we have been \ndescribing in very vivid detail on the Senate floor, the procedure that \nno one really can argue is anything less than barbaric and inhumane.\n  There is absolutely nothing vague, unclear, or ambiguous about how \nthis bill defines the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  To make this even more clear, it is useful to examine the law struck \ndown by the Supreme Court in the Stenberg case. The procedure was \ndefined in that case by the Nebraska Legislature as follows, and I will \nread from that Nebraska law that was found to be unconstitutional, to \nshow its difference from this law:\n\n       An abortion procedure in which the person performing the \n     abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child \n     before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.\n\n  That is what the Nebraska law said. The phrase ``partially delivers \nvaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child'' was \nfurther defined in the Nebraska statute as follows:\n\n       Deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a \n     living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for \n     the purpose of performing a procedure; that the person \n     performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child \n     and does kill the unborn child.\n\n  The Supreme Court held this language of the Nebraska statute covered \nmore than just one abortion procedure. The definition used in the \nNebraska statute implicated not only partial-birth abortion procedures, \nbut it also implicated the more common dilation and evacuation or D \nmethods, which is different from a D method we are dealing with in \nthis statute.\n  For the record, a D, according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, is described as follows:\n\n       D involves the dilation of the cervix and the \n     dismemberment of the fetus inside the uterus. The fetal parts \n     are later removed from the uterus either with forceps or by \n     suction.\n\n  In other words, in a D procedure, an unborn child is essentially \ndismembered, limb by limb, piece by piece. During a D, an arm or leg \nis sometimes pulled into the birth canal before being twisted off, \nwhile the baby is still alive. The Justices thought this might be \nconsidered a partial-birth abortion under the Nebraska law definition \nbecause that definition, as I have just stated, includes any procedure \nin which a baby is delivered vaginally, even if that vaginal delivery \nis just a partial delivery.\n  At this point, it is worth repeating exactly how a partial-birth \nabortion procedure, again also known as a D procedure, is \ndistinguished from a D procedure. The D or partial-birth abortion \nprocedure was very well described by U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nClarence Thomas in his dissent in the Stenberg case.\n  This is what Justice Thomas wrote:\n\n       After dilating the cervix, the physician will grab the \n     fetus by its feet and pull the fetal body out of the uterus \n     into the vaginal cavity . . . While the fetus is stuck in \n     this position, dangling partly out of the woman's body, and \n     just a few inches from a completed birth, the physician uses \n     an instrument such as a pair of scissors to tear or perforate \n     the skull. The physician will then either crush the skull or \n     will use a vacuum to remove the brain and other intracranial \n     contents from the fetal skull, collapse the fetus' head and \n     pull the fetus from the uterus.\n\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n\n  That is depicted in a later phase of this procedure in this picture.\n  In order to avoid any possibility of confusion, the bill before the \nSenate, S. 3, defines the phrase ``partial-birth abortion'' so narrowly \nthat only the D abortion procedure is covered. No other abortion \nprocedures--including the D procedure in which an unborn baby's arm \nor leg is pulled into the birth canal before being twisted off--could \npossibly be implicated by S. 3.\n\n  While we have already heard it read on the Senate floor during the \ndebate, while I read it last night in this debate, I think it is \nimportant to again repeat the bill's definition of the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. According to the definition in this bill, S. 3:\n\n       (1) the term 'partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in \n     which----\n       (A) the person performing the abortion deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the \n     case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is \n     outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech \n     presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is \n     outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing \n     an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially \n     delivered living fetus; and\n       (B) performs the overt act, other than completion of \n     delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus;\n\n  My colleague from California and others have argued that the S. 3 \ndefinition of a partial-birth abortion still covers more than one \nabortion procedure. But she has never explained how this is possible. \nThe description of partial-birth abortion in S. 3 is so precise and is \nbased, frankly, on the description of a leading abortionist, Dr. Mark \nHaskell, a man about whom I spoke last night on the Senate floor, a man \nwho regularly conducts these heinous procedures in my home State of \nOhio. This is a very precise definition of a partial-birth abortion \nthat leads absolutely nothing to the imagination.\n  Clearly, without question, S. 3 very precisely and very specifically \naddresses the first constitutional issue that was raised in the \nStenberg case and is fundamentally different than the Nebraska statute \nthat was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. S. 3 \nwould ban one and only one very specific abortion procedure. It simply \nimposes absolutely no undue burden on a woman's ability to obtain an \nabortion.\n  Let me turn now to the second issue, the second constitutional issue, \nand that is the health of the mother, which was the other issue raised \nin the Stenberg case. The so-called requirement that the statute must \ncontain ``the health of the mother'' also springs from the notion of \nundue burden on the woman's ability to get an abortion.\n  The argument, as I understand, goes something like this: If a \nprocedure is medically important to protect the health of the mother, \nbanning that procedure would pose an undue burden on her ability to \nhave an abortion. Yet in the case of the partial-birth abortion, \nmedical experts have repeatedly confirmed that this callous act is \nnever medically indicated. And because it is never medically indicated, \nbanning it cannot possibly be an undue burden.\n  There is substantial evidence from past congressional hearings on \nthis issue to support a finding obtained in the bill itself, and the \nbill makes these findings. It says in part, the following: Rather than \nbeing an abortion procedure that is embraced by the medical community, \npartial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is not only \nunnecessary to protect the health of the mother but, in fact, poses \nserious risk to the long-term health of women and, in some \ncircumstances, their lives.\n  I remind my colleagues of a 1996 interview in which the former U.S. \nSurgeon General, C. Everett Koop, explicitly discussed partial-birth \nabortion. In that interview, a reporter for American Medical News posed \nthe following question. This is what the interviewer asked.\n\n       President Clinton just vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth \n     abortions, a late-term abortion technique that practitioners \n     refer to as intact dilation and evacuation or dilation and \n     extraction. In so doing, he cited several cases in which \n     women were told these procedures were necessary to preserve \n     their health and their ability to have future pregnancies. \n     How would you characterize the claims being made in favor of \n     the medical need for this procedure?\n\n  Dr. Koop responded as follows:\n\n       I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late term abortions because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late term abortion as described, you know, \n     partial-birth, and then destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born, is a medical necessity for the \n     mother.\n\n  Similarly, in 1997 a House committee report on the subject cited over \n400 OB/GYN and maternal/fetal specialists who have unequivocally \nstated:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true. The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and her \n     fertility.\n\n  The majority leader of the Senate, a medical doctor, gave us, a few \nmoments ago, the benefit of his wisdom, of his experience on this \nissue. The point I believe is worth repeating because it is notable \nthat so many doctors are willing to come right out and say: No, this is \nabsolutely not necessary; we can never find one instance in which it is \nmedically indicated.\n  Doctors usually don't say things like this. They just don't like \nbeing that definite because medicine, by definition, is usually a case-\nby-case situation, a case-by-case profession. But this issue is \ndifferent. On this issue, it is crystal clear, partial-birth abortions \nserve no legitimate medical purpose that cannot be served by other \nmeans. As my colleague from Pennsylvania stated earlier today:\n\n       Over the past several years the Senate advocates of \n     partial-birth abortion have never produced even one case in \n     which a partial-birth abortion is shown to be medically \n     necessary.\n\n  Opponents of this bill go beyond just arguing about the merits of \npartial-birth abortion. They go further, probably because it is so \ngruesome that some of my colleagues are uncomfortable supporting it. \nSome of my colleagues would prefer to debate the issue of abortion more \ngenerally. They try to cast this debate as a debate about a broader \nissue, and that issue is reproductive freedom. But the issue before us \ntoday is not reproductive freedom; it is a much more narrow issue. The \nissue is very narrowly defined. It is simply the issue of partial-birth \nabortion. The issue before us is the very specific method of partial-\nbirth abortion, a method that is particularly brutal and gruesome and \nwrong.\n  Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse who observed Dr. Haskell use \nthe procedure to abort three babies in 1993, testified before our \nSenate Judiciary Committee in 1995. I would like to share with my \ncolleagues what she said because she gave very gripping, very telling \ntestimony.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Nurse Shafer described a partial-birth abortion she \nwitnessed on a child of 26.5 weeks, and this is what she said:\n\n       Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so \n     that he could see the baby. On their ultrasound screen I \n     could see the heart beat. As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on \n     the ultrasound screen, the baby's heartbeat was clearly \n     visible on the ultrasound screen.\n       Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's \n     legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he \n     delivered the baby's body and arms. Everything but the head. \n     The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. The baby's \n     little fingers were clasping and unclasping and his little \n     feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the \n     back of his head and the baby's arms jerked out like a \n     startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he \n     thinks he is going to fall. The doctor opened up the \n     scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, \n     sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely \n     limp. He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. \n     He threw the baby in a pan along with the placenta and the \n     instruments he had just used. I saw the baby move in the pan. \n     I asked another nurse and she said it was just reflexes. That \n     baby boy had the most perfect angelic face I think I have \n     ever seen in my life.\n\n  As stated in a House committee report containing the transcript of \nthis nurse's testimony:\n\n       The only difference between the partial-birth abortion \n     procedure and infanticide is a mere 3 inches.\n\n  Three inches between life and death, between murder and lawful \naction, is clearly not enough. The time to ban this procedure once and \nfor all is now. We cannot in good conscience let this\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\nbarbaric procedure continue to be legal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Has the Pastore rule \nrun its course today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. It has. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I shall speak out of order, not long. My guess is that \nI will speak for 20 minutes or less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chaffee). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United Nations is in diplomatic disarray \ntoday as the foreign ministers from the world's most powerful nations \nscramble to find some scrap of common ground on the question of war \nwith Iraq.\n  What a difference a few months makes. Last November, under the \nleadership of the United States, the 15-member U.N. Security Council \nunanimously approved Resolution 1441, strengthening the weapons \ninspection regime and giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with \nits disarmament obligations.\n  The rapidity with which that unity has unraveled is astounding. What \nbegan as a constructive process to gain international support for war \nagainst Iraq has disintegrated into insults, accusations, and finger-\npointing among the key members of the Security Council. Instead of \nforging an international coalition to deal with Iraq, as it set out to \ndo, the Administration has managed to turn much world opinion against \nUnited States. With his insistence that the United Nations declare the \ninspection regime a failure and immediately authorize war against Iraq, \nthe President has opened a chasm between the U.S. and Great Britain on \none side and the remaining permanent members of the Security Council on \nthe other.\n  Today, the White House is declaring the United Nations irrelevant--\none of the most over used words in the English language as of today, I \nwould say, and as of the last several days.\n  Today, the White House is declaring the United Nations irrelevant if \nit does not authorize immediate war against Iraq, and U.N. Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan is countering that a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq \nwithout the sanction of the United Nations will violate the U.N. \ncharter.\n  The knock-down, drag-out in the Security Council has tarnished the \nimages of both the United Nations and the United States, and it has \nimperiled the political career of at least one world leader, one \nforemost leader, President Bush's staunchest ally, British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair.\n  What a high price to pay for the President's insistence on blindly \nfollowing a war-first, war-now policy on Iraq. What a high price to \npay.\n  Despite feverish activity this week on the part of the U.S. and Great \nBritain to persuade a majority of members of the Security Council to \nsupport a second resolution authorizing war with Iraq, the President \nand his chief advisers have made it clear that the activity is merely \nwindow dressing and that the United States is prepared to act with or \nwithout U.N. support. For the Bush Administration, war with Iraq seems \nto be no longer a question of if, but when and the window on ``when'' \nis rapidly closing.\n  Dr. Condoleezza Rice, the President's National Security Advisor, \ndeclared over the weekend, ``There is plenty of authority to act. We \nare trying very hard to have the Security Council one more time affirm \nthat authority. But it's important to know that we believe the \nauthority is there.''\n  In other words, the die has been cast. As Caesar said when he crossed \nthe Rubicon, ``the die is cast.'' The rhetoric has hardened. U.S. \nforces are in place and poised to attack. The U.N. Security Council has \nbeen relegated to a classic Greek chorus of tragic protest while the \nUnited States takes center stage. The President has stopped listening.\n  The administration's strategy for war with Iraq is so far advanced \nthat not only does the President have war plans on his desk, he also \nhas a blueprint for the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.\n  On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development is soliciting bids from a handful of U.S. \nfirms for a contract worth as much as $900 million to begin the \nreconstruction of Iraq. According to the Journal, the contract would be \nthe largest reconstruction effort undertaken by the United States since \nthe reconstruction of Germany and Japan after World War II.\n  With post-war contracts already in hand, can the onset of war be far \nbehind?\n  My views, by now, are well known. I believe this coming war is not a \nnecessity. I believe it is a grave mistake, not because Saddam Hussein \ndoes not deserve to be disarmed or driven from power, not because some \nof our allies object to war, but because Iraq does not pose an imminent \ndirect threat to the security of the United States. There is no \nquestion that the United States has the military might to defeat Saddam \nHussein. There is no question about that. But we are on much shakier \nground when it comes to the question of why this Nation, the United \nStates, under the current circumstances, is rushing to unleash the \nhorrors of war on the people of Iraq.\n  In many corners of the world, the United States is seen as \nmanufacturing a crisis in Iraq, not responding to one. Key members of \nthe U.N. Security Council, including France and Russia, have vowed to \nveto any move to secure the imprimatur of the U.N. on war with Iraq. \nThe U.N. weapons inspectors have pleaded for more time to do their \nwork. Citizens by the thousands--nay, by the hundreds of thousands--\nhave taken to the streets in countries around the globe, including the \nUnited States, Europe, and the Middle East, to protest the war.\n  The day after the September 11 terrorist attacks on America, the \nFrench newspaper Le Monde proclaimed, ``We are all Americans!'' \nEighteen months later, the United States and France are hurling insults \nat each other, and the French are leading the opposition to the war \nagainst Iraq. In country after country, the United States has seen the \noutpouring of compassion and support that followed September 11 \ndissolve into anger and resentment at this Administration's heavy-\nhanded attempts to railroad the world into supporting a questionable \nwar with Iraq.\n  The latest report of the U.N. weapons inspectors only heightened the \ntensions in the Security Council and helped to precipitate the current \nscramble for a new resolution. On Friday--March 7--chief U.N. weapons \ninspector Hans Blix reported progress in the disarmament of Iraq and \npredicted that the inspection process could be completed in months--\n``not years, nor weeks, but months.''\n  At the same meeting, Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, threw cold water on a key assertion \nof the Bush administration, that Iraq is actively pursuing a nuclear \ncapability on two fronts--by importing high-strength aluminum tubes \nwhich could be used as part of a centrifuge to produce enriched uranium \nand by attempting to buy uranium from Niger. Dr. ElBaradei said the \ninspectors have found no evidence--none--that Iraq is attempting to \nrevive its nuclear weapons program, concluding that the aluminum tubes \nwere for a rocket engine program, as Iraq claimed, and that the \ndocuments used to establish the Niger connection were faked.\n  Not even reports of a chilling discovery by U.N. weapons inspectors \nof a new type of rocket in Iraq that appears to be designed to carry \nchemical or biological agents has swayed the hardening opposition in \nthe United Nations to authorizing an immediate war against Iraq.\n  The world is awash in anti-Americanism. The doctrine of preemption \nenshrined in the Bush administration's national security strategy the \npolicy on which the war with Iraq is predicated has turned the global \nimage of the United States from that of a world class peacemaker into \nwhat many believe is dangerous warmonger.\n  The President is on the wrong track in insisting on rushing into war \nwithout the support of the international community, and specifically \nthe United Nations. Not only is America's reputation on the line, but \nso is our war on terror. The recent arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed \nand two of\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nhis cohorts in Pakistan is evidence that the United States is making \nslow but steady progress in dismantling the al-Qaida organization, and \nthat we are reaping huge dividends from the anti-terrorism efforts we \nhave undertaken in cooperation with other nations in the Middle East.\n  Pakistan's cooperation is particularly important in the war on \nterror, and yet the majority of the Pakistani people are opposed to war \nwith Iraq. How or whether Pakistani opposition to the war against Iraq \nwill affect the war against terror is one of many unknowns.\n  The United States cannot bring down al-Qaida alone. We need support \nand cooperation from friendly nations in the region. We risk losing \ntheir friendship, and possibly causing major upheavals in the Middle \nEast, if the President defies world opinion and launches a U.S. led \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the al-Qaida front, we have just captured supposedly \nthe third ranking person in al-Qaida.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We were able to do that because of cooperation from \nPakistan.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Just to underscore the Senator's point about the \nnecessity of having the cooperation of other countries to deal with the \nterrorism threat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Undoubtedly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yet Pakistan, which has been trying to work with us, \nhas already announced that at best they will abstain at the Security \nCouncil with respect to the coming vote because it is applying such \ntremendous internal pressure in Pakistan that there is some danger that \nthis Government that has been working with us may not survive and may \ncollapse.\n  Mr. BYRD. Unquestionably.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't that a dramatic example of the kind of problem \nthe Senator is talking about that is being created for us around the \nworld?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is a dramatic example and a most somber and chilling \none. I thank the distinguished Senator for his observation.\n  The President may be lucky. We may be lucky. If we launch this war on \nIraq, we may be lucky. I hope we will be. But we may not be.\n  The cost of war and the potential casualties--not only to American \nmilitary personnel but also to innocent civilians in and around Iraq--\nare unknowns. The impact of war on the fragile fabric of the Middle \nEast is also unknown. The administration seems to think that war with \nIraq will pave the way to peace and democracy in the Middle East, but I \nbelieve that is merely wishful thinking. Saddam Hussein is not the \ncause of the strife between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and \nSaddam Hussein's downfall will not erase the deeply rooted conflict \nbetween the two sides.\n  War against Iraq may prove to be a fatal distraction from the war on \nterror. It could be. The danger to Americans today is from al-Qaida. \nIntelligence officials predict that war with Iraq will precipitate a \nnew wave of terrorism against the United States and its allies and will \nserve as a powerful recruiting tool for anti-American extremists.\n  We need to keep the pressure on al-Qaida. We need to strengthen our \ndefenses against a terrorist attack here at home. We need to focus the \nresources of our Nation on the war on terror and dismantle the al-Qaida \nnetwork before it can mount another catastrophic attack on the United \nStates.\n  The hour is late; the clock is ticking. But if the President would \nonly listen to voices outside his war cabinet of superhawks, he might \ndiscover that it is not too late to stop the rush to war. There is \nstill a chance that Saddam Hussein can be disarmed and neutralized \nshort of war. As long as that possibility exists, the United States \nshould drop its resistance to any slowdown in the march to war and \nshould begin to talk with, and listen to, the other members of the \nSecurity Council.\n  The prospect of regaining unanimity within the United Nations on the \nquestion of Iraq is dim at best, but as long as there remains even a \nglimmer of hope, it is in the best interests of both the United States \nand the other members of the Security Council to regroup and strive to \nachieve that goal. The world community deserves nothing less.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield without losing my right to the floor. I am \nabout finished.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to say, before asking my question to the \nSenator from West Virginia, if the American people are looking for a \ndebate on the war in Iraq, the looming possibility of war in Iraq--\n  Mr. BYRD. They have been looking for one. They have been entitled to \none. And now they have received one.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The only place they can find it is in the House of \nCommons in London--\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank God.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And from the desk of the Senator from West Virginia and \ntwo or three other souls who come to this floor to raise the issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank Providence again.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say a commendation to the Senator from West Virginia. \nThank you for your leadership in bringing us to this debate. I ask you, \nto make certain this point is clear on the record, is it the position \nof the Senator from West Virginia that we all believe the world would \nbe a safer place without weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, even \nwithout the leadership of Saddam Hussein, but that in order to be \nstrong in our war on terrorism, we need the cooperation of countries \nall around the world which now are questioning our wisdom in pursuing \nthis war in Iraq?\n  Mr. BYRD. Indubitably, that is the way I see it. That is my opinion. \nI believe there is ample evidence of that fact. The world itself at \nlarge wishes to see that, wants to see that and hopes for that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might also ask the Senator from West Virginia, is the \npoint he is making that if we stay working with the United Nations on a \ncommon plan to disarm Iraq and if it fails and we ultimately join with \nthe other nations around the world to take whatever action is necessary \nagainst Iraq, we will have a better outcome, not only in terms of the \nmilitary outcome but the responsibility of reconstruction of Iraq? Is \nthat the Senator's point as well?\n  Mr. BYRD. Precisely so and importantly, emphatically on the second \nobservation the Senator has made.\n  In other words, the morning after, what happens in Iraq? What does \nthat cost? If we destroy much of Iraq, we have a responsibility to help \nto rebuild it. That is going to be a tremendous cost. I am afraid this \nadministration has not thought that element through.\n  Moreover, the administration has not told the Congress very much \nabout that, what the cost of that may be, what the administration's \nplans are in that case. I think that is a very soft underbelly of this \nwhole matter.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask one final question. I don't want to \nmischaracterize the Senator's position, but I think what I am about to \nsay he and I share. There is no question in our minds about not only \nthe goodness of the men and women serving in the American military \ntoday and their ability and skill to win any military challenge thrown \ntheir way. I hope the Senator agrees that it is far better for our \nmilitary forces and our Nation, in the long run, for us to show wisdom \nin the decision of how to bring Iraq under control rather than just \ndemonstrate that military strength.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is preeminently correct. Let me add, as ranking \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will never yield to \nanyone when it comes to supporting America's fighting men and women who \nhave been sent abroad, and those at home, once the war begins.\n  I do not believe this war is necessary. But I will support to the \nlast degree the men and women who have to go. They didn't ask to go, \nbut they have to go; they are answering the call. I will support them \non the Appropriations Committee to the furthermost of my ability.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator spoke earlier about the preemption doctrine \nthe administration has put forward.\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nWould the Senator agree that one of the dangers with the enunciation of \nthat doctrine and the path the administration has now been pursuing--\nwhich is to assert that they may take unilateral action instead of \ntrying to work in a cooperative way through international bodies--is \nthat it will set a precedent for other countries around the world to \npursue the same course? After all, here is the predominant superpower \nasserting a doctrine of preemption, apparently prepared to go the \nunilateral path. What is then in the future to prevent some other \nregional power that asserts that it is confronted with some danger, \nfrom some neighbor, from pursuing the same path? Are we not in the \nprocess of setting a very dangerous precedent on the international \nscene in terms of maintaining international peace?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is right on point. This doctrine is exceedingly \ndangerous. It not only will set a precedent, it has set a precedent, as \nwe have seen it begun to be put into play in Iraq. It will be a \nprecedent. There will be a blotch on the escutcheon of the United \nStates from now and until kingdom come. It is a dangerous precedent. \nCan't the Senator see that already it is beginning to have an impact on \nother nations, as we watch North Korea, as we watch Iran--why, those \ncountries and others are going to say, well, if this bully on the block \nis going to do this, we had better get ready and get our things in \norder. Maybe we had better get ready to hit him or others within our \nreach. This is a genie that we will regret ever having let out of the \nbottle.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me ask the Senator one final question and be very \nclear. I take it the Senator would agree with me that none of us \nquestions that if we were in imminent danger of being struck, we would \nbe warranted in taking measures to protect ourselves against such \ndangers.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. No question about it. The President--whether it is a \nRepublican or a Democrat--has an inherent power under the Constitution. \nIf there is an imminent threat about to be carried out against the \nUnited States, of course, the President has a responsibility and a duty \nto act first.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actually, the U.N. Charter grants the right of self-\ndefense, which would in fact entitle us to act on our own accord if \nconfronted with an imminent danger.\n  Mr. BYRD. No question. But even without the U.N. Charter, we have the \ninherent right. It is under the Constitution. I will be the last person \nto give up on that right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wanted to make that point because some are arguing \nthat somehow we are giving over to someone else the decisionmaking \nauthority, in case we are confronted with an imminent danger, to \nrespond. That is not the case at all. So as we see this situation, that \nis not present. The question becomes how smart and how wise are we in \nexercising this unquestioned power, which we hold now on the \ninternational scene; is that not correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. We are taking a reckless course in advocating \nthis doctrine. It is a nefarious doctrine, and it is scaring the world \nto death today. No wonder we are looked upon as being warmongers. When \nour friends begin to fear us, may I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland--who is one of the foremost thinkers in this body. I have \nbeen in this Congress for 50 years now, and I have seen some thinkers. \nI remember John Pastore, for example, who was a thinker. The Senator \nfrom Maryland is a thinker. The Senator is right on point in what he is \nsaying. This is a dangerous doctrine, a reckless doctrine. When our \nfriends begin to fear us, we are in trouble.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nfor the enormous contribution he has been making. He has been willing \nto speak the truth and raise these very important and serious \nquestions, which I am frank to say I don't think have been given \nadequate attention downtown by the President or by, as the Senator \ncharacterizes it, his war cabinet. This course we are on has tremendous \nimplications in all of the United States.\n  Mr. BYRD. It has vast implications. I will say to the Senator that \nsome of us have trouble going to sleep at night as we ponder this \nquestion. I thank the Senator for his observations today and for the \nservice he has rendered not only to the State of Maryland but to this \ncountry. I think the Framers of the Constitution would be proud of Paul \nSarbanes. I think Paul Sarbanes could very well have been one of the 39 \nsigners of the Constitution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. I would hope the circumstance \nwould be that the Senator from West Virginia would have been presiding \nin the chair, if I may say so.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no problem with the Senator from Utah \ngetting the floor. We have a unanimous consent request we wish to \npropound if the Senator will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished friend \nand colleague from West Virginia. Everybody in this body knows the deep \naffection I have for him and for his feelings, and for his earnest and \nvery important analysis of many of the issues we have had to live with \nover the years. I have deep respect for the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, as well. We came to the Senate together. They are both great \nSenators, in my eyes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield? I \nthank the distinguished Senator. When he speaks of respect for the \nSenator from Maryland and for this Senator, may I say it is mutual. I \nhave great respect for the Senator from Utah. There have been few \noccasions--not many--when we have differed on the floor. I have \ntremendous respect for him, for his leadership, for his dedication to \nhis country, and for his State.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I listened carefully to \nmuch of what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said, and he \nraised a number of very important issues, no question about it. I have \ngreat assurance as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence in \nour President as we are considering one of those issues. It just points \nout how difficult it is to be President of the United States, \nespecially during times of strife and difficulty; how difficult it is \nto make these decisions; how difficult it is to determine what \nimminence really is. Hugo Grotius, the father of international law, \nbasically said imminency is a very hard thing to define.\n  I think the Senator raised a lot of interesting points, but I also \nbelieve the President and his advisers have gone over every one of \nthose points. I wish to mention one problem, and that is, some people \ntry to blame Israel for our positions--not the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia. But some have tried to raise that point and blame \nIsrael. The fact is Israel is important here, but so are all the Arab \nstates. Keep in mind, this man, Saddam Hussein, has weapons of mass \ndestruction. He came within a few weeks of having a nuclear device. We \nall know that. It was a matter of time. They had the ability. They had \nthe capacity. They had the scientists. Who knows how close they are to \nhaving a nuclear device now, because there is no possible way that 100 \ninspectors, or even 1,000 inspectors, whose every action, every word, \neverything they do is monitored by more than 1,000 security people, \nintelligence people.\n  Everybody knows Iraq, being the size of California, it is virtually \nimpossible to be absolutely sure that these inspections are even \nworking. If, in fact, they continue to have--which we know they have--\nbiological and chemical weapons, we know they have certain stores of \nthem. We know pretty much how much they have. But if, in fact, they \nhave a nuclear device, I am going to tell my colleagues, Israel is \nacting very restrained and has throughout these difficulties in the \nMiddle East. I hope they will be able to continue to act restrained. \nThey have one of the best intelligence forces in the world, if not the \nbest, in the Mossad. They are not going to wait if we are not going to \ntake the responsibility of stopping this type of madman with weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  There have been 17 U.N. resolutions that have been ignored--17 of \nthem. We have had over 9, 10, 11 years now of watching him flagrantly \nviolate the U.N. resolutions. I respect my colleagues for their \nthoughtful analysis of\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nthis situation, but I also think there is a thoughtful analysis going \non in the White House, the State Department, at the CIA, and in so many \nother ways.\n\n  With regard to the war on al-Qaida, anybody who thinks that war is \nnot going on and we are not doing everything we possibly can ought to \nlook at Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is the director \nof operations for al-Qaida. We were not just sitting there worrying \nabout Iraq. We were out there actively trying to find Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed. I might add, we found him. We have him in custody now. We are \nlearning a lot from what we found around Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  That battle is ongoing. There is no letup in what we are doing \nagainst terrorism from that perspective. I can personally testify to \nthat.\n  We may be very close to ascertaining the whereabouts of Osama bin \nLaden. So let no one misconstrue, the fact is, this administration is \ndoing a very good job with regard to al-Qaida, with regard to \nterrorism. I happen to believe the administration listens carefully to \nmy distinguished friend from West Virginia, and analyzing and realizing \nthey have thought very carefully about the issues he raises, which are \nimportant issues, issues about which we all have to stop and think.\n  Keep in mind, imminence does not mean we have to wait until a nuclear \ndevice is blowing up New York or Washington, DC, or Los Angeles or \nMiami or Chicago. Imminence means the threat--it can happen tomorrow--\nand that threat is all around us. We know because we have been rounding \nup the people in America who are terrorist threats to us, who would not \nhesitate for a minute to take the lives of every American citizen they \ncould possibly take.\n  I believe right now what we need is to rally together as much as we \ncan. We do need wise men to raise these issues, as my distinguished \nfriend from West Virginia has done, and he has done it continuously \nthroughout his career. Many times he has been right. But I also believe \nthere comes a time when we have to act, too, in the direct care and \nnurturing of our own country.\n  I believe the administration is listening to everything that has been \nsaid by my dear colleagues on the other side, and I think they are \ndoing everything they can to protect this Nation and to protect the \nworld from a third world war.\n  One of the worst happenings would be to leave Israel to have to \ndefend itself over there and to leave the moderate Arab nations to have \nto defend themselves over there. There are a significant number of \nmoderate Arab nations. If they have to go in, then we are really in \nvery dire straits.\n  I mention these points hopefully in a way of helping all of us \nunderstand these are important issues. It is important we discuss them. \nIt is also important we support the administration, which has the \nultimate responsibility, and we do, too, here, no question about it.\n  We have passed a resolution that says we have to do what is in the \nbest interest of our country. I believe this President and his advisers \nare doing that. They have, across the board, people who have \nphilosophical differences in the administration. I think it is a good \nbalance between those in the Defense Department and those in the State \nDepartment. I say with particularity, no one can say Colin Powell goes \nto war willingly, that he goes to war without having thought through \nevery possible problem. No one believes he would risk our young men and \nwomen or our country in any way without thoughtful reflection and \nconsideration.\n  I believe that is true of Donald Rumsfeld, who would be perhaps on \nthe other side of the equation because he has the obligation of making \nsure our military is the best in the world, and that when we have to \ndeploy our military, we do so in a manner that will let anybody know \nthe United States is no pushover, and that you better think twice \nbefore you start taking on our people.\n\n  I respect my colleagues and I respect their viewpoints. I happen to \ndiffer with them on some of them, but the fact is my main difference is \nI believe these viewpoints have been considered and reflected upon by \npeople of good will who, I believe, are trying to do the very best they \ncan. In that regard, I compliment the distinguished Prime Minister of \nEngland who, against some very bad odds and some very difficult times, \nhas stood as a very strong leader in this world. I think he will go \ndown in history as a very strong leader, recognizing the threat of \nterrorism throughout the world, at least in part emanating from Iraq \nand the leadership of Saddam Hussein.\n  I also pay respect to our colleagues and friends in Pakistan who, \nunder very stringent and difficult circumstances, have been willing to \nassist us in the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  At this point, I would like to change the subject.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could we do our UC? I am sorry to interrupt.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 258\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Nickles, I state \nthat the pending amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause an \nincrease in the deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against \nthe amendment pursuant to section 207 of H. Con. Res. 68, the \nconcurrent budget resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, as \namended by S. Res. 304 from the 107th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the pending Murray \namendment 258 occur at 6 p.m. today; that the time prior to the vote be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. We have another unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield to my colleague, without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the disposition of the Murray amendment, Senator Durbin be \nrecognized in order to offer an amendment regarding health exceptions. \nI further ask unanimous consent that following the debate this evening, \nthe amendment be temporarily set aside; provided further that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of S. 3 beginning at 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning, Senator Boxer be recognized in order to offer a motion to \ncommit; further, there be 2 hours equally divided in the usual form, \nand that following that debate the motion be temporarily set aside and \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Durbin amendment for 1 \nadditional hour of debate, equally divided. Finally, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Durbin amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Boxer motion to commit; provided further \nthat no amendments be in order to either the motion or the amendment \nprior to the votes, with 4 minutes equally divided prior to the second \nvote.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we made \nprogress on this most difficult issue today. If this unanimous consent \nagreement is entered, we will have gone at least halfway.\n  There are a couple of other amendments that have been submitted to \nthe majority. We hope they would review those and maybe before the \nnight is out enter into an agreement to have some end game for this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his cooperation, \nand I appreciate the good work. We are making good progress. I \nencourage Members who have statements they would like to make on the \nbill, there will be time in the debate of the Durbin\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\namendment tonight to make those statements, and we encourage Members to \ndo that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be added as a \ncosponsor to this bill, S 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, both requests are agreed \nto.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 3, the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. To begin, I would like to thank \nmy colleague from the State of Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and \napplaud his leadership on this bill particularly, and on this issue \ngenerally, over the years. He is clearly very passionate about it, and \nis also one of the most extremely knowledgeable people anywhere on this \nissue. I respect him and am very proud of the work he has done on this \nissue.\n  I have spoken on the need to ban partial birth abortions many times \nsince we began this effort many years ago. I have done so out of my \npersonal conviction, and also because I am here to represent the people \nof Utah. By a huge margin, Utahns find the practice of partial-birth \nabortion offensive, immoral and impossible to justify as legal in \nAmerica, or anywhere else in the world.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have chaired several \nhearings about partial-birth abortions in past sessions, and I remain \nas convinced as ever that this important legislation is essential and \nwill go a long way toward helping us restore our sense of human dignity \nin this country.\n  This bill does only one thing: it prohibits one particularly gruesome \nabortion procedure--so gruesome that only a handful of doctors are \nwilling to perform it. This procedure is never medically necessary. It \nis simply morally reprehensible, indefensible, and should be banned. I \nhonestly do not know how anyone, after learning of this procedure, \ncould continue to defend it.\n  Those Members of this body who disagree with me, I think they should \nhave to actually watch this procedure being done. Once they have seen \nthe baby's legs kicking while it is being killed--I challenge them to \ndefend it then, because as one can see, the legs and hands are outside, \nand anybody watching will know this is a fully living human being.\n\n  The procedure, known as dilation and extraction--or ``D''--involves \nthe partial delivery of an intact baby into the birth canal. In the \ncase of a breech presentation, the baby is delivered from the feet \nthrough the shoulders so only the head remains in the birth canal. And \nin the case of a head-first presentation, the body's full head is \ndelivered outside the birth mother. Then, either scissors or another \ninstrument are used to stab a hole in the base of the skull. There is \nno doubt that this is a living baby at this point--a baby that feels \npain, make no mistake about it. After the scissors are stabbed into the \nhead a suction catheter is inserted to suck out the baby's brains and \ncollapse the skull. That is about as barbaric as anything I have seen \nor heard.\n  Each time I read the description of this procedure I am sickened. It \nis not done as a mass of tissue but to a living baby capable of feeling \npain and, at the time this procedure is typically performed, capable of \nliving outside of the womb with appropriate medical attention.\n  All this bill would do is ban this grotesque, barbaric procedure. We \nare not talking about the entire framework of abortion rights here but \njust one procedure. And S. 3 also provides an exception for cases where \nthe life of the mother is endangered by a physical disorder, illness or \ninjury.\n  At least 31 States--including my home State of Utah--have enacted \ntheir own partial-birth abortion bans but, sadly, many have not taken \neffect due to temporary or permanent injunctions. S. 3 would create a \nFederal ban on just the D procedure I have described, and it \ncarefully conforms to the constitutional jurisprudence in this area.\n  Now, let me explain how this bill differs slightly from \nprevious versions. A couple of years ago, the Supreme Court handed down \nan opinion in Stenberg v. Carhart, which addressed a partial-birth ban \nin Nebraska. The Stenberg court, relying in part on a dubious trial \ncourt finding that it was forced to accept, struck down the statute.\n\n  In fact, the trial court's finding that partial-birth abortions could \nbe necessary to protect the health of the mother was just wrong, and \nthe findings outlined in S. 3 clarify this point.\n  The record in support of the fact that D is never medically \nnecessary is long. In November, 1995, I presided over a 6\\1/2\\ hour \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing on partial-birth abortions, and we \nalso had a 1997 joint hearing with the Constitution Subcommittee in \nwhich we heard that D is not done for medical reasons.\n  The former U.S. Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop has said:\n\n     . . . in no way can I twist my mind to see that [partial-\n     birth abortion] . . . is a medical necessity for the mother. \n     And it certainly can't be a necessity for the baby.\n\n  And Dr. Daniel Johnson, the former president of the American Medical \nAssociation said in 1997 that he and others investigating the issue:\n\n     could not find any identified circumstances in which the \n     procedure was the only safe and effective abortion method.\n\n  The fact is that there is no medical need to allow this type of \nbarbaric procedure.\n  The 5-4 Stenberg court also had concerns that the procedure, as \ndefined in the Nebraska statute, could have been construed to ban more \nthan one type of abortion procedure, including one which could \ntheoretically be used to protect the health of the mother. Based on \nthis, the court found that the lack of a ``health of the mother'' \nexception created an ``undue burden'' because it could prevent a \nprocedure that could be necessary for the health of the mother.\n\n  S. 3, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, addresses that \nproblem as well by very specifically defining the procedure so that it \nonly prohibits the D procedure, which, as our hearings have shown, \nand the findings in S. 3 confirm, is never necessary to protect the \nhealth of the mother.\n  Let me repeat, the carefully-drafted definition used in S. 3 for \npartial-birth abortion cannot be construed to include any abortion \nprocedure other than the D procedure.\n  In other words, other alternative procedures, all of which will \nremain legal under S. 3, will be available in the event that the health \nof the mother needs to be preserved. For this reason, this bill does \nnot require an exception for the health of the mother.\n  Now, let me address a misrepresentation that has been floated over \nthe years--that is, that this barbaric procedure is rare. The record \nindicates that this is clearly not the case. In fact, one clinic in New \nJersey alone admitted to 1500 of these procedures in just one year! And \nthat is just one state. How can anyone claim that is ``rare''?\n  And in the State of Kansas, which requires that doctors report \npartial-birth abortions and also cite the reasons given for having the \nabortion, we found out that doctors there performed 182 partial-birth \nabortions in just one year on babies they deemed viable. And every one \nof these reports, by the way, cited ``mental health'' as the reason for \nhaving this barbaric procedure.\n  It is likely that there are at least 3,000 to 5,000 of these \nprocedures performed every year, despite what some try to claim.\n\n  To further expose the lack of credibility of those who claim this \nprocedure is rare, we need only listen to Ron Fitzsimmons of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers. He admitted in 1997 that when \nhe told us the procedure was rare, he ``lied through my teeth.'' He \nadded that he only represented it as being rare because, ``I just went \nout there and spouted the party line.'' That shows how far these people \nwill go. Abortion is so sacred to them they see no reason to ban any \naspect of it, not even this barbaric procedure.\n  The truth always eventually prevails over the party line, and the \ntruth is that this procedure is not rare, and it should be banned.\n  I think former Sen. Daniel Moynihan had it about right when speaking \nin favor of this ban in previous debates he called the procedure \n``close to infanticide.'' It is infanticide.\n  In recent years, we have heard about teenaged girls giving birth and \nthen dumping their newborns into trash cans. One young woman was \ncriminally charged after giving birth to a child in a bathroom stall \nduring her prom, and then strangling and suffocating her child before \nleaving the body in the trash. Tragically, there have been several \nsimilar incidents around the country in the past few years.\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\n  This is what happens when we devalue human life.\n  William Raspberry argued in a column in the Washington Post several \nyears ago that ``only a short distance [exists] between what [these \nteenagers] have been sentenced for doing and what doctors get paid to \ndo.'' How right he is.\n  When you think about it, it is incredible that there is a mere three \ninches separating a partial-birth abortion from murder.\n  Now, I have sympathy for any young woman who contemplates \nan abortion. The circumstances that drive a woman to it must certainly \nbe complex and appear to her to be overwhelming and insoluble.\n\n  But the D procedure is not an ordinary abortion. It is not \ncontemplated by the Roe v. Wade decision. Even the Stenberg court \nconfirmed, and I quote, ``By no means must physicians [be granted] \n`unfettered discretion' in their selection of abortion methods.'' So \nthis is not about overturning Roe v. Wade--that is a red herring.\n  The D procedure is one method which we ought not give doctors the \ndiscretion to perform. It is never medically necessary, it is never the \nsafest procedure available, and it is morally reprehensible and \nunconscionable.\n  Partial-birth abortion simply has no place in our society and rightly \nshould be banned.\n  President Bush has described partial-birth abortion as ``an abhorrent \nprocedure that offends human dignity.'' I wholeheartedly agree. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of S. 3, the \nPartial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, and help restore human dignity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this would be an easier debate if we were \nspeaking to an issue that only dealt with healthy mothers and healthy \nfetuses. The fact is, we are not. The Senator from California outlined \na number of very difficult, troubling cases of women who have had to \nmake very difficult choices that no one on this floor can comprehend \nwithout having gone through.\n  If we can reduce unintended pregnancies we can go a long way to \nreducing abortions in this country and not have these kinds of debates \nin the Senate. That is precisely what the current pending amendment is \nabout that we are discussing at this time. It is an amendment that \nprovides contraceptive equity for women. It provides emergency \ncontraception education. It provides emergency contraceptives in the \nemergency room and it expands SCHIP and Medicaid to include low-income \npregnant women so the mother and the fetus are both covered--unlike the \ncurrent administrative rule.\n  My colleagues on the other side have offered a point of order against \nthis amendment. I say to them, no one can hide behind a point of order. \nIf we truly believe we want to reduce the number of abortions in this \ncountry, if we reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and allow \nhelp for women, as this amendment will do, we will all have made a step \nin the right direction.\n  I will have more to say but my colleague from Illinois is here. I \nyield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  I come to the floor to discuss an issue which is highly charged and \nemotional. In the 20 years I have served in both the House and the \nSenate, I can say the debates on this issue have been some of the most \npainful. No matter who you are, in the Senate or the House, whatever \nyour political party, whatever your background, if you take this issue \nas seriously as you must, you have to reflect every time as to whether \nor not your vote makes sense, is fair, is a policy that America should \nfollow.\n  Now, of course, we are debating the so-called partial-birth abortion \nprocedure. I came to Congress many years ago personally opposed to \nabortion. It was part of my faith tradition, part of my personal value \nsystem. I came here to find that many of the people I assumed would be \nmy allies opposed abortion but had other elements in their belief which \nstarted to trouble me.\n  I believe that a woman pregnant, facing extraordinary medical \ncircumstances, a woman who is pregnant, having been impregnated by a \nrape or incest, should be given special concern and consideration. But \nI found many times that those who opposed abortions would make no \nexception no matter what the circumstances leading up to a pregnancy. \nAnd that troubled me.\n  I also found that in those extraordinary situations where a woman \nfound in her pregnancy, one that she anticipated to be normal, \nuneventful, that something awful had occurred, that, in fact, many of \nthe people who opposed abortion would not even allow that procedure in \nthose extraordinary medical situations. I was surprised by that. I \ndidn't expect to find it.\n  Then I met with some of the women and talked to them about their \npersonal experiences. One of them is a woman I met from my home State \nof Illinois, Vikki Stella. This is a picture of Vikki, her husband, her \nfamily. Vikki's is an extraordinary story.\n\n  When Vikki was pregnant several years ago, she learned late in her \npregnancy that her much wanted son was suffering from some \nextraordinary, serious abnormalities. Vikki, who is diabetic, was told \nthat if she continued her pregnancy through to its natural conclusion, \nshe could endanger her own health.\n  She told me personally--I had a chance to meet with her--that she \ncouldn't believe it. This was supposed to be a very normal pregnancy. \nAs you can see, she has other children. She learned, much to her \nsurprise and amazement, that she faced an extraordinarily complicated \npregnancy, and her doctor sat down with her and her husband, who is \nalso a doctor, and said to them: You need to do something; you need to \ndo it now to protect Vikki's survival and her own health.\n  She was faced with a terrible decision. She had already created the \nnursery in her home for the new baby. They had the walls painted, the \nfurniture picked out; they expected in just a few weeks to have this \nnew baby--to be told, instead, that she was facing a medical crisis in \nher own life. As she said, she could barely walk, it hit her so hard. \nHer husband had to help her walk away from the doctor's office.\n  She went home, she told me, in tears, saying to her husband: What are \nwe going to do? I don't believe in abortion. He explained to her, as \nher doctor explained to her, that unless she did something right then \nand there to terminate that pregnancy, she would endanger her own life \nand her ability to have other children.\n  She prayed over it, thought about it long and hard with her husband \nand family, and decided to go through with the termination of the \npregnancy.\n  Would you want to face that decision? I am sure glad I never had to \nas a father and husband. But she faced it. She terminated that \npregnancy.\n  One of the last times I saw Vikki was here, right in front of the \nCapitol Building. She was pushing a stroller with her new baby in it--\nNicholas. Nicholas came into this world as healthy and normal as you \ncould ever ask.\n  So people who are arguing that those who go in for these \nextraordinary abortion procedures somehow hate babies, or look at these \nthings lightly--please. If you listen to the women who have been \nthrough it, if you talk to them and their families, you will understand \nthe tragedy that comes into their life, the crisis that comes into \ntheir life.\n  What we are saying on the floor of the Senate with S. 3, a bill \nsponsored by Senator Santorum, is that we do not want the doctor to \nmake the decision. No. And we don't want the mother or her husband to \nmake the decision. We want to make the decision. The Government should \nmake the decision. The Government should overrule the doctor. The \nGovernment should say to her: Finish your pregnancy regardless of the \noutcome. You can't use the procedure.\n  Is that the right thing to do, for us to inject ourselves into those \nmedical crisis situations? I don't think it is.\n  Whatever your view on abortion personally, for goodness' sake, I \nthink you should have the heart to understand that you don't know \neverything; that, frankly, there are doctors in disagreement as to \nwhether these abortion procedures are needed. If there is true medical \ndisagreement, are we going to choose one side and say this will be the\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nofficial Government medical position? That is what we are hearing \ntoday. We are hearing, when it comes to abortion, don't let your doctor \ndecide; let your Senator decide for you.\n\n  I may have some expertise in some areas, but it certainly is not in \nmedicine. I rely on professionals for my family, for myself, and when \nit comes to making these important decisions.\n  If you listen to these doctors, they are telling us: For goodness' \nsake, Senator, stop and think. Do you want to say that you can imagine \nevery possible complication a mother would find late in her pregnancy \nand you want to rule that certain surgical procedures cannot be used to \nsave a mother's health or her life? That is how far this goes. And it \ngoes too far.\n  The other thing I learned when I came here was that many of the \npeople who oppose abortion very strongly, with the deepest of \nconvictions, feel just as strongly in opposition to contraception. I \ncouldn't believe that part because--think about it--if you don't offer \nto a woman, a wife, for example, in a family situation, an option to \nplan her pregnancies, then you are just inviting an unplanned or \nunwanted pregnancy, inviting the possibility of abortion.\n  So to oppose contraception is to say to the woman: We are not going \nto stand by you even making your own decision and your family decision \non when a child should come to your household. Of course, you know what \nhappens. The likelihood of abortion increases when there are unwanted, \nunplanned pregnancies.\n  I always thought if you opposed abortion, it was common sense to say \nwe would make contraception, family planning, birth control information \navailable to women in America. That seems to me just common sense, so \nthat you wouldn't have the unwanted, unplanned pregnancies leading to \nabortions.\n  I was stunned when I came to Congress many years ago to find that the \npeople most vehemently opposed to abortion were equally opposed to \ncontraception. How can that make any sense? Thank goodness Senator \nPatty Murray of Washington, along with Senator Reid of Nevada, came to \nthe floor today on this abortion debate and said we really need to be \non the record as to whether or not we are going to provide \ncontraception in health insurance plans so that women can get birth \ncontrol pills to decide when they are going to have children, when it \nis the right thing for them and their family.\n  Isn't it ironic that these health insurance plans will provide Viagra \nto men but will not provide birth control pills to women? That is a \nfact. Senator Murray's amendment comes to the floor and says we are \ngoing to put an end to that. We are going to provide that these women \nand families will have the contraception that they need to make their \ndecisions on planning their families so there are wanted and planned \nchildren as often as possible, and the likelihood of abortion is \ndiminished. That seems so patently obvious.\n  I commend Senator Murray again. She goes on to say if your feelings \nand emotions are strong when it comes to mothers and babies, for \ngoodness' sake, prove it--not just by voting against abortion but \nvoting for the mother, the pregnant mother, making certain that she has \naccess to health care during her pregnancy.\n  Senator Murray offers a provision in her amendment which says we are \ngoing to allow pregnant women across America to come into what we call \nthe SCHIP plan, a basic health insurance program offered by the States \nso that more and more working mothers have a chance to get prenatal \ncare and have healthy babies. Why in the world would anybody even \ndebate this: Contraception, birth control, family planning available \nfor mothers, women and their families, and health insurance coverage \nfor the pregnant mother so she can be certain to come out of this \npregnancy healthy herself with a healthy baby?\n\n  This is a good amendment. This is a pro-life amendment.\n  What do we hear? We hear that the Senators on the other side of the \naisle who say they are opposed to abortion--and I believe they are--are \nnow going to try to kill the Murray amendment. They don't want the \nSenate to go on record in favor of family planning and birth control in \nthe health insurance plans for women across America. They don't want \nthe Senate to go on record so rape and incest victims brought into \nemergency rooms can have the contraceptive care they need immediately \nso they do not end up pregnant because of the crime that was committed \nagainst them. They don't want to vote for the Murray amendment that \nsays pregnant mothers will have health insurance so that the babies \nwill be healthy and the mothers will be healthy. And they call \nthemselves pro-life.\n  I am sorry, it doesn't work. It is not consistent. If they are \nconsistently pro-life, they should stand by the woman, stand by the \nmother, do everything in their power to make certain that that baby is \nborn into a loving family and is as healthy as it possibly can be. That \nis what this amendment comes down to.\n  It is hard to imagine there is any opposition, and yet there is. In \nfact, a Senator will come to the floor here, he will make a procedural \nmotion, and it will take more than a majority for Senator Murray to \nprevail. Do I understand right, we will need 60 votes? Is that correct? \nSixty votes out of a hundred. So they have just raised the bar, and \nthey said to Senator Murray: If you want to protect women in terms of \nfamily planning and birth control, you need more than a majority, \nSenator Murray; you need 60 votes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will just finish, and I will be happy to yield.\n  If you want to protect women who have been raped who are going into \nthe emergency rooms--can you imagine the emotional problem they are \nfacing right then and there? If you want to protect them so they can \nhave emergency contraception and not be pregnant, you need 60 votes. \nFifty-one will not do. If you want to give women basic health insurance \nso they can have a successful pregnancy, you need 60 votes. That is \nwhat is coming from the Republican side of the aisle. I don't believe \nit is consistent with the ethic that says we care not just about babies \nbut about the mothers as well.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in the debate which took place from 11 \nuntil about quarter to 1 today, there was a lot of talk about 60 votes. \nI am wondering if this is a constitutional vote. They are asking for 60 \nvotes. Does the Senator have anything to say about that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. When it comes to \njudicial nominations, the floor was filled earlier this morning with \nRepublican Senators objecting to 60 votes. They set an outrageous \nstandard to live by. Now they have turned around here. When it comes to \nSenator Murray's amendment to stand by women, to stand by pregnant \nmothers, to stand by victims of crimes, they have said to her that she \nis going to need 60 votes. In other words, they have been trying their \nbest to stop her from protecting women in this circumstance.\n  I have to say to the Senator from Nevada, whether you are pro-choice, \npro-life, or anti-abortion, it really is a woman's right to choose. \nWouldn't you stand by a woman's right to plan for her own family and to \nbe able to have at her disposal health insurance, birth control pills, \nand family planning information? We certainly say if a husband decides \nhe needs Viagra in order to have a family, health insurance will cover \nthat. Why wouldn't we cover birth control pills? That is what this \nsays. Senator Reid of Nevada has a bill. Senator Murray has added it to \nher amendment. It is eminently sensible.\n  We come down in this debate to pretty basic values and issues. As far \nas I am concerned, whatever you call yourself on the abortion issue, I \nthink most people across America will agree we want to reduce the \nnumber of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. We want to reduce those \ntragic circumstances in the case of crimes of rape or incest, and we \nwant to make sure mothers have health insurance protection so they and \ntheir babies will be helped and taken care of in the best medical \nprofession. Sadly, the opposition on the other side makes that very \ndifficult, if not impossible.\n  This will be a good test vote when it comes to families and the \nrights of women and children. It really gets down to some fundamentals. \nIt is not enough to stand up, as did my colleague from Wisconsin, David \nObey,\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nand pose for holy pictures and say, I am opposed to abortion, and then \nturn around and vote against family planning that can avoid abortion; \nturn around and vote against those contraception techniques of an \nemergency nature and avoid unwanted pregnancies; to vote against health \ninsurance for these mothers.\n  The Senator from Washington has put this debate in the right \nperspective. If we are going to be honest about this issue, we need to \nsupport Senator Murray. I will be one who votes for her amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, was the time evenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls 21 \nminutes 11 seconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 25 minutes \n38 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to make a couple of points, and \nthen I will yield to my colleague.\n  No. 1, the Senator from Oklahoma asked me to make a budget point of \norder on his behalf. I want to make it clear he has an SCHIP provision \nthat is in the budget which they are marking up later this week. We \nwill be on that subject. We will have plenty of opportunity to deal \nwith this issue next week.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois. We should have a provision \ncovering women going through pregnancy, and be supportive of that. I \nwill not be supportive of covering medications that would lead to a \nfertilized egg not implanted in the uterus. I believe life begins at \nconception. I will not support drugs that would prevent a conceived \nembryo to be implanted.\n  I have mixed emotions about this amendment. But, nevertheless, it is \nroughly a $1 billion addition to the budget, and that should be done in \nthe context of the budget, not on a partial-birth abortion bill.\n  Finally, I would like to add to the record by unanimous consent a \nletter from Dr. Pamela Smith, who was the director in 1996 of the \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in \nChicago. She is a member of the Association of Professors of Obstetrics \nand Gynecology. In response to the case Senator Durbin has laid out, \nshe has a response that is rather lengthy. But I will just quote one \ncomment she said.\n\n       . . . medically I would contend of all the abortion \n     techniques currently available to her this was the worst one \n     that could have been recommended for her.\n\n  Again, that just proves the point.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition\n\n\n                                                    for Truth,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 23, 1996.\n       Dear Member of Congress: My name is Dr. Pamela E. Smith. I \n     am a founding member of PHACT (Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition \n     for Truth). This coalition of over three hundred medical \n     providers nationwide (which is open to everyone, irrespective \n     of their political stance on abortion) was specifically \n     formed to educate the public, as well as those involved in \n     government, in regards to disseminating medical facts as they \n     relate to the Partial-Birth Abortion procedure.\n       In this regard, it has come to my attention that an \n     individual (Ms. Vicki Stella, a diabetic) who underwent this \n     procedure, who is not medically trained, has appeared on \n     television and in Roll Call proclaiming that it was necessary \n     for her to have this particular form of abortion to enable \n     her to bear children in the future. In response to these \n     claims I would invite you to note the following:\n       1. Although Ms. Stella proclaims this procedure was the \n     only thing that could be done to preserve her fertility, the \n     fact of the matter is that the standard of care that is used \n     by medical personnel to terminate a pregnancy in its later \n     stages does not include partial-birth abortion. Casarean \n     section, inducing labor with pitocin or protoglandins, or (if \n     the baby has excess fluid in the head as I believe was the \n     case with Ms. Stella) draining the fluid from the baby's head \n     to allow a normal delivery are all techniques taught and used \n     by obstetrical providers throughout this country. These are \n     techniques for which we have safety statistics in regards to \n     their impact on the health of both the woman and the child. \n     In contrast, there are no safety statistics on partial-birth \n     abortion, no reference of this technique in the national \n     library of medicine database, and no long term studies \n     published that prove it does not negatively affect a woman's \n     capability of successfully carrying a pregnancy to term in \n     the future. Ms. Stella may have been told this procedure was \n     necessary and safe, but she was sorely misinformed.\n       2. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that tends to \n     get worse over time and that predisposes individuals to \n     infections that can be harder to treat. If Ms. Stella was \n     advised to have an abortion most likely this was secondary to \n     the fact that her child was diagnosed with conditions that \n     were incompatible with life. The fact that Ms. Stella is a \n     diabetic, coupled with the fact that diabetics are prone to \n     infection and the partial-birth abortion procedure requires \n     manipulating a normally contaminated vagina over a course of \n     three days (a technique that invites infection) medically I \n     would contend of all the abortion techniques currently \n     available to her this was the worse one that could have been \n     recommended for her. The others are quicker, cheaper and do \n     not place a diabetic at such extreme risks for life-\n     threatening infections.\n       3. Partial-birth abortion is, in fact, a public health \n     hazard in regards to women's health in that one employs \n     techniques that have been demonstrated in the scientific \n     literature to place women at increased risks for uterine \n     rupture, infection, hemorrhage, inability to carry \n     pregnancies to term in the future and maternal death. Such \n     risks have even been acknowledged by abortion providers such \n     as Dr. Warren Hern.\n       4. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, \n     recently stated in the AMA News that he believes that people, \n     including the President, have been misled as to ``fact and \n     fiction'' in regards to third trimester pregnancy \n     terminations. He said, and I quote, ``in no way can I twist \n     my mind to see that the late term abortion described . . . is \n     a medical necessity for the mother . . . I am opposed to \n     partial-birth abortions.'' He later went on to describe a \n     baby that he operated on who had some of the anomalies that \n     babies of women who had partial-birth abortions had. His \n     particular patient, however, went on to become the head nurse \n     in his intensive care unit years later!\n       I realize that abortion continues to be an extremely \n     divisive issue in our society. However, when considering \n     public policy on such a matter that indeed has medical \n     dimensions, it is of the utmost importance that decisions are \n     based on facts as well as emotions and feelings. Banning this \n     dangerous technique will not infringe on a woman's ability to \n     obtain an abortion in the early stage of pregnancy or if a \n     pregnancy truly to be ended to preserve the life of health of \n     the mother. What a ban  will do is insure that women will not \n     have their lives jeopardized when they seek an abortion \n     procedure.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Pamela Smith,\n      Director of Medical Education, Department of Obstetrics and \n                             Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Medical Center.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Second, I have another letter with an analysis done by \nDr. Curtis Cook, Maternal Fetal Medicine, Michigan State College of \nHuman Medicine, on the case of Coreen Costello. I will discuss both of \nthese in detail later. But I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth]\n\n                      The Case of Coreen Costello\n\n       Partial-birth abortion was not a medical necessity for the \n     most visible ``personal case'' proponent of procedure.\n       Coreen Costello is one of five women who appeared with \n     President Clinton when he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act (4/10/96). She has probably been the most active and \n     the most visible of those women who have chosen to share with \n     the public the very tragic circumstances of their pregnancies \n     which, they say, made the partial-birth abortion procedure \n     their only medical option to protect their health and future \n     fertility.\n       But based on what Ms. Costello has publicly said so far, \n     her abortion was not, in fact, medically necessary.\n       In addition to appearing with the President at the veto \n     ceremony, Ms. Costello has twice recounted her story in \n     testimony before both the House and Senate; the New York \n     Times published an op-ed by Ms. Costello based on this \n     testimony; she was featured in a full page ad in the \n     Washington Post sponsored by several abortion advocacy \n     groups; and, most recently (7/29/96) she has recounted her \n     story for a ``Dear Colleague'' letter being circulated to \n     House members by Rep. Peter Deutsch (FL).\n       Unless she were to decide otherwise, Ms. Costello's full \n     medical records remain, of course, unavailable to the public, \n     being a matter between her and her doctors. However, Ms. \n     Costello has voluntarily chosen to share significant parts of \n     her very tragic story with the general public and in very \n     highly visible venues. Based on what Ms. Costello has \n     revealed of her medical history--of her own accord and for \n     the stated purpose of defeating the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act--doctors with PHACT can only conclude that Ms. \n     Costello and others who\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\n     have publicly acknowledged undergoing this procedure ``are \n     honest women who were sadly misinformed and whose decision to \n     have a partial-birth abortion was based on a great deal of \n     misinformation'' (Dr. Joseph DeCook, Ob/Gyn, PHACT \n     Congressional Briefing, 7/24/96). Ms. Costello's experience \n     does not change the reality that a partial birth abortion is \n     never medically indicated--in fact, there are available \n     several alternative, standard medical procedures to treat \n     women confronting unfortunate situations like Ms. Costello \n     had to face.\n       The following analysis is based on Ms. Costello's public \n     statements regarding events leading up to her abortion \n     performed by the late Dr. James McMahon. This analysis was \n     done by Dr. Curtis Cook, a perinatologist with the Michigan \n     State College of Human Medicine and member of PHACT.\n       ``Ms. Costello's child suffered from at least two \n     conditions: `polyhydramnios secondary to abnormal fetal \n     swallowing,' and `hydrocephalus'. In the first, the child \n     could not swallow the amniotic fluid, and an excess of the \n     fluid therefore collected in the mother's uterus. The second \n     condition, hydrocephalus, is one that causes an excessive \n     amount of fluid to accumulate in the fetal head. Because of \n     the swallowing defect, the child's lungs were not properly \n     stimulated, and an underdevelopment of the lungs would likely \n     be the cause of death if abortion had not intervened. The \n     child had no significant chance of survival, but also would \n     not likely die as soon as the umbilical cord was ctut.\n       The usual treatment for removing the large amount of fluid \n     in the uterus is a procedure called amniocentesis. The usual \n     treatment for draining excess fluid from the fetal head is a \n     procedure called cephalocentesis. In both cases the excess \n     fluid is drained by using a thin needle that can be placed \n     inside the womb through the abdomen (``transabdominally''--\n     the preferred route) or through the vagina \n     (``transvaginally''). The transvaginal approach however, as \n     performed by Dr. McMahon on Ms. Costello, puts the woman at \n     an increased risk of infection because of the non-sterile \n     environment of the vagina. Dr. McMahon used this approach \n     most likely because he had no significant expertise in \n     obstetrics and gynecology. In other words, he may not have \n     been able to do it well transabdominally--the standard method \n     used by ob/gyns--because that takes a degree of expertise he \n     did not possess. After the fluid has been drained, and the \n     head decreased in size, labor would be induced and attempts \n     made to deliver the child vaginally.\n       Ms. Costello's statement that she was unable to have a \n     vaginal delivery, or, as she called it, `natural birth or an \n     induced labor,' is contradicted by the fact that she did \n     indeed have a vaginal delivery, conducted by Dr. McMahon. \n     What Ms. Costello had was a breech vaginal delivery for \n     purposes of aborting the child, however, as opposed to a \n     vaginal delivery intended to result in a live birth. A \n     caesarean section in this case would not be medically \n     indicated--not because of any inherent danger--but because \n     the baby could be safely delivered vaginally.''\n       Given these medical realities, the partial-birth abortion \n     procedure can in no way be considered the standard, medically \n     necessary or appropriate procedure appropriate to address the \n     medical complications described by Ms. Costello or any of the \n     other women who were tragically misled into believing they \n     had no other options.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Kansas, and thank him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania be \nkind enough to yield for 2 minutes so I might respond? And I would be \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. On the Senator's time. That is fine.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope you listen carefully to what the Senator from \nPennsylvania just entered into the Record. He entered into the Record \nan opinion of another doctor which said the woman who faced that crisis \npregnancy should have done it differently. I don't know if the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is aware of the fact that she not only had the \ncounsel of her own obstetrician/gynecologist, but she had the counsel \nof her husband who was a practicing physician. She was relying on her \nhusband's medical knowledge and the advice of her obstetrician/\ngynecologist. The Senator from Pennsylvania has found another doctor \nwho disagrees. And he says that is why we should overrule her personal \ndoctor and her personal obstetrician in this case; that we should make \nthe decision here; that Senators and politicians should be making the \ndecisions about what was the right information for her in that \ncircumstance.\n  Is there something wrong with that picture? I think there is. We \nshould leave the decisions in a crisis pregnancy, in a case where \nliterally disaster occurs to the family, to the woman and her doctor, \nto her family, and to her God. For us to step in and say we are going \nto make medical decisions goes way too far.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing \n45,000 OB/GYNs, agrees:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies in the medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, if I may respond very briefly, there \nis no evidence in any record, nor did she give any testimony, that this \nwas a crisis pregnancy. Second, there is ample testimony and \noverwhelming evidence that this procedure is never necessary for the \nlife or health of the mother. It is never used in a 3-day procedure.\n  I won't go into great detail. That is the reason we have malpractice \nlaws in this country. Doctors make very bad decisions and give bad \nadvice to patients. It happens all the time. In this case, it happens \nwith frequency. But there is dispositive, overwhelming evidence that \nthe advice she was given was wrong. Because someone gives advice \ndoesn't mean it is correct advice. She got bad advice and, \nunfortunately, it resulted in a heinous act being perpetrated in this \ncase.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for yielding the time. This debate is about a very \ndifficult and very important topic of our era and our day.\n  I believe a true mark of a civilized society is not the level of \nhuman dignity it confers upon the strong or wealthy, but a true mark is \non how much it confers upon the vulnerable and the oppressed. Clearly \nan abortion procedure that dismembers and kills partially-born human \nbeings has no place in a civilized society.\n  I think it is becoming increasingly clear that the impact of \nabortions on society is profound. I want to spend some time talking \nabout the impact on society, particularly when you take such a risky \nprocedure as this which is not necessary and allow it to continue \nwithin the context of this society today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some statistics \nof the Kansas Department of Health and Environment on partial-birth \nabortions, when they were being conducted in the State, and the reasons \nthey were being done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Kansas Department of Health & Environment, Center for \n           Health and Environmental Statistics,\n                                       Topeka, KS, March 24, 2000.\n       Dear Interested Party: State statutes require physicians, \n     ambulatory surgical centers, and hospitals to report \n     abortions to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. \n     The law also requires physicians, who perform abortions, to \n     report to KDHE the number of certifications received under \n     the Women's Right-to-Know Act. These data are compiled by the \n     Center for Health and Environmental Statistics, Office of \n     Health Care Information.\n       The collection of these vital statistics reports for 1999 \n     is now complete. This report is a summary of the preliminary \n     analysis of that data. Additional analysis of the 1999 \n     abortion data will be included in the Kansas Annual Summary \n     of Vital Statistics.\n       This report also contains information the Legislature \n     requires physicians to report regarding (a) abortions \n     performed at 22 weeks or more and (b) ``partial birth'' \n     procedures.

I would just note, in citing this statistic, it has \nbeen cited previously, the statistical year we have available to us, \n182 partial-birth abortions were done and reported within the State of \nKansas. Of those, when they asked if the abortion was necessary to \nprevent substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily \nfunction, was the impairment physical or mental, they were asking, are \nyou asking for this abortion, this partial-birth abortion to be done \nfor physical reasons or for mental reasons, all 182 partial-birth \nabortions done in Kansas this year were for mental reasons. Zero were \nfor physical reasons. The doctors conducting these, the patients doing \nit, said this is all for a mental reason.\n  The notion that some have put forward that there is not another \nphysical option, that you are jeopardizing the physical health of the \nmother, the life of the mother by banning a partial-birth abortion \nprocedure is certainly not borne out by the statistics in my State. You \nwould think there should be at least one, maybe five that were for \nphysical reasons of the mother. In our instance, in Kansas, where we \nrequire by law that partial-birth abortion be reported, and the \nreasoning, zero were for physical reasons. These were all for mental \nreasons that were put forward. I would hope we could put to rest the \ndebate point about we have to maintain this procedure for the life of \nthe mother, the health of the mother. Our experience in the State is \nthat is simply not the reason. I am delighted to be able to provide \nthat to my colleagues for the Record.\n  Regardless of your view overall on abortion, to have this grisly \npractice of partial birth continuing is something we should not have \ntaking place. It is something we don't need to take place, and it does \nlead to a more callous society. That is the point I want to discuss, \nits overall impact on society. I hope we can step back a moment and \nphilosophize a bit about what it does.\n  Aside from partial-birth abortion, it has become increasingly clear \nthat the impact abortion has had on society is in itself profound. I am \nquite convinced the widespread acceptance of this brutal practice has \nalready significantly coarsened public attitudes toward human life in \ngeneral, particularly toward the most vulnerable in society, whether \nthey are unborn or old or infirm. This coarsening of public attitude \nover the past several years has made other assaults against the dignity \nof humans and human life more acceptable and more accessible.\n  It is one of those slopes that you start down. If you say as a \nsociety, partial-birth abortion, we really don't like it that much but \nwe will go ahead and let it take place, when you say it from a large \nlegislative body such as this one, the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, to say we really don't care for it but we will let it \ntake place, and we know what this procedure is and we know most of it, \nif not all of it, is on a choice basis of a mental concept, it is not \non physical consequence for the mother, we know most of this is about a \nmental choice on the mother's part, and yet we are going to let this \ncontinue, what message does that send overall to society? What does it \nsay to the country? What does it say to the world?\n  Does it make other assaults on human dignity possible? Euthanasia; \nassisted suicide; let's do embryo research; now let's clone human \nbeings. We continue to move upon that path of saying the human being is \nnot sacred; it is not precious; it is another entity; and we can \ncountenance that such coarseness takes place, and it continues to move \nus on down that road.\n\n  Mother Teresa was quoted as once saying that ``if we can accept that \na mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to \nkill one another?''\n  That is a really good question she was asking. If we accept that a \nmother would do this, particularly a partial-birth abortion procedure, \nhow can we tell other people not to kill one another?\n  We all have a duty, an obligation, as citizens of the United States \nto stand up against such a moral outrage as partial-birth abortion. \nHuman life is sacred. It is a precious gift. Human life is not \nsomething to be disposed of by those with more power. One of the most \nextreme assaults against human dignity is made against some of the most \ninnocent among us, whether from the first moments of life to the \nmoments just before birth, a child continues in that point to be a \nprecious\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\nand unique gift, a gift never to be given or to be created again. It is \ngiven once. That is it. It seems therefore that in some measure this \ndebate is about whether or not that child prior to birth is a child at \nall. Is this young human a person? Is it a child or is it a mere piece \nof property?\n  Some who support partial-birth abortion will argue this young human \nis not a person and can therefore be disposed of as property, as need \nsees. To me, this would be a ghastly concept. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a \nlady whose statue is in this building, one of the women depicted in the \nportrait monument, foresaw this awful view of humanity, of human life. \nShe wrote a letter to Julia Ward Howe in October of 1873 and said:\n\n       When we consider that women are treated as property, it is \n     degrading to women that we should treat our children as \n     property to be disposed of as we see fit.\n\n  That is a quote from 1873. The Congress must speak out against this \natrocity. We must speak out against this degradation of human life. \nThese are life issues of enormous consequence, and they are issues by \nwhich history will rightly judge us.\n  I thank those who have brought the debate forward. I know everybody \nwho has entered into it does so with deep convictions, deep desires to \ndo what is right. I hope we would back up as a society and ask \nourselves, what coarsening does this do to us; what message is this \nsending, and what are we really saying about that young human life? Is \nit a person or is it a piece of property? It is one or the other in our \njurisprudence, it has to be. Everything in this building right now, \neverything in this country is either a person or a piece of property. I \nam a person; my clothes are property. The building is property. The \npeople in here are personages. What is the young human? We have had \nthis debate before. We really need to consider that that is a child. It \nis a gift.\n  I want to quote one more time Mother Teresa and her concern on this \nparticular issue and this particular issue of abortion itself. I don't \nthink anybody could question her bona fides for being willing to take \ncare of the weakest and the poorest in society and in the culture \noverall and her willingness to work and her work being carried on of \ntaking care of the most vulnerable in society. She said this one time \nabout the whole issue of abortion. She spoke very passionately, clearly \nabout this topic. She said:\n\n       Many are concerned with the children of India, with the \n     children of Africa where quite a few die of hunger and so \n     on. Many people are also concerned about the violence in \n     this great country of the United States. These concerns \n     are very good. But often these same people are not \n     concerned with the millions being killed by the deliberate \n     decision of their own mothers. And this is the greatest \n     destroyer of peace today--abortion which brings people to \n     such blindness.\n\n  We are confronted with an issue that is difficult and has been in \nfront of us before. We have a chance for the first time in a number of \nyears to limit a particular ghastly abortion procedure. It has been \nadequately described over and over. This is the time. This is the \nplace. This is the moment for the Senate to pass this bill, to pass it \nwithout amendment, to get it on through to the House and to the \nPresident, who will sign it into law. We can do something that really \nwill send a right signal to society, a right signal overall to the \nculture, away from the coarsening and towards a life that does support \na culture of life and not one of death.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 19 minutes and \n43 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to take 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Off of your time, I would be happy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I wanted to compliment the Senator from Kansas for his \nleadership on this issue, as well as the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis leadership. While they have done the bulk of the discussion on this \nissue, they represent a lot of us who feel just as strongly about the \nissue. I want them to know how much those of us who haven't spoken \nappreciate their leadership in proposing this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to take 5 minutes to thank my \nfriend from Washington, Senator Murray, for her extraordinary \nleadership on women's health. The fact that this amendment is being \ndebated is very encouraging to me, because when people stand up and say \nwe want to prohibit a procedure that doctors tell us, OB/GYNs tell us \nis absolutely necessary in some cases in order for a woman to have her \nlife saved or her health preserved, that is not something we should be \ndoing here. We are not physicians; we are Senators.\n\n  What we would be doing is making sure that every woman in this \ncountry, when faced with a very difficult life-threatening or a health-\nthreatening pregnancy can make decisions based on the best advice that \nshe can get, the best science, because if we look at these families--\nand I have been showing these portraits of real women. This is a woman \nwho, in her own words, said, ``I am a conservative pro-life \nChristian.'' Those are her words. She said, ``Abortion, to me, is \nsomething unthinkable.'' Yet she said in her own words, far more \neloquent than mine, that had she not been able to have the procedure \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to ban, she \nmight not have been able to bear another child. In fact, the possible \nhealth impacts of her not being able to have the procedure have been \nspelled out by physicians.\n  I am so happy to see my friend from Illinois in the Chamber because \nhe is going to be offering an amendment to make sure that if this bad \nlaw moves forward, there is an exception, so that women won't \nhemorrhage, won't have uteruses rupture, won't suffer blood clots, \nwon't have embolism or strokes, or won't suffer damage to nearby organs \nor have paralysis. Can you imagine us doing something that could lead \nto a woman--like this beautiful woman and the others I have talked \nabout having to suffer one of those consequences--being ripped away \nfrom her family?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We had a conversation on the floor about another woman \nwhose photograph is here, whom I met, Vikki Stella, from my home State \nof Illinois. We talked about the complications she faced. It was \ninteresting to me that as I told her tragic story--I wonder if the \nSenator from California is aware of the fact--the Senator from \nPennsylvania took the floor and said that, in his opinion, she did not \nface a medical crisis in her pregnancy. I wonder if the Senator from \nPennsylvania or the Senator from California are aware of the fact that \nat 32 weeks in her pregnancy an ultrasound disclosed that her son had \nnine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain \ntissue at all; compacted, flattened congenital hip dysplasia; and \nskeletal dysplasia; and hypertoloric eyes, and he would never have \nsurvived outside the womb.\n  I wonder if the Senator believes it is within our purview, within our \nauthority and knowledge, to judge that that terrible outcome in a \npregnancy was not a medical crisis.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend has put it in a very stark way--that what is \nhappening in this Chamber, and as my friend, Senator Murray, has \neloquently pointed out, as we are amassed to go to war in Iraq, as we \nhave a building crisis in North Korea, as we have the worst economy I \nhave seen in decades, what is on this floor is banning a procedure that \nyour constituent--is she yours?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That your constituent needed in order to spare her son \nhorrific health consequences. And the fact that somebody would say that \nis not a crisis, when you have described the status of this pregnancy, \nis stunning to me. I know people around here have big egos. I don't \ndoubt that. We all have----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know that most politicians--and we are all included--\nthink we really know a lot, and we are really pretty smart, and we have \nto work hard at our jobs, and we feel confident and comfortable in our \nwork, but when we start doing things such as this--outlawing a medical \nprocedure that OB/GYNs tell us is necessary to preserve the health of a \nwoman, and when we start telling women such as this woman here, and \nothers I have shown, that they don't know what they are talking about, \nthey were not in crisis, this isn't an emergency--I actually heard \nsomeone on the floor today say this isn't an emergency situation if it \ntakes 3 days.\n  Well, let me tell you, it may take 3 days because of these \ncomplications that we are talking about. These are very complicated, \ndifficult situations that are delicate. If it takes 3 days, it is \nbecause it is delicate.\n  I have to say, if we wind up banning this procedure--which, by the \nway, the way the bill as written is unconstitutional because the \nlawyers who have fought the previous case said it is legally identical \nto the case that the Supreme Court said was unconstitutional--and it is \nupheld because of a change in the Court, or whatever, we are going to \nfind some tragedies that we are going to bring to the floor.\n  I don't want to see that day come. Doctors take an oath to do no \nharm. I wish we can take that same oath to do no harm. Roe v. Wade was \na very important decision. It said in the first few months of a \npregnancy, before viability, a woman has a right to choose what she \nwants to do with the pregnancy. That is Roe. After viability, we all \nsupport restrictions--but always with an exception for the life or the \nhealth of the mother.\n  This bill is so radical, it has no exception for health. The women I \nhave brought to you have told me they could have suffered any one of \nthese on this list of problems. How we can stand here on the floor, \nwhen physicians are telling us these are the problems--the hemorrhages, \nblood clots, strokes, paralysis--that could result If this particular \nmethod is banned, it seems to me we are doing harm. We are doing harm \nto the women of this country.\n  I would like to see us finish this bill. I would like to see these \namendments pass. Senator Murray's amendment is so important. They are \nso important because what they will do if they pass and are signed into \nlaw is make abortion rare because it is talked about in every aspect of \ncontraception being available to women. That is what we ought to be \ndoing so we don't have to have this debate on abortion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask the Senator from California \nthis. She keeps making the statement and I want to make sure I give her \nan opportunity to substantiate this statement. The statement is made \nrepeatedly that obstetricians and gynecologists around the country are \nsaying that this is medically necessary to preserve the health of the \nmother.\n  Has one of those obstetricians or gynecologists submitted a \ncircumstance by which this would be the case? And where have they said \nthis is the case? I am asking. If the Senator from California is going \nto make a statement that obstetricians believe this is medically \nnecessary to preserve the health of a mother, substantiate the \nstatement.\n  For 7 years I have asked this question. Seven years. It has been \nasked at hearings and in a variety of different forums. I understand \nwhy the OB/GYN association opposes this ban because they do not like \nanything that criminalizes their behavior. I understand that. I am sure \nanybody who does behavior outside the bounds of morality and, \ntherefore, potentially criminal, would like laws that do not stop them \nfrom doing what they want to do. I understand why people do not want \nconstraints on their actions, but we have laws because we believe there \nare certain actions that are so morally reprehensible that we want to \nprohibit them and at which we want consequences directed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for an answer to the question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the question, as I have repeatedly: Provide for \nme an instance, a circumstance, a medical situation in which this \nprocedure would be necessary to preserve the health of the mother. That \nis what I am asking. Give me a circumstance where this would be \nnecessary and there would be no other procedures available. Give me a \ncircumstance where this would be the best procedure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I assume I am answering on my friend's time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If you can answer the question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I would like to submit for the record a letter from \nthe University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Felicia Stewart, in \nwhich she says very clearly that this bill:\n\n       . . . fails to protect women's health by omitting an \n     exception for women's health; it menaces medical practice \n     with the threat of criminal prosecution; it encompasses a \n     range of abortion procedures; and it leaves women in need of \n     second trimester abortions with far less safe medical \n     options: hysterotomy and hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods.\n\n  She goes on:\n\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions.\n\n  And she says here is what happened to them: Death, infertility, \nparalysis----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Coma, stroke, hemorrhage, brain damage, infection, liver \ndamage, and kidney damage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, with all due respect to the Senator \nfrom California, she has not answered my question. That letter does not \nanswer my question. I have asked not what could happen if abortions are \nnot available. What I have asked is for a specific medical circumstance \nthat someone can provide me where this procedure would be necessary to \nsave the health of the mother.\n  In 7 years of asking that question, I have not gotten an answer. I \nthink that is significant, that if this is so important, if Members of \nthe Senate are going to come here and say this is medically necessary \nto protect the health of the mother, then they have to have evidence to \nsupport that statement. Saying that this limits options and saying \npotentially it could have adverse--give me a circumstance, give me a \ncase.\n  The reason that no cases have been brought forward is because we have \noverwhelming testimony, dispositive testimony from physicians all \nacross this country who say that it is never medically necessary, \nincluding the American Medical Association, which says this is a bad \npractice.\n  Take the cases that are being presented today. Vikki Stella. Did I \nsay the pregnancy was not a crisis in the sense the child had multiple \nbirth defects? Is that a crisis pregnancy? Of course it is in the sense \nthat the child does not have a chance or very much of a chance to \nsurvive long after birth. But that is not what I said. What I said was \nit was not a medical crisis for the mother, and there is no evidence \nthe mother was in any physical danger. I have gone through this \npersonally as----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish, and I will be happy to yield as I have \ncontinually. The fact that a child in utero is going through a crisis \ndoes not equate that the mother is going through a health crisis. There \nare lots of mothers of babies with multiple defects who carry that \nchild to term or do things to try to help that child in utero survive. \nOne does not equate to the other.\n  The case of Vikki Stella--and I am just reporting--I understand the \nfact she was carrying a child with multiple disabilities. My heart \ngrieves for her and for all women who have to go through such difficult \npregnancies. It is horrible to find out that a child you want may not \nlive long after birth. It is as compelling a story as you can present \nto me. The point is, the answer does not have to be the death of the \nchild.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is an accomplished legislator. He is an \naccomplished lawyer with good background and understanding, but he is \nnot a medical doctor. In this case, her medical doctor said because of \nher diabetic condition and complications that the fetus she was \ncarrying could not survive outside the womb, if she had a C-section to \ndeliver this child, it would have put her life and health at risk. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania comes to the floor and says: No, I understand \nit better. I can make a better diagnosis. She was not at risk.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How can the Senator stand here and make a medical \njudgment on a person he has never seen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. One, you make it sound like the doctor who diagnosed \nthe fetal abnormality was the one who performed the abortion. In fact--\nI am reading her story--the diagnosis was made by a perinatologist and \nthe abortion was performed by an abortionist in a clinic, not the same \nperson.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What is the point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The point is that this is not done in hospitals. This \nis done in abortion clinics. This is not a procedure that was developed \nto protect the health of the mother. This was a procedure that was \ndeveloped so the abortionist could do multiple abortions and do more of \nthem at the same time.\n  The case we are laying out here--and by the way, we are arguing a \ncase of where you have a fetal abnormality which, by the way, is less \nthan 1 percent of the abortions that are performed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator make that exception in his bill?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Excuse me, there need not be an exception, but you are \narguing these compelling cases and they are compelling because they are \ntalking about women going through very difficult decisions, but there \nis no medical reason to do this procedure. There are other procedures \navailable and safer. There are better procedures for abortion \navailable. I am not talking about C-sections, but other abortion \nprocedures that are better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator please tell me what procedure would have \nbeen better for Vikki Stella?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Look, this procedure is not done in hospitals. So all I \nsuggest is there are other safer, peer-reviewed procedures that can and \nare used on a routine basis by a physician----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator please tell me, since he said it was not \na medical crisis, and she did not need this procedure----\n  Mr. SANTORUM.--which is a standard D, which is the most common \nlate-term abortion performed at hospitals, taught in medical school, \nand peer reviewed. This is not Rick Santorum talking. This is not the \nSenator from Tennessee talking. This is a variety of obstetricians.\n  The point is, they are giving a reason for keeping this procedure \nlegal that is a red herring. This procedure is not taught in hospitals. \nIt is not performed in hospitals. It is not done by advanced \nperinatologists who run into difficult pregnancies. Why? Because it is \nnot safe. Why? Because there are better methods.\n  What we are trying to do here is protect women's health. We hear so \nmuch passion here about protecting women's health. We have a procedure \nthat has been demonstrably proven is dangerous to women's health; that \nthere are other procedures that are safer.\n  Why are we not concerned about women's health when we want to keep a \nprocedure legal that is unsafe? Are we really concerned about women's \nhealth, or are we really concerned about eroding, chipping ever so \nslightly at this oracle of abortion in America? This is trying to stop \nsomething that is unsafe for women, that is obviously brutal for \nchildren, and is simply not necessary to protect the health of a woman.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I think this discussion shows exactly \nwhy this Senate should agree on the women's health amendment that is \nnow before this body and that we will vote on in a few minutes.\n  Senator Reid and I have said that the goal of all of us should be to \nreduce the number of unintended pregnancies so that this issue that is \nbeing debated does not have to be debated on the floor of the Senate; \nthat this issue should be decided between a women and her doctor, her \nfamily and her faith.\n  I commend Senator Reid for working with me on this very important \namendment, and I yield 8 minutes of my remaining time to Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this amendment is to end insurance \ndiscrimination against women and improve awareness and understanding of \nemergency contraception, ensure that rape victims have information \nabout and access to emergency contraception, and promote healthy \npregnancies of babies by allowing States to expand coverage for \nprenatal and postpartum care. That is what this amendment is.\n  The debate that has been going on in the last few minutes has nothing \nto do with the amendment offered by the Senators from Washington and \nNevada.\n  As I mentioned earlier today, the abortion debate has been a divisive \none for our Nation for many years. We recognize the issue is not going \nto go away soon, but there is a need--and I thought we had an \nopportunity, and I hope we still do--to find common ground and to take \nsteps toward a goal I hope we all share: Reducing the number of \nunintended pregnancies in America and reducing the number of abortions.\n  We put forth a good-faith effort to find common ground by offering \ncommonsense solutions in our amendment. Instead of giving serious \nconsideration to our amendment that would improve access to \ncontraception and improve access to care for pregnant women, the other \nside has instead chosen to hide behind a technicality. That is what it \nis. If my friends on the other side of the aisle were serious about \nimproving women's health, serious about improving access to \ncontraception, and serious about reducing unintended pregnancies, they \nwould not dismiss this amendment on a technicality.\n  When the Bush administration decided it would allow a fetus to be \ncovered through the SCHIP program but it was all right to exclude the \nmother from coverage, we did not have the opportunity to dismiss this \nshameful and absurd regulation on a technicality. As a result, we are \nmissing the opportunity to provide critical health care coverage for \nlow-income women and their babies.\n\n  The sad irony of tonight's vote is that the measures contained in our \namendment would actually save the country money. In fact, as the \nWashington Business Group on Health has found in its report ``Business, \nBabies and the Bottom Line,'' more than $6 of neonatal intensive care \ncosts could be saved for every $1 spent on prenatal care, and low-\nbirth-weight babies are 64 percent more likely to attend special \neducation classes than normal-birth-weight babies. That is why the \nneonatologists came to see me, as I reported earlier today. They want \nwomen who have not had the opportunity to have prenatal care to have \nprenatal care. It saves the Government money.\n  Furthermore, an Agency for Health Care Research and Quality report \nhas found 4 of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the hospital are \nrelated to care of infants with complications, respiratory diseases, \nprematurity, health defects, and lack of oxygen. All of these \nconditions can be improved and, in most cases, eliminated through \nquality prenatal care.\n  The same holds true for EPICC legislation that would improve access \nto contraception by requiring insurance plans which provide coverage \nfor prescription drugs to provide the same coverage for prescription \ncontraceptives.\n  The Washington Business Group on Health estimates that not covering \ncontraceptives in employee health plans would cost 17 percent more than \nproviding the coverage. It is a loser to vote against this amendment. \nIf my colleagues are concerned about money--and that is what this \ntechnicality is all about--then vote with us because we are going to \nsave the State, local, and Federal Governments money.\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which has provided \ncontraceptive coverage for several years now as the result of an \namendment made on this floor, shows that adding such coverage does not \nmake the plan more expensive.\n  This vote is not about money. If the other side were serious about \nimproving women's health, serious about improving access to \ncontraception, and serious about reducing unintended pregnancies, they \nwould not dismiss this amendment on a technicality.\n  I hope people will vote their conscience, the conscience to help \nwomen have healthy babies.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I support the prevention package \namendment offered today by Senators Murray and Reid to reduce the high \nrates of unintended pregnancy in our country as well as improve access \nto prenatal and postpartum care for pregnant women.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense approach to the \nhealth of women and their babies. If Senators really want to make our \ncountry a better place for babies, women, and their families, they \nshould support this amendment.\n  Half of the 4 million pregnancies that occur in the United States \nevery year are unintended. This amendment seeks to curb that trend by \nhelping women better plan their pregnancies, improving knowledge of and \naccess to contraception, and expanding insurance coverage for prenatal \nand postpartum care. If the provisions in this amendment were already \nlaw, I sincerely believe we wouldn't be here debating the underlying \nbill.\n  A recent report showed that abortion rates are at their lowest level \nsince 1974. Most of this decline is attributed to women becoming better \neducated about how to care for their bodies. We are gaining greater \naccess to safe contraceptive measures. That is the good news.\n  However, while there was an overall decline in abortion rates, the \nabortion rate among women of lower economic status actually rose. These \nwomen face greater barriers to contraception. To really reduce \nabortions in our country, we need to ensure that all women--poor and \nwealthy--have access to affordable and timely contraceptives.\n  This prevention amendment makes significant progress towards that \ngoal. First, the amendment makes contraception more affordable for \nprivately insured women, an important provision based on bipartisan \nlegislation introduced by Senators Snowe and Reid. This provision \nestablishes parity for prescription contraception by requiring private \nhealth plans to cover FDA-approved prescription contraceptives and \nrelated medical services to the same extent that they cover \nprescription drugs and other outpatient medical services. By making \ncontraception affordable for working women and families, this provision \ntakes a positive step forward in the effort to reduce abortions in our \ncountry.\n  Second, this amendment seeks to make women and health care providers \nmore aware of emergency contraception, which is really just a specified \ndose of standard birth control pills that can be taken up to 72 hours \nafter unprotected sex. Despite the potential for emergency \ncontraception to drastically reduce unintended pregnancies and the need \nfor abortion, it is underutilized and misunderstood. This amendment \nseeks to correct that. Emergency contraception is FDA-approved to be a \nsafe and effective form of contraception, and it is often the only \ncontraception option for women who have been raped.\n  Of the 300,000 women in our country who report rapes every year, \n25,000 of them become pregnant. Women who have been raped deserve to be \ngiven information about emergency contraception when they seek medical \nhelp following their sexual assault. Rapes can happen at any time, day \nor night. Oftentimes, women are treated in hospital emergency rooms. \nThis amendment also ensures that hospitals counsel raped women about \ntheir risk of pregnancy and offer them emergency contraception as an \noption. This policy is in line with emergency care standards \nestablished by the American Medical Association and could significantly \nreduce future abortions.\n  Lastly, I am glad that this amendment gives States the option of \ncovering pregnant women in their Children's Health Insurance Programs. \nBased on bipartisan legislation we passed unanimously in the Finance \nCommittee last summer, this bill allows coverage for prenatal care, \ndelivery, and postpartum care. This provision could drastically improve \nthe lives and health of thousands of women and children throughout our \nNation.\n  The infant and maternal mortality statistics in this great country of \nours are shocking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the United States ranks 28th in the world in infant \nmortality. We rank behind countries like Cuba and the Czech Republic. \nIt is amazing to me that the United States lags far behind these \nnations in this area. Another shocking statistic from the CDC is that \nthe United States ranks 21st in the world in maternal mortality. The \nWorld Health Organization estimates that the U.S. maternal mortality \nrate is double that of Canada.\n  When we are ahead of every other nation in almost every other arena, \nI am deeply saddened that we have not taken a course of action that \nwould prove to the rest of the world that we truly do value life in \nthis country, and that we want to do all we possibly can to ensure the \nhealthy delivery of children, as well as the health of their mothers.\n  The fact is, we know how to address this problem. The solution lies \nin prenatal and postpartum care. Studies have shown that this care \nsignificantly reduces infant mortality, maternal mortality, and the \nnumber of low-birthweight babies. Prenatal care is also cost-effective. \nFor every dollar we spend on prenatal care, we save more than 6 dollars \nin neonatal intensive care costs. Pre-term births are one of the most \nexpensive reasons for a hospital stay in the United States.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the great opportunity we have here in the \nSenate to drastically improve the lives and health of women and babies \nin our country. We must allow States to cover pregnant women under \nSCHIP--the States want to do it, and the Federal government should give \nthem the option.\n  I do not understand why anyone would stand in the way of common \nsense, practical solutions like the ones offered in this amendment. If \nmy colleagues are serious in their quest to reduce abortions, they will \nsupport this amendment. Instead of debating the same bill we did 5 \nyears ago--a bill that will ultimately be decided by the courts--let's \ndo something proactive for our Nation's most vulnerable women and \nfamilies. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am aware that an amendment has been \noffered to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 that would \nprovide coverage through the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n(S-CHIP) to pregnant women.\n  The amendment is similar to a bill that passed out of the Finance \nCommittee last July. The bill providing health care to low-income \npregnant women was never enacted in the 107th Congress. I support \ncaring for low-income mothers and their unborn children. It is sound \nhealth policy.\n  It is a new Congress, and unfortunately, I can't support this \namendment. This policy has not been properly debated in the 108th \nCongress.\n  Policies that alter our Nation's safety net programs deserve the \nSenate's proper attention. We must address policy changes to the safety \nnet through regular order. By accepting this amendment, we are not \nallowing for this process to work.\n  Earlier this year, I worked with Senator Nickles, Senator Snowe and \nothers to setup a process to address the need to redistribute unspent \nS-CHIP funds. Together we have set up a solid process to address S-CHIP \nredistribution through regular order.\n  I assure my colleagues that, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nam willing to address pertinent S-CHIP issues in the near future and \ndiscuss the possibility of extending S-CHIP coverage to pregnant women.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nMurray-Reid amendment. This amendment protects women's health. It makes \nabortions more rare--not more dangerous. It tries to find common \nground.\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\n  I acknowledge the seriousness of this debate. My colleagues have \nraised troubling ethical issues about these grim and ghoulish \nprocedures. But there are other equally troubling ethical issues at \nstake about who should decide how best to protect a women's health.\n  Proponents of the Santorum bill that we are debating deny that their \nlegislation will have any consequences for women's health. They are \nwrong.\n  Denying women access to the abortion that could save their life and \nphysical health is unconscionable--and unconstitutional.\n  A pregnant woman facing the most dire circumstances must be able to \ncount on her doctor to do what is medically necessary to protect her \nfrom serious physical harm.\n  I want every woman who hears this debate to know: I am on your side. \nI will fight to protect your health.\n  That is why I am proud to support this amendment. It builds on my two \ndecades of advocacy--to protect women's health, to give women access to \nappropriate medical treatments, and to make sure women are treated \nfairly and equally under the law.\n  When I was still a Congresswoman on the House side, there was study \nafter study on how women were not included in the clinical trials at \nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n  Studies were being done with men only. One study examined whether \naspirin decreases cardiovascular deaths on 22,000 men. A study on heart \ndisease risk factors was conducted on 13,000 men--and not one woman. \nBut the results of these studies were applied to both men and women.\n  What did this mean for women? Millions of men benefited from a study \nthat found taking aspirin reduced their incidence of heart attacks. But \nsince women weren't included in the clinical trial, we didn't know \nwhether it would hurt us, help us, or have no effect.\n  This policy was unfair. It was harming women.\n  So one day, I called up Pat Schroeder, Connie Morella, and Olympia \nSnowe. We decided to go to NIH--to light a fire so they would take \naction.\n  It was a hot day in August. We pulled up in our cars, up to the curb \nat the front door of NIH. They knew we were there, they knew we were \nserious. They knew we were going to have a Seneca Falls on NIH if \nnecessary. True story and the rest is history.\n  Within 1 month after that, working with Ted Kennedy, Tom Harkin and \nthe women of the House, there was an Office of Women's Health at NIH. \nNIH finally moved and I moved Congress.\n  We mow know that men and women often have different symptoms before a \nheart attack. We know that men and women have biological differences \nthat must be studied and understood so women's symptoms can be \nrecognized and treatments can be developed that are effective for both \nwomen and men.\n  Including women in clinical trials and making sure investments in \nbiomedical research benefit men and women equally is about basic \nfairness.\n  This amendment is also about fairness. It includes the Equity in \nPrescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act (EPICC). EPICC \nrequires health plans that cover prescription drugs to provide the same \ncoverage for prescription contraceptives. 98 percent of workers with \nhealth insurance have prescription drugs benefits,but only 64 percent \nof workers have plans that cover birth control pills. Only 40 percent \nof workers have plans that cover all forms of contraceptives.\n  When health plans cover other prescription drugs but exclude the \ndrugs that only women take, it is gender discrimination. It is wrong.\n  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) agreed. I chaired \na hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on \nthis legislation. The Committee heard testimony from Jennifer Erickson, \na 28-year-old pharmacist from Seattle. Jennifer used this EEOC decision \nto take her employer to court. She won.\n  This was a landmark victory for women. But women should not have to \nsue their employers to get their health plans to treat them fairly.\n  That is why I am such a strong supporter of this legislation. EPICC \nprotects every woman from illegal gender discrimination. It reaffirms \nour commitment to basic fairness for women under the law. It leaves \nmedical decisions in the hands of women and their doctors--not \nlegislators, and not insurance company bureaucrats. It expands access \nto contraceptives that help prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n  EPICC also builds on past successes. In 1998, I worked with Senators \nSnowe and Reid to require Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans that \ncovered other prescription drugs to also cover prescription \ncontraceptives. I have stood sentry in the Appropriations Committee to \nkeep this promise to Federal employees.\n  Contraceptive equity for Federal employees was a downpayment. It \ncreated a model for employers--and other States--to follow, like my own \nstate of Maryland. Maryland was the first state to pass a contraceptive \nequity law.\n  This legislation will make the final payment--so every woman can \ncount on her health plan to treat her fairly and to cover her basic \nmedical care.\n  This amendment also expands access to medical treatment for women by \ngiving women who have been raped access to emergency contraceptives, \nand giving low-income pregnant women health insurance through the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  The Murray-Reid amendment builds on past efforts to make sure every \nwoman has access to the medical care she deserves. In 1990, I fought to \nmake sure low-income women could get screened for breast and cervical \ncancer. Since this screening program started, over 1.5 women have been \nscreened, more than 9,000 breast cancers have been diagnosed, and over \n48,000 precancerous cervical lesions have been detected.\n  This screening program was a good start--but it left a serious gap. \nThe program paid for women to get screened, but it did not pay the \ncosts of treatment for women who were diagnosed with breast and \ncervical cancer through the program. Women were left to fend for \nthemselves or rely on volunteers to provide free or reduced-cost \ntreatment. I fought to change that.\n  In 2000--after years of effort--Senator John Chafee and I passed a \nlaw to give women who were diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer \nthrough this program access to the medical treatment they needed.\n  Let's continue to build on these efforts to make sure every woman has \naccess to quality health care. Millions of Americans do not have access \nto health care, because they cannot afford health insurance. There are \n267,000 women in Maryland without health insurance, 11 percent of \nMaryland women under age 65.\n  The Murray-Reid amendment will expand health insurance coverage. It \nincludes legislation that I strongly support that allows states to \nexpand their children's health insurance program to give pregnant women \nearning less than $17,000 a year access to the health care they need.\n  This amendment sends a message to women. I am on your side. I will \nfight to protect your health. I will fight to make sure you get treated \nfairly. I urge you to support it.\n  I am also here in support of the Murray-Reid amendment because it \nsends a message about the importance of prevention. This amendment will \nhelp prevent unwanted pregnancies--by expanding access to \ncontraceptives through fair, equitable insurance coverage, guaranteeing \nthat women who have been raped can get emergency contraceptives (ECs), \nand getting information to women and their doctors about ECs. It will \nprevent abortions.\n  Unlike this amendment, the Santorum bill that we are debating does \nnot prevent a single abortion. It prohibits certain abortion \nprocedures, but allows doctors to use other procedures in its place. \nThe Santorum bill directs doctors to use other procedures that may be \nmore dangerous to women. It is a hollow and ineffective approach.\n  Improving access to contraceptives makes sense. This amendment makes \nabortions more rare, not more dangerous.\n  Preventing unwanted pregnancies in the first place is something we \ncan all agree on. People of good conscience and good will disagree on \nsome of these difficult issues. I support commonsense ways to find \nmiddle ground. The Durbin amendment I will support is a commonsense \napproach to prohibit late-term abortions and protect women's life and \nhealth from serious harm.\n  There is too much at stake to angle for partisan advantage or to be \ndriven\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nby narrow ideology. Let's work together to prevent abortions and \nprotect the health and lives of American women. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes 48 \nseconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 38 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I state for all of our colleagues that \nwe are going to vote in a few minutes on a very important amendment. We \nhave heard a lot of rhetoric in the last few days saying that people \ncare about women, care about women's health, care about the health of a \nchild. I think what we all can agree on is that if we can help prevent \nunintended pregnancies and ensure access to health care coverage for \nlow-income women, we have taken a major step forward in this country.\n  The Murray-Reid amendment we are going to vote on in a few minutes \ndoes several really important things. Today, in this country, in too \nmany States, women do not have access to contraceptives simply because \nthey are discriminated against by their insurance company.\n  What this amendment merely says is that it would prohibit those \ninsurance plans from discriminating against contraception, so that \nwomen would not be denied the ability to make their own choices for \ntheir own family in their own homes with contraception that they can \nafford. I think this is something many Members agree on, many Members \nhave supported, and it is a step in the right direction in this country \nfor women's health.\n  Secondly, it provides emergency contraceptive education. It simply \nauthorizes a $10 million education program to help people know and get \ninformation to women and health care providers on the availability and \neffectiveness of emergency contraceptives--again, preventing unintended \npregnancies. It provides emergency contraceptives in the emergency \nroom.\n  Senator Reid spoke very eloquently this morning about a young woman \nwho was raped, who had no knowledge of what she could do to make sure \nshe would not have an unintended pregnancy as a result of the rape. \nThis simply makes sure that emergency contraceptives are available in \nour emergency rooms so that victims of sexual assault can get the care \nthey need and be taken care of without having to have an unintended \npregnancy that would be devastating. This is something of which \neveryone in this Chamber can be supportive.\n  Finally, it expands the SCHIP and Medicaid Program to include low-\nincome pregnant women. As we all know, the administration moved to make \nthe fetus eligible under SCHIP but left out the woman. I find that \nreprehensible. I do not know how a woman's health can be separated from \nher fetus and one can say this procedure and this medical condition \nonly applies to the fetus. For all of us who have been pregnant, we \nknow that oftentimes when you are not feeling well, you are not sure \nwhy you are not feeling well. You cannot separate a woman from her womb \nwhen she is pregnant, and you cannot make that kind of coverage just \nfor the fetus. You have to make sure the woman is healthy. That is what \nthis amendment will do. I think it is something all of us can support.\n  What we have found this evening is that our colleagues on the other \nside, who have not spoken against this amendment because they do not \nwant to speak against it, are hiding behind a budget waiver. To me, \nthat is a technicality to hide behind. How can they go home and tell \nwomen that they are for women's health; that they are for making sure \nwomen have the opportunity to prevent unintended pregnancies so that we \ndo not have these difficult choices on the floor of the Senate, and \nhide behind a budget waiver?\n  I tell all of my colleagues, a vote to waive the Budget Act is a vote \nto help prevent unintended pregnancies. It is a vote for women's \nhealth, a vote to make sure that women have access and the ability to \nmake these choices for themselves.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will vote to waive the Budget Act so that \nwe can put in place a bill that will allow women to make good choices \nfor themselves that will allow them to be healthy and for their \nchildren to be healthy. Certainly, that is something on which we can \nall agree.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, a couple of points on the Murray \namendment: No. 1, this amendment puts conditions on the receipt of \nenhanced SCHIP dollars. In order to get the enhanced match, a State \nmust first expand eligibility up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel with the regular Medicaid match rate. In other words, we will \nforce States which are already facing tough budgetary times--and they \nare pounding on our door because of the cost of Medicaid already--to \nexpand Medicaid before they are able to receive the benefits of this \nenhanced match.\n  I do not think this is going to accomplish what they want to \naccomplish anyway. We are going through the process right now in the \nbudget to deal with this issue. Senator Nickles has already said this \nis going to be dealt with in the budget. We will have a full discussion \nabout this next week. That is the proper place for this discussion, not \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senate is about to vote on the Murray-Reid \namendment. This is a prevention amendment. It is an amendment that \nsupports women's health. If our colleagues choose to hide behind the \ntechnicality, that is their choice, but the American people want us to \nstand behind women's health. I urge my colleagues to support the motion \nto waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The question is on waiving section 207(b) of H. Con. Res. 68 of the \n106th Congress as extended by S. Res. 304 of the 107th Congress. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

On this vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are \n47.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 259\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I will be \noffering. At this point, I am prepared to commence debate on the \namendment. I see the majority leader in the Chamber. If there is no \nother business to come before the Senate this evening, I will just \ncontinue the debate on the issue before us.\n  I would like to bring the attention of my colleagues to an amendment \nwhich I will bring to a vote tomorrow afternoon. This is an amendment \nwhich I have prepared and offered with a number of cosponsors. I would \nlike to acknowledge their support in offering this amendment with me. \nThey include a bipartisan group of Senators who, frankly, are on \ndifferent places on the political spectrum when it comes to the issue \nof abortion. This may be one of the only amendments to be offered which \nbrings together people who don't see eye to eye, usually, on this \nissue. It is a good-faith effort on the part of myself and the \ncosponsors to bring this amendment forward in an effort to find a \nreasonable way to resolve an extremely difficult issue.\n  I have said in previous debates, and I repeat that those who are on \nboth sides of the issue come to it in good faith. Anyone who is in \npolitical life knows this is not an issue on which you are ever going \nto win. When it comes to the issue of abortion, there are a substantial \nportion of Americans who believe very strongly against a woman's right \nto choose, and a substantial portion who strongly favor a woman's right \nto choose. No matter which position you take, you are bound to make \nsome enemies.\n  What I have found is that between these two positions on the issue, \nyou will find most Americans. And most Americans when pressed come to \nthe following conclusion: They believe that we should keep abortion \nprocedures safe and legal but make them as rare as possible, do not \nencourage them, have them available in extraordinary situations, but do \nnot encourage them.\n\n  That is the nature of the amendment which I am offering tomorrow, an \namendment which I hope goes to the heart of the issue before us.\n  We are debating what is known as the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure. It has been graphically described during the course of this \ndebate, and I am sure will be described again. It is one of the \nprocedures that is used to terminate a pregnancy.\n  There are those, including medical doctors, who argue that there is \nno such thing as a so-called partial-birth abortion. This was a term \ncreated for political purposes and that, in fact, when you look at all \nof the various abortion procedures available, you won't find this one \nlisted. Some have called this the D procedure, dilation and \nextraction. Others say, no, it is somewhat different.\n  The reason the definition of that procedure is important is that \nacross the street from the Senate in the Supreme Court, they have \nthrown out State statutes that just refer to partial-birth abortion by \nsaying that it is so vague, they can't reach a conclusion as to what \nthe State legislature in that case intended.\n  We come in this general debate on partial-birth abortion to the same \nimpasse. The procedure is not well defined. But the amendment I offer \nis not an amendment that focuses on this procedure. What I focus on \nwith the amendment is all abortion procedures postviability.\n  That is an important distinction. What we are saying is that \nregardless of the abortion procedure you are talking about, I am \nlooking at that period of time after it is medically determined that \nthe fetus that the mother or woman is carrying is viable, could survive \noutside the womb. That was a critical distinction made in Roe v. Wade \nover 25 years ago. They said, when it comes to a case where that fetus \ncould survive and is viable, only under the most extraordinary \ncircumstances could you end a pregnancy, could you terminate with an \nabortion.\n  That is reasonable. My amendment says that all abortion procedures \npostviability, after the fetus is viable, are prohibited except in two \nspecific instances. You can only terminate a pregnancy legally through \nan abortion procedure after the fetus is viable if the life of the \nmother is at stake--same thing as said by my colleagues offering S. 3--\nor a woman, if she continued the pregnancy, has a risk of grievous \nphysical injury. I will explain these terms a little later.\n  We also go on to say that in order to determine whether that late in \nthe pregnancy, after the fetus could nominally survive outside the \nwomb, in order to determine whether a woman's life is at risk to \ncontinue the pregnancy, or if she faces a grievous physical injury if \nshe continues that pregnancy, you need not one but two doctors to \ncertify that. But a reason that the two-doctor certification is \nimportant is that arguments were made that the same doctor performing \nthe abortion would happily certify that the woman is eligible for the \nabortion. I don't believe that, but the critics have raised that point.\n\n  To overcome that point, we have added the requirement for a second \nmedical certification of a doctor who is not performing the abortion \nprocedure--a doctor who will certify that continuing the pregnancy \nthreatens the life of the mother, or would expose this mother to \ngrievous physical injury.\n  Then we add a very tough section in the bill that says that doctors \nwho certify need to tell the truth. If they falsify information to \njustify a termination of a pregnancy, they face not only substantial \nfines of $100,000 in the first instance, $250,000 in the second \ninstance, but in either case, if they falsify information about whether \na woman's medical condition qualifies her for a late-term abortion, \nthey can lose their licenses to practice medicine. That is about as \nserious a penalty as you can impose on a doctor.\n  So when you look at the span of what this amendment will do, it, in \nfact, limits all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure--\nlimits all late-term abortions, only allowing them in two cases: where \nthe life of the mother is at stake if she continues the pregnancy, or \nwhether she faces grievous physical injury--which we define--if she \ncontinues the pregnancy. She needs two doctors to stand by her.\n  We create an exception for an emergency. A woman late in her \npregnancy, whose life is at risk, may not be able to find a second \ndoctor; and if she can have a certification that it is an emergency \nsituation, the second doctor's opinion will not be necessary. But that \nis the only exception. I think this is a very strict approach. I think \nit is one that is reasonable.\n  There has been a lot said on the floor as to whether the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure is ever medically necessary. I have said \nrepeatedly in debate that I am not a doctor; I cannot reach that \nconclusion on my own. I have to turn to others for advice. The American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is never the only \nthing you can do, but in some cases it may be the most appropriate \nthing for you to do.\n  I have a statement of policy from the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists which restates their earlier position \nof 1997. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists (ACOG) reaffirms its Statement of Policy on \n     Intact Dilation and Extraction, initially approved by the \n     ACOG Executive Board in 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ralph Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n       Attachment.\n\n                        ACOG Statement of Policy\n\n                (As issued by the ACOG Executive Board)\n\n\n             statement on intact dilatation and extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\n     delineate a specific procedure recognized in the medical \n     literature. Moreover, the definitions could be interpreted to \n     include elements of many recognized abortion and operative \n     obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3 percent of abortions performed in the United \n     States in 1993, the most recent data available, were \n     performed after the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary \n     figure published by the CDC for 1994 is 5.6 percent. The CDC \n     does not collect data on the specific method of abortion, so \n     it is unknown how many of these were performed using intact \n     D Other data show that second trimester transvaginal \n     instrumental abortion is a safe procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D, however, may be the best \n     or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to \n     save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the \n     doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the \n     woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. The \n     potential exists that legislation prohibiting specific \n     medical practices, such as intact D, may outlaw techniques \n     that are critical to the lives and health of American women. \n     The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision \n     making is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have a difference of opinion. Senator \nSantorum and others have said, wait a minute, we have doctor statements \nthat say just the opposite. Some doctors and some doctor associations \nsay this procedure is never needed, never necessary. Yet other doctors, \nsuch as the ones to whom I have referred, who do this for a living, say \nit may be the best thing to do. So when you have a difference of \nmedical opinion, the obvious question is, Why would we, as a matter of \nlaw, come down on one side of this medical debate?\n  It is not unusual for a patient who is facing a serious medical \ndecision to get a second opinion because sometimes doctors disagree. \nYou have to decide as a patient, or as a parent of a patient, what is \nthe right thing to do. To say we are only going to take one approach, \none opinion, and that will be the law of the land is to foreclose \nmedical options. To foreclose options in a case where there may be a \nmedical crisis, a serious complication in the pregnancy, I don't think \nis a wise course of action. As visceral and emotional as this issue is, \nour responsibility is to step back and say let's deal with this \nhonestly and deal with it in a way that we can defend in medical terms.\n  The bill before us bans only certain procedures and allows others to \ntake place. Earlier, I had a conversation on the Senate floor with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who is the lead sponsor. We \ntalked about a particular case of a woman whom I have met from my \nState. She was the mother of two children. She was in her third \npregnancy. Her husband, a businessman, had also been a practicing \nphysician. She believed she was in a very normal pregnancy--until late, \nlate, late in the pregnancy, the 32nd week, or 8 months into the \npregnancy. She went in for an ultrasound because she had personal \nmedical conditions they were worried about, and they determined by the \nultrasound that the baby she was carrying had horrible birth anomalies \nand would not survive outside the womb, at which point her doctor said \nto her: If you go ahead with this pregnancy, normal labor in this \npregnancy, or if you submit yourself to a C-section, it could be \nextremely dangerous. We recommend that you use the very procedure that \nis being banned by S. 3.\n  She tells the story of almost collapsing in the doctor's office when \nshe learned this. She told me personally that she wasn't a person who \nsupported abortion. She told many people she was opposed to it. Here \nshe was facing a medical emergency with few choices. So she prayed over \nit, talked to her husband, and made the decision to go for this \nprocedure.\n  The Senator on the floor, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum, said she did the wrong thing. He has interposed his medical \njudgment, for what it is worth, and said she should have had a \ndifferent form of abortion. I would not be so bold as to stand here on \nthe floor and suggest that I can make that call or that decision. But \nit is interesting to me that, even being pro-life, he was saying she \nshould have had an abortion procedure other than the one she chose.\n  The reason I raise that is that this amendment deals with all \nabortion procedures, not just one, not just the D, or the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure, but all abortion procedures postviability. I \nthink that is important to remember in what we are trying to achieve.\n  If your goal is to reduce the number of late-term abortions in \nAmerica, this amendment I am offering today has a greater likelihood of \nreducing that number than the underlying bill, S. 3. There is no \nquestion about it because only a very small percentage of cases use the \nso-called partial-birth abortion procedure. In fact, this amendment \ndeals with all late-term abortions, all postviability abortion \nprocedures. It would actually reduce the number of abortions performed.\n\n  My amendment bans all postviability abortions regardless of \nprocedure, unless ``the continuation of pregnancy would threaten the \nmother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.'' This \nexception is very important.\n  The Santorum bill violates a woman's constitutional right to have her \nhealth protected. If you will read S. 3--and I have read it--the \nbiggest problem they have is that the language of the bill before us is \nvirtually identical to a Nebraska statute that has already been \nrejected by the Supreme Court. The Senators who offer this believe that \nby passing this bill and putting in the findings of the earlier Supreme \nCourt decision, that is good enough.\n  I don't think any student of constitutional law would agree with \nthat. If the Supreme Court has reached the conclusion that this \nlanguage fails to meet the test of Roe v. Wade, why in the world are we \ngoing through this exercise again?\n  I think it is better for us to consider my alternative because the \nsubstitute I am going to offer takes a different approach--I hope a \nbetter approach. The Santorum approach, S. 3, violates a woman's \nconstitutional right to choose under Roe v. Wade. Don't take my word, \ntake the word of the Supreme Court. That was their decision in the case \ninvolving the Nebraska statute with the identical language.\n  My amendment specifically protects a woman's constitutional right to \nchoose before viability, before the fetus can survive outside the \nwoman. That is an important distinction. Viability is, of course, a \nmoving target. When Roe v. Wade was decided--I think the year was \n1973--the last 3 months was considered the time that a fetus would be \nviable. Medical technology has made great leaps forward, and now there \nare fetuses that are viable even before the third trimester. So we say \nto use as a standard, as in Roe v. Wade viability in general, the \ntrimester system. They said in Roe v. Wade that until the time the \nfetus is viable there are certain legal rights in this country. We \nprotect them. Once viability is reached, those rights change and we \nstart acknowledging the fact that the fetus has now become a potential \nhuman being at birth.\n  Roe v. Wade said we will define the laws of America based on \nviability. The amendment I offered does the same thing. The problem \nwith S. 3--the reason this bill and versions have been\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nfound unconstitutional repeatedly is they refuse to accept the basic \npremise of Roe v. Wade, the premise of existing law in this country.\n  They just will not acknowledge that you should have a law banning a \ncertain procedure only after viability, which is why the Supreme Court \nrejected the Nebraska statute. Each time it is stricken because it \nwould, in fact, restrict the right to abortion before viability, before \nthe fetus could survive. Court after court has stricken down State laws \nthat have followed S. 3, the Santorum model. Yet here we are again: \nsame language, same outcome.\n  My amendment represents a good-faith effort to deal with this issue. \nIt draws the line with two specific cases: where the continuation of \nthe pregnancy would threaten the mother's life, or risk grievous injury \nto her physical health. That is it, grievous physical injury.\n  Here is why I believe this is reasonable. At this late stage in the \npregnancy, seventh, eighth, or ninth month, I believe Roe v. Wade tells \nus we have to look at the pregnancy in different terms. We are now \npostviability. We are now in a circumstance where the fetus can \nsurvive.\n  In those circumstances, I say the only way legally you can terminate \nthe pregnancy is if continuing it could threaten the mother's life or \ncontinuing it could subject her to grievous physical injury, which is \ndefined in my amendment.\n  What does grievous physical injury include? What if you diagnosed a \nmother in the course of her pregnancy with serious cancer? And what if \nyou found that continuing the pregnancy somehow compromised your \nability to treat her for that cancer? My alternative retains the \nabortion option for mothers facing extraordinary heartbreaking medical \nconditions, such as breast cancer, discovered during the course of \npregnancy.\n  It also allows for postviability abortions in cases of uterine \nrupture, which could leave a woman sterile, future infertility, or non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma.\n  The two-doctor requirement is an important element, too. Some have \nsaid one of the objections is if you allow a doctor to certify a \nmother's life is at stake or she runs the risk of grievous physical \ninjury if the pregnancy continues, you are playing right into the hands \nof the people who perform the abortions. I have heard this argument so \nmany times. We have addressed it directly in the amendment.\n  I require a second doctor to certify. You have two doctors who come \nforward and say exactly what the conditions are to terminate a \npregnancy. I also have a requirement that this can be waived in case of \na medical emergency.\n  What risks do doctors take if they are falsifying this information? \nIf they do not tell the truth that a mother's life is at risk, they \nface substantial fines and the suspension or revocation of their \nlicense to practice medicine. It could not be more serious.\n  There are two reasons to support my substitute amendment. One, it \nwould actually reduce the number of abortions performed in this Nation \nand, two, because it has a health exception not contained in S. 3, the \nSantorum bill now under consideration, it is more likely to withstand \nthe constitutional challenge and scrutiny across the street at the \nSupreme Court.\n  I am honored a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nhave joined me as cosponsor of the amendment. I particularly note the \npresence of my friend and cosponsor, Senator Collins of Maine. Her \ncolleague, Senator Snowe of Maine, is also a cosponsor, as is Senator \nAkaka, Senator Bingaman, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Mikulski.\n  As I said at the outset, it is the only amendment I know that will be \nconsidered in this debate which has the support of Senators across the \nspectrum on the issue of abortion:\n\n     those who consider themselves closer to a pro-life position, \n     those who consider themselves closer to a pro-choice \n     position. I think that speaks to the wisdom of the amendment. \n     I hope my colleagues will consider that when the issue comes \n     before us for a vote.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. I am going to address most of my remarks \nto the bill. I do not think the amendment has been offered yet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator's indulgence for a moment. That is \ncorrect, I have not offered the amendment. If I might at this time \noffer the amendment and then yield to the Senator to continue his \nspeech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. DURBIN], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, \n     and Ms. Mikulski proposes an amendment numbered 259.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud today to join Senator Santorum \nfrom Pennsylvania and a large majority of my colleagues in support of \nS. 3, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in passing this bill.\n  Since the amendment has been laid down, I will ask my colleagues to \njoin me in opposing the amendment that has been put forth. My colleague \nsaid the procedure is not well defined. Read the bill. Partial-birth \nabortion is the best description of what we are talking about: allowing \na baby to come within a heartbeat of being born and then killing it.\n  I am also fascinated by this term ``viable fetus.'' I think that \nmeans a real baby. It is nice to phrase it in some other terms, but if \nit is viable, that is what we are talking about.\n  The argument is this is about health. No, it is not. This is about \nlife and death, and that is why the bill speaks specifically to life. \nWhat we tried to do in framing this argument was to come up with the \nmost definite situation where those who are in favor of abortion are \nseparated from those opposed to abortion. It is pretty much that \nsimple. There will be some efforts to try to bring it back a little \nmore to the middle so people can put a little bit of a spin on their \ndecision, but that is what this is about. That is why a procedure was \npicked that is not taught any longer; a procedure was picked that the \nAmerican Medical Association said is not needed anymore. That makes it \npretty clear.\n  You can add all the qualifications you want to it, but if you cannot \noppose partial-birth abortion, then you must be in favor of abortion.\n  We are debating an issue that has an important bearing on the future \nof this Nation. Partial-birth abortion is a pivotal issue because it \ndemands we decide whether we as a civilized people are willing to \nprotect the most fundamental of rights: the right to life itself.\n  If we rise to this challenge and safeguard the future of our Nation's \nunborn, if we make this statement, we will be protecting those whose \nvoices cannot yet be heard by the polls and the surveys and those whose \nvotes cannot be weighed in the political process. If we fail in our \nduty, we will justly earn the scorn of future generations when they ask \nwhy we stood idly by and did nothing in the face of national \ninfanticide.\n  Opponents have argued this procedure is necessary in some \ncircumstances: to save the life of the mother or to protect her health \nor future fertility. These arguments do not have foundation in fact.\n  First, this bill provides an exception if the procedure is necessary \nto save the life of the mother and no alternative procedure could be \nused for that purpose. Moreover, leaders in the medical profession, \nincluding former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, have stated \nunequivocally that partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary \nto protect a mother's health or her future fertility; on the contrary, \nthis procedure can pose a significant threat to both.\n  A coalition of over 600 obstetricians, perinatologists, and other \nmedical specialists have similarly concluded there is no sound medical \nevidence to support the claim that this procedure is ever necessary to \nprotect a woman's future fertility.\n  These arguments are offered as a smokescreen to obscure the fact that \nthis procedure results in taking an innocent life at the moment of \nbirth.\n  The practice of partial-birth abortion has shocked the conscience of \nour Nation and it must be stopped. Even the American Medical \nAssociation has endorsed this legislation. In a letter to the chief \nsponsor of this bill, Senator Santorum, the American Medical \nAssociation explained:\n\n       Although our general policy is to oppose legislation \n     criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has \n     supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly \n     defined and not medically indicated. The Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act now meets both of these tests. . . . Thank \n     you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting \n     a procedure that we all agree is not good medicine.\n\n  I have based my decision on every bill that has come before this body \non what effect it will have on those generations still to come. We in \nthe Senate have deliberated about what steps we can take to make the \nsociety a better place for our families and the future of our children. \nWe, as Senators, will cast no vote that will more directly affect the \nfuture of our families and our children than the vote we cast on this \nbill.\n  When I ran for office, I promised my constituents I would protect and \ndefend the right to life of unborn babies.\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nThe sanctity of human life is a fundamental issue on which we as a \nnation should find consensus. It is a right that is counted among our \nunalienable rights in our Nation's Declaration of Independence.\n  We must rise today to challenge what has been laid before us to \nprotect innocent human life. I urge my colleagues to join me in casting \na vote for life by supporting the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  All of us in this body have had significant life experiences that \nhave helped to shape our political philosophies. Eight years ago I had \na torn heart valve and I was rushed to the hospital for emergency \nsurgery. I had never been in a hospital except to visit sick folks. It \nwas a tragic surprise to me. I am impressed with what they are able to \ndo, but I have also been impressed with what doctors do not know, and \nthat is not a new revelation for me.\n  Thirty-one years ago, my wife and I were expecting our first child. \nOne day early in the sixth month of pregnancy my wife started having \nsome pains and contractions. We were so new to the game we did not even \nknow what that was, but fortunately she had a visit to the doctor \nscheduled that same day. I took her there and I went back to work. Then \nI received a call from the doctor who said: You need to come down here, \ntoo.\n  That is never good news when the doctor tells you to come to the \ndoctor's office.\n  I went down there and the doctor said: You may have a baby right now. \nWe know it is early, 3 months early, and that does not bode well. We \nwill try to stop it and we can probably stop it.\n  Well, they could not. The baby came that night and weighed just a \nlittle over 2 pounds. I wanted to know what the doctor was going to do. \nThe doctor said: Well, we will just have to wait until morning and see \nif she lives--not exactly the kind of medical technology and knowledge \nthat one wants somebody to have about a baby.\n  He admitted that he did not have any control over it. It was in our \nhands at that point in time. We sweated through that night. I could not \nbelieve that the doctors could not stop a premature birth. Then I could \nnot believe that they could not do something to help the newborn baby. \nUntil someone sees one of these babies, they will not believe what a 6-\nmonth-old baby looks like. At the same time my wife gave birth to this \n2-pound baby, a friend of ours gave birth to a 10-pound baby. This was \na small hospital in Wyoming. They put them side by side. It was a \ntremendous contrast. Some of the people viewing the babies said: Oh, \nlook at that one. Looks like a piece of rope with some knots in it; too \nbad.\n\n  We were watching her gasp and struggle with every breath. We watched \nthe whole night to see if she would live, and we prayed.\n  The next day we were able to take this baby to a hospital that \nprovided excellent care. She was supposed to be flown to Denver where \nthey have the best care in the world for premature babies, but it was a \nWyoming blizzard and we could not fly. So we took a car from Gillette, \nWY, to the center of the State to Wyoming's biggest hospital to get the \nbest kind of care we could find. We were supposed to be going down in a \nfour-wheel drive ambulance but we wound up going in an Edsel. They \nthought there might be a bigger medical emergency in the county so they \ncould not get the four-wheel drive. I can say I thought the biggest \nemergency in the county was my daughter.\n  On the way down, we ran out of oxygen. We noticed a whole bunch of \nhighway patrolmen going the other way. When we got to the hospital, we \nasked if there had been an accident, and they said, no, that they were \nlooking for a premature baby who should have gotten to the hospital \nquite awhile ago. I said: Well, that was us.\n  We did receive exceptional care, but the doctor's words when we first \ntalked to him at that hospital were: Well, another 24 hours and we will \nknow something. Another 24 hours before we could do anything.\n  After those 24 hours, there were still several times when we went to \nthe hospital and there would be a shroud around her isolette. We would \nknock on the window. The nurses would come over and say: It is not \nlooking good. We had to make her breathe again. One time when they \nsaid, have you had the baby baptized, that is kind of the ultimate of \ndropping your heart in your shoes.\n  We had had the baby baptized in the first few minutes after birth \nusing some water in a coffee cup from the kitchen of the hospital. A \nminister had come over and done that. We did learn from the nurse that \nthey had no records of ever having lost a baby who had been baptized. \nBut that child worked and struggled to live. Feeding was a major \nprocedure. Losing the ability to get blood through the navel was a \nmajor procedure. She was 3 months premature, did not have any gristle \nin her ears. They flopped over. That had to be a part of the procedure \nyet that would come with growth.\n  We went through 3 months of waiting to get her out of the hospital. \nEvery step of the way the doctor said: Her ability to live is not our \nduty. It gave me a whole new outlook on life, and now I want to tell \neveryone the good news. The good news is that the little girl who \nstruggled so hard to live, who would be considered barely viable by \nmost people who perform abortions, is now an outstanding public school \nprincipal in Chugwater, WY; population, 256; enrollment, 126 kids, \nkindergarten through 12th grade. She is doing a marvelous job. She has \ntaught school for several years.\n  That does not mean she came out of this problem free. She was very \nlucky. There was a hum in that isolette that was sometimes covered up, \nand that hum wiped out a wide range of tones to her. So she cannot hear \nthe same way that you and I do, but, oh, can she read lips, which in a \nclassroom is really a very good thing for a teacher to be able to do. \nEven after they know she can read lips, they usually test her with it.\n  This experience has given me an appreciation for all life, and it \ncontinues to influence my vote now and on all issues protecting human \nlife.\n  I have come to know what an incredible thing that is as I watch some \nof life's situations. For instance, death row, how come those people do \nnot want to die? It is not common to life.\n  I watch these young babies. They want to live. They struggle with \nevery fiber of their being to live. It is an incredible struggle--one \nwe do not see in kids who come to term or kids as they grow up--when \nthey have no meat on their bones and lungs that are underdeveloped and \nfingernails that have not come on yet. It is an incredible struggle \nthat gives a new appreciation of life. It is such a miracle that we \nhave to respect it. We have to work for it every single day in every \nway that we can.\n  I think this bill will help that effort. I think this bill will bring \na little conscience, a little consideration, and a whole lot of thought \nto this country. It is something we have needed and we do need and we \nwill need for the future of our kids.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to \nban all late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions that are \nnot necessary to save the woman's life or to protect her physical \nhealth from grievous harm.\n  This debate should not be about one particular method of abortion \nbut, rather, about the larger question of under what circumstances \nshould late-term or post-viability abortions be legally available. Let \nme be clear from the outset that I am strongly opposed not just to \npartial birth abortions, but to all late-term abortions. I agree they \nshould be banned.\n  Such a ban, however, must have an exception for those rare cases when \nit is necessary to save the life of the woman or to protect her \nphysical health from grievous harm. Fortunately, late-term abortions \nare extremely rare. In my state, according to the Maine Department of \nHuman Services, just five late term abortions have been performed in \nthe last 20 years.\n  Our amendment goes far beyond, in many ways, what the Senator from \nPennsylvania is attempting to accomplish. His legislation would only \nprohibit one specific form of abortion. In fact, the bill he supports \nwould not prevent a single late-term abortion. Let me emphasize that \npoint. The partial-birth legislation before us would not prevent a \nsingle late-term abortion. A\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nphysician could simply use another, perhaps more dangerous, method to \nend the pregnancy.\n  By contrast, Senator Durbin's proposal would prohibit the abortion of \nany viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to \npreserve the life of the woman or to prevent grievous injury to her \nphysical health.\n  Those of us who have worked with Senator Durbin on this amendment \nhave taken great care to tightly limit the health exception. Grievous \ninjury is limited to physical health. It is defined as a severely \ndebilitating disease or impairment specifically caused or exacerbated \nby the pregnancy or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a \nlife-threatening condition.\n  The Maine Medical Association has said that when ``a pregnant woman \ndevelops a life or health-threatening medical condition that makes \ncontinuation of the pregnancy dangerous, abortion may be medically \nnecessary. In these cases, intact dilation and evacuation procedures \nmay provide substantial medical benefits or, in fact, may be the only \noption. This procedure may be safer than the alternatives, maintain \nuterine integrity, reduce blood loss, and reduce the potential for \nother complications.'' That is what the experts the doctors are telling \nus.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment also includes a very important second \nsafeguard. If the treating physician determines that continuation of \nthe pregnancy would threaten the woman's life or risk grievous injury \nto her physical health, before the abortion could be performed, a \nsecond opinion, in writing, must be obtained from an independent \nphysician. This second opinion must come from a physician who would not \nbe involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved in \nthe treatment of the woman.\n  Unlike the pending bill, which I believe is unconstitutional, the \nDurbin amendment is consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2000 \ndecision in Stenberg v. Carhart. In Stenberg, the Court struck down \nNebraska's partial-birth abortion ban statute because it lacked any \nexception for the preservation of the health of the woman. The Court \nreaffirmed its earlier decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood \nv. Casey that abortion regulation must include an exception where it is \n``necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of \nthe life or health of the woman.''\n  The Durbin amendment is a fair and compassionate compromise on this \nextremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all late-term \nabortions--including partial-birth abortions--are strictly limited to \nthose rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of \nthe woman is in serious jeopardy. This amendment presents an unusual \nopportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' advocates to work \ntogether on a reasonable approach, and I urge our colleagues to join us \nin supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Durbin \namendment. The Durbin amendment is virtually identical to the amendment \nwe voted on 3 years ago, I believe it was. It adds simply nine words at \nthe beginning of the amendment. It says:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for a physician to intentionally abort \n     a viable fetus unless the physician prior to performing the \n     abortion----.\n\n  And then adds these words----\n\n     including the procedure characterized as a partial birth \n     abortion.\n\n  And then it goes on. The only difference between that amendment and \nthis amendment are the words ``including the procedure characterized as \npartial-birth abortion.'' So all of the operative language that seeks \nostensibly to ban certain abortions is the same.\n  What are the problems I have, and hopefully the majority of Senators \nhave with this ban? No. 1, it only limits--the partial-birth abortion \namendment is limited to postviability abortions. As we have discussed \nhere over and over, the fact that babies who are delivered in a \npartial-birth abortion, partially delivered, are of gestational age \nthat is in excess of 20 weeks and would otherwise be born alive, that \ndoesn't necessarily mean that they would necessarily survive long-term \nor ``be viable.'' Viability means not that they wouldn't be born alive, \nbut they would have a reasonable chance of survival. That is a very \nsubjective thing. There is no definition of viability, no standard set \nin this legislation, and it is purely the abortionist's determination \nas to whether the child being aborted is viable or not.\n  We have survival rates of infants born at different gestational ages. \nSenator Frist, earlier today, went through some of those. I will review \nthem.\n  Prior to 23 weeks, a child being delivered at that time has a small \nchance. There are probably single digits or less at 21 weeks; 22 weeks \nmaybe high single digits. I don't have those numbers but that is my \nrecollection from years past debating this.\n  When we get to 23 weeks, you have a survival rate of about a third; \n24 weeks, two-thirds; 25 weeks, almost three-quarters; 26 weeks, 90 \npercent. But in each one of these cases, even though there are \nincreasing survival rates, you have a great deal of subjectivity of an \nabortionist being presented with a baby to determine whether this baby \nin utero is viable. It is purely subjective. All the physician has to \nsay is: Well, I don't think it is viable. So this just doesn't apply. \nThere is no ban at all.\n  Since most partial-birth abortions are in the 20-to-26 week range, \nthere is ample opportunity, ample opportunity for the doctor to say in \nevery instance: Well, I just didn't think it was viable.\n  There is no penalty. There is no criminal sanction. There is no peer \nreview. There is nothing. So this is a ban without a ban because it \nleaves it completely to the subjectivity of the physician to determine \nviability.\n  But that is only half the problem. The other half of the problem is \nthese words. It says:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for a physician to intentionally abort \n     a viable fetus unless the physician prior to performing the \n     abortion, including partial-birth abortion, certifies in \n     writing in the physician's medical judgment, based on the \n     particular facts of the case before the physician, \n     the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the \n     mother's life----\n  Hear the operative words----\n\n     or risk grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  Substantial risk? A little risk? One percent risk? Half of 1 percent \nrisk? Is it .00001 percent risk? Risk is not defined and risk can mean \nany risk. It can mean the slightest risk.\n  As Dr. Warren Hern, who is the author of the standard textbook on \nabortion procedures back in May of 1997, said in response to a question \non this amendment: ``I say every pregnancy carries a risk--'' not just \nof grievous physical injury--``of death.''\n  Every pregnancy carries a risk of death.\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  He was talking about life and death. We are talking about her \nphysical health, grievous injury to her physical health. That is the \nsecond part.\n  The fact is, risk not being defined is the open door. The analogy was \nmade by someone that if you have a law that says no dog may be shot \nexcept where there is a risk that the dog in question may bite, then \nany dog can be shot because there is always a risk a dog is going to \nbite.\n  Any abortion can be performed because there is always a risk. Since \nwe don't quantify the risk, since we don't define the risk, risk is \nwhatever a doctor wants it to be. I bet you will not find one \nobstetrician, and certainly not one abortionist, who will make the \nclaim that there is no risk associated with the continuation of a \npregnancy. It is by definition a risk to the mother.\n  The most healthy pregnancy involves some element of risk. So this \namendment--I am not questioning the intent of the Senator from \nIllinois. I know he went at this and worked, together with the Senator \nfrom Maine and others, to try to come up with a good-faith attempt to \nput a bill together that would be effective. But this doesn't do it. \nThis simply leaves open both the issue of viability and who determines \nit. There is no peer review, no second-guessing to the abortionist, and \nthen risk as an open question meaning any amount of risk.\n  I believe you will not find any doctor who will say there is not a \nrisk. Of course, there is a risk.\n  The point is not risk, the point is, Is this procedure medically \nnecessary? I keep coming back to this issue over and over again. Please \npresent me with a case, with a case, a factual circumstance where this \nprocedure would\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nbe medically necessary and where other abortion procedures could not \ndo, not just as good a job, but a better job. Every health organization \nout there that I am aware of has said this is bad medicine, this is not \npracticed, this is not used to protect the health of the mother.\n  We keep trying to grab for a health-of-the-mother exception when the \nhealth of the mother is not at issue here. If we were concerned about \nthe health of the mother, then we would not be doing the procedure. We \nwould not be allowing a procedure that is unhealthy; that takes a \nmother who obviously is under some duress or she wouldn't be at an \nabortion clinic. She is under some either mental or physical or some \nsort of angst that she wants to terminate her pregnancy. This is not a \ndecision that people come by easily.\n  What the doctor in the case of a partial-birth abortion does is give \nher a pill and send her home for 2 days. Come back to me in 2 days. And \nwe have cases that we are aware of, the Senator from Ohio spoke about \nthis yesterday, where children have been delivered in the interim \nbecause the cervix dilated too quickly, too much, and the baby was \ndelivered. In one case that we are aware of the baby lived. But they \nsend these mothers home for 2 days.\n\n  The doctor who designed this procedure said the reason he designed \nthis procedure is because it only takes 15 minutes out of his day to do \nand the other abortions that are peer reviewed, that are taught in \nmedical schools, that obstetricians and gynecologists do--not that \nphysician who is not an obstetrician who came up with this procedure or \nmost of the practitioners, if not all of them that I am aware of who do \nthis procedure, to my knowledge, I am not aware that any are \nobstetricians. I could be wrong on that but the ones who have come \nbefore the Congress, the ones I have seen cited in articles and \ntestimony who have done these, none of them have been obstetricians. \nThey are abortionists who make money doing abortions. And they came up \nwith a great way to make more money, to get patients in and out \nquicker.\n  That is great for them, but it certainly does not take into much \naccount the health consequences to women. If you look at the AMA, and \nevery physician group that has come forward, none of them are seeing \nthis is superior medicine. None of them say this is to the benefit of \nwomen's health.\n  I hear so many of my colleagues talk about women's health, women's \nhealth, women's health. Where are they when we are trying to ban a \nprocedure that is contraindicated for the health of women? Where there \nare other, safer, better procedures that are available for the health \nof women, and yet they stand foursquare against women's health, \nfoursquare for the option that is the most dangerous. And it is never \nmedically necessary. So you have to ask yourself a question. If you \nhave a procedure that is the most dangerous procedure and that is the \nmost unhealthy for women, why would you continue to support it if it is \nnot medically necessary? Not one case has ever been voiced at any \nhearing or in any debate on the floor of the Senate or on the floor of \nthe House. One has come forward and said: This is why. Here is the \ncase. This is why this is the best procedure. No one--no doctor, no \nSenator, no Congressman, no layperson--has come forward and said, this \nis it, this is the reason. So we have no medical need.\n\n  But we do have overwhelming definitive evidence that this procedure \nis the most dangerous to the health of women. Yet there are those who \nwill come to the floor and proclaim their allegiance to improving \nwomen's health who want this procedure made legal for the people who \ndesigned it so they can make more money doing abortions in 15 minutes \nas opposed to 45 minutes--and do it in a way that is just brutal.\n  This is another quote from Dr. Hern:\n\n       I have very serious reservations about this procedure. You \n     really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement that \n     this is the safest procedure to use.\n\n  This is an abortionist who wrote the textbooks on abortions. He \nauthored the textbooks on abortion procedures. He does late-term \nabortions regularly. He is the expert. He continues to do them. What \nprofessional in the field says you can defend it? Why would people come \nto the floor of the Senate to defend the procedure that is \nindefensible, that is never going to be necessary, and that is harmful \nto women? Why? Why would you do that? Because you want to create \noptions. Why would you want to create an option that is harmful to \nwomen?\n  I understand people come in all the time saying we can't restrict the \ndoctors. Of course you can restrict the doctors if what they are \nprescribing is harmful and if there are safer procedures to use. We \ndarned well better proscribe it. We have to. We have an obligation to.\n  You have folks who are abortionists saying you can't defend it. Yet \nhere we are defending it. Why? Why are some Members so dug in to \nprotect a rogue procedure that brutalizes and executes a child 3 inches \naway from constitutional protection?\n  I had a debate several years ago on this issue. If a child was \nsomehow delivered--3 inches from the crown of the baby's head, from the \nnape of the neck to the crown of its head--had actually gone through \nthe cervix and the child was separated from the mother, they wouldn't \nargue that you then could kill the child. What is it that would allow \nthis procedure?\n  You heard the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, talk about all of \nthe complications and all that could go wrong with the blind procedure \nin an area of the woman's body that is very susceptible to injury, and \nwhere these other abortions are performed under controlled conditions \nwith sonograms and you can see everything that is going on. In this \ncase, it is a blind procedure with a sharp instrument in an area that \nis very vulnerable to injury. Why? Why would people continue to defend \na harmful procedure, the least safe procedure done only by \nabortionists, only in abortion clinics, not taught by schools and not \ndone by obstetricians? Why? To protect women's health? No. For medical \nnecessity? No. Why? That is a question I think needs to be answered.\n  What is so sacred here? What is so valued? What is it that is very \ndeep inside this opposition, that is so important that we are willing \nto risk the health of women who are told by their doctors this is safe \nand who listen? The doctor-patient relationship is important. There is \na sanctity to it. But you know what. Not every doctor lives up to that.\n\n  Many of the people who come here and argue for partial-birth abortion \nwill be here in a few weeks arguing that doctors aren't worthy in many \ncases of our support and are against medical malpractice. These doctors \nwho do bad things to patients should be hammered. What about these \ndoctors who perform indefensible procedures that risk the health of \nwomen? Why aren't we going after them? Why are we protecting them? What \nis it? What is it that is so important that we are going to risk \nwomen's health when there is no medical necessity to do this? Where? It \nis contraindicated.\n  We know the answer to that question, don't we? We can't even come \nclose. We can't even approach abortion as a right in this country \nbecause it is the supreme right. Anything that even approaches \nmentioning the word ``abortion'' irrespective of the consequences to \nwomen, God knows irrespective of the consequences to the children, we \nsimply preserve this right above all rights.\n  OK. Maybe we have to argue for a procedure that is dangerous. Maybe \nwe have to argue for a procedure that is going to hurt women. Maybe we \nhave to argue for a procedure that is never medically necessary. Maybe \nwe have to argue for a procedure that is not done by obstetricians even \nthough we are talking about obstetrics here. We have to bite the bullet \non this. Yes.\n  But do you know what. We are going to keep the barbarians away from \nthe gates. We are going to keep these people away from this absolute \nright of abortion. Whether it costs a few women their lives, or it \ncosts the health or reproductive future of women, you know, it is worth \nit. We can't erode this right.\n  That is what it is all about. That is what it is all about. It is not \nabout women's health. There is not one physician in this country who \nhas come and testified that this is about women's health because it is \nnot. The AMA says it is not. The obstetrician organizations say it is \nnot. No one argues\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nthat this is the best procedure. The expert on third-term abortion said \nit. He is on this side of their issue, by the way. But at least he will \nmake the claim that he is for women's health, and he will do so \nhonestly, which is something that has not been done by many of the \noutside ``experts'' who have argued to keep this procedure legal.\n  I have chart after chart. I will bring them out later. I have six \ncharts going through the history of partial-birth abortions and showing \nthe absolute fabrication put forth by those against this ban.\n  Oh, the anesthesia would dull the pain. Then another person testified \nthat the anesthesia and the cervical block would kill the baby and \nthere wouldn't be a live delivery. The anesthesiologists around the \ncountry went into panic. Women were hearing about it and they would be \nafraid with their delivery if they took anesthesia--that there would be \na cervical block and their child would die. They had to backtrack from \nthat.\n  The list is long. The facts stand. The reason this bill has gotten \nover 60 percent of the Senate, when probably 40 to 45 percent of the \nSenate is pro-life, is because this is, as the doctor from Colorado \nsaid, an indefensible procedure.\n  So why? Why are we here? We are here because the Supreme Court \ndefended the indefensible. They defended the indefensible. We have \nresponded to the Supreme Court.\n  I hope the Justices read this Record because I am talking to you. I \nwant you to read every time over the last few days where I asked \nsomebody to come forward with a health exception, where there is a \nmedical necessity for the health of the mother to use this procedure. \nRead it. Observe the silence. I understand the Justices' feelings on \nthe issue of abortion. It is evident from your decisions. It is obvious \nfrom your position. But you can't ignore the facts. Don't ignore the \nfacts, because they are clear. They are as clear as the sound of the \npeople coming forward with their examples. It is crystal clear. There \nis no sound and there is no reason for a health exception. Take the \nobligation you have seriously because I can tell you, the Members of \nthis body do. We take our constitutional obligations dead seriously. \nThe weight of evidence is not just overwhelming, it is dispositive. \nListen. Learn. Decide justly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nEdwards be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the arguments made \nby the Senator from Pennsylvania. I would say the vast majority of the \narguments he made had nothing to do with my amendment. He has made \narguments on behalf of the underlying bill, and that is his right. I \ndefend his right to do it. But I come back to a discussion of my \namendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has argued that because we use the term \n``risk'' in this amendment that it is so hard to understand or define, \nit really does not present any kind of protection. Let me read it for \nthe record. We say in this amendment we will prohibit all late-term \nabortions--that is, abortions after a fetus is viable--unless two \nmedical doctors certify--and one has to be a nonattending physician, in \nother words, an expert brought in for consultation--that continuing the \npregnancy would threaten the mother's life--that is fairly \nstraightforward--or risk grievous injury to her physical health.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says: I just don't understand what you \ncould mean by ``risk grievous injury to her physical health.'' The fact \nof a pregnancy is a risk.\n  That certainly is true. But to argue that each pregnancy is a risk of \ngrievous physical injury is to overstate it and to ignore section 1535 \nwhere grievous injury is defined.\n  Keep in mind, the doctors who have to certify in writing that you are \ndealing with a viable fetus and there is a risk of grievous physical \ninjury have their medical licenses on the line. Their right to practice \nmedicine is on the line. If it is found they have misstated the facts \nconcerning this pregnancy, they could lose their medical license. Do \nyou think a doctor is likely to take that lightly? I don't. A doctor is \nlikely to take that seriously.\n  Then read what we say about grievous physical injury. We define it as \nfollows: It means a severely debilitating disease or impairment, \nspecifically caused or exacerbated by the pregnancy or an inability to \nprovide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.\n  There is a limitation which the Senator from Pennsylvania has not \nadded into his argument. Listen to this limitation. The term grievous \ninjury does not include any condition that is not medically diagnosable \nor--this is the important part--any condition for which termination of \nthe pregnancy is not medically indicated.\n  You have to link up the continued pregnancy and the grievous physical \ninjury in order to justify this late-term abortion. That is a fact. \nThat is clearly written.\n  For the Senator to dismiss this and say, risk of grievous physical \ninjury, that doesn't mean anything, any doctor would sign that, the \ndoctor has his medical license on the line as to whether or not that \nfetus is viable, as to whether or not there really is a threat to the \nwoman's life, as to whether or not there is a risk of grievous physical \ninjury. His medical license is on the line, and it spells it out \nspecifically in the amendment.\n  To think some doctor is going to just say: I will just sign that for \nmy buddy, the abortionist, I don't believe so. Both doctors have too \nmuch at stake.\n  Let me go on to his underlying bill where he spent most of his time \nin argument. I understand it. The Senator from Pennsylvania feels very \npassionately about this issue. I know it. I have listened to him. I \nbelieve it, and I respect it. We see it differently, but I respect him \nfor it.\n  I have grown weary, and I think the people who prepare \nthe Congressional Record have grown weary of our submitting into the \nRecord a direct rebuttal of the statement he repeats on the floor over \nand over and over again. Show me one doctor, not an abortionist, but \none doctor who tells you this is medically necessary.\n\n  Well, I have already submitted them for the Record: The American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They have said it. They \nhave said this may not be the only procedure to save the life or \npreserve the health of a woman, but it may be the best, the most \nappropriate procedure in a particular circumstance. That is not good \nenough for the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  First, he is mistaken if he does not believe obstetricians and \ngynecologists are medical physicians. They are. You have to be a \nmedical doctor, board certified, in order to be part of this American \nCollege, and they have said it. They have made it clear. They are not \nso-called abortionists, which is a term developed here as part of the \ndebate. These are people who do many other things with their lives, \nworking with women for their health as well as for the delivery of \ntheir children. They have said the Senator from Pennsylvania is just \nwrong.\n  They are not alone. This has already been entered into the Record. I \nwill not belabor the point. But Dr. Stewart from the University of \nCalifornia at San Francisco says the same thing. She says, after \nconsidering this procedure, this could turn out to be the best approach \nfor some women facing very serious medical problems related to their \npregnancy.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania went on to say, not one person \ntestified this procedure was medically necessary. I hasten to remind \nhim, we put it in the Record early this morning, not one person \ntestified because this bill was not brought before a committee. This \nbill came directly to the floor without any hearings, without any \ntestimony from anybody.\n  I could stand here and say: Not one person testified on behalf of \nyour amendment, not one doctor. You couldn't find one single doctor who \ntestified on behalf of this bill, S. 3. That is technically correct \nbecause there was never a committee hearing.\n  So let's make it clear: Not one doctor testified for or against S. 3. \nThis amendment came directly to us without any committee testimony.\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n  Then the Senator from Pennsylvania spends a great deal of time \narguing this procedure is harmful to women and those who are defending \nit--this is the procedure of his bill, nothing to do with my \namendment--this procedure is harmful to women. I want to tell the \nSenator from Pennsylvania I have very limited expertise in \nanything. But before I came to the Senate, or to Congress, I was a \npracticing trial lawyer and spent many years defending doctors in \nmedical malpractice cases, and suing them. I have been on both sides, \nrepresenting plaintiffs and doctors who were defendants. So I know a \nlittle bit about medical malpractice.\n\n  I will tell you this. Can you imagine in this day and age any doctor \nis going to take part in a procedure that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsees as so clearly harmful to women? How crazy could you be to subject \nyourself to the liability of a woman suing you because you chose a \nprocedure that was harmful to her, as opposed to one that was safer for \nher. That just doesn't pass the smirk test. Doctors think twice. We \nhear about defensive medicine. They think about procedures and what is \nthe safest procedure, the procedure least likely to expose them to \nliability in a court of law.\n  For the Senator from Pennsylvania to suggest these doctors ignore \nthat and walk in and practice medicine that is harmful to women, \nwithout a concern, is to ignore the obvious. Medical malpractice cases \nare found in every State in the Union and substantial verdicts result \nfrom them. So I argue that common sense suggests if this were the most \nharmful procedure, the so-called partial-birth abortion, very few \ndoctors would ever consider using the procedure and running the risk of \nexposing themselves to a medical malpractice case.\n  I would like to, if I can for a few minutes, go back to my amendment \nbecause most of what the Senator from Pennsylvania had to say didn't \nrelate to my amendment at all. Here is where I think we come down. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania has had laser-like intensity focusing on one \nabortion procedure. He is troubled by it; he is pained by it. It is \nclear from his voice that it affects him very much, and I respect him \nfor that. Thank goodness people fight for their convictions, even if I \ndisagree with him on this. Please, I say to the Senator, step back and \nlook at my amendment in a larger context. I am not just prohibiting the \nprocedure you find objectionable. I am prohibiting that procedure and \nall other abortion procedures, postviability. So if, instead of using \nthe dilation and extraction--partial-birth abortion--there is an effort \nto use some other procedure to terminate abortion after a fetus is \nviable, it is prohibited by my amendment, except in two specific cases: \nwhere the life of the mother is at stake and where there is a risk of \ngrievous physical injury.\n  I suggest to the Senator if your goal in service on this issue is to \nlimit the number of abortion procedures in America, reduce the \nlikelihood of abortions being performed, you will achieve that goal \nmore with my amendment than with your bill. Your bill is strictly \nfocused on one extraordinary and rare procedure. Mine is focused on all \nprocedures, postviability. You would have to say in fairness, just by \nthe simple numbers of abortion procedures, my amendment is going to \naffect more abortion procedures and limit more abortion procedures than \nyours.\n  Why am I willing to do this? Because despite the fact I am pro-\nchoice, I do believe, when it comes to postviability abortions, we \nreally should draw a straight line.\n  My wife and I have been blessed with three wonderful kids. It has \nbeen a long time since we had a new baby in the house, and a long time \nsince I watched my wife grow large in pregnancy. But I can remember the \nseventh, eighth, and ninth months. Most fathers and husbands can. At \nthat point in time, there is no doubt about it, your wife is about to \nhave a baby and it is very visible and, in many cases, she is very \ngreat with child, as they say. I really believe in those cases you \nshould not terminate a pregnancy, except under the most extraordinary \nof situations. That is why we spell it out. That is why we require two \ndoctors to certify it in writing. That is why we say to these doctors: \nYour medical license is on the line if you misrepresent the facts of \nthis pregnancy. That is pretty serious, and that is why people across \nthe abortion spectrum, pro-choice, pro-life, have come to this \namendment and said this is a reasonable approach.\n\n  I am never going to convince my colleague and friend from \nPennsylvania. He is passionately focused, laser-like focused on this \nprocedure, and I will concede to him that, pre-viability, that \nprocedure could be used under the Durbin amendment. I think those cases \nare rare. But I hope he will step back for a second and be honest about \nwhat this amendment could achieve. I think it is a positive thing. I \nthink it is something many of us would feel makes real progress in \ndealing with this issue.\n  Make no mistake, I have spoken to people on the phone today, some of \nthe strongest pro-choice organizations. They don't want the Durbin \namendment to pass because they feel, as you have described, that if you \ndid that, it is just the beginning of an exception to Roe v. Wade. I \ndon't think it is an exception that is inconsistent with Roe v. Wade. I \nthink it says we are going to consider the health of the mother, but \nonly in the most exceptional circumstances, where grievous physical \ninjury is at issue.\n  I might also add we did not include the phrase ``mental health.'' As \nSenator Collins, my cosponsor, said earlier, to say that a woman late \nin her pregnancy--the seventh, eighth, or ninth month--argues she is \nsuddenly in depression and therefore a viable fetus that could survive \nshould be terminated is something I cannot personally accept. I am \nsorry, I cannot accept that. I will concede the point that if a woman \nsuffering from a serious mental illness is suicidal and her life may be \nat risk. That would be the most extreme case, but that would be the \nonly linkage I can think of that would justify the termination of a \npregnancy that late in the pregnancy. That is the only one that comes \nto my mind.\n  So we have made this exception for physical health, grievous physical \ninjury, or the life of the mother. I will not submit these statements \nagain for the Record, but I believe ample evidence has been given as \npart of this debate that the obstetricians and gynecologists say do not \npass the underlying bill, that medical doctors, such as Dr. Stewart, \nhave written letters that suggest the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to make sure the Senator understands the \nquestion. I have not been asking about medically necessity. The quotes \nyou have given me have said that it ``ought to be the best.'' Another \nquote was ``may be the best.'' I have not asked for someone's opinion \non what ought to be or what could be. What I have asked for is an \nexample. I wanted a fact circumstance to be provided as to where this \nwould be the best, this would be appropriate, this would be medically \nindicated.\n  Not in any of the letters I have seen entered into the Record, or in \nany testimony, has anybody come forward with a factual circumstance \nthat would support the general statements that it ``may be.'' Well, it \nmay be a lot of things, but the point is, there are no examples that \nsupport the ``may be.''\n  All I have asked for--and I have not received a response--is an \nexample for us to look at, to have peer-reviewed, and to determine \nwhether there is in fact a situation that has heretofore not been put \nin the Record, which is an example of a medical condition that would \nindicate a partial-birth abortion would be indicated to deal with as \nthe best alternative.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may respond to the Senator, this is a statement from \nViki Wilson of California in opposition to the bill. She tells of her \npregnancy in 1994. She was expecting Abigail, her third child. \nNaturally, she was excited about this. It was 36 weeks into her \npregnancy, when an ultrasound detected what all of the previous \nprenatal testing failed to detect--an encephalocele. Approximately two-\nthirds of her daughter's brain had formed outside her skull. She says \nin this statement--and I will make it part of the Record:\n\n       What I had thought were big, healthy, strong baby movements \n     were in fact seizures.\n       My doctor sent me to several specialists, including a \n     perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist, and a geneticist in \n     a desperate attempt to find a way to save her. But everyone \n     agreed, she would not survive outside of\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n     my body. They also feared that as the pregnancy progressed, \n     before I went into labor, she would probably die from the \n     increased compression in her brain.\n       Our doctors explained our options, which included labor and \n     delivery, C-section, or termination of the pregnancy. Because \n     of the size of her anomaly, the doctors feared that my uterus \n     might rupture in the birthing process, possibly rendering me \n     sterile. The doctor also recommended against a C-section, \n     because they could not justify the risks to my health when \n     there was no hope of saving Abigail.\n       We agonized over our options. Both Bill----\n\n  Her husband----\n\n       and I are medical professionals.\n\n  She a registered nurse, he a physician, so they understood the \nmedical risk.\n\n       After discussing our situation extensively and reflecting \n     on our options, we made the difficult decision to undergo an \n     Intact D and E.\n\n  Also known as partial-birth abortion. What I am saying to my friend \nand colleague from Pennsylvania is this is an example, a case, where \nshe had three options. Partial-birth abortion was the third and chosen \nfor medical reasons, reasons for which she said in the statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement of Viki Wilson, California, in Opposition to S. 3\n\n       I urge you to oppose S. 3. I understand that this bill is \n     very broad and would ban a wide range of abortion procedures. \n     Mine is one example of the many families that could be harmed \n     by legislation like this.\n       In the spring of 1994, I was pregnant and expecting \n     Abigail, my third child, on Mother's Day. The nursery was \n     ready and our family was ecstatic. My husband, Bill, an \n     emergency room physician, had delivered our other children, \n     and would do it again this time. Jon, our oldest child would \n     cut the chord. Katie, our younger, would be the first to hold \n     the baby. Abigail had already become an important part of our \n     family. At 36 weeks of pregnancy, however, all of our dreams \n     and happy expectations came crashing down around us. My \n     doctor ordered an ultrasound that detected what all of my \n     previous prenatal testing had failed to detect, an \n     encephalocoele. Approximately two-thirds of my daughter's \n     brain had formed outside her skull. What I had thought were \n     big, healthy, strong baby movements were in fact seizures.\n       My doctors sent me to several specialists, including a \n     perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist and a geneticist, in \n     a desperate attempt to find a way to save her. But everyone \n     agreed, she would not survive outside my body. They also \n     feared that as the pregnancy progressed, before I went into \n     labor, she would probably die from the increased compression \n     in her brain.\n       Our doctors explained our options, which included labor and \n     delivery, c-section, or termination of the pregnancy. Because \n     of the size of her anomaly, the doctors feared that my uterus \n     might rupture in the birthing process, possibly rendering me \n     sterile. The doctors also recommended against a c-section, \n     because they could not justify the risks to my health when \n     there was no hope of saving Abigail.\n       We agonized over our options. Both Bill and I are medical \n     professionals (I am a registered nurse and Bill is a \n     physician), so we understood the medical risks inherent in \n     each of our options. After discussing our situation \n     extensively and reflecting on our options, we made the \n     difficult decision to undergo an Intact D and E.\n       It was important to us to have Abigail come out whole, for \n     two reasons. We could hold her. Jon and Katie could say \n     goodbye to their sister. I know in my heart that we have \n     healed in a healthy way because we were able to see Abigail, \n     cuddle her, kiss her. We took photos of her. Swaddled, she \n     looks perfect, like my father, and Jon when he was born. \n     Those pictures are some of my most cherished possessions.\n       The second reason for the intact evacuation was medical: \n     Having the baby whole allowed a better autopsy to be \n     performed, to give us genetic information on the odds of this \n     happening again.\n       Losing Abigail was the hardest thing that has ever happened \n     to us in our lives, but I am grateful that Bill and I were \n     able to make this difficult decision ourselves and that we \n     were given all of our medical options. There will be families \n     in the future faced with this tragedy. Please allow us to \n     have access to the medical procedures we need. Do not \n     complicate the tragedies we already face. Oppose S. 3.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the fact is, Viki Wilson testified at a \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing in November of 1995. Viki Wilson, as \nthe Senator from Illinois said, was in her ninth month of pregnancy \nwhen she received an abortion. According to Mrs. Wilson's testimony, \nthe death of her daughter Abigail was induced inside the womb:\n\n       My daughter died with dignity inside my womb, after which \n     the baby's body was delivered head first.\n\n  At this Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Hatch suggested to Mrs. \nWilson that her abortion was not a partial-birth abortion as defined by \nthe bill. Mrs. Wilson responded:\n\n       It is true, if you take it verbatim. You know, my daughter \n     did die in the womb.\n\n  That is not an example, No. 1, of partial-birth abortion because she \ndid not have one and, No. 2, that she is not a medical professional. \nShe is a registered nurse, and as my wife is a nurse, my mom is a \nnurse, please do not get me wrong, nurses are wonderful health \nprofessionals, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for them. I \nlove them personally. To suggest that in her testimony, which you just \nheard--and it was not a partial-birth abortion, but even if it was, to \nsuggest that her testimony was somehow a decision by the medical \ncommunity or a physician putting forward a case by which the physician \nsaid this was the best option, this was medically necessary, and that \nother options were less desirable, this just does not make the case, \nwhich I keep coming back to the point that the case has not been made.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Why do you keep asking this question? \nSomeone is going to come forward with something. After 7 years, you \nfigure out no one is going to come forward because there are no cases, \nand no medical professional worth their salt would come forward and say \nsomething they know is not true because they are going to be reviewed \nby umpteen obstetricians and gynecologists who will come forward with \nthe medical peer-reviewed research that indicates this procedure is not \nmedically indicated, that it is not necessary, and it is not in the \nbest health interest of the mother.\n  It is brutal, and as the Senator from Tennessee, our leader, said \ntoday, the only advantage he can think of to a partial-birth abortion \nis the certainty of a dead baby. That is the advantage. It is that you \nknow by thrusting those scissors into the base of the skull and \nfeeling--because the doctor has the baby in his or her hand. I just \nfind it to be remarkable, from the standpoint of a physician who can \nhold a live baby who would otherwise be born alive, a baby who could \nsurvive outside the womb, in many cases, and while holding that child, \ntake the sharp, long Metzenbaum scissors and thrust it into the base of \nthe baby's skull.\n  I know many people have felt living beings die in their presence, \nwhether it is a pet or a variety of different living animals, and the \nfeeling when life rushes out, you know it. You feel it. The baby is \nmoving. All of a sudden, as Brenda Shafer, the nurse who testified, \nsaid, the baby's arms and legs spring out, tensing up because of the \nshock to the system and then falling limp. Life evaporated, leaving \nthis little child. And then to take those scissors and open them up--\nopen them up--to stretch out the base of the skull, as the Senator from \nTennessee described, to rupture the cranial cavity, to create a hole \nbig enough to insert a suction catheter.\n  Why? Why is this procedure needed? I keep coming back to the \nquestion. It has not been answered because there is no answer. That is \nwhy the health exception is not needed, because it is outside the scope \nof Roe v. Wade, and we have clarified the other problem the Supreme \nCourt noted, which is the vagueness of definition. We have a much more \ndetailed definition. It cannot be confused.\n\n  The Senator from California keeps coming to the floor and suggesting \nother medical procedures would be covered by this current definition. \nAgain, I ask the Senator from California to come to the floor and tell \nme what procedure would be covered by this definition. So far, the \nanswer to that has been silence.\n  On the two points the Court had trouble with the Nebraska statute, \nthere has been no response. I suggest there is no response because we \nhave solved these problems, and that is why this legislation is \nconstitutional.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is the third time I have taken the \nopportunity to talk about partial-birth abortion, and each time I have \naddressed the Members of the Senate, I have tried to cite some of the \nmedical experts in this field.\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n  It has been pointed out that, with the exception of one Member of the \nSenate, we are not doctors. I certainly am not a doctor, but I have \ntried to cite the experts and have tried to help build a record for \nanyone who looks at the proceedings to help them understand what the \nbasis for the Senate's ultimate decision will be. I want to continue \nthat practice tonight.\n  It is certainly true, as has been pointed out on the Senate floor, \nthat we did not hold hearings on this bill, but over the last few \nyears, we have had a series of hearings in both the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives on this very issue. We have heard many \nwitnesses. We not only have had the opportunity to hear the witnesses \nin the Senate and the House in the Judiciary Committees, but we also, \nof course, have had the opportunity to read journals, read news \narticles, and other sources of information.\n  Very briefly, what I would like to do tonight is add to some of the \ncitations I have already made and talk about the question that my \ncolleagues have been talking about, and that is whether or not partial-\nbirth abortion is ever medically indicated. I submit to my colleagues \nthe evidence is very clear that partial-birth abortion is not medically \nindicated. It is never medically indicated. Therefore, a medical \nexception is simply not needed.\n  It is important to cite what several OB/GYN doctors have said about \nthis horrific procedure. These medical doctors, these experts, will \ntell us this abortion procedure is brutal, it threatens the life of the \nmother, and it is just plain unnecessary and inhumane.\n  I will take a few minutes tonight to read to my colleagues some of \nthe testimony from doctors who, for years, have been saying this \nprocedure is, in fact, wrong. In a House of Representatives hearing on \nSeptember 27, 1995, these doctors testified that partial-birth abortion \nis not sound science. I ask my colleagues to listen to what several of \nthem had to say.\n  First, Dr. Donna Harrison, then the chair of the Department of \nObstetrics and Gynecology at the Lakeland Medical Center in Michigan, \nstated:\n\n       There is no data or any proposed reliable data to show that \n     this has a lesser incidence of maternal morbility or \n     mortality than the standard prostaglandin termination. \n     Indeed, any surgeon can tell you that when you put a sharp \n     instrument into a body cavity, there is a always the risk of \n     perforating that organ. As an obstetrician, I can testify \n     that this procedure has no medical indication over standard, \n     recognized and tested procedures for terminating a pregnancy.\n       It is a hideous travesty of medical care and should rightly \n     be banned in this country.\n\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, former Director of Medical Education, Department of \nOB/GYN, at Mt. Siani Medical Center in Chicago and a member of the \nAssociation of Professors of Obstetrics, had this to say:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is not a standard for care for \n     anything. In fact, partial-birth abortion is a perversion of \n     a well-known technique . . . used by obstetricians to deliver \n     that is considered to impose a significant risk to maternal \n     health when it is used to deliver a baby alive, suddenly \n     become the ``safe method of choice'' when the goal is to kill \n     the baby? In short, there are absolutely no obstetrical \n     situations encountered in this country, which require a \n     partially delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve \n     the life or health of the mother.\n       When I described the procedure of partial-birth abortion to \n     physicians who I know to be pro-choice, many of them were \n     horrified to learn that such procedure was even legal.\n\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, then a Clinical Associate Professor at Wright State \nUniversity and Chair of the Department of Obstetrics at Miami Valley \nHospital in Ohio, said this:\n\n       There is simply no data anywhere in the medical literature \n     in regard to the safety of this procedure. There is no peer \n     review or accountability of this procedure. There is no \n     medical evidence that the partial-birth abortion procedure is \n     safer or necessary to provide comprehensive health care for \n     women.\n\n  To add to this, Dr. Lewis Marola, then Chair of the Department of \nObstetrics at St. Clare's Hospital in Schenectady, NY, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The conversion of a fetus presenting a vertex to a breech \n     position, as in the partial-birth abortion, is capable of \n     causing an abrubtion of the placenta and amniotic fluid \n     embolism. This is a dangerous and life-threatening situation. \n     Never, ever, in our 30 years of practice, have my colleagues \n     or I seen a situation which warrants the implementation of \n     partial-birth abortion. Personally, I cannot imagine why a \n     practitioner would want to resort to such barbaric techniques \n     when other, recognized methods are available.\n\n  Dr. Joseph DeCook, once a Fellow at the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, said the following at a press briefing \nin 1996:\n\n       Reaching into the uterus to pull the baby feet first \n     through the cervix--the second step [of the procedure]--``is \n     a very dangerous procedure,'' ``frightening'' because of the \n     chance that it might ``tear the uterus.'' This is the \n     ``reason it was abandoned 30 or more years ago.'' There is \n     also the danger of ``perforating the uterus'' with the \n     instrument used to grab the baby's leg. Such a tear or \n     perforation could result in severe hemorrhage, necessitating \n     immediate hysterectomy to save the life of the mother.\n\n  Dr. Cutis Cook, from the Michigan State College of Human Medicine, \nsaid this:\n\n       To my knowledge, and in my experience, this particular \n     procedure described as partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically necessary to preserve the life or future fertility \n     of the mother and may, in fact, threaten her health or well-\n     being or future fertility. In my opinion--and, I think, in \n     the opinion of the medical literature and other specialists \n     in my field--the fact remains that there are choices and \n     there are alternatives to the partial-birth abortion \n     procedure that do not require the use of what has now been \n     demonstrated as a potentially dangerous and completely \n     unstudied and unnecessary procedure.\n\n  I can go on, but the testimony from medical doctors is very clear. \nThey know in their heart and in their minds that this procedure is not \nappropriate. It is never necessary. I would like to conclude tonight \nwith what Dr. Joseph DeCook once said. He said that the partial-birth \nabortion procedure ``sounds like science fiction. It ought to be \nscience fiction.''\n  I think that says it all. The testimony from these medical doctors is \nvery clear. I have cited other doctors the other two times I have been \nin the Chamber, and when I come back later, I will cite other doctors. \nBut the evidence is abundantly clear that partial-birth abortion, as my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania has pointed out, is never medically \nindicated. At no time have the proponents of this procedure been able \nto come to the floor and cite any specific example where anyone has \nbeen able to say that it was truly medically indicated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the Senator from Ohio \nwho was in the Chamber until about this hour last night laying out very \nclearly, very succinctly, the legal, moral, ethical, and medical \nevidence as to why this procedure should be banned and why this Senate \nshould feel comfortable, from all of those perspectives, in passing \nthis legislation.\n  He has done an outstanding job, a thorough job. He has been an \ninvaluable ally in the Senate in making the case, hopefully convincing \ncase, to hopefully a clear majority of our colleagues, that we should \nproceed, maybe as early as tomorrow, in passing this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for his outstanding work and his \nobvious commitment to this cause.\n  I wanted to respond to the Senator but I got sidetracked. The Senator \nfrom Illinois mentioned something at the end of his talk, and I focused \non that and I forgot to respond to a couple of other points he made \nwith respect to his amendment.\n  I focus on the two problems, again, and respond to his defense of his \namendment. He defended his amendment and spent the entire time talking \nabout the grievous physical injury, grievous injury that could result, \nthat would be the exception for his ban on late-term abortions.\n  I have concerns because of the issue of risk, and I don't want to \nrepeat that. But what he did not talk about, as big or if not a bigger \nhole in this legislation, is the whole issue of viability. I believe \nthe Senator--and I will check the record on this, and if I am wrong, I \napologize. I believe the Senator from Illinois suggested that the \nphysician certify that a child is not viable, and if there was a \ndetermination that the child was viable, he could lose his license. I \ndon't see that in the legislation. I don't see a second doctor \noverseeing the issue of viability. It is clear from the reading of the \nlanguage that the second doctor can review the risk of serious injury \nbut is not responsible under the legislation for reviewing the issue of \nviability.\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n  So we have, again, before we even get to the issue of injury or \nhealth risk, we have the issue of the abortionist determining whether \nthe baby about to be aborted is viable. Since most partial-birth \nabortions and most abortions, generally, occur prior to viability, and \nmost abortions, even late-term abortions, occur in the 20th, 26th, 27th \nweek, very few occur 30-plus weeks where viability rates are very high. \nWe are talking here about giving the abortionist, certainly in the case \nof partial-birth abortions, an unreviewable decision that even in the \ncases of 35 weeks there may be--I have not looked at the literature \nbecause it is, I agree, a rare circumstance--I suggest there are \nprobably some instances where you can conclude the child is not viable \nfor some reason, even at that stage.\n  What the Senator from Illinois has done is create a standard of \nviability that is not reviewable, and certainly with the case of \npartial-birth abortions, and I know his amendment purports to cover \nmore than that, it covers even a very small subset of those abortions \nthat we are talking about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At the risk of reading what has been read many times:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for a physician to intentionally abort \n     a viable fetus unless the physician prior to performing the \n     abortion--\n       (1) certifies in writing . . .\n\n  The premise of this amendment is viability.\n  Now, I will concede the point, there are fetuses in the 35th week and \nlater that are not viable, will never survive outside the womb. But the \npremise here is the fact that you must be dealing with a viable fetus \nin order for this prohibition to apply and for the exceptions to be \napplied, as well.\n\n  For the Senator to continue to ignore this clear language, I have to \nsay I am prepared to defend what is written here. I am not prepared to \ndefend what the Senator refuses to read.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, is the Senator from Illinois \nstating that legislation requires a second opinion on the issue of \nviability?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It says:\n\n       An independent physician who will not perform or be present \n     at the abortion and who was not previously involved in the \n     treatment of the mother certifies in writing that, in his or \n     her medical judgment based on the particular facts of the \n     case, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the \n     mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  This is not your so-called abortionist. This is an independent \nphysician.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I did not hear the word ``viable'' in that second \ndefinition. There was no term--\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator a question? The Senator is \nunderstood to be a practicing attorney; is that true?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator to pause and think about that for a \nmoment. If a doctor called you and said: Attorney Santorum, there has \nto be a second opinion here on whether this mother's pregnancy should \nbe terminated postviability, late term, what do you suggest?\n  I think the first thing you would ask is: What is the penalty if you \nare mistaken?\n  Oh, I could lose my license, face a penalty of $100,000 or $250,000.\n  I think Attorney Santorum and Attorney Durbin would say to this \ndoctor: Wait a minute. Let me sit down and talk to you. Are you \nprepared to stand behind the fact that this is a viable fetus? Are you \nprepared to stand behind the fact that there is a threat to life here? \nBecause if you are not, stay away from us.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, you ask: Are you prepared to stand \nbehind the fact this is a viable fetus? Yet your amendment does not say \nthat. Your amendment does not say the second physician has to certify \nto viability.\n  What your amendment says is they have to certify that there is a \nrisk--that word that I have trouble with, a ``risk,'' a risk, not a \nsubstantial risk, not a verifiable risk, but a risk of grievous injury.\n  So your amendment does not deal with the independent physician \nsecond-guessing the determination by the doctor that this is a viable \nfetus. So we do not even get to the issue of risk if the doctor says it \nis not viable. If the doctor says it is not viable, no one is looking \nover his shoulder because your ban does not apply. So nobody is coming \nin and saying: Well, I understand you can say you are heavy handed with \nthis doctor. We have a doctor, Dr. Hern, who will certify under oath \nthat every pregnancy is a risk, that he can look at any pregnancy and \nfind a substantial risk, and the nexus you spoke about under the \nlegislation. This is the person who read the entire text of your \namendment and said he is willing to do so in every circumstance.\n  Setting that aside, we do not even get to that if the doctor \ndetermines no viability, correct? Is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say that it is a condition to even--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The condition is not a reviewable condition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is certainly reviewable.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, having sat across the desk \nfrom many physicians whom I represented, and sued, believe me, trust \nme, they are not going to stick their neck out, put their medical \nlicense on the line, unless there is certainty in their mind that they \ncomply with the statute.\n  The suggestion by the Senator--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Illinois just said the statute does \nnot apply if the physician certifies it is not viable. So the statute \ndoes not apply if the license is not on the line. But your statute does \nnot say that. You may want to say that, but it does not say that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I hope you understand that you and \nI come to this from a different perspective. Your perspective is one \nabortion procedure. You are prepared to not accept, but to tolerate \nother destructions of the fetus in abortion, but not this one, which \ntroubles you greatly.\n\n  I don't deal with that aspect. I deal with postviability, that is, \nlate-term abortions, of all types. And there is the distinction.\n  If the Senator is saying to me: ``You do not cover fetuses that are \nnot viable,'' guilty as charged. This amendment does not address the \nfetus that is not viable.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. Let me reiterate for the record, I \ndo not question--and I mean this with all sincerity--I do not question \nthe sincerity of the Senator from Illinois. I know because many on his \nside have voted against his amendment who agree with him on the \nposition of abortion. So I truly do recognize the Senator is attempting \nto find some middle ground.\n  With all due respect, I just don't believe you have gotten there, but \nI do not question you have attempted to do so.\n  The point I am trying to make is the whole operation of your statute \ndoes not apply unless the physician claims viability. If the physician \ndoesn't claim viability, then your statute doesn't apply. I am a \nphysician. I say--and under the Supreme Court a physician can abort a \nchild under any circumstances for any reason up until the time of \nseparation. So I have no legal liability out there. Outside of your \namendment, I have no concern about my license, a lawyer, anything.\n  So all I have to say is this child is not viable. If I make the claim \nthis child is not viable--I don't care if it is 39 weeks and 5 days. If \nI say it is not viable, your statute does not apply. If your statute \ndoes not apply, I am in the clear. So that is the concern I have, that \nyou leave the determination of viability to the physician.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can I ask--at least make a point here for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania? If he would be kind enough to read section 1532 of \nthe penalties, under offenses: First offense, section (b), second \noffense, section (c). Note that it says:\n\n       Upon a finding by the court the respondent in an action \n     commenced under subsection (a) has knowingly violated a \n     provision of this chapter, the court shall notify . . .\n\n  And it goes on to say medical license at stake, fine at stake.\n  Now, if you will turn back to read section (a) you will find 1531, \nsection (a) includes viability of fetus.\n  So if a doctor has misrepresented--for example, if there is medical \nevidence the fetus was viable and the doctor went ahead and performed \nan abortion, arguing, ``Well, it wasn't viable,'' and in so doing has \nmisrepresented the medical facts, he can have his license revoked and \nface the penalty. That is\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nwhat it says, section (a). It doesn't go down to subsection (1) and \n(2); it says subsection (a), which includes viability of the fetus.\n  What we are driving at is this, I would say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Under this language I don't think I am going to get \nendorsed by any medical group that is going to stand up and say what a \ngreat amendment, Senator Durbin, because it puts an extraordinary \nburden on doctors who want to be involved in these abortions. But I \nthink that burden is merited when we are dealing with these particular \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would just suggest to the Senator from Illinois, \nhaving read this, having read the reference--not criminal but civil \npenalties could apply--it still leaves viability, No. 1, undefined; \nand, No. 2, solely at the discretion of the abortionist. You can say \nthere is other evidence. But particularly when most of these abortions \nare performed, most late-term abortions are performed--the question of \nviability is a percentage. You can talk to most obstetricians and they \nwill tell you the determination of viability is very difficult. \nFrankly, you leave it unreviewable from the standpoint of the act.\n\n  You say someone could bring a suit or someone could bring charges. \nThe question is, Who would bring the charges? That is another story. \nBut nevertheless, someone could. But to be able to prove a child is \nviable when you have up through early 30 weeks a percentage that are \nnot, I think is a very steep task, and one that would not, I believe, \ndissuade. Certainly in the area where most late-term abortions are \nperformed, the percentage is high enough that any abortionist could \ncome forward and say this child, I just didn't believe it could live, \nand that as long as they did so with a reasonable judgment, you have no \nopportunity. You have no standard. You really do leave this very much \nwide open. I would just argue it does not accomplish what you want.\n  Again, there may be a handful of abortions that would fall under this \nin terms of a court or somebody saying because of the advanced--38, 39, \n37 weeks we would have--there is a presumption of viability. But there \nis no presumption of viability in this statute. There is no presumption \nof viability, I believe, in any statute I am aware of. So if there is \nno presumption, then you have a very difficult task proving viability \nwhen you are not the physician at the time, there, doing the procedure.\n  Even if we get past the viability issue, which I believe we have not \ngotten past, you have this whole issue of risk of grievous injury to \nher physical health. I would again argue that the word ``risk'' leaves \nopen a wide area, a wide berth for opportunity for physicians to get \naround this problem.\n  I just refer you to not just Warren Hern, but we have other \nphysicians, other abortionists who have come forward and said they \nwould come forward certifying that, under your statute, they read your \nlanguage and said they would feel comfortable under that language. I \nsuggest there are still problems here.\n  Again, I respect the Senator for his desire to deal with this issue, \nbut I just don't believe his amendment hits the mark.\n  Mr. President, I am going to depart from conversation on the Durbin \namendment and I will not talk anymore about it this evening. If the \nSenator wants to stay some more and talk about it, I am just going to \ntalk generally on the bill.\n  I do not want to tell the Senator it is 8:30, if he wants to go home, \nhe can go home, but I am going to make just some general comments on \nthe bill. Then I intend to wrap up.\n  If the Senator would like to make another comment for a few minutes? \nOK. Then I will just proceed.\n  I will be brief because I know the Presiding Officer has been in the \nchair a long time and we have students here who want to get out before \n9 o'clock so they can be in class tomorrow morning, so I want to make \nsure they are not deprived of their educational opportunities. I will \ndo my best to finish before 9 o'clock.\n  When I came to the floor years ago to debate this issue, we talked a \nlot about the impact of abortion in this country; as Senator Brownback \nsaid earlier, the cheapening of the value of human life that has \noccurred as a result of legalized abortion. That was amplified greatly \nby this particular procedure, this brutal procedure in which the child, \na living child is all but born, 3 inches from legal protection under \nthe Constitution, and then treated so brutally, so harshly.\n\n  I talked about the culture and how the culture is implicated in this, \nand how the medical profession is implicated in this. We hear so much \ntalk about obstetricians wanting to keep these legal, but you would be \nhard-pressed in many communities to find obstetricians because of legal \nliability and all the problems associated with that.\n  In fact, the indication I talked about a few years ago was a classic \ncase in point of obstetricians' insensitivity to life, compounded with \ntheir fear of legal liability. It is a pretty potent combination for \nany child with a disability in utero. It leads a lot of doctors to head \nout of town and not want to deliver children with any kind of fetal \nabnormality. Mothers who have children with fetal abnormality really do \nhave trouble finding doctors who will treat because of the fear of \nlitigation and because of this sense that, well, you know, let's just \nhave an abortion. You don't want to be hassled with this child who may \nhave multiple difficulties or problems. Certainly I don't want to have \nto deliver a child who has multiple problems because you can blame me \nfor some of this, or I can be dragged into lawsuits.\n  So we have a real coarsening, from both the litigation end and, I \nwould argue, from the abortion end of this issue dealing with the very \nchildren the other side uses to legitimize or attempt to legitimize the \nprocedure of partial birth.\n  For these hard cases--these hard cases are not cases where the \nwoman's life or health is in danger, but where the child's prognosis is \npoor because of multiple abnormalities--trisomy 13 was one example, \naencephaly was, I think, another example, or hydrocephaly. There are \nall sorts of examples out there where children who have very severe \nbirth defects are sort of shoved aside by our health care \nsystem, because of insensitivity to life compounded with the fear of \nlegal liability, the one such case which I talked about in great detail \nwas the case of Donna Joy Watts. Donna Joy came here to the Senate. In \nfact, her mother sat up in the galleries. Donna Joy was not allowed to \nsit in the galleries because she wasn't old enough. Under the rule, we \nwere not permitted to bring her into the gallery.\n\n  She is a little girl who is a true miracle.\n  Very briefly, 7 months into her pregnancy, Lori Watts and her \nhusband, Donny, learned through a sonogram that their child would not \nbe normal. She went to see a genetic counselor. Unfortunately, there \nare far too many genetic counselors in this country. The genetic \ncounselor quickly referred her for an abortion saying that their child \nhad hydrocephalus, which is water on the brain; and that as a result of \nthe water buildup, brain development was not normal because of pressure \non the brain. As a result, their child would either die shortly after \nbirth or would be living a ``horrible life.''\n  One of these genetic counselors suggested what would be a partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  They didn't know that they were being referred for an abortion when \nthey were referred to the doctor. But they were. They rejected that \noption. Through their faith and through their love of their child in \nthe womb, they made the decision that if their child, Donna Joy, was \nhurting and was sick, they would act like parents who have a child that \nis hurting and sick. You do everything you can to help your child. It \nis a natural parental reaction. It is a very difficult reaction. It is \nvery difficult to deal with these circumstances. But it is the instinct \nto first want to see what you can do to help your child, even if things \nlook hopeless.\n  I have given the example many times. When parents find out their 7-\nyear-old is stricken with leukemia which may be fatal, or diagnosed as \nfatal, I don't think the immediate reaction of most parents is, well, \nlet us execute him to put him out of his misery. The immediate reaction \nis, What can we do to fight? What can we do to\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nhelp this child survive? How can we rally around him or her to fight \nthis problem that has confronted our family? Thankfully, many parents \nrespond like Donny and Lori Watts. They were advised to see a \nspecialist in high-risk obstetrics. I will not go through all of the \ndetails, but I can tell you that they went to hospitals and practice \nafter practice. Practices simply wouldn't see them. They wouldn't see \nLori because of her high-risk pregnancy and because of high risk in the \nsense that their daughter had severe abnormalities.\n  Eventually, they were able to find a doctor at the University of \nMaryland who agreed to monitor the pregnancy. And through a C-section, \nDonna Joy was born on November 26, 1991. She had very serious health \nconsequences.\n  This is a picture of her. You can see the size of her head. It was \nlarge as a result of the hydrocephalus.\n  The Watts family lives in Greencastle, Pennsylvania.\n  Seven months into her third pregnancy, Lori Watts learned that her \nchild would not be ``normal.'' Through a sonogram, Lori and her husband \nDonny learned that their child had a condition known as hydrocephalus--\nan excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the skull, also known as \n``water on the brain.''\n  Lori's Ob-Gyn made an appointment for her to see a doctor billed as a \n``genetics counselor'' at a clinic. When Lori Watts phoned the clinic \nto get directions and ask what they planned to do, the staff member \ntold her that most hydrocephalic ``fetuses'' do not carry to term so \nthey would terminate the pregnancy. When she asked how they could do an \nabortion so later in the pregnancy, she was told that the doctor could \nuse a ``skull-collapsing'' technique--what we refer to as a partial-\nbirth abortion. Appalled, Lori promptly canceled the appointment. When \nDonny Watts demanded to know why they had been referred to a facility \nthat performs abortions, their Ob-Gyn explained that he thought he had \nreferred them to a different doctor at that same clinic--a doctor who \nwould have suggested ways to keep the child alive. The Wattses were \nstunned to realize that the clinic offered both life and death--\ndepending on which staff doctor you happened to speak with.\n  Their Ob-Gyn then advised the Wattses to see a specialist in high-\nrisk obstetrics. They never expected the cavalier treatment they \nreceived from the medical community. Doctors at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, Union Memorial Hospital, and the University of Maryland \nHospital in Baltimore were quick to dismiss their baby's chances for \nsurvival and even suggested that if the child lived, she would be ``a \nburden, a heartache, a sorrow.'' According to Donny Watts, ``They \nwouldn't even give her a chance.'' Instead, they urged Lori to abort \nthe baby to protect her own health and future fertility. Medical staff \nat Johns Hopkins would not even see Mrs. Watts. When she explained her \nsituation over the telephone, she was urged to have an abortion. The \nWatts family received similar treatment from a perinatologist and a \nspecialist in high-risk and severe abnormalities at Union Memorial \nHospital. This perinatologist advised Mrs. Watts to have an abortion \nand claimed that without a neo-natal intensive care unit NICU, Union \nMemorial could not care for this sort of child. After making her own \ninquiries, however, Mrs. Watts learned that Union Memorial did in fact \nhave a NICU. The Wattses next appealed to the University of Maryland \nhigh-risk obstetrics clinic, where the attending physician told Mrs. \nWatts she needed an abortion because the ``fetus'' had occipital \nmeningoencephalocele--part of the brain was developing outside the \nskull.\n  Still determined to save their child, Lori and Donny Watts continued \neducating themselves about their baby's abnormalities and searching for \na doctor who would perform the delivery. Finally, another doctor at the \nUniversity of Maryland agreed to monitor the pregnancy. Through a \nCaesarean delivery, the Watts' third daughter, Donna Joy, was born on \nNovember 26, 1991.\n  Yes, Donna Joy was born with serious health problems. And like any \nloving parents, the Wattses expected the medical community to work \ntirelessly to help their new baby survive. They were greatly \ndisappointed to discover that many members of the hospital staff \ntreated Donna Joy with the same apathy, pessimism, and callousness \nafter her birth. For instance, the Wattses were alarmed that doctors \nwaited three days to implant a shunt to drain excess fluid from the \nbaby's head. In prenatal consultations with a perinatologist, they had \nlearned that the shunt should have been implanted as soon after the \ndelivery as possible.\n  To add insult to injury, hospital staff made no attempt to feed Donna \nJoy in the traditional sense. Doctors at the University of Maryland \nbelieved that Donna Joy's deformities would prevent her from sucking, \neating or swallowing. Because of a neural tube defect that made feeding \nher difficult, Donna Joy received only IV fluids for the first days of \nher life. Lori refused to give up. Initially, she literally fed breast \nmilk to Donna Joy with a sterilized eye dropper, to provide sustenance. \nThen, at two weeks of age, the shunt failed, and Donna Joy was \nreadmitted to the hospital for corrective surgery. When a tray of food \nwas delivered to her hospital room by mistake, Lori had a brainstorm. \nShe mashed the contents together and created her own food for the \nnewborn with rice, bananas, and baby formula. She fed this mixture to \nthe baby one drop at a time with a feeding syringe.\n  Unfortunatley, Donna Joy's fight for life became even more \ncomplicated. At two months of age, she underwent an operation to \ncorrect the occipital meningoencephalocele. At four months, a CT scan \nrevealed that she also suffered from lobar-holoprosencephaly--a \ncondition which results from incomplete cleavage of the brain. She was \nalso suffering from epilepsy, sleep disorders, and continued digestive \ncomplications. In fact, the baby's neurologist conveyed to a colleague, \n``We may have to consider placement of a gastronomy tube in order to \nmaintain her nutrition and physical growth.''  The baby was still \nhydrocephalic and could not hold her head up. Furthermore, the baby was \nsuffering from apenea--a condition in which spontaneous breathing \nstops.\n  Then, at eighteen months of age, Donna Joy had another brush with \ndeath. She had suffered from encephalitis--inflammation of the brain--\nthroughout the summer. Donna Joy developed amnesia, tore at her face \nand eyes, and could not talk or walk. Her recovery was--miraculously, I \nwould suggest--facilitated when Lori Watts popped a tape into her VCR \nat random. The tape happened to contain an episode of the television \nshow Quantum Leap in which the show's star, Scott Bakula, sings a song. \nUpon hearing Bakula's rendition of ``Somewhere in the Night,'' Donna \nJoy showed the first signs of responsiveness in months.\n\n  At two years of age, Donna Joy had already undergone eight brain \noperations. Although most of these occurred at the University of \nMaryland Hospital, in one case doctors had to perform surgery at the \nchild's bedside with local anesthesia. Finally, the family received \ngood news about Donna Joy's prospects. Donna's neurologist, who re-\nexamined the child after a seizure in September, 1996, noted that at \nfour and one half years, Donna Joy could speak, walk, and handle \nobjects fairly well. He also thanked a colleague `` . . . for the kind \napproval for follow-up and allowing me to re-assess this beautiful \nyoung child, who is remarkably doing very well in spite of such a \nsignificant malformation of the brain.''\n  Before Donna Joy moved to Pennsylvania, Maryland Governor Parris \nGlendenning honored her with a Certificate of Courage commemorating her \nfifth birthday. Mayor Steve Sager, of Hagerstown, Maryland, proclaimed \nher birthday Donna Joy Watts Day. Members of the Scott Bakula fan club \nhave sent donations and Christmas presents for the Watts children. \nPeople from around the world who have learned about Donna Joy on the \nInternet have also been moved to write and send gifts. But perhaps most \nimportant, the Watts' determination has inspired a Denver couple to \nfight for their little boy under similar circumstances.\n  There is a lot of talk on the other side about partial birth \nabortions being necessary to preserve future fertility--indeed, one \ndoctor cautioned Lori Watts that her fertility could be compromised if \nshe chose not to have a partial birth abortion. Well, in June 1995 Lori \nand Donny Watts experienced the joy of welcoming another child--\nShaylah--into the family. Like many\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nchildren, Shaylah has asthma, but is otherwise healthy. Furthermore, \nLori Watts experienced no similar complications with this pregnancy.\n  The story of Donna Joy Watts continues to inspire the public. The \nchild that nobody gave a chance to live is now 11 years old. She has \noutlived her original prognosis by a decade. She continues to battle \nholoprosencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, tunnel \nvision, and Arnold-Chiari Type II Malformation--which prevented \ndevelopment for her medulla oblongata.\n  Donna Joy visited my office just a few weeks ago with her mother, \nfather, and two of her sisters. She is now being home schooled with her \nsisters. She is very active outside of school too. She has taken a gym \nclass where her favorite activities are running track and playing \nsoccer. While she may tire a little bit faster than the other kids, \nthere is no question that she keeps up with them and follows the rules \nof the games. Her teacher has said how very proud she is of how Donna \nhas excelled in class. She has also taken art classes, where she \nparticularly likes painting and beadwork. She loves music, and her \nchurch wanted me to know how much they love having Donna in their \nchoir. She is active in not only her church choir, but also actively \nparticipates in her Sunday school class. The picture we have here is \nfrom a few years ago when Donna Joy was flower girl in her aunt's \nwedding, one of 2 weddings Donna Joy was in that summer. And she \ncontinues to add to her collection of movie star memorabilia. Oh, and \nshe recently made an appearance on the Donahue Show with her mom Lori.\n\n  So far, Donna Joy sounds like a pretty normal kid. But let me tell \nyou a little bit more about her. Donna Joy is also very thoughtful \nabout the needs of others. In her Sunday school class, she will stop \nand help the younger children who might be struggling with doing their \ncrafts. She helps out around the house--without complaining! Donna Joy \nregularly helps a local shop pack up their extra cloths for shelters \nfor abused women, shelters for the homeless, and for orphanages in \nRomania. Not only that, but with her sisters and mother, she regularly \nvisits the elderly in nursing homes. She finds out which of them hasn't \nhad a visitor in a while and then plays games and sings with them. This \nlittle girl once described as ``a burden, a heartache, a sorrow'' is in \nfact a beautiful, lively child who is now caring for the needs of \nothers.\n  Donna Joy's pastor recently sent me a letter expressing his \nappreciation of Donna Joy's life. Pastor David Rawley noted that ``had \nDonna Joy's parents followed the advice of several physicians and \naborted this child, our community and church would have been bereft of \nan absolute treasure.'' He referred to himself as ``a member of the \ncommunity which benefits from her life.'' I think he raises an \nimportant point. We never know ahead of time the impact that one life--\nin this case, Donna Joy's--will have on a family, on a community, or \nfor that matter, the world. Lori wrote me the other day to say, ``Donna \nJoy never put my life at risk. She's only made it better!\n  Let me say again that Donna Joy went through an enormous amount of \nmedical procedures--shunts. She suffered from epilepsy, sleep \ndisorders, digestive complications, a variety of different \ncomplications that came with the condition that she had in utero. She \nsuffered from encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. She was 18 \nmonths of age and had all sorts of problems--amnesia, tore at her face \nand eyes, couldn't walk or talk. She was not given much chance of \nrecovery. And then a miracle happened. Donna Joy liked the television \nshow, ``Quantum Leap'' and the show's star, Scott Bakula. She would \nperk up when he sang a song. She would light up. She was responsive. By \nputting the tape in and continuing to stimulate her, she was able to \ncome through this and survive.\n  She underwent eight brain operations by the age of 2. She incurred a \nlot. She was a great inspiration to me in pursuing this cause because \nshe was proof that these children who are unwanted, who are wanted up \nto a point and then unwanted, unfortunately--because of their \nabnormality, they become unwanted and a subject for an abortion.\n  This is a hard case, a crisis pregnancy, as someone described, that \nturned out for the best.\n  In previous discussions I talked about cases that didn't turn out so \nwell. Subsequent to this debate and the publishing of my wife's book \nabout our son, Gabriel Michael, whose case did not turn out as well as \nDonna Joy Watts, many people have talked to Karen and to me about their \nown personal stories, and their own crises that they had to go through \nand deal with. They talked about the difficulties that were presented \nand how happy they were looking back that they saw it through; \nsupporting and loving their child up until natural death; and the \nhealing experience that they endured as a result of the pain that was \nbrought upon them.\n  Donna Joy is a good story. Donna Joy is someone who survived. All \nthese obstacles were placed in front of her. But she lived despite what \neveryone said was an impossible situation. We have a recent picture of \nher.\n  This is Donna Joy in a recent picture. She served as a flower girl in \na wedding. I understand she was in two weddings that summer. She has \nhad health problems and continues to have some. She has difficulties. \nHaving six little children at home, I know all about those difficulties \nand challenges that each individual child brings. But she is a fighter. \nShe is an inspiration to all the moms and dads who are going to \nconfront a difficult pregnancy--a pregnancy as some would suggest which \nwill go awry. Maybe 1 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent, some small \npercentage of the people who had Donna Joy's condition will survive as \nwell as she is. But she did because her parents believed in her. They \ndidn't accept the culture that said: You don't need this birth. It is \ntoo much for you.\n  I am sure Lori and Donny would say this is too much at times, as any \nparent would. But here is a real-life situation with hopelessness. But \noccasionally there comes hope.\n  As bad as it can be, if you have trust in your instincts and you \nfollow those instincts to love and support and nurture the child whom \nGod has given you, as a gift--it may not be as you open the package \nwhat you expected it to be, but it is nonetheless a gift; and you have \nto search, many times, for meaning from the gift, as Karen and I have--\nbut search and you will find the gift.\n  In Lori and Donny's case, the gift is obvious. She is a beautiful \ngirl, who wrote me a letter. I would like to read that letter into the \nRecord. She wrote it on March 6. She said:\n\n       Dear Senator Santorum,\n       I think abortion is very mean. I am very glad that my Mom \n     and Dad did not let me die. I like to sing Karen Carpenter \n     songs. I like to play with my best friend Mariam. I love my \n     family and my church. My favorite actor is Scott Bakula. I \n     love pizza! I love my puppy. Please tell the President and \n     the other Senators that I want to be a T.V. star, and a \n     pilot, and a U.S. Senator. Please tell them I want to live!\n\n  She is an example of the triumph of the human spirit that is far too \noften snuffed out by this brutal procedure. This brutal procedure not \nonly snuffs out so much human potential, but its very presence in our \nsociety affects our spirit. It dulls our senses. It makes us less aware \nof the world around us because it is another thing we just have to \nblock off, because we certainly cannot think, as we go through the day, \nof the dozen or so--maybe a few less, maybe a few more--of these \nprocedures being performed on little babies, as the Kansas report says, \nwith healthy mothers, healthy children.\n  If we thought every day about what partial-birth abortion is and the \nhorror it brings to these little children, we would have trouble going \nhome. So we just put it aside. We bury it someplace, as we bury so much \nelse, and it hardens us. It takes a little breath of spirit out of us \nand makes us a less caring and loving culture, less sensitive to the \nneeds and wants of our neighbors, and particularly the little children.\n  We have already seen it. Not only the 1.3 million abortions in this \ncountry, but we see it in people such as Peter Singer, who talks about \nchildren being killed after they are born, up to a year now, he says, \nbecause they really don't know who they are, and so it really doesn't \nmatter. We kill them at that age. They have no sense of self. In some \ncases they may be in pain, so we need to alleviate pain.\n  See, that is absurd. Well, 40 years ago, this procedure that I \ndescribed\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nwas considered too absurd to be legal in America, and it is.\n  So much that coarsens society is done just a little bit at a time, \njust on the fringes, just on the edges. And partial-birth abortion is \njust on the fringe, just on the edge, but yet coarsening our society, \nrobbing us of the spirit, telling the world that we are not the country \nthat we proclaim to be. And it is not even medically necessary.\n  I would ask my colleagues, tomorrow, if we get to a final vote, to \nsupport this language as is, not to pass any amendments to this bill. I \nencourage a very strong and robust vote, to send a message to America \nthat this does offend us, and that this does coarsen our society, and \nwe need to stop it, at least here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be brief, no more than 5 minutes.\n  I will just say, I listened to the Senator's remarks. I know the \nSenator has gone through some personal trials and tragedies in his \nfamily. I am aware of that. And I respect the Senator for not only his \nstrength, but for that of his wife and all his family in enduring these \ntrials. Many of our families have been through similar trials.\n  I will tell you--and I am sure you will not be surprised; and I bet \nyou will identify with this--some of the most heartening things I do \nare my visits to children's hospitals and seeing these parents, many of \nwhom have children with serious health problems, who show such courage \nand such determination. It is a miracle to watch them and to see a \nchild finally survive and prosper, as this beautiful little girl whose \nportrait the Senator brought to the floor.\n  It is a testament to God and a testament to the strength of the \npeople who just do not give up when their children are at stake. I \nthink that is the right thing to do. God has blessed me and my wife \nwith three great kids, and a grandson to boot.\n  I will tell you, though, it troubles me that we end this debate on a \nday when we had a chance to offer across America health insurance to \npregnant mothers who have no health insurance, so that they could have \nthe best chance to give birth to a healthy baby, that we had that \nchance earlier in Senator Patty Murray's and Senator Harry Reid's \namendment--a chance to offer them health insurance. That amendment was \ndefeated. It was defeated on a 49 to 47 vote. Three Republicans joined \nus in voting for the amendment.\n  I do not understand this: To have such depth of feeling and emotion \nfor children, to have the medical resources to turn out like this \nbeautiful little girl, and then to vote against that amendment; to vote \nagainst an amendment which offered health insurance. How can you \npossibly rationalize that we would have such determination to provide \nthese medical resources, and when Members were given a chance today, \nthey voted no. They voted no.\n  I believe this admiration, this strength of families, particularly of \nthe ones I visit in hospitals, has to be put in context. These families \nhave hope because they have access to the great hospitals, the great \nminds, the great doctors, medicine, and technology. Think of the \ndespondency of the family with a sick child and no health insurance, \nnowhere to turn, begging--begging--in an emergency room for just any \nattention whatsoever.\n  So I would say my belief is that a commitment to family, a commitment \nto children, goes beyond the abortion issue. It goes to the basic \nissues of health care and health insurance. We had a chance today with \nthe Murray amendment to do something about it. Sadly, we failed.\n  I hope another day will come. I hope those who opposed it today \nsaying, oh, it wasn't in the budget, and we are going to save that for \nthe budget resolution debate, will say the same thing next week when \nthe budget resolution comes to the floor. I hope they will join me and \nothers and show that this commitment to kids, this commitment to \nparents, this commitment to hope goes beyond the debate on abortion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

They are our police officers, and they fight a \nwar against crime every day.\n  I'd like to talk about one of those officers today--Raul Elizondo, of \nthe North Las Vegas Police Department.\n  Raul Elizondo went to the same high school I did--Basic High School \nin Henderson, NV. He was a member of the championship wresting team \nthere.\n  He went to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and then joined the \nNorth Las Vegas Police Department.\n  We have some outstanding officers in North Las Vegas, but Raul \nElizondo quickly distinguished himself as one of the best.\n  He was known for going above and beyond the call of duty, and for \ngetting personally involved in his community. He even helped get \nChristmas and birthday presents for children on his patrol beat.\n  In 1994, Raul Elizondo was named ``Police Officer of the Year'' by \nhis colleagues in the North Las Vegas Police Officer Association.\n  That same year, he got a special commendation from the Chief of \nPolice at the Annual Policeman's Ball.\n  Two months later he was killed in the line of duty.\n  This Thursday, March 13, will be Raul Elizondo Day in North Las \nVegas.\n  Officers from the North Las Vegas Police Department will go to the \nelementary school that's now named after Raul Elizondo. They will read \nto students there, and help with classes, and eat lunch with kids.\n  Then in the afternoon they will have an assembly and a parade.\n  I wish I could be there with them. But on Thursday, while I'm here on \nthe Senate floor, I'll be thinking about everyone involved.\n  I will be thinking about the police officers, who will be carrying on \nRaul Elizondo's tradition of being a role model for the community--as \nwell as a law officer.\n  I will be thinking about Raul Elizondo's family--his mother Ann, his \nsister and his two brothers.\n  I will be thinking about the officers of the North Las Vegas Police \nDepartment, who still live with the pain of losing a colleagues and a \nfriend.\n  And I will be thinking of the police officers all over the country, \nand the sherrif's deputies, and the FBI agents, and my old department--\nthe Capitol Police. I'll remember how they put themselves on the front \nlines every day to keep me and my family safe. I'll offer my thanks for \ntheir sacrifice and my prayers for their safety.

Mr. President, earlier today the Committee on Foreign \nRelations held a hearing about U.S. plans\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nfor humanitarian relief and reconstruction of Iraq, in the event we \nchoose to use force to disarm that country. Senator Lugar, the Chairman \nof the Committee did a superb job of assembling a panel of experts to \ntalk about the various issues associated with that subject, including \nwhat such initiatives are likely to cost and how much assistance we can \nexpect from other governments, international relief agencies and non-\ngovernmental organizations.\n  The Committee learned a great deal from our witnesses. We had a very \ngood discussion of the range of costs we may be looking at to pay for \nnot only U.S. military action, but humanitarian relief and the longer \nterm reconstruction of Iraq--and the costs are likely to be \nsubstantial--even under relatively optimistic assumptions.\n  I was very disappointed that no administration representatives were \npresent to take part in the Committee's deliberations. While the \nwitnesses we heard from today were excellent and are certainly well \nqualified experts who could credibly speculate on the costs of these \noperations and other related matters, they aren't the people who are \nplanning the U.S. operations in Iraq.\n  Let me say, that my comments are not meant as a criticism of Senator \nLugar, the Chairman of our Committee. He rightly identified the two key \nadministration officials who are most knowledgeable on this matter--\nAndrew Natisos, USAID Administrator, and retired General Jay Garner, \nDirector of the newly established Office of Reconstruction and \nHumanitarian Assistance at the Pentagon--two key individuals in any \nhumanitarian relief and reconstruction effort in Iraq. The \nadministration declined to make them available this morning.\n  That is deeply troubling to me.\n  I have to believe that the administration's reluctance to make its \nrepresentatives available to the Committee was because they would have \nbeen asked some hard questions, including the range of cost estimates \nthat they have been working with as they plan for military action, \nhumanitarian relief and the longer turn reconstruction of Iraq.\n  I don't think the Committee would have found it very credible to hear \nfrom these witnesses that such a range of costs has yet to be \ndeveloped, when we are just days away from war with Iraq. Nor would we \nhave found it credible to hear that national security concerns \nprohibited them from sharing this information, particularly as USAID \nhas just sought public bids from five major U.S. construction firms for \n$900 million in contracts for reconstruction projects in Iraq--\nincluding for restoration of water systems, roadways, ports, hospitals \nand schools.\n  Mr. President, are we saying that private American construction \ncompanies can be privy to details of U.S. reconstruction plans, but the \nCongress and the American people cannot? Who is paying the bills here \nanyway?\n  Perhaps the administration's unwillingness to provide these witnesses \nhad something to do with the timing of the hearing. Could it be that \nthe administration did not want to make public those cost numbers just \nas the Senate and House are about to begin debate on the FY 2004 Budget \nResolution?\n  How can this body or the House have a credible debate on the FY 2004 \nbudget without knowing what war and the aftermath of that war with Iraq \nis likely to cost?\n  How can this body have a credible debate about the FY 2004 budget \nwithout knowing what the total cost of our so called diplomatic efforts \nto persuade governments to allow the U.S. to station military troops \nwithin its territory, or cast favorable votes at the U.N. Security \nCouncil will reach?\n  The answer quite simply is, we cannot.\n  Mr. President, it would appear that we are on the eve of going to \nwar. This is a very solemn moment for our Nation. The Congress and the \nAmerican people need to have a full understanding of all that is \ninvolved in doing so, including what it will cost and the sacrifices \nthat may be required in other areas. It is time for this administration \nto stop playing games and politics with this critically important \nissue.\n  I would say to the administration it is time to come clean and tell \nthe American people what they are going to have to pay for our military \nactions in Iraq and for nationbuilding in the aftermath of that \nconflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3495-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3495-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE NATIONAL AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, last week, I joined several of my \ncolleagues in introducing the National Invasive Species Council Act, \nwhich addresses how the Federal Government would coordinate itself in \ncombating aquatic and terrestrial and aquatic invasive species. I was \nalso pleased last week to join my colleagues in introducing the \nNational Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003, NAISA.\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003 would reauthorize \nthe Non-indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, which \nCongress first passed in 1990 to better deal with the invasion of zebra \nmussels in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are still plagued by \ninvasive species. In fact, over 160 non-indigenous species have been \nestablished in the Great Lakes since the 1800s.\n  The economic damage that invasive species, like the zebra mussels, \nEurasion Ruffe, purple loosestrife, sea lamprey, and so many more cause \nto the Great Lakes is quite high. The zebra mussel has raised the cost \nof doing business for raw water users in the Great Lakes region by $24 \nmillion per year, and the Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the \neconomic impact to industries nationwide from zebra mussels over the \nnext 10 years will be $5 billion dollars. The Eurasian Ruffe, another \ninvasive species that fortunately has been found in just a couple ports \nin the Great Lakes, is estimated to cost the Great Lakes fishery $119 \nmillion if it spreads throughout the system. Considering that the value \nof the Great Lakes fishery is approximately $4 billion per year, I \nbelieve that Congress needs to take the next important steps to \nminimize the risk of new invasions into the Great Lakes.\n  NAISA would improve the Great Lakes aquatic invasive species program \nby authorizing the State Department to pursue a reference to the \nInternational Joint Commission, IJC, to analyze the prevention efforts \nin the Great Lakes. Last fall, the IJC released its 11th biennial Great \nLakes Water Quality Report, and in that report, the IJC recommended \nthis reference. Because controlling invasive species in the Great Lakes \nis an international effort, it is necessary for the IJC to review, \nresearch, conduct hearings, and submit to the United States and Canada \na report that describes the success of current policies of governments \nin the United States and Canada having jurisdiction over the Great \nLakes.\n  Our bill also would improve and expand upon the dispersal barrier \nproject in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal. The dispersal barrier \nwas originally authorized in the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, \nand the project became operational in 2002. The electric barrier is \nproving to be effective in preventing the movement of carp up and down \nthe canal, but this barrier is imperfect. This canal supports maritime \ncommerce, and finding a permanent solution to preventing the inter-\nbasin movement of invasive species is important. Therefore, NAISA would \nauthorize the construction of a second barrier in the canal and mandate \nother improvements to this project so that if an invasive species \nbreeches one barrier, there would be a backup barrier. Additionally, \nNAISA expands the barrier authority so that the Corps and the Fish and \nWildlife Service would study additional waterways that would be good \ncandidates for a dispersal barrier.\n  To address the largest pathway of invasive species introduction--\nballast water--NAISA would establish a nationwide mandatory ballast \nwater management program that would apply to ships entering the Great \nLakes system. Because these ships still contain small amounts of \nunpumpable water that may contain organisms, ballast water management \npractices would help address the problem of ``No Ballast On Board'' or \n``NOBOB'' vessels, which are ships that enter the Great Lakes reporting \nno ballast on board. By encouraging the regular flushing of sediments \nfrom ballast tanks in Great Lakes ships, management practices can \nfurther reduce the likelihood of new invasions.\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\n  Ships operating exclusively in the upper four Great Lakes, Superior, \nMichigan, Huron, and Erie, do not introduce invasive species into the \nGreat Lakes, so it would be unnecessary to expect the lake carriers to \ncomply with the mandatory ballast water management program. However, \nall ships, including those in the Great Lakes, would be required to \nhave an Invasive Species Management Plan on-board outlining ways to \nminimize transfers on a ``whole ship'' basis and to abide by best \nmanagement practices. Also all ships constructed after 2006 must have \nballast technology on-board.\n  Finally, NAISA would include new authority to set up procedures for \nscreening importations of live aquatic organisms to ensure that \npotential invasive species are not intentionally introduced into the \nGreat Lakes System. I was very surprised to learn that currently, there \nare no processes for screening aquatic organisms that are shipped to \nthis country. Our bill would direct the Invasive Species Council to \ndevelop a set of screening guidelines for federal agencies to use to \ndetermine whether a planned importation of a live organism from outside \nthe country into the United States should proceed, and if so, whether \nthat importation should be conditioned.\n  This is a very good bill with bipartisan, bicameral support. Though \nit is national in scope, the bill improves upon the existing \nauthorities relating to the Great Lakes, which is vital to my home \nState of Ohio. Aquatic nuisance species are a threat to biodiversity, \nan economic burden, and a danger to human health. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support the quick passage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3496-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3496-S3497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FBI'S RECENT FAILURES IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an unfortunate string \nof events that may set back the Department of Justice in fighting child \npornography. Unfortunately, it appears that recklessness by DOJ \nprosecutors and FBI investigators may result in child pornographers \nbeing set free all over the Nation. We cannot afford such mistakes in \nour efforts to protect our children.\n  The fight against child pornography is an important and laudable \ngoal. Child pornography victimizes real children and scars them for \nlife. That is why I joined Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT \nAct, S.151, which passed the Senate this month by a vote of 84-0 and \nnow awaits action in the House. I urge the House to pass this bill \nswiftly as we wrote it and as it unanimously passed the Senate. That \nway we can quickly get prosecutors the tools they need to win these \ncases.\n  The scars of the children who are victimized by child pornography can \nbe that much longer in healing when the power of the internet is \nmisused to spread their images to a worldwide audience with the click \nof a mouse. The internet also provides child pornographers with greater \nanonymity, allowing them to exploit children from the perceived safety \nof their bedrooms and basements. It is crucial to pierce this veil of \nsafety to deter child pornography. Those who victimize our children \nmust be made to understand that they will be held accountable when they \nare caught.\n  With that accountability comes deterrence, and only through \ndeterrence will our children actually be safer. By the same token, the \nfailure to make a conviction stick when the FBI does catch a child \npornographer emboldens all child pornographers in carrying out their \ncriminal activity. Whenever child pornographers see one of their own \n``beat the rap,'' their perception that they can victimize the innocent \nwith impunity is reinforced.\n  Last March, the Attorney General and FBI Director announced with \ngreat fanfare the ``Operation Candyman'' initiative. This investigation \nwas billed as one of the most extensive child pornography stings in \nhistory. According to the FBI's March 18, 2002 press release, it \ninvolved all 56 FBI Field offices, nearly every U.S. Attorney's Office \nacross the country, and the DOJ's Criminal Division. A major part of \nthe investigation was accomplished by the FBI's completion and \ndissemination of a centralized search warrant affidavit that was \nslightly adapted and used in numerous jurisdictions to search the \nresidences of suspects in the case. Thus, most all the Operation \nCandyman searches--and the admissibility of the evidence obtained \nthrough them--depend on the validity and accuracy of this centralized \nFBI affidavit.\n  Many arrests resulted from these searches. As the Attorney General \nsaid at the time he announced the operation, he wished this case to \nserve as an example ``to others that we will find and prosecute those \nwho target and endanger our children.''\n  Unfortunately, this case may set the wrong kind of example. The DOJ \nhas now admitted that its key affidavit--the one that it sent all over \nthe country to conduct searches and gather evidence--contained false \ninformation. Two judges so far, one in Missouri and one in New York, \nhave thrown out the evidence obtained from searches in this case. \nBecause of the DOJ's admitted false statements, more cases are in peril \nwithin Operation Candyman. More importantly, as the Attorney General \nacknowledged at the time he announced the operation, other child \npornographers may well take their cue from the FBI's failures in this \ncase.\n  We all want to stop child pornography, but we must do so within the \nbounds of the Constitution. Otherwise, dangerous predators end up back \non the street and our children are still at risk. In this case, two \nseparate judges have found that the FBI acted recklessly and DOJ \nadmitted that it provided false information in its nationally \ncirculated affidavit.\n  It is all well and good to have press conferences and give catchy \nnames to investigative efforts, but public relations is not enough. \nPress releases must be accompanied by an effective law enforcement \ncampaign. Otherwise, instead of trumpeting success, we highlight \nfailure. If we concentrate on the fundamentals and bring successful \ncases, there will be enough credit for everyone. That course alone will \nmake our children safer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a New York \nTimes article discussing this matter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2003]\n\n     Judge Discards F.B.I. Evidence in Internet Case of Child Smut\n\n                          (By Benjamin Weiser)\n\n       A federal judge in Manhattan has thrown out the \n     government's evidence in an Internet child pornography case \n     involving a Bronx man, in a ruling that could imperil scores \n     of related prosecutions around the country.\n       The judge, Denny Chin of Federal District Court, ruled that \n     the F.B.I. agents who had prepared a crucial affidavit had \n     ``acted with reckless disregard for the truth.'' The ruling, \n     dated Wednesday, was released yesterday, the same day that a \n     federal judge in St. Louis, Catherine D. Perry, ordered \n     evidence suppressed in a related case. Judge Perry, too, \n     cited false statements in the affidavit.\n       The F.B.I. affidavit claimed that anyone who had signed up \n     to join the Internet group at the center of the investigation \n     automatically received child pornography from other members \n     through an e-mail list.\n       This claim was used to obtain search warrants for the homes \n     and computers of people who had joined the group, known as \n     Candyman. The bureau later conceded that people who had \n     signed up for the group--which also included chat sites, \n     surveys and file sharing--could opt out of the mailing list \n     and did not automatically receive pornography.\n       As a result, Judge Chin ruled, investigators would not have \n     been justified in searching the home and computer of the \n     Bronx man, Harvey Perez, who had signed up for the Candyman \n     group but did not send or receive e-mail messages containing \n     images.\n       ``In the context of this case, a finding of probable cause \n     would not be reasonable,'' Judge Chin wrote. Most subscribers \n     to the group--part of a larger site known as eGroups--elected \n     to receive no e-mail, Judge Chin said. The eGroups site, \n     which was acquired by Yahoo, and the Candyman group are no \n     longer in operation.\n       Operation Candyman was announced with great fanfare a year \n     ago by Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n       Thus far, more than 1,800 people have been investigated, \n     and more than 100 arrested, an F.B.I. spokeswoman said. There \n     have been around 60 convictions, many as a result of guilty \n     pleas, she added. Some defendants have admitted to molesting \n     children, officials have said.\n       A Justice Department spokeswoman, Casey Stavropoulos, said \n     yesterday that the two court rulings were being reviewed. \n     ``The department remains committed,'' she said, ``to \n     vigorously investigating and prosecuting the purveyors and \n     distributors of child pornography.''\n       Defense lawyers in the cases praised the rulings. Nicole \n     Armenta, who represents Mr.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n     Perez, said: ``The fact that someone visited a Web site, and \n     you don't know if they did anything wrong, can't be a reason \n     to go into their home and seize their computer.''\n       Daniel A. Juengel, a lawyer for Gregory Strauser, the \n     defendant in the St. Louis case, called the rulings ``a major \n     victory for the Fourth Amendment,'' which protects against \n     illegal searches and seizures. Mr. Juengel said he believed \n     the decisions would significantly change how the Justice \n     Department handled search warrants involving Internet crime, \n     and how judges looked at affidavits in such cases.\n       The F.B.I. spokeswoman had no comment on the rulings, or on \n     the agents' actions, and said that the agents would also have \n     no comment. One agent, Geoffrey Binney, has left the F.B.I., \n     and did not return a message left at his office seeking \n     comment.\n       It could not be learned yesterday how many Candyman \n     prosecutions have relied on the affidavit in question, but it \n     appears that there could be many challenges.\n       Judge Chin noted that 700 copies of a draft version of the \n     affidavit were sent to F.B.I. offices around the country for \n     use in the investigation. In New York, federal prosecutors in \n     Manhattan and Brooklyn announced last July that 10 people, \n     including Mr. Perez, were being charged in the Candyman \n     investigation.\n       Without the false statement in the affidavit, Judge Chin \n     said, all that remained was the allegation that Mr. Perez had \n     subscribed to a Web site where unlawful images of child \n     pornography could be downloaded.\n       ``If the government is correct in its position that \n     membership in the Candyman group alone was sufficient to \n     support a finding of probable cause, then probable cause \n     existed to intrude into the homes'' of several thousand \n     people, merely because their e-mail addresses were entered \n     into the Web site, Jude Chin wrote.\n       ``Here, the intrusion is potentially enormous,'' the judge \n     added. ``Thousands of individuals would be subject to search, \n     their homes invaded and their property seized, in one fell \n     swoop, even though their only activity consisted of entering \n     an e-mail address into a Web site from a computer located in \n     the confines of their own homes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3497-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DISTURBING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as cochairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, I am concerned by a myriad of \nproblems that plague the nation of Georgia a decade after restoration \nof its independence and nearly eleven years after it joined the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE. Among these \npressing concerns that I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues is the ongoing violence against non-Orthodox religious \ngroups, as well as allegations of torture perpetrated by Georgian \nsecurity officials.\n  Concerning religious freedom, the situation in Georgia is one of the \nworst in the entire 55-nation region constituting the OSCE. Georgia is \nthe only OSCE country where mobs are allowed to attack, violently and \nrepeatedly, minority religious groups with complete impunity. Most \nrecently, on January 24th, worshipers and clergy were assaulted and \nbeaten in a mob attack on the Central Baptist Church in Tbilisi, where \nan ecumenical service was to have taken place. While police did \neventually intervene, no arrests were made, and the planned ecumenical \nservice between Baptists, Armenian Apostolic Church, Catholics and \nLutherans was canceled. While I am pleased President Shevardnadze did \nissue a decree calling for a full investigation, to date no action by \npolice or the Prosecutor General has taken place.\n  During the past three years of escalating mob violence, the Jehovah's \nWitnesses have experienced the majority of attacks, along with \nBaptists, Pentecostals, and Catholics. Sadly, victims from throughout \nthe country have filed approximately 800 criminal complaints, and not \none of these has resulted in a criminal conviction. The mob attacks are \nusually led by either Vasili Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Georgian \nOrthodox priest, or Paata Bluashvili, the leader of the Orthodox \n``Jvari'' Union. Often the police and media are tipped off in advance \nof an attack--probably so that the media can arrive early and the \npolice can show up late. The brazen leaders of these attacks have even \ngiven television interviews while mob brutality continues in the \nbackground.\n  In response to this ongoing campaign of violence against members of \nminority faiths, the leadership of the Helsinki Commission and other \nmembers of the Senate and House have been in correspondence with \nPresident Shevardnadze on numerous occasions. Congressional dismay over \nthis ongoing issue was also reflected in language included in the \nomnibus appropriations bill underscoring concern over the Georgian \nGovernment's apparent resistance to prosecuting and jailing the \nperpetrators of these mob attacks. Despite assurances, Georgian \nofficials have neither quelled this violence nor taken effective \nmeasures against the perpetrators of these assaults. Ironically, it \nappears that minority religious communities may be freer in parts of \nGeorgia outside of Tbilisi's control than those under the central \nauthorities.\n  The conference report language should send a strong message to \nPresident Shevardnadze and other Georgian leaders. They must understand \nthe Congress's deep and abiding interest in this matter and our desire \nto see those responsible for the violence put in jail.\n  I also must express my concern regarding the widespread, indeed \nroutine, use of torture in the Republic of Georgia. While law \nenforcement remains virtually nonexistent when it comes to protecting \nreligious minorities from violent attacks, the use of torture by police \nremains a commonplace tool for extracting confessions and obtaining \nconvictions in other areas. A government commission has also \nacknowledged that the scale of corruption in law enforcement has \nseriously eroded public confidence in Georgia's system of justice and \nthe rule of law.\n  At one point, a few years ago, there appeared to be real political \nwill to address this problem. Sadly, increased protections for \ndetainees, adopted to facilitate Georgia's accession to the Council of \nEurope, were quickly reversed by the parliament once Georgia's \nadmission was complete. Moreover, I am particularly concerned by \nremarks made by Minister of Interior Koba Narchemashvili in November. \nIn a move calculated to look tough on crime following a notorious \nmurder, he called for seizing control of pre-trial detention facilities \nfrom the authority of the Ministry of Justice. This would move Georgia \nin exactly the wrong direction. Reform must continue on two levels; \ncontinuing to move Georgia's legal standards into compliance with \ninternational norms, and improving actual implementation by law \nenforcement officers.\n  I want to see a prosperous, democratic, and independent Georgia, but \nthese facts are deeply disturbing and disappointing. The Government of \nGeorgia's failure to effectively address these concerns through \ndecisive action will only further erode confidence here in Washington \nas well as with the people of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3497-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3497-S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in recognition of Cover the Uninsured \nWeek, March 10th through the 16th, I want to address a very serious \nissue that our country is facing on the domestic front. It is a problem \nthat can be found in every State and encompasses a staggering 41 \nmillion Americans, a number that is only due to increase if we do not \ntake immediate efforts to remedy the problem. I am referring to the \nnumber of people in this country who lack health insurance. Let me also \ntake this opportunity to acknowledge the effort that is being put forth \nthis week by numerous individuals, organizations, and businesses alike \nwho have been instrumental in arranging Cover the Uninsured Week. This \nevent will highlight the degree to which the issue affects our society \nand will serve as a venue bringing communities, professionals, \neducators, faith groups, legislators, businesses, and those directly \naffected to find solutions.\n  There are 41 million Americans who lack health insurance, 75,000 of \nwhom are South Dakotans. In 2001, 41.2 million people or 14.6 percent \nof the U.S. population were uninsured, which was an increase of 1.4 \nmillion from the previous year. This is most likely a result of the \ncontinued increase in the unemployment rate. These factors, coupled \nwith State budgets that are strapped thin, are what many analysts \npredict is the making of a ``perfect storm'' in the wake of health care \ntoday. South Dakota is facing a $54 million shortfall this year alone.\n  Every year, South Dakota continues to lose access to health insurance \ncompanies. Currently, there are only three health insurance carriers \noffering individual coverage in this State. This is\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\ncompounded with the continued increase of yearly premiums, which have \nleft many individuals and families having to choose either between \ncoverage and financial insecurity or joining the ranks of the uninsured \nand watching the possible deterioration of their health. Nationally, 8 \nout of 10 or the uninsured are in working families that cannot afford \nhealth insurance and are not eligible for public programs. In South \nDakota, 84 percent of the uninsured live in a family headed by a \nworking adult. The Center for Studying Health System Change found that \nhealth care costs for privately insured Americans jumped 10 percent in \n2001. In 2002, premiums for employer-sponsored health coverage \nincreased 12.7 percent. As many as 40 percent of small businesses in \nSouth Dakota that have provided workers a health benefit say that they \nmay have to eliminate it. In addition, children are seriously affected \nby this decrease in health insurance coverage. While South Dakota has \ndone very well at enrolling eligible children in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program SCHIP, according to a January 2003 report by \nthe Children's Defense Fund the State ranks 16th in the Nation in \npercent of uninsured children. A recent report showed that 19,000 South \nDakota children under age of 19 are uninsured. These statistics on both \nthe South Dakota level, as well as national level, only reconfirm the \nseriousness of the problem.\n  It goes without saying that the uninsured often face greater \nchallenges and run a higher risk of developing chronic illness because \nseeking treatment or even preventative care is fiscally out of the \nquestion. A third of uninsured South Dakotans report needing to see a \ndoctor but not going because of cost concerns. National studies have \nshown that the uninsured are four times more likely to experience an \navoidable hospital or emergency room visit or stay. For those who \nexperience these types of visits, medical costs can be too substantial \nto pay. Outstanding medical bills are a leading cause of bankruptcy and \nhave been cited as a reason for half of all personal bankruptcy \nfilings. It is troubling to know that a large number of Americans are \nplaced in a position to gamble with their health and be faced with \npossible financial ruin if they seek care for minor or major ailments.\n\n  With these staggering statistics, we need to take initiatives, as \nwell as employ current resources, that will prevent this problem from \nbecoming even worse. I support the establishment of full deductibility \nof health insurance premiums for the self-employed. I feel strongly \nthat we need to make additional funding available to community health \ncenters and other public health programs, which are the main source of \ncare for the uninsured. As well, I look forward to further movement on \nsuch legislative initiatives as the Family Opportunity Act, which would \ngive States the option of allowing families of disabled children to \npurchase Medicaid coverage for them, and would provide for treatment of \ninpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21 by \nallowing for payment of part or all of the cost of home or community-\nbased services. While all of these initiatives are important steps \nforward, more needs to be done.\n  It is also important as we move forward with these initiatives, that \nwe make sure to take precautions on other levels, so as not to \nexacerbate this problem any further. It is for this reason that I am \nconcerned with the administration's Medicaid reform proposal. With \nStates facing the most serious fiscal shortfalls to date, it is \nimperative to see that such programs as Medicaid be adequately funded. \nIn previous years we have seen how Federal assistance has helped to \nexpand this program, and in many ways been able to pick up where \nMedicare has left off. The Medicaid program has proved instrumental in \nproviding health care coverage for many who would otherwise fall into \nthe growing ranks of the uninsured.\n  Currently, there are 91,531 Medicaid-eligible recipients in South \nDakota and the States' Medicaid expenditures are in excess of $450 \nmillion. This includes both State and Federal dollars. It is projected \nthat the South Dakota Medicaid Program will spend over $70 million on \nprescription drugs alone in fiscal year 2003. The President's proposal \nwould for the most part cease future Federal assistance, which has been \ninstrumental in funding this program, and leave States having to pay \nback any Federal assistance they receive in a decade from now. This is \nnot a solution, but a reshuffling of responsibility and liability from \nFederal and State to just States. This proposed reform could leave \nthousands of additional South Dakotans uninsured.\n  As you can see, the high volume of the uninsured is a serious \nsituation in South Dakota, as well as the Nation at large. This problem \nneeds to be remedied before any further erosion of our health care \nsystem commences. I look forward to the progress that will arise this \nweek from the numerous presentations and discussions that will take \nplace. However, it is my hope these discussions do not stop here. The \nultimate goal of covering the uninsured can be reached as long as we \nwork in a bipartisan fashion on both the Federal and State levels to \nmake health care more affordable and accessible to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3498-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3498-S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to a little-\nknown, little-understood, devastating ``orphan'' disease fibrodysplasia \nossificans progressiva, or FOP--which strikes children between age 2 \nand 10.\n  Normally, when a young child sprains a wrist or an ankle, or bruises \na knee, there's a natural healing process. But children with FOP--\ndevelop catastrophic bone spurs at the site of the injury that continue \nto grow, encasing major organs and exerting painful, life-threatening \npressure. According to Dr. Frederic Kaplan, an orthopedic surgeon at \nthe University of Pennsylvania, the worldwide center for FOP research, \nthe average lifespan for people with this dreadful disease is about 45 \nyears. But most sufferers are wheel-chair bound by age 20, breathing \nwith the greatest difficulty, unable to feed or dress themselves.\n  Here's the sad problem: there are perhaps 300 FOP cases in the \nworld--at least 12 in my state of New Jersey, 16 in New York, and 13 in \nPennsylvania. This is the orphan of all orphan diseases. So we need to \nput a human face on this. For me, that face belongs to 10-year old \nWhitney Weldon, of Westfield, New Jersey. When first diagnosed two \nyears ago, Whitney did all the things most all children do--run, play \nball, skip down the street. Now she cannot lift her arms over her head. \nBut she is able to ride a special bicycle and enjoy the art she loves, \nand time with her best friend. We want to give her the chance for more \ntime, and to do that we need money for research. Right now Whitney's \nonly treatment consists of painkillers and anti-inflammatory steroids. \nNothing stops the bone growth.\n  Dr. Kaplan and his research partner at the University of \nPennsylvania, Dr. Eileen Shore, have received a little more than $1 \nmillion over 4 years from the National Institutes of Health for \nresearch into the gene that causes FOP and to determine the pathways by \nwhich this abnormal gene causes extra bone production. This funding is \na tribute to their progress so far, but there is still such a long way \nto go. Dr. Kaplan's annual budget is $1 million. About 20 percent of \nthat comes from NIH funding--the other 80 percent comes from families \nand friends. And I'll tell you something interesting--Dr. Kaplan says \nthat even though FOP affects only one person in 2 million, the answers \nthat can be found in continued research can shed light on osteoporosis \nand extra-bone formation that occurs after head or spinal cord trauma. \nSo there is the very real potential of beneficial effects for many \nmillions of people.\n  There are some promising avenues. Adult stem cell research and \nexamination of bone marrow from FOP sufferers have yielded possible \ndirections to pursue. Wider stem cell research would be exponentially \nmore helpful.\n  Whitney's parents enable her to live as normal a life as possible for \nas long as possible. And she shares fun and confidences with Mackenzie \nRoach, her friend since kindergarten. She also shares one of life's \nextraordinary connecting bonds with Mackenzie. Stephen Roach, \nMackenzie's father, was killed on September 11 when terrorists bombed \nthe World Trade Center. Stephen was very involved in raising funds\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nand awareness for FOP. In his memory, Mackenzie's family has created \nthe Stephen L. Roach Fund for FOP Research, which to date has raised \nmore than $800,000.\n  Last March, President Bush declared 2002-2011 as National Bone and \nJoint Decade. That is a very hopeful development, and hope goes a long \nway. When we join that hope with a sustained focus on finding a cure \nfor FOP, we will go even further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3499-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NINTH CIRCUIT COURT SPLIT--S. 562\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsponsoring S. 562, which will reorganize the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I have been a long-time advocate of splitting this \ncontroversial court and my passion was further enflamed when a three-\njudge panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled that the words ``under God'' in \nthe Pledge of Allegiance are unconstitutional. I found this ruling \nappalling.\n  In fact, I am also a cosponsor of S. Res. 71, which expressed support \nof the Pledge of Allegiance. This resolution unanimously passed the \nSenate on March 4. This resolution came as a result of the Ninth \nCircuit voting not to have the full court reconsider the earlier \ndecision, which I believe was a mistake.\n  The current Ninth Circuit encompasses nine States, two territories, \nand 14 million square miles. The current population is estimated at 45 \nmillion people; however, the Census Bureau has estimated the population \nto grow to 63 million by the year 2010. In comparison, the circuit with \nthe second highest population is the Sixth Circuit, which contains 29 \nmillion people. The Ninth Circuit also seats the highest number of \nactive judges with 28, whereas the Fifth Circuit has the second highest \nwith 17. The average number of judges in each circuit, excluding the \nNinth Circuit, is 12.6.\n  The population served by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals needs a \nchange. The liberal, frequently reversed decisions handed down by the \nNinth Circuit do not fairly represent the views of my State and many of \nthose in the surrounding region. About half of the judges on the Ninth \nCircuit are California based and, with all due respect, do not reflect \nthe principles and values of those of us from Montana.\n  The amount of time between filing and disposition on the Ninth \nCircuit is exorbitant. In 2001, the national average was 10.9 months, \nwhile the Ninth Circuit's average time was 15.8 months, nearly a 5-\nmonth difference. From 1996 to 2001, the national average has increased \nby 0.5 months while the Ninth Circuit's average has increased by 1.5 \nmonths.\n  The size, unbalanced judgeships, high reversal record, and \nintracircuit conflicts of the Ninth Circuit, along with the past \nsuccess of dividing the Fifth Circuit, endorse the notion of division. \nIt was the intent of Congress to create regional courts based upon \nidentity of population and the current Ninth Circuit Court simply does \nnot reflect Montana's unique social, cultural, geographic or economic \ncharacteristics.\n  This trend cannot continue. It is time to split the Ninth Circuit and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this reasonable, \ncommonsense bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3499-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to draw the Senate's attention to events in \nZimbabwe, where a continuing political and economic crisis is \ndevastating the country and threatening the future of the southern \nAfrican region. A combination of corruption at the highest levels of \ngovernment, political desperation leading to ill-conceived economic and \nagricultural policies implemented in chaotic fashion, and severe \npolitical repression have brought the country to its knees. Already \ndevastated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Zimbabwe is now gripped by a food \ncrisis--one in large part caused by the government's policies. Nearly \n40 percent of Zimbabweans are malnourished. This in a country that used \nto be a net exporter of food to the region.\n  Members of Zimbabwe's ruling party and their cronies have led their \nown country to ruin--even starvation--in order to manipulate the \npopulation and retain power. We are talking about a government that \ntortures independent journalists, beats respected civil society leaders \nwho have testified before Congress, murders opposition supporters, and \nrecently even arrested and detained a U.S. diplomat.\n  Last week, President Bush signed an executive order freezing the \nassets of 77 Zimbabwean individuals responsible for this repression and \nabuse, and prohibiting Americans from having business dealings with \nthem. This is a step many of us in Congress had been anticipating for \nsome time. Just last month I asked Secretary of State Powell about the \nstatus of the asset freeze, and more recently I spoke with the \nPresident's National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, about this \nmatter. I am glad the delay is over, and I commend the President for \ntaking this step.\n  I was recently in Botswana and South Africa, and it is clear the \nconsequences of the crisis are spilling over into other parts of the \nsouthern African region. Zimbabweans desperate to escape are spilling \nacross borders. Foreign investors are nervous about engagement in the \nregion. And the muted reaction of other African leaders is calling into \nquestion their commitment to the basic principles so critical to the \ndevelopment of the region.\n  I also commend the President and the administration for making it \nclear that the U.S. condemnation of the Zimbabwean government has \nnothing to do with race, and everything to do with basic principles \nlike the rule of law, democratic governance, and freedom of expression. \nAs the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I look \nforward to continuing to work with the administration, with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, with African leaders, and with the many \nbrave and capable Zimbabweans who are working to stop Zimbabwe's \ndecline into disorder and to realize the potential of the Zimbabwean \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3499-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to take note of \nInternational Women's Day, which people around the world commemorated \nlast Saturday. For nearly a century, women's groups worldwide have \npaused on March 8 to celebrate the achievements and contributions of \nwomen in all fields of human endeavor throughout our history. It is a \nspecial occasion to remember the progress women have made and to \nreflect upon the injustices and hardships they still face.\n  When I arrive here a decade ago, there were only six women in the \nSenate, and four of them had just come in with me in the Class of `92. \nToday there are 14. Of the 18 women who have ever been elected to a \nfull term in the Senate, 13 are here now. There are now 62 women in the \nHouse of Representatives--the most ever. And Nancy Pelosi recently \nbecame the first woman ever chosen to lead a majority party in the \nCongress. Around the world, at latest count, almost 500 million people \nlive in countries with female elected heads of government.\n  These are encouraging signs that we are making progress toward \nachieving full equality for women in the political realm. But even \nafter the great advances of the past decade, women, who are more than \nhalf the electorate, account for only 14 percent of each House of the \nU.S. Congress. This is just one example of how, in so many areas, we \nstill have a long way to go.\n  Women have made tremendous strides in the last century. In the United \nStates today, more women than ever are attending college and earning \npost-graduate degrees. More women are entering the workforce and \nstarting their own companies. But although equal pay for equal work has \nbeen the law of the land since 1963, on average, women still earn \nsubstantially less than men. Wage discrimination persists, costing \nfamilies thousands of dollars each year. I am proud to support \nlegislative efforts to correct this discrepancy.\n  While many women are going to work, many have to sacrifice time spent \nwith their children in order to afford child care, education, and \nhealth care for their kids. Too often, women and children fall through \nthe cracks of\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nour system. Violence against women is still all too prevalent in our \ncountry. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury among women \nof child-bearing age. One out of every six American women has been a \nvictim of a rape or an attempted rape. Many rapes go unreported. Only \nrecently have States begun to recognize crimes such as stalking or \nmarital rape.\n\n  Outside the United States, the situation for women is often far \nstarker. Last year, the world came to understand the brutal treatment \nof Afghan women under the reign of the Taliban. Unfortunately, the \nTaliban regime was just an extreme example of the kinds of repression \nand denial of basic freedoms that women face in much of the developing \nworld. Women in many places are denied such basic rights as owning \nproperty. They are more likely to live in poverty, suffer from \nmalnutrition, and lack access to education. Despite the expansion of \nwomen's health care research and practices in the last two decades, \nwomen still have unequal access to these services.\n  Such policies are not only unjust, they are unwise. Numerous studies \nhave shown that one of the best investments a developing society can \nmake is educating its girls. In societies where women are literate, \ninfant mortality is lower and children are healthier and better fed. \n``Women are critical players in ensuring household food security and \nnutrition,'' according to the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment. ``Increasing the economic resilience of the poor is \nlargely about enabling women to realize their socio-economic potential \nmore fully and improve the quality of their lives. To do so, women need \naccess to assets, services, knowledge and technologies, and must be \nactive in decision-making processes.'' This is important to keep in \nmind as we grapple this year with food crises in Africa and elsewhere.\n  As we contemplate going to war with Iraq, we should bear in mind that \nwomen often suffer more than men from armed conflict. Women and girls \nare among those most affected by the violence, economic instability, \nand displacement associated with warfare, and they frequently are \nthreatened by rape and sexual exploitation, whether at home, in flight, \nor in refugee camps. Rape and sexual assault have often been used as \nweapons of war. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on Women, \nPeace and Security in 2000. Yet the deliberate killing, rape, \nmutilation, forced displacement, abduction, trafficking, and torture of \nwomen and girls continue unabated in contemporary armed conflicts, \naccording to UNIFEM.\n  Although it is usually men who go off to war, women often bear much \nof the burden. It is therefore crucial that women be active and \nrespected participants in peace-building and reconstruction.\n  In peacetime as well, women are often victims of domestic violence \nand illegal trafficking for slavery and prostitution. In some \ncountries, women fall victim to ``honor killings,'' a deplorable \npractice whereby women are murdered by male relatives for actions that \nare perceived to bring dishonor to the family.\n\n  The Senate will likely soon be considering landmark legislation to \ndeal with the global problem of HIV/AIDS, which I hope to be able to \nsupport. Here again, women must be at the center of our deliberations. \nStatistics compiled by UNAIDS show that both the spread and impact of \nHIV and AIDS disproportionately affect women and adolescent girls who \nare socially, culturally, biologically, and economically more \nvulnerable. In 1997, 41 percent of HIV-infected adults worldwide were \nwomen. In the latest report, they accounted for half. In North Africa \nand the Middle East, 54 percent of HIV-positive adults are women; in \nthe Caribbean, 52 percent are. U.N. experts believe that women's \nempowerment is one of the only AIDS vaccines available today in most of \nthe world, and that gender equality should be a guiding principle in \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel to numerous countries in Africa \nand see firsthand the devastating toll that HIV/AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases are taking on the people of that continent. Young \nwomen are especially at risk. The United Nations reports that in Africa \ngirls aged 15 to 19 are infected with HIV at a rate of 15 to 23 \npercent, whereas infection rates among boys of the same age group are 3 \nto 4 percent.\n  Mr. President, the protection of women's rights is vital to the \nsuccess of promoting fundamental human rights. The Senate can work \ntowards protecting women's rights and improve the status of women \ndomestically and internationally by acting upon the United Nations \nConvention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, or \nCEDAW. CEDAW is the most comprehensive treaty on women's human rights, \naddressing almost all forms or discrimination in areas such as \neducation, employment, marriage and family, health care, politics, and \nlaw. It has been over two decades since the United States signed this \ntreaty, and it still awaits consideration before the Senate. Once \nagain, I urge the Committee on Foreign Relations to take up this treaty \nand finally allow the Senate the opportunity to offer its advice and \nconsent.\n  In conclusion, as we honor women everywhere and celebrate their \naccomplishments and contributions to history, we must recognize that \nthere is still more to be done in the struggle for gender equity. \nDiscrimination and violence against women still exist here at home and \nabroad. The United States and the rest of the international community \nmust reaffirm their commitment to promote gender equality and human \nrights around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3500-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SHRM LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

As an influential voice, SHRM also \nseeks to advance the human resources profession by ensuring that human \nresources is an essential and effective partner in developing and \nexecuting organizational strategy.\n  As a legislator, as a human resources professional, and as a member \nof SHRM, I want to congratulate SHRM for recognizing the important role \nindividuals can play in affecting the legislative process. Human \nresources professionals are crucial to the successful operation of our \nnation's businesses and organizations. Most importantly they understand \nthe positive impact of meeting with their Senators and Representatives \nto discuss recent workplace trends, their policy implications, and \nsuggested remedies.\n  Citizen participation is a crucial component of the legislative \nprocess, allowing legislators and their staff the opportunity to hear \nconstituents explain personal experiences as they live and work within \nour nation's laws. Finally, legislators gain critical knowledge through \nthese conversations, resulting in legislation that's clearly applicable \nto the workplace and effective for employees and employers.\n  I sincerely thank the members of SHRM for their commitment to provide \nvalue to employees and employers across the United States while \ncontributing an essential component to the political process--practical \nreal world experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3500-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3500-S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEANNIE BRIGHT\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

She will be honored at the \nSecretary of the Army Awards ceremony in the Pentagon on March 14.\n  Ms. Bright began her civilian career with the Army in 1974. Over the \npast 22 years, she has poured over millions of words in search of \nerrors and in pursuit of accuracy in Army publications for\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nsoldiers. She recently said, ``Sometimes it can be monotonous stuff, \nbut if we're talking about nuclear, biological, and chemical gear and \nwe go to war, then this is pretty important stuff.''\n  While the Army recognizes the dedicated efforts of Ms. Bright, her \naward should also serve to acknowledge the vital role that all civilian \nemployees play in our Nation's defense.

Mr. President, today I commemorate the Michigan \nAmerican Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, \nCouncil 25, AFL-CIO for 25 years of dedication to State and local \ngovernment employees. On March 14, 2003, members and supporters of \nMichigan AFSCME Council 25 will gather to celebrate the commitment this \norganization has shown and the support it has provided to working \nfamilies in my home State of Michigan.\n  For over six decades, AFSCME and its members have worked to combat \nadversity in the workplace. What began as an effort to save civil \nservice jobs expanded to become an adaptive and dynamic collective \nbargaining organization. AFSCME has thrived throughout its history by \ncreatively meeting the difficult challenges that it and its members \nhave faced. Today, the organization is a national leader among \norganized labor movements.\n  For the past quarter century, Michigan AFSCME Council 25 has \nrepresented and advocated for public employees throughout Michigan. The \norganization's membership includes employees of State, county, and \nmunicipal governments, school districts, public hospitals, and \nnonprofit agencies. Since the formation of Michigan AFSCME Council 25 \nby special convention in March of 1978, it has been a strong force \ndedicated to improving working conditions and advocating for its \nmembers.\n  Today, Michigan AFSCME Council 25 represents over 60,000 public \nemployees and is organized into more than 300 local unions. Workers of \nvirtually all public service occupations find a specialized voice \nwithin AFSCME. Because of the unwavering dedication that Michigan \nAFSCME Council 25 has shown to its community, working families and \npublic employees have seen their working conditions improve and their \nvoices heard.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in offering our \ncongratulations to Michigan AFSCME Council 25 and its members as they \ncelebrate their 25 years of unwavering support for Michigan's working \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3501-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MONTE MADNESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express a little \nhome State pride. It was described as ``Monte Madness.''\n  For months, Montanans logged on to the Internet to cast their votes. \nBillboards hailed his name. Communities rallied around him. Montana's \npolitical leaders backed him. And our State beamed with pride on \nJanuary 1 when the University of Montana's Monte the Grizzly was \ncrowned Capital One National Mascot of the Year.\n  For the first time, mascots across the country competed in an online \nelection for the right to represent their school in national \ncompetition. Monte faced stiff competition from mascots like Penn \nState's Nittany Lion and the University of Florida's Albert the Gator. \nIn the end, Monte won the distinguished title, earning the UM mascot \nprogram $10,000 and a lot of national exposure.\n  Monte is known for his athletic prowess, his slick dance moves, and \nhis knack for firing up Griz fans. It's easy to understand why Missoula \nMayor Mike Kadas declared February 1 as Monte Day.\n  The highflying mascot is an unsung hero of the University of Montana \nand a valuable member of the Missoula community. There is no doubt \nMonte is the hardest working mascot in collegiate athletics. He \ndeserves the national recognition. He is the most spirited, most \nathletic, hardest hitting, best crowd surfing mascot ever to grace a \ncollege campus.\n  I endorsed Monte during his election because he is a mascot for the \nright reasons--to win ball games and boost Montana athletics.\n  But Monte is not only a Montana treasure on the field, he is \ncommitted to giving back to our communities. Monte often attends \nparades, community events, and gives his time to help others. He \ndonated $1,000 he received from the national exposure to Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters of Missoula.\n  Monte makes us all very proud to be Montanans. May he wear his crown \nfor all to see and ride his Griz-colored Harley for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3501-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARROLL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Carroll \nCollege Saints football team and to congratulate them on their NAIA \nNational Championship.\n  As you can see, Montana has much to be proud of.\n  Carroll College is a 4-year college located in Helena, MT, and was \nranked as the fourth best western regional comprehensive college by \nU.S. News and World Report.\n  In a game that became part of Montana sports legend, the Carroll \nSaints crushed their opponent, the two-time defending national champion \nGeorgetown Tigers 28-7. The Saints pounded the Tigers in Tennessee and \nthe echoes reached living rooms throughout Montana. We love football in \nMontana and the Saints gave us a team to be proud to cheer for and \nfollow.\n  Although the game was magical, magic played no part in the Saints' \nsuccess. Teamwork, amazing leadership from Coach Mike Van Diest, and \nhard work, in the weight room, on the field, and in the classroom, led \nthis group of honorable young men through a solid season and an \nincredible string of playoff games.\n  Montana's college football teams recruit heavily from the state and \nmany Montanan seniors led this legendary team. Darold Debolt from Great \nFalls, Casey Fitzsimmons from Chestor, Nick Garreffa from Billings, \nChris Jones from Helena, Luke Lagomasino from Lincoln, Shane Larson \nfrom Miles City, Tyler Maxwell from Helena, Cory Perzinski from \nBillings, Nick Porrini from Helena, and Heath Wall from Belt, all \nplayed their part in creating the unity and teamwork that this team \ndisplayed throughout the season.\n  The National Champion Saints' provided inspiration to all who \nfollowed them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3501-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3501-S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK WALDROUP, SR.\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nfellow Hoosier and a dear friend, Jack G. Waldroup, Sr., who passed \naway on March 9, 2003.\n  Those of us who knew Jack were touched by his kind heart and generous \nspirit. His life was the embodiment of values Americans have cherished \nsince the founding of our democracy: civic involvement, active \npolitical participation, and public service.\n  Jack loved Indiana. Throughout his days, he always remained close to \nhis beloved home of Knox County. Jack graduated from Oaktown High \nSchool in 1946 and then spent time working on his family farm. He also \nserved his community as a Chief Deputy in the Knox County Sheriff's \nDepartment. Soon after, Jack assumed his longtime position as a \ncontract administrative assistant at United Engineers and Architects.\n  Jack's service to his party never faltered, and he became known in \nIndiana as ``Mr. Democrat.'' Jack served ably as Knox County Democrat \nChairman from 1970 to 1984, helping to cultivate and guide countless \ncareers in public service. He could always be counted on for sound \nadvice, and you could be sure he would give it to you straight--without \nany sugar coating. Jack's keen understanding of the political process \ncoupled with his loyalty and honest advice led him to become a fixture \nin statewide Indiana politics, and a must-\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nsee for anyone seriously seeking to serve in public office.\n  Over the years, many leaders came to rely on Jack's wisdom and \nguidance. His good judgment and invaluable counsel was always \nappreciated and will be greatly missed.\n  When we reflect upon the lives of men such as Jack Waldroup, Sr., we \nare reminded that we live in a country where the true power to shape \nthe destiny of government is vested in the people. We will all miss \nJack deeply, but his memory will serve as a beacon and his life as an \nexample of the virtues of civic involvement. He was my friend, and I \nshall miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3502-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING HAYS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nsome hardworking students who are paying attention to a neglected area \nof all of our education--our own history and founding.\n  Fortunately, there are programs such as ``We the People: The Citizen \nand the Constitution program,'' which is the most extensive educational \nprogram in the country, and was developed specifically to educate young \npeople about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. This program, \nwhich is administered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by \nthe U.S. Department of Education by act of Congress, finally addresses \nthis woeful lack of knowledge in a systematic and thorough way.\n  In fact, on April 26, 2003, more than 1,200 students from across the \nUnited States will visit Washington, D.C., to compete in the national \nfinals of the ``We the People'' program. What an experience!\n  I am especially proud to announce that the class from Hays High \nSchool from the town of Hays will represent my home State of Kansas in \nthis national event. These young scholars have worked diligently to \nreach the national finals by participating at local and statewide \ncompetitions. As a result of their experience, they have gained much--\nincluding a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The three-day ``We the People'' national competition is difficult, \nyet true to life as it is modeled after hearings in the United States \nCongress. These hearings consist of oral presentations by high school \nstudents before a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The \nstudents are given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while \nthey evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by a period of \nquestioning by the judges who probe the students' depth of \nunderstanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  The ``We the People'' program-- which provides curricular materials \nat upper elementary, middle, and high school levels--not only enhances \nstudents' understanding of the institutions of American constitutional \ndemocracy, but it also helps them identify the contemporary relevance \nof the Constitution and Bill of Rights. At the same time, critical \nthinking exercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative \nlearning techniques help develop participatory skills necessary for \nstudents to become active, responsible citizens.\n  Independent studies done by groups as diverse as the Educational \nTesting Service, Richard Brody at Stanford University, and researchers \nat the Council for Basic Education discovered that participants \noutperform comparison students, develop a greater commitment to \ndemocratic principles and values and are more enthusiastic about their \nwork. Clearly this is a deserving program!\n  The class from Hays High School is currently preparing for their \nparticipation in the national competition in Washington, D.C. It is \ninspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and \nprinciples of our government, ideas that identify us as a people and \nbind us together as a nation. It is important for future generations to \nunderstand these values and principles which we hold as standards in \nour endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional \ndemocracy. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of \nluck at the ``We the People'' national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3502-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

A bill to provide additional funding for the second round of \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Round II \nEZ/EC Flexibility Act of 2003. This important legislation would secure \nvital funding for Round II Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities \nto ensure that communities throughout the country will be able to \ncontinue the important work of economic revitalization.\n  This legislation promotes the continued economic development \nthroughout the EZ/EC program, particularly to the 15 Round II urban and \n5 rural empowerment zones that were designated in 1999. Each of those \ncommunities has implemented a host of strategic initiatives aimed at \neconomic growth and job creation in their respective communities.\n  The EZ/EC Act ensures that Round II communities EZs and ECs are \nprovided with funding they were promised upon designation. It also \nauthorizes the use of EZ/EC grants as a match for related Federal \nprograms, providing the EZ/EC program with maximum flexibility to \nimplement initiatives at the local level.\n  The Enterprise Zone/Enterprise Community program was created to \nprovide Federal assistance over ten years in designated urban and rural \ncommunities that would fuel economic revitalization and job growth. The \nprogram does so primarily by providing Federal grants to communities \nand tax and regulatory relief to help communities attract and retain \nbusinesses.\n  Unfortunately, an inequity now exists between the way Round I and \nRound II EZs and ECs have been funded. Those communities that won EZ \ndesignations in the initial round, in 1994, received full funding from \nthe Congress, which made all grant awards available for use within the \nfirst two years of designation. However, EZs and ECs designated in \nRound II did not receive this same funding authority.\n  Federal benefits promised to the Round IIs included funding grants of \n$100 million for each urban zone, $40 million for each rural zone and \nabout $3 million for each Enterprise Community over a ten-year period \nbeginning in 1999. In reliance on those ``promised'' funds, Round II \nzones prepared strategic plans for economic revitalization based on the \navailability of that funding. However, unlike Round I designees, who \nreceived a full funding up front, Round II zones have received a mere \nfraction of the funding promise.\n  The lack of a certain, predictable funding stream will ultimately \nundermine the ability of Round II EZs/ECs to effectively implement \ntheir economic growth strategies in their designated communities. And \nthat's a shame, because the EZ/EC initiative has produced real results.\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  In fact, I'm proud to say that one of the best Round II EZs is \nlocated in Cumberland County, NJ. The Cumberland County Empowerment \nZone, a collaborative effort of the communities of Bridgeton, \nMillville, Vineland and Port Norris, has been a model EZ, and committed \nall the funds made available to it by HUD.\n  Since the creation of the EZ, Cumberland County has witnessed more \nthan 100 housing units rehabbed, renovated or newly built. A $4 million \nloan pool has been created to fund community and small business \nreinvestment. The EZ also has led to the funding for over 60 economic \ndevelopment initiatives, utilizing more than $11 million in funding to \nleverage $120 million in private, public and tax exempt bond financing.\n  These are real results. In fact, over 1,100 new jobs will be created \nin the County over the next year and a half alone if the Federal \nGovernment were to maintain its commitment to the EZ/EC program.\n  Cumberland County is just one example of how the EZ/EC initiative has \nbrought hope and promise to communities throughout America. We need to \ndo more to support and build on these initiatives. Now is the time for \nCongress to fulfill the promise made to Round II EZs and ECs.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill that will allow \ncommunities throughout the country to continue their work of economic \nrevitalization. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In the House, \nCongressman Chris Cox will also be introducing the H2 GROW Act, so we \nwill have the first bipartisan, bicameral bill to provide incentives \nfor commercialing hydrogen-powered cars and the fueling stations needed \nfor hydrogen cars to have widespread acceptance.\n  Our legislation has the support of a diverse coalition of interest \ngroups, ranging from the Natural Resources Defense Council to the \nautomobile industry. It is not a coalition that naturally flocks \ntogether. In fact, on many environmental issues, these groups are \nskirmishing, not coalescing.\n  Just as these groups have come together, Congressman Cox and I have \nfelt, on a bipartisan basis, that he and I could find common ground on \nthe critical issue of hydrogen fuel cells. Unlike some other proposals \nto promote hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the H2 GROW Act goes beyond \nresearching hydrogen to kickstart the market for hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles and fueling equipment. Legislation he and I will introduce \ntoday, the H2 GROW Act, uses marketplace incentives so that a \nsignificant number of fuel cell vehicles can hit American streets in \nthe next decade. In effect, our legislation goes beyond the popular \nwisdom that you can't do much to actually get these vehicles on the \nstreet anytime soon.\n  Our legislation stipulates that when someone opens a fueling station, \nsells fueling equipment, sells hydrogen fuel for use in vehicles, or \nbuys a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, the tax man won't cometh for the \nnext 10 years. By creating incentives this way, our legislation, can \ncatalyze commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. Tax holidays and tax \nincentives will stimulate a private market for everything from creating \nthe infrastructure needed for fuel cell vehicles, to direct incentives \nfor American consumers.\n  By using this approach, our legislation only pays for performance. It \ndoes not subsidize research that may or may not advance the goal of \ngetting hydrogen-powered cars on the road. The tax credits and other \nincentives only reward actions that actually put cars on the road or \nfueling equipment in use.\n  Best of all, the price tag is minimal. The government isn't expecting \nany significant revenue from fuel cell vehicles anyway in the next 10 \nyears--and that's the life of our bill. So there's no enormous cost to \nthe government.\n  Congress has a clear choice between taking 20 years to get a \nsignificant number of hydrogen vehicles on the road and making real, \nmeasurable progress in the next 10 years. In my view, reducing this \ncountry's dependence on foreign oil is a national security priority. At \na time when more than half our energy is imported, enacting policies \nthat promote energy independence is a true act of patriotism. Our \nlegislation would promote that energy independence.\n\n  Here are two examples of how our legislation provides critically \nneeded incentives for the fuel cell market:\n  Congressman Cox and I want to make it worth the consumer's while to \nbuy a fuel cell vehicle in the first place. So a tax credit will help \nmake up the difference between the cost of a gasoline-powered vehicle \nand a fuel cell car. For example, if in 2009, a consumer buys a fuel \ncell car for $25,000, the consumer can write $3,750 off his or her \ntaxes to make the fuel cell car more affordable.\n  To help gasoline stations begin to shift to serving consumers with \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles, our bill provides a 20-percent tax credit \nfor every unit of hydrogen fuel sold equivalent to a gallon of \ngasoline.\n  The bill also helps taxpayers get the most of the fuel cell vehicle \nin terms of convenience and ease of use. With hydrogen fuel cells, \nfilling up your car could be something you do at your home or your \noffice as well as a retail filling station. So our bill gives taxpayers \nwho install hydrogen fueling equipment in their homes a tax credit for \nup to 50 percent of the cost of the refueling equipment.\n  In my view, these are practical steps away from our reliance on \nforeign oil and toward better, cleaner transportation for all \nAmericans. I also believe this plan is the best, most effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars on this issue.\n  Companies like GM and Toyota--two car companies that are endorsing \nthe H2 GROW Act--are already developing the technology to improve the \nperformance and reduce the cost of fuel cell vehicles with more \nreliable, affordable\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nmaterials. These companies are already putting the money and time into \nthat effort. What Congress needs to do is help the American people and \nAmerican businesses take advantage of these new products as they're \nperfected, and help them hit the streets as quickly as possible.\n  I firmly believe the H2 GROW Act is a strong step toward helping \nconsumers to shore up this Nation's economic and environmental \nstability for future generations. I know Congressman Cox feels the same \nway, and I encourage my colleagues to support our bipartisan \nlegislation to accelerate commercialization of hydrogen fuel cell cars \nand help reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 588. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2004; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce \nthe MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2003. Congressman Stark is \nintroducing a companion bill in the House.\n  This legislation is, without a doubt, ambitious. It is a deliberate \neffort to try to ignite a national commitment to the goal of insuring \nall of our children. For some, that is an idealistic proposition that \ndoes not seem achievable. With this bill, I want to call on the public \nand my colleagues to consider once again the clear and convincing case \nfor investing the necessary resources in the health of our children--\nand therefore, in the well-being of their families and our entire \ncountry. The President and Congress continue to talk about their \ncommitment to America's health. This bill challenges them to take \naction on their rhetoric.\n  Our children are not only our future, they are also our present. What \nwe do for them today will greatly affect what happens tomorrow. Yet \neven though we recognize these facts, we still have not found a way to \nguarantee health coverage for children. Without health insurance, many \nof these children go without health care all together.\n  Children are the least expensive segment of our population to insure. \nThey are also the least able to have control over whether or not they \nhave health insurance. Yet we now have over 9 million uninsured \nchildren in this country. And with the downturn in the economy and the \nrising costs of health care, this number will continue rising.\n  Our success in expanding Medicaid and passing the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program was a meaningful, significant start at closing \nthe tragic gap represented by millions of uninsured children. However, \nCongress cannot point to these programs and declare that our work is \ndone. We still have much more to do. The percent of children in low-\nincome families without health insurance has not changed in recent \nyears. Even with perfect enrollment in S-CHIP and Medicaid, there would \nstill be a great number of children without health insurance.\n  This is partially due to our increasingly mobile society, where \nparents frequently change jobs and families often move from State to \nState. When this occurs there is often a lapse in health coverage. \nAlso, families working their way out of welfare fluctuate between \neligibility and ineligibility for means-tested assistance programs. \nAnother reason for the number of uninsured children is that the cost of \nhealth insurance continues to increase, leaving many working parents \nunable to afford coverage for themselves or their families. All of this \nadds up to the fact that many of our children do not have the \nconsistent and regular access to health care which they need to grow up \nhealthy.\n  That is why I am re-introducing the MediKids Health Insurance Act. \nThis bill would automatically enroll every child at birth into a new, \ncomprehensive Federal safety net health insurance program beginning in \n2004. The benefits would be tailored to the needs of children and would \nbe similar to those currently available to children under Medicaid. A \nsmall monthly premium would be collected from parents at tax filing, \nwith discounts to low-income families phasing out at 300 percent of \npoverty. The children would remain enrolled in MediKids throughout \nchildhood. When they are covered by another health insurance program, \ntheir parents would be exempt from the premium. The key to our program \nis that whenever other sources of health insurance fail, MediKids would \nstand ready to cover the health needs of our next generation. By the \nyear 2020, every child in America would be able to grow up with \nconsistent, continuous health insurance coverage.\n  Like Medicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover \nbenefits tailored to the needs of its target population, and would have \nthe goal of achieving nearly 100 percent health insurance coverage for \nthe children of this country--just as Medicare has done for our \nNation's seniors and disabled population. It's time we make this \ninvestment in the future of America by guaranteeing all children the \nhealth coverage they need to make a healthy start in life.\n  The MediKids Health Insurance Act would offer guaranteed, automatic \nhealth coverage for every child with the simplest of enrollment \nprocedures and no challenging outreach, paperwork, or re-determination \nhoops to jump through. It would be able to follow children across state \nlines, or tide them over in a new location until their parents can \nenroll them in a new insurance program. Between jobs or during family \ncrises such as divorce or the death of a parent, it would offer extra \nsecurity and ensure continuous health coverage to the Nation's \nchildren. During that critical period when a family is just climbing \nout of poverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested \nassistance programs, it would provide an extra boost with health \ninsurance for the children until the parents can move into jobs that \nprovide reliable health insurance coverage. And every child would \nautomatically be enrolled upon birth, along with the issuance of the \nbirth certificate or immigration card.\n  As we all know, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nProviding health care coverage to children affects much more than their \nhealth--it affects their ability to learn, their ability to thrive, and \ntheir ability to become a productive member of society. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues and supporting organizations for the \npassage of the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2003 to guarantee every \nchild in America the health coverage they need to grow up healthy.\n  I stand before you today to deliver a message. That it is time to \nrekindle the discussion about how we are going to provide health \ninsurance for all Americans. The bill I am introducing today--the \nMediKids Health Insurance Act of 2003--is a step toward eliminating the \nirrational and tragic lack of health insurance for so many children and \nadults in our country.\n  Partial solutions to America's ``uninsured crisis'' lie before \nCongress, and I recognize the sense of realism and care that are the \nbasis for proposing incremental steps towards universal coverage. As \nsomeone involved in the tough battles in years past to achieve \nuniversal coverage, I will continue to do all I can to make whatever \nprogress can be made each and every year.\n  But I also believe it is important to not lose sight of the ideal--\nand our capacity to reach that ideal--of the United States of America \njoining every other industrialized nation by ensuring that its citizens \nhave basic health insurance. Until we succeed, millions of children and \nadults will suffer human and financial costs that are preventable.\n  Therefore, I offer this legislation to both enlist my colleagues in \nan effort to insist that all of our Nation's children are insured as \nquickly as possible and to lay out the steps that would achieve that \ngoal. Some may say that we cannot afford this level of commitment to \nAmerica's children in a time of war and economic downturn. I strongly \ndisagree. We can fully fund MediKids with the more than $388 billion \nthe President's budget proposes to spend on the dividend tax cut. I \nbelieve that choice is clear between providing 100 percent of our \nchildren with health care coverage and giving tax breaks to the \nwealthiest 2 percent of people in our country. I hope this bill will \nhelp to build the will and momentum so desperately needed by our \nchildren for action that will change their lives and\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nstrengthen our Nation. I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nto join as co-sponsors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues.\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 9 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in lifetime costs to themselves and to the \n     entire American economy.\n       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending \n     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, they \n     alone cannot achieve 100 percent health insurance coverage \n     for our nation's children due to inevitable gaps during \n     outreach and enrollment, fluctuations in eligibility, \n     variations in access to private insurance at all income \n     levels, and variations in States' ability to provide required \n     matching funds.\n       (4) As all segments of society continue to become more \n     transient, with many changes in employment over the working \n     lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety net of \n     health insurance which follows children across State lines, \n     already a major problem for the children of migrant and \n     seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and provides a tested model for designing a program to reach \n     out to America's children\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2004, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible \n     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to strengthen and improve the management of national \nsecurity, encourage Government service in areas of critical national \nsecurity, and to assist government agencies in addressing deficiencies \nin personal possessing specialized skills important to national \nsecurity and incorporating the goals and strategies for recruitment and \nretention for such skilled personnel into the strategic and performance \nmanagement systems of Federal agencies; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Durbin, Allen and Voinovich to reintroduce the Homeland \nSecurity Federal Workforce Act. This is similar to legislation Senator \nDurbin, Senator Thompson, and I introduced in the 107th Congress. Like \nS. 1800, this bill is designed to strengthen the Federal Government's \nrecruitment and retention efforts in the areas of science, mathematics, \nand foreign language where there is a growing absence of qualified \npersonnel.\n  In the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, FBI \nDirector Mueller made a plea on national television for speakers of \nArabic and Farsi to help the FBI and national security agencies \ntranslate documents that were in our possession but which were left \nuntranslated due to a shortage of employees with proficiency in those \nlanguages. The General Accounting Office has reported that agencies \nhave shortages in translators and interpreters and an overall shortfall \nin the language proficiency levels needed to carry out their missions.\n  The Federal Government also lacks personnel with scientific and \nengineering skills. On February 25, 2003, William Wulf, president of \nthe National Academy of Engineering, noted that the supply of talented \nengineers in government is not keeping pace with growing demand. A \nrecent poll found that a mere 24 percent of job seekers believe that \nthe best engineering job opportunities are in the Federal Government \ncompared to 52 percent for the private sector. In another example, a \n1999 report of the National Research Council found significant science \nand technology weaknesses throughout the Department of State. These \nshortfalls have real consequences that hamper our ability to monitor \nexports of military-sensitive technology and preventing proliferation \nof biological warfare expertise from the former Soviet Union.\n  Now more than ever, we must make sure we have the right people with \nthe right skills in the right place. On January 9, 2003, the Washington \nPost reported that six major agencies moving into the Department of \nHomeland Security could lose roughly a quarter to one-half of their \nemployees to retirement over the next five years. The data shows that \nabout twice as many employees at these six agencies will be eligible to \nretire by the end of 2008 than\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nare currently eligible. According to the data, the following \npercentages of employees will be eligible to retire: 59 percent at the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency; 54 percent of the Coast Guard; 46 \npercent of the U.S. Customs Service; 44 percent of the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service; 32 percent of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service; and 22 percent of the Secret Service.\n  An alarming 26,363 employees out of 67,166 in the six agencies would \nbe eligible to retire in 2008. Unfortunately, the numbers for other \nFederal agencies are not any better.\n  We need programs to recruit personnel with the skills necessary to \nprotect our country. The Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act will \ndo just that. Today, agencies are forced to decide between funding \nprograms and investing in their workforce. This is a no-win situation \nand has prevented many agencies from fully utilizing the Federal \nstudent loan repayment program which is intended to be a powerful \nrecruitment and retention tool. The Homeland Security Federal Workforce \nAct expands the existing student loan repayment program by authorizing \nfunds for key national security agencies. The Act establishes a \nseparate fund to be administered by the Office of Personnel Management, \nOPM, to repay student loans for employees in national security \npositions who pledge to serve in the government for a minimum of three \nyears.\n  In addition, our legislation would establish a National Security \nService Board to oversee and implement the new National Security \nFellowship Program and the National Security Service Corps. The \nNational Security Fellowship Program is designed to fund graduate \neducation for selected students learning skills critical to national \nsecurity who agree to enter federal service on the completion of their \ndegree.\n  Current employees would not be neglected. Twenty percent of \nfellowship slots would be reserved for Federal employees to enhance \ntheir education and training. In addition, more training opportunities \nwould be provided to current federal employees through the National \nSecurity Service Corps. This program is designed to provide \nopportunities for mid-level federal employees in agencies with national \nsecurity responsibilities to serve in rotational assignments to build \nexperience and widen perspectives within the national security \ncommunity.\n  Last March I chaired a hearing in the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on this bill. Witnesses commented on the additional \nbenefits this legislation could have on the ability of government \nrecruitment and retention efforts. My former colleague, Representative \nLee Hamilton, now the Director of the Woodrow Wilson International \nCenter for Scholars, noted that, ``Enactment of these proposals would \nencourage more people to enter national security positions by easing \nthe financial sacrifices often associated with graduate study and with \ngovernment service.''\n  The creation of the Department of Homeland Security once again raised \nconcerns over the recruitment and retention of skilled employees in \nnational security positions. To address these needs, Senator Voinovich \nand I successfully added an amendment to the Homeland Security Act to \nhelp alleviate problems associated with the workforce crisis facing the \nFederal Government. However, we must focus our efforts on recruiting \nand retaining employees with the technical and language skills the \nfederal government needs the most. This legislation helps fill the \nholes in our recruitment and retention efforts.\n  As the United States Commission on National Security/21st Century, \nalso known as the Hart-Rudman Commission, concluded in 2001, `` . . . \nthe maintenance of American power in the world depends upon the quality \nof U.S. government personnel, civil and military, at all levels . . . \nThe U.S. faces a broader range of national security challenges today, \nrequiring policy analysts and intelligence personnel with expertise in \nmore countries, regions, and issues.'' The Homeland Security Federal \nWorkforce Act will meet this challenge.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the \nFederal Government has the tools to put the right people with the right \nskills in the right place to protect our great Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Federal \n     Workforce Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND EFFECT OF LAW.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The security of the United States requires the fullest \n     development of the intellectual resources and technical \n     skills of its young men and women.\n       (2) The security of the United States depends upon the \n     mastery of modern techniques developed from complex \n     scientific principles. It depends as well upon the discovery \n     and development of new principles, new techniques, and new \n     knowledge.\n       (3) The United States finds itself on the brink of an \n     unprecedented human capital crisis in Government. Due to \n     increasing competition from the private sector in recruiting \n     high-caliber individuals, Government departments and \n     agencies, particularly those involved in national security \n     affairs, are finding it hard to attract and retain talent.\n       (4) The United States must strengthen Federal civilian and \n     military personnel systems in order to improve recruitment, \n     retention, and effectiveness at all levels.\n       (5) The ability of the United States to exercise \n     international leadership is, and will increasingly continue \n     to be, based on the political and economic strength of the \n     United States, as well as on United States military strength \n     around the world.\n       (6) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that \n     the employees of its departments and agencies with national \n     security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges \n     of this changing international environment.\n       (7) In January 2001, the General Accounting Office reported \n     that, at the Department of Defense ``attrition among first-\n     time enlistees has reached an all-time high. The services \n     face shortages among junior officers, and problems in \n     retaining intelligence analysts, computer programmers, and \n     pilots.'' The General Accounting Office also warned of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service's ``lack of staff to \n     perform intelligence functions and unclear guidance for \n     retrieving and analyzing information.''\n       (8) The United States Commission on National Security also \n     cautioned that ``the U.S. need for the highest quality human \n     capital in science, mathematics, and engineering is not being \n     met.'' The Commission wrote, ``we must ensure the highest \n     caliber human capital in public service. U.S. national \n     security depends on the quality of the people, both civilian \n     and military, serving within the ranks of government.''\n       (9) The events on and after September 11th have highlighted \n     the weaknesses in the Federal and State government's human \n     capital and its personnel management practices, especially as \n     it relates to our national security.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) provide attractive incentives to recruit capable \n     individuals for Government and military service; and\n       (2) provide the necessary resources, accountability, and \n     flexibility to meet the national security educational needs \n     of the United States, especially as such needs change over \n     time.\n       (c) Effect of Law.--Nothing in this Act, or an amendment \n     made by this Act, shall be construed to affect the collective \n     bargaining unit status or rights of any Federal employee.\n\nTITLE I--PILOT PROGRAM FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES \n                    IN AREAS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish an Office of Manufacturing in the \nDepartment of Commerce, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Department of Labor, recently \nreleased the latest unemployment results and at first blush, the 5.8 \npercent figure, while certainly too high, does not seem overly \nalarming. It is only with a look behind the numbers that some \ndisturbing trends become apparent.\n  February marked the 31st consecutive month, since July 2000, that \nmanufacturing employment has declined. This is the longest consecutive \nmonthly decline in the post World War II era. Already, more than 2 \nmillion manufacturing jobs are gone. A generation ago, in 1974, \nmanufacturing workers were 26 percent of the workforce, today they \naccount for only 12.5 percent of the workforce.\n  For all of 2002, industrial production fell 0.6 percent following a \n3.5 percent decline in 2001. That represented the first back-to-back \nannual declines in industrial output since 1974-1975.\n  Unfortunately, no end is in sight. By some measures, the \nmanufacturing job loss is twice as bad as the last recession in the \nearly Nineties. The 2002 Producer Price Index revealed the worst \ndeflation in producer prices since 1949, suggesting that there is \nlittle incentive to restart the shuttered factories.\n  Prices for manufactured goods were down 1.5 percent in December from \na year earlier. Next to a 1.6 percent year-to-year drop in November, it \nwas the largest decline of such prices on record going back to 1958. \nAnd all this has occurred against the backdrop of 2 years of \nsubstantial fiscal stimulus and the most aggressive monetary policy in \nanyone's memory.\n  But this wasn't suppose to happen. Globalization was going to create \na gentle prosperity that would create jobs, lift our standard of living \nand improve our communities. During the Clinton era, we entered into a \nseries of international trade agreements, most notably NAFTA, WTO and \nChina's entrance into the WTO, designed to increase trade and stimulate \nmanufacturing job creation.\n  The second Bush administration continues this policy, trotting around \nthe globe negotiating, free-trade agreements within every region of the \nworld. Recently, the administration concluded agreements with Singapore \nand Chile.\n  After nearly a decade of the NAFTA/WTO free-trade experiment and \nafter a year of ``recovery'', it seems appropriate to review whether \nthis free trade era is working? The answer is clearly no.\n  Our factories have been swamped by a flood of imports. Each month \nseems to bring a record trade deficit and more stories of plants \nclosing and moving offshore.\n  Our communities, particularly the rural ones, are quite literally \nemptying out. During the nineties, imports soared by more than 107 \npercent. Our trade surplus with Mexico dissolved soon after NAFTA went \ninto effect. From 1991 to 2001, our trade deficit went from $77 billion \nto $427 billion, costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Essentially, our trading partners are exporting their unemployment to \nus. Recently, Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Prudential \nSecurities, noted that while the United States currently has 16.3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs, some 20 million rural Chinese move to seek \nbetter-paying manufacturing and construction jobs in the cities, each \nyear.\n\n  There seems to be no end in sight to pain being experienced by our \nmanufacturing sector. Even a declining dollar is not improving our \ntrade situation, as our factories race to re-establish overseas. It \nseems like recognizing\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nwhere our problem is coming from would be a good first step toward \nsolving it.\n  So today I introduce legislation designed to help get American \nmanufacturing off the canvas. It is broad and wide ranging.\n  The legislation would eliminate the tax benefits associated with off-\nshore production, whether its by a United States or foreign-based \ncompany. It would eliminate the incentives for companies to move their \nheadquarters outside of the United States. It would prevent the Export \nImport Bank or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation from funding \nany project that did not contain at least 80 percent U.S. content. It \nwould eliminate the International Trade Commission. It would provide \nfor an additional 500 Customs agents to enforce the tariff and quota \nrules associated with the textile trade. It would prohibit the sale in \ninterstate commerce of any manufactured product made by anyone under \ntwelve. It would reform WTO dispute settlement by establishing a panel \nof Federal judges to review the determinations that these dispute \npanels are reaching. It would express the Senate's strong support for \nthe Byrd amendment which returns anti-dumping monies to injured \nparties. Finally, the legislation would extend the Buy America \nprovisions for the Defense Department contained in the Berry amendment \nto the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.\n  It's just a start, but we have to begin the process of rejuvenating \nthe American manufacturer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 593. A bill to ensure that a Federal employee who takes leave \nwithout pay in order to perform service as a member of the uniformed \nservices or member of the National Guard shall continue to receive pay \nin an amount which, when taken together with the pay and allowances \nsuch individual is receiving for such service, will be no less than the \nbasic pay such individual would then be receiving if no interruption in \nemployment has occurred; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, with war looming with Iraq and \nhundreds of thousands of our troops poised for battle overseas, I would \nlike to discuss the financial burden faced by many of the men and women \nwho serve in the military Reserves or National Guard and who are forced \nto take unpaid leave from their jobs when called to active duty. \nCurrently, there are nearly 170,000 Guard and Reservists mobilized and \nserving on active duty in our armed forces. While these individuals \nreceive pay for the time they are on active duty, the salary gap \nbetween military duty and civilian work can be considerable. It is \nunfair to ask the men and women who have volunteered to serve their \ncountry, often in dangerous situations, to also face a financial strain \non their families.\n  A number of employers have wisely acted to remedy this hardship by \nestablishing financial compensation plans for their employees in the \nReserves and National Guard. Many companies and State and local \ngovernments, including Ford, IBM, the State of California, Los Angeles \nCounty, and Austin, TX, recognize this burden and voluntarily pay the \ndifference between the active duty military salary and civilian salary \nfor these reservists. In my State of Illinois, Boeing Aerospace, State \nFarm Insurance, Sears, Roebuck & Company, the State of Illinois, the \nCity of Chicago, and many other Illinois companies, local governments, \nand institutions cover the pay differential for Reserve and National \nGuard members called to active duty.\n  We should take similar action in Washington and set an example for \nemployers throughout the country. Today, I am introducing with my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Reservist Pay \nSecurity Act of 2003, legislation that will help alleviate the \nfinancial problems faced by many Federal employees who serve in the \nReserves and must take time off from their jobs when our Nation calls. \nThis bill would allow these citizen-soldiers to maintain their normal \nsalary when called to active service by requiring Federal agencies to \nmake up the difference between their military pay and what they would \nhave earned on their Federal job.\n  As the symbol of American values and ideals, the Federal Government \nshould give these special employees of our government more than just \nwords of support. We should not encourage Americans to protect their \ncountry and then punish those who enlist in the armed forces by taking \naway a large portion of their salaries. We must provide our reservist \nemployees with financial support so they can leave their civilian lives \nto serve our country without the added burden of worrying about the \nfinancial well-being of their families. They are doing so much for us; \nwe should do no less for them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor about \nsupporting our armed forces. Support for our troops is particularly \nimportant today as our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are \ndeployed for possible war with Iraq. We must express our support not \nonly with words, but with deeds. We owe that to our armed forces.\n  Our brave men and women of the National Guard and Reserves are \nexperiencing hardships as a result of recent mobilizations. I believe \nwe should do everything we can to reduce unnecessary financial burdens \non members of the military, especially when they are putting themselves \nin harm's way to protect our great Nation.\n  We must stand up for our military; we must also stand up for their \nfamilies. Our troops will face grave danger. They should not have to \nface fear for their families, and particularly they should not have to \nworry about their families' finances.\n  Though America is on the brink of war, American military families \nmust never be on the brink of bankruptcy. That is why we, in the \nSenate, must take immediate steps to support military families.\n  Today, I am proud to cosponsor the Reservists Pay Security Act with \nmy colleague Senator Dick Durbin. Senator Durbin introduced a similar \nbill in the House, and I introduced it in the Senate during Desert \nStorm in 1991. It was the right thing to do then, and it is the right \nthing to do now. I'm proud to work together again on this worthy cause.\n  The Reservists Pay Security Act of 2003 would ensure that Federal \nemployees who take leave to serve in our military reserves receive the \nsame pay as if no interruption in their employment occurred. Why start \nwith Federal employees? Well, many large companies and local \ngovernments continue to pay the full salary of their employees when \nthey are activated. I applaud those excellent corporate citizens and \nthose local governments. Some of the largest employers in my own State \nare also meeting that responsibility. The Federal Government should be \na model employer and set the example for large businesses. This should \nbe a first step.\n  I believe we should move quickly to pass this bill because many \nmembers of the Guard and Reserves do work for the Federal Government in \nhighly specialized areas. But the Federal Government needs to do more \nthan that. We need to take a look at those who work for small business \nand those who are self-employed. A call for duty will be responded to, \nbut a call for duty time and time again in a single-year period places \nthe responsibility on the family. American families should never \nsubsidize our war effort. We should be looking out for those families.\n  We owe reservists our support and a debt of gratitude. This bill is a \nstep toward achieving that. I urge my colleagues to join us and enact \nthis important legislation for the men and women of our National Guard \nand Reserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Cochran, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 594. A bill to provide for the issuance of bonds to provide \nfunding for the construction of schools of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Daschle, Campbell, \nCochran, and Murray introduce the Indian School Construction Act. This \nlegislation establishes an innovative funding mechanism to enhance the\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\nability of Indian tribes to construct, repair, and maintain quality \neducational facilities.\n  For education construction in fiscal year 2004, President Bush \nproposes a total of $292.6 million, the same level as was requested in \nFY 2003. Of this total, $131.4 million is for new school construction \nto replace seven trial schools on the BIA Priority List, one of those \nis in my home state of South Dakota. While I am pleased that seven \nschools will be replaced this year, there are literally dozens of \nschools that are in desperate need of replacement and repair. Simply, \nthe process for replacing schools does not meet the need.\n  American Indians have been, and continue to be disproportionately \naffected by both poverty and low educational achievement. The fact that \nchildren are expected to learn despite inadequate educational \nfacilities undoubtedly contributes to this disparity.\n  This bill provides a mechanism whereby an escrow account will be set \nup with a one time appropriation. Money would be placed in the escrow \naccount and the tribal governments could use that account to issue \nbonds for purposes of constructing elementary and secondary schools. \nThis allows tribal governments an opportunity to construct schools, \neven if the schools are low on the BIA priority list and are not slated \nfor immediate construction under the direct appropriation process. \nUltimately, this would mean that our children can learn in a better \nenvironment more quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to closely examine the Indian School \nConstruction Act and join me in working to make this innovative funding \nmechanism a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Allard, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Sununu, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 595. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe required use of certain principal repayments on mortgage subsidy \nbond financings to redeem bonds, to modify the purchase price \nlimitation under mortgage subsidy bond rules based on median family \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Breaux, I \nrise today to introduce the Housing Bond and Credit Modernization and \nFairness Act of 2003. We are joined in this legislation by Senators \nAllard, Collins, Sununu, and Snowe.\n  This bill will bring about important modifications to two important \nand popular Federal affordable housing programs--Housing Bonds, or \nsingle family Mortgage Revenue Bonds, MRBs, as they are commonly known, \nand the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. My long-time partnership on \nthese issues with Senator Breaux is one indication of the broad \nbipartisan support enjoyed by these programs. Another is the fact that \nour identical bill in the 107th Congress attracted 79 members of this \nbody as cosponsors.\n  These programs are popular because they are state-administered, \nfederal tax incentives designed to encourage private investment in \nfirst-time homebuyer mortgages for low and moderate-income families and \nprivately developed and owned apartments for low-income renters. \nMoreover, they have a proven track record of being effective in \nproviding housing to families who need it.\n  As with most things, however, these programs could use some \nimprovements. Specifically, the current law governing these two housing \nprograms includes some obsolete provisions that act as barriers and \nlimit their effectiveness. The legislation we are introducing today \nwould modernize these programs and remove these barriers.\n  The Housing Bond and Credit Modernization and Fairness Act does three \nthings.\n  First, it repeals the so-called ``Ten-Year Rule,'' a provision added \nto the MRB program in 1988 that prevents States from using homeowner \npayments on such mortgages to make new mortgages to additional \nqualified purchasers. For each day the Ten-Year Rule is in effect, \nStates lose millions of dollars in financing for first-time homebuyer \nmortgages, amounting to more than $14 billion in mortgage authority \nbetween 2001 and 2005. This barrier keeps tens of thousands of \nadditional qualified lower income homebuyers from getting an affordable \nMRB-financed mortgage, including many in my home State of Utah. Our \nbill eliminates the Ten-Year Rule to allow States to use mortgage \npayments to finance additional lower income mortgages.\n  Second, it replaces the present unworkable price limit for homes \nthese mortgages can finance with a simple limit that works. Let me \nexplain. Current law limits the price of homes purchased with MRB-\nfinanced mortgages to 90 percent of the average area home price. States \nhave the option of determining their own purchase price limits or \nrelying on Treasury-published safe harbor limits.\n  Most States have relied on the Treasury limits because it is costly \nand burdensome to collect accurate and comprehensive sales price data. \nThe problem is that the Treasury Department has not been providing \nrecent data. This has especially been a problem for states, such as \nUtah, with many rural areas. In fact, Treasury last issued safe harbor \nlimits in 1994, based on 1993 data. Home prices have risen \nsignificantly in the past ten years. This means that the MRB program \nsimply cannot work in many parts of many states because qualified \nbuyers cannot find homes priced below the outdated limits. To have an \noutdated and unworkable requirement that holds back the families that \nthis program is designed to help is poor public policy that cries out \nfor remedy.\n  The answer, which is included in our bill, is to replace the present \nlimit, set in Washington, by a simple formula limiting the purchase \nprice to three and a half times the qualifying income under the \nprogram.\n  Finally, the bill makes Housing Credit apartment production viable in \nrural areas by allowing States to use statewide median incomes as the \nbasis for the income limits in that program. This change would apply \nthe same methodology for determining qualifying income levels used in \nthe MRB Program. HUD data shows that current income limits inhibit \nHousing Credit development in more than 1,300 nonmetropolitan counties \nacross the country.\n  I am pleased to tell my colleagues that the changes proposed by the \nHousing Bond and Credit Modernization and Fairness Act have been \nendorsed by the bipartisan National Governors Association, the National \nCouncil of State Housing Agencies, and nearly every major national \nhousing organization. These groups know how important the Housing Bond \nand Housing Credit programs are in giving States the ability to meet \nthe housing needs of low and moderate-income families.\n  The Housing Credit and the MRB programs work and they are important \nto each State. This bill gives the Congress a golden opportunity to \ncreate new housing opportunities for tens of thousands of low and \nmoderate-income families every year, simply by improving these existing \nand proven programs. I encourage my colleagues to join this bipartisan \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage the investment of foreign earnings within the United States \nfor productive business investments and job creation; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President. I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nBoxer, Senator Smith, Senator Allen, Senator Enzi and Senator Bayh to \nintroduce The Invest in the U.S.A. Act of 2003 to stimulate job growth \nand investment in the American economy.\n  Under current tax law, American companies doing business overseas are \ndiscouraged from bringing their earnings back home because those \nearnings are subject to up to a 35-percent rate of taxation. \nSpecifically, our government imposes taxes on American companies when \nits foreign subsidiary earnings are brought back to the United States, \nto the extent of any shortfall in the tax paid abroad and the 35-\npercent U.S. tax rate. Therefore, many businesses do the math and \nconclude that it would be more beneficial to invest 100 percent of \nthose earnings abroad than it would be to bring the funds home to be \nreinvested in the American economy.\n  Our proposal is a sensible, fiscally responsible way to provide \nimmediate investment in the American economy. Specifically, the Invest \nin the U.S.A. Act bill will allow domestic corporations doing business \nabroad to bring their foreign earnings home by imposing a 5.25-percent \ntoll tax on dividends in excess of normal distributions for only one \nyear. Companies must reinvest these funds in the United States in an \napproved investment plan to take advantage of the lowered rate. \nFinally, domestic shareholders would permanently surrender the right to \nclaim foreign tax credits for 85 percent of foreign income taxes \nassociated with dividends subject to the 5.25-percent tax, as well as \nexclude 85 percent of income subject to the 5.25-percent tax from the \ncalculation of the foreign tax credit limitation ensuring that no \nAmerican company will be taxed less than 5.25 percent.\n  Lowering the tax burden on foreign subsidiary income for a limited \ntime will open the floodgates for privately held foreign funds to be \nbrought back into the American economy to provide immediate economic \nstimulus. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Invest in \nthe U.S.A. Act will not only increase receipts to the U.S. Treasury in \nthe first year by $4.1 billion but also inject an additional $135 \nbillion of privately held funds into the U.S. economy that will be an \nimmediate stimulus to our economy at a cost of only $3.9 billion over \n10 years--less than 3 percent of the overall gain this legislation will \nhave to the American economy.\n  These funds can be used to create more jobs for American workers, \nsolidify corporate pension and retirement funds, invest in \nmanufacturing equipment and research and development, and reduce \ndomestic debt loads thereby increasing employee and shareholder \ndividends. American jobs depend on American companies, and this \nproposal will accomplish that objective. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Today, Senator Ensign and I are introducing the Invest in \nthe U.S.A. Act of 2003 along with Senators Smith, Allen, Enzi, and \nBayh. This economic stimulus legislation would create a one-year \nincentive for corporations to bring the profits they have made overseas \nback to the United States and invest them in creating jobs.\n  The act lowers the effective corporate tax rate on the foreign \nearnings of American companies from 35 percent to 5.25 percent for one \nyear. By lowering that rate for one year, we will encourage companies \nto bring an estimated $135 billion from abroad back home to invest in \nthe United States. Getting this capital into the domestic economy is \nparticularly necessary in light of the difficulties firms are having \nraising money in this tough economy. By making this capital available \nfor domestic investment, we will minimize the spending cuts that \ncompanies have been announcing for the coming year.\n  The Invest in the U.S.A. Act would constitute a true economic \nstimulus by encouraging investment and job creation right away in such \nactivities as worker hiring and training, research and development, and \nnew plants.\n  Our proposal is also fiscally responsible, unlike other proposals \nthat fail to give the economy the shot in the arm it needs. It will \nresult in job creation rather than deficit creation by enabling a \ntremendous amount of investment in our economy in the short term with \nonly a small cost in the long term. For Government, the funds brought \nback to the United States will generate $4.1 billion in revenues in the \nfirst year and is expected to cost $3.9 billion over 10 years.\n  I want to thank Senator Ensign for his active, engaged leadership on \nthis legislation. I particularly appreciate Senator Ensign's focus on \nensuring that these funds will be targeted at creating jobs and \nstimulating our economy right away.\n  Mr. President, we will work hard to ensure that the provisions in \nthis act are included in any economic growth package that the Senate \nconsiders because our workers need the opportunities it would create \nand our economy needs the capital it would generate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 597. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nenergy tax incentives; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we offer a \nbipartisan energy tax incentives package for the 108th Congress. I have \nbeen joined in this introduction by not only Ranking Member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, but also the Chairman and the \nRanking Member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman as original sponsors of the Energy Tax Incentives \nAct of 2003, which we are introducing today.\n  This bill is substantially similar to the Energy Tax Incentives Bill \nwhich won overwhelming support on the floor of the Senate last April. \nIt continues to represent a balanced package of alternative energy, \ntraditional energy production and energy efficiency incentives. As we \nmove forward towards a Mark-up of an energy tax bill by the Finance \nCommittee, this bill represents a starting point. We hope over the next \nfew weeks to be able to incorporate some of the new and improved \nversions of some of the provisions that we developed over the many \nmonths of conference during the last Congress.\n  I remain committed to diverse sources of energy and electricity, to \ninclude the production of electricity for wind and agricultural waste \nnutrients. In addition this bill reflects my continued interest in \nbiodiesel and provisions to support small ethanol producers. I look \nforward to working with the Sponsors to craft a responsive bipartisan \nenergy tax package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Finance Committee and the Chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee as a sponsor of the Energy Tax \nIncentives Act of 2003, which we are introducing today.\n  The tax incentives we introduce today are designed to encourage \ncommercial activities that will increase and diversify our energy \nsupplies and help us to use those energy supplies more efficiently and \nproductively. Our demand for energy continues to grow and we will need \na broad portfolio of energy sources, including improved efficiency, to \nmeet this demand. The energy tax package encompasses many of the \ndiverse components that make up a comprehensive energy strategy. These \ninclude incentives for renewable resources, alternative transportation \nfuels and alternative fuel vehicles, energy efficient appliances and \nbuildings, clean coal, domestic oil and gas production and \ninfrastructure, as well as removing impediments to an integrated \nelectric grid.\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n  This bill reflects the work of the Finance Committee last year to \ndevelop a balanced package of energy tax provisions to complement the \nenergy policy legislation developed by the Senate. The language of the \nbill is virtually identical to the tax sections of the Energy bill \npassed by the Senate last April. While new or improved versions of some \nof the provisions have been developed in the intervening months, this \nversion provides a common starting point for any further refinements of \nthe text. I look forward to participating in the Finance Committee's \nconsideration of the energy tax package this year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Grassley in \nintroducing the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2003. The chairman and the \nranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman, are also original sponsors of this legislation.\n  This legislation is very similar to the energy tax incentives bill \nwhich won overwhelming support on the Senate floor last April and \nprovides a strong starting point for the Senate Finance Committee \ntowards a mark-up of an energy tax bill.\n  The urgency for this legislation at this point in time is \nparticularly critical. Gasoline prices in the U.S. are at record \nlevels. Low inventories, high crude oil prices, recent cold weather and \ncontinuing industry concern about a possible war with Iraq have raised \ngas prices close to the highest price ever recorded. This situation is \nnot expected to improve in the near future.\n  To help alleviate this situation, this bill proposes a balanced \npackage of alternative energy, traditional energy production and energy \nefficiency incentives. This legislation begins from the premise that we \nmay accomplish energy policy goals by targeting market incentives--in \nthe form of tax deductions and credits--at certain investments. The \nbill would accomplish this in three ways. First, we create incentives \nfor new production, especially production from important renewable \nsources. Second, we create incentives for the development of new \ntechnology. Third, we create incentives for energy conservation.\n  Through targeted market incentives we hope to encourage the \ndevelopment of alternative sources of production and technologies, \nthereby boosting our overall energy resources. This will help promote \nenergy independence in the United States, which will contribute to both \ngreater economic growth and national security. At the same time, by \nencouraging development of sources of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, we will also encourage pollution reduction and improve \nhuman health and the environment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important piece \nof legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Dole, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Chambiss, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 598. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a clarification of the definition of homebound for purposes \nof determining eligibility for home health services under the medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nMiller, Dole, McCain, Kerry, Chambliss and Specter in introducing the \nDavid Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2003 to modernize \nMedicare's outdated ``homebound'' requirement that has impeded access \nto needed home health services for many of our Nation's elderly and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Health care in America has gone full circle. People are spending less \ntime in institutions, and recovery and care for patients with chronic \ndiseases and conditions have increasingly been taking place in the \nhome. The highly skilled and often technically complex care that our \nhome health agencies provide has enabled millions of our most \nvulnerable older and disabled individuals to avoid hospitals and \nnursing homes and stay just where they belong--in the comfort and \nsecurity of their own homes.\n  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered \n``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. \nWhile an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to qualify \nfor benefits, his or her condition must be such that ``there exists a \nnormal inability to leave home.'' The statute does allow for absences \nfrom the home that are ``infrequent'' or of ``relatively short \nduration.'' It also gives specific permission for the individual to \nleave home to attend medical appointments, adult day care or religious \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, however, the statute does not define precisely what \n``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration'' means. It leaves it to \nthe fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify \nas ``frequent'' and just how short those absences must be. \nInterpretations of this definition have therefore varied widely.\n  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an \noverzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned \nelderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries--who are dependent upon \nMedicare home health services and medical equipment for survival--into \nvirtual prisoners in their own home.\n  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, \ndisabled Medicare patients. For example, last year I met with David \nJayne, a 41-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who is confined to \na wheelchair and cannot swallow, speak or even breathe on his own. Mr. \nJayne needs skilled nursing visits each week to enable him to remain \nindependent and out of an inpatient facility. Despite his disability, \nMr. Jayne meets frequently with youth and church groups. Speaking \nthrough a computerized voice synthesizer, he gives inspirational talks \nabout how the human spirit can endure and even overcome great hardship.\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne \nand his activities, including a report about how he had, with the help \nof family and friends, attended a football game to root for the \nUniversity of Georgia Bulldogs. A few days later, at the direction of \nthe fiscal intermediary, his home health agency--which had been sending \na health care worker to his home for two hours, four mornings a week--\nnotified him that he could no longer be considered homebound, and that \nhis benefits were being cut off. While his benefits were subsequently \nreinstated due to the media attention given the case, this experience \nmotivated him to launch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition \nand led him to found the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare \nHomebound Restriction.\n  The fact is that the current requirement reflects an outmoded view of \nlife for persons who live with serious disabilities. The homebound \ncriteria may have made sense thirty years ago, when an elderly or \ndisabled person might have expected to live in the confines of their \nhome--perhaps cared for by an extended family. The current definition, \nhowever, fails to reflect the technological and medical advances that \nhave been made in supporting individuals with significant disabilities \nand mobility challenges. It also fails to reflect advances in treatment \nfor seriously ill individuals that allow them brief periods of relative \nwellness.\n  It also fails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity and \nphysical stamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the \nbody and mind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four \nwalls of a home.\n  The David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2003 will \ncreate an exception to the homebound restriction based on the severity \nof the patient's functional limitations and clinical condition. The \nspecific, limited exception to the homebound rule would apply to \nindividuals who: one, have been certified by a physician as having a \npermanent and severe condition that will not improve; two, who will \nneed assistance with three or more of the five activities of daily \nliving, such as eating, dressing and bathing, for the rest of their \nlives; three, who require technological and/or personal assistance with \nthe act of leaving home; and four, who are only able to leave home \nbecause the services provided through the home health benefit makes it \npossible for them to do so.\n  We believe that our legislation is budget neutral because it is \nspecifically limited to individuals who are already eligible for \nMedicare and whose conditions require the assistance of a skilled \nnurse, therapist or home health\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\naide to make it functionally possible for them to leave the home. Our \nlegislation does not expand Medicare eligibility--it simply gives \npeople who are already eligible for the benefit their freedom.\n  This issue was first brought to my attention by former Senator Bob \nDole, who has long been a vigorous advocate for people with \ndisabilities, and I ask unanimous consent that the editorial Senator \nDole wrote for the Washington Post last summer entitled ``Imprisoned by \nMedicare'' be printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Our proposal is also supported by the Consortium of Citizens with \nDisabilities, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, the National \nAssociation for Home Care, Advancing Independence: Modernizing Medicare \nand Medicaid, AIMM, the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare \nHomebound Restriction, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Half \nthe Planet Foundation.\n  Moreover, the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of \n2003 is consistent with President Bush's ``New Freedom Initiative'' \nwhich has, as its goal, the removal of barriers that impede \nopportunities for those with disabilities to integrate more fully into \nthe community. By allowing reasonable absences from the home, our \nlegislation will bring the Medicare home health benefit into the 21st \nCentury, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it \ndone.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 27, 2002]\n\n                         Imprisoned by Medicare\n\n                               (Bob Dole)\n\n       Heroes inspire us to achieve the unachievable, to leave \n     America a better place for future generations. They remind us \n     that contributing to family and community is our highest \n     priority. I am fortunate to know such a hero, and his story \n     has inspired me to help achieve his one simple wish before he \n     dies--to change a Medicare restriction so that he and \n     thousands of others who live with permanent and severe \n     disabilities can leave their homes to see their children grow \n     up and contribute to their community without losing life-\n     sustaining home health services.\n       David Jayne was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease at age \n     27. Otherwise known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), \n     this degenerative neuromuscular condition causes his muscles \n     to atrophy, leaving him unable to eat, breathe or move on his \n     own. Though his mobility is limited to moving three fingers, \n     Jayne, now 41, has demonstrated to everyone who knows him or \n     has read about him that the human spirit is indomitable.\n       I met David Jayne by chance at Reagan National Airport \n     about a year ago. Attached to life support equipment and a \n     computerized voice simulator because of his body's \n     deterioration at the hand of ALS, Jayne had traveled with the \n     help of friends from his home in Rex, Ga., to meet with his \n     elected members of Congress. He came to urge them to amend \n     the Medicare homebound restriction.\n       The homebound rule was intended to deter abuse of the home \n     health benefit by limiting services to only those individuals \n     whose illnesses and disabilities are so severe that leaving \n     the home would require ``a considerable and taxing effort.'' \n     In the 1960s, when this rule was created, it reflected the \n     limits of health care and technology at the time. It was \n     incomprehensible then to think that someone with ALS or any \n     severe and permanent disability could leave the home.\n       While the homebound restriction has not changed, the role \n     of physicians and home health providers has. Nurses, doctors \n     and home health administrators have been turned into \n     watchdogs and given the responsibility to report any \n     knowledge of their patients leaving their homes. And the \n     awful reality of those receiving these services is that they \n     must either lie or cheat just to enjoy fundamental liberties.\n       This nearly 40-year-old policy reflects an outmoded view of \n     life for persons with disabilities. Thanks to advances in \n     technology and greater community accessibility through the \n     passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), people \n     with the most severe disabilities are able to leave their \n     homes to go to work, volunteer in their communities and enjoy \n     their family and friends. Unfortunately, Medicare policy has \n     not kept pace with our times and is now punishing the very \n     people it was intended to benefit. While Medicare has \n     developed other and better policies to deter abuse, it has \n     kept this outdated policy.\n       The Medicare statute does allow for absences from the home \n     of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.'' But the \n     vagueness of this allowance leaves it to Medicare contractors \n     to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent'' \n     and just how short those absences might be. To err on the \n     conservative side, contractors have stripped home health \n     coverage from those most needing it, including David Jayne, \n     whose life depends on a ventilator, intravenous feeding and \n     daily care from a home health aide. Because Jayne's story \n     went public, his home health agency discontinued these life-\n     sustaining services. They were only reinstated after members \n     of Congress became involved and Jayne agreed to pay his home \n     health provider for any claim denied by Medicare. But \n     thousands of others live in fear of leaving their homes \n     because of the stories that have been reported. In two \n     heartbreaking cases, one mother's services were cut off after \n     she attended the funeral for her child, while another mother \n     did not attend the funeral of her child because of fear of \n     losing her home health care.\n       For millions of Americans, Medicare-covered home health \n     services provide a less costly alternative to nursing home or \n     hospital care. There are abuses that should be corrected, but \n     not by extracting a price that no law-abiding American should \n     ever have to pay.\n       David Jayne has inspired many people with his love and \n     determination and his simple words, ``Always wait another day \n     because the next day will be better.'' He inspired me to \n     volunteer to try to help.\n       I urge the House of Representatives to amend this harsh \n     restriction on individual freedom by including in the \n     Medicare reform bill the David Jayne Amendment, carefully \n     drafted by Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Susan Collins \n     (R-Maine), to do what we all know in our hearts is right, \n     including all the appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse. \n     And if this is not possible because of cost concerns, to \n     adopt an amendment to provide for those who are severely and \n     permanently disabled and who require the assistance of an \n     attendant or a skilled nursing facility.\n       The amendment should give the Health and Human Services \n     Department six months to address the homebound rule and make \n     recommendations on how to bring it up to date with today's \n     technology. Make no mistake, David Jayne is a prisoner--a \n     prisoner in his specially designed wheelchair. His illness \n     has robbed him of the ability to do anything without the aid \n     of technology. Medicare shouldn't act as jailer too. \n     Thousands of David Jaynes across America are looking to the \n     president, Congress and the Department of Health and Human \n     Services for help.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 599. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage under the medicare program for diabetes laboratory \ndiagnostic tests and other services to screen for diabetes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Access \nto Diabetes Screening Services Act of 2003'' with my friends Senators \nCollins and Bingaman. This bill will help to bring the epidemic of \ndiabetes under control by providing Medicare coverage for laboratory \ndiagnostic tests and other services which are used to screen for \ndiabetes. Medicare cannot currently provide these screening services \nbecause they are prohibited to do so by Federal law.\n  Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among adults in the United \nStates. The latest figures published by the Centers for Disease \nControl, CDC, in the January 1, 2003, edition of the ``Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association'' show that 7.9 percent of the American \npopulation has diabetes. The CDC believes that if trends continue, more \nthan 10 percent of all Americans will have diabetes by the year 2010. \nEven today our Nation is feeling the effects of this disease--diabetes \nis the Nation's sixth leading cause of death.\n  Diabetes strikes even harder in our nation's minority and emerging \nmajority populations. Today, the CDC estimates that 11.9 percent of the \nAfrican American population and nine percent of the Hispanic population \nhas diabetes. Without a doubt, diabetes is now truly the epidemic of \nour time.\n  These rising rates are especially evident among our Nation's aging \npopulation. Currently almost seven million Americans age 65 and older, \nor over 20 percent of seniors, have diabetes. Roughly 20 percent of \nseniors age 65 and older have a newly identified condition called pre-\ndiabetes, which if left untreated will develop into diabetes. An \nadditional 40,000 people living with diabetes and end-stage renal \ndisease under the age of 65 participate in the Medicare program.\n  Even more distressing is the fact that approximately one third of the \n7 million seniors with diabetes, or 2.3 million people, are \nundiagnosed. They simply do not know that they have this very serious \ncondition--a condition whose complications include heart disease, \nstroke, vision loss and blindness, amputations, and kidney disease.\n  My own home State of Arkansas has had first-hand experience with the \nrising diabetes rates. Arkansas ranks\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\nfifth in the Nation for diabetes incidence. Recent studies show that \n8.9 percent of all Arkansas adults had diagnosed diabetes, and over one \nmillion Arkansans are at risk for undiagnosed diabetes.\n  Our Nation is not yet doing enough to manage this preventable and \ncontrollable disease. Last week, the National Institutes of Health, the \nCDC and the American Diabetes Association announced that the direct \ncosts of treating diabetes grew by more than 50 percent between 1997 \nand 2002, from $44 billion to $91.8 billion. One of every ten dollars \nspent on healthcare in America is now spent on diabetes, and the \naverage per capita cost of healthcare for a person living with diabetes \nis $13,243 versus $2,560 for a typical American without diabetes.\n  Those in the medical community and the federal government are only \ntoo aware of the rising prevalence and serious nature of diabetes. The \nCenters for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services recently joined together in a \nnational education campaign to inform people about diabetes and \nencourage people age 45 and older to get screened for diabetes.\n  Unfortunately, current law does not allow Medicare to reimburse for \ndiabetes testing, even if a patient presents serious risk factors for \ndiabetes such as obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. \nMost shockingly, even if a patient is experiencing early evidence of \ndiabetes complications, such as blindness or kidney disease, Medicare \nstill cannot reimburse a physician for diabetes testing.\n  This nonsensical omission of diabetes screening coverage is even more \nshocking in light of the fact that about 25 percent of the Medicare \nbudget currently is devoted to providing medical care to seniors living \nwith diabetes. In 1999, Arkansas spent $1.6 billion on direct and \nindirect costs of diabetes. The amount Arkansas spent on diabetes in \n2002 is undoubtedly higher in light of the cost data available. Why are \nwe continuing to react to diabetes and its complications instead of \nproactively screening our Medicare beneficiaries for this common and \ncostly disease? This screening can identify the disease, even before \nany symptoms have appeared, and has the potential to save and improve \nthousands of lives. In addition, this screening will potentially help \nprevent countless cases of end-stage renal disease, blindness and \namputations--preventable complications of the diabetes that are \ndraining Medicare of vital resources.\n  The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists strongly \nbelieves that patients with diabetes should be identified as early as \npossible in their illness. We have the technology to do this through \nscreening.\n  I cannot overstate the need for this legislation. When faced with the \nrising prevalence of diabetes, the high percentage of seniors who \nalready have the disease, the alarmingly high number of seniors who \nhave diabetes but do not know it yet, the growing number of seniors \nliving with preventable diabetes complications, and the high cost \nassociated with diabetes treatment, it is obvious that Medicare should \nprovide coverage for diabetes screening.\n  Our Nation must do more to battle the epidemic of diabetes through \nprevention, detection and treatment. This legislation will make \ndetection of a deadly disease available to all Medicare enrollees. The \nAmerican Diabetes Association has identified Medicare screening \ncoverage as a top legislative priority, and I have worked closely with \nthem to craft this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to give \nserious consideration to cosponsoring and actively supporting the \nDiabetes Screening Act of 2003.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln, in introducing this important bill to \nprovide Medicare coverage for laboratory diagnostic tests and other \nservices used to screen for diabetes.\n  As the founder and co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families. \nDiabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that disproportionately \naffects the elderly, children and minorities. It is one of our Nation's \nmost costly diseases in both human and economic terms, and is the \nleading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations \nnot related to injury. Moreover, it is a major risk factor for stroke, \nheart disease and other chronic conditions. According to a new study \nreleased by the American Diabetes Association, diabetes cost our Nation \n$132 billion last year, and health care spending for people with \ndiabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have \ndiabetes.\n  Unfortunately, diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed. Of the more than \n17 million Americans who have diabetes, 7 million of whom are 65 and \nolder, it is estimated that as many as one third don't know it. They \nsimply do not know that they have this very serious condition that \nplaces them at increased risk of developing devastating and costly \ncomplications such as blindness, kidney failure and amputations.\n  Moreover, an additional 16 million Americans have a newly identified \ncondition known as ``pre-diabetes,'' an increasingly common condition \nin which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet \ndiabetic. Pre-diabetes dramatically raises the risk for developing Type \n2 diabetes and increases the risk of heart disease by 50 percent. \nAccording to research supported by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, most people with pre-diabetes are likely to develop diabetes \nwithin a decade unless their condition is diagnosed and they make the \nlifestyle changes necessary to reduce their risks for the disease.\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson has made \ndiabetes prevention and management a key part of the Bush \nAdministration's broader efforts to encourage a healthier America. As a \npart of this effort, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services have joined together in a national education campaign to \ninform people about diabetes and encourage people age forty-five and \nolder to get screened for diabetes.\n  Unfortunately, however, current law does not allow Medicare to pay \nfor diabetes testing, even for patients with serious risk factors for \ndiabetes, such as obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. \nAstoundingly, even if a patient is experiencing early evidence of \ndiabetes complications such as blindness or kidney disease, Medicare \nwill not pay for diabetes testing.\n  This coverage omission is particularly irrational given the fact that \none out of every four Medicare dollars is currently spent on medical \ncare for seniors who are living with diabetes.\n  Early detection and treatment are essential if we are to improve the \nquality of life for people with diabetes and prevent or delay the onset \nof the costly and sometimes deadly complications associated with the \ndisease. We have the technology to identify diabetes even before the \nonset of any symptoms. These tests have the potential of improving and \nsaving thousands of lives, not to mention countless Medicare dollars. \nIt only makes sense that Medicare should cover them.\n  Both the American Diabetes Association and the American Association \nof Clinical Endocrinologists support our legislation, and I encourage \nall of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 600. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to cooperate in \nthe international magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment, or \nalternatively to develop a plan for a domestic burning plasma \nexperiment, for the purpose of accelerating the scientific \nunderstanding and development of fusion as a long term energy source; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there should be no doubt that energy is \nvital to our economy and that it contributes to our wealth and strength \nas a nation. While it is true that human intelligence, a skilled \nworkforce, and the human spirit are essential to our economy and to our \nfuture, without useable energy, these virtues are not, of themselves, \ntools to make a physical difference.\n  As we look out decades and centuries into the future, determining \nwhether we will have enough energy and finding\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nthe sources from which we will get it are extremely important \nendeavors. Will we get our energy from oil or from coal? Will it come \nfrom solar collectors and wind farms? Will it come from nuclear \nfission? I submit that the answer we work to provide to this question \ntoday will have a profound effect on the future quality of life for our \nchildren and grandchildren. This is part of the reason why energy \npolicy is so controversial. It is because the stakes are so high.\n  Although fossil fuels will last for many decades yet--perhaps \ncenturies--the reality is that we must begin to plan for the time when \nfossil fuels might not be so plentiful. Taken together, fossil fuels \nprovide us with well over 70 percent of the energy we consume in this \ncountry. Much of that energy is imported. When you take oil, coal and \nnatural gas out of the equation, what are our options for the long term \nfuture?\n  The significant potential contributors to our energy picture that are \nnot fossil fuels are likely to be nuclear, hydropower, renewables such \nas solar, wind and geothermal, and fusion energy. We must pursue all of \nthese options as if our future depended on it, because it does. It is \nin this context, that I want to focus my colleagues' attention today on \nthe subject of fusion energy.\n  Fusion energy is the power of the sun and the stars and has been the \nsubject of a decades-long research effort in the United States and \naround the world. The bad news is that the ultimate goal of practical \nfusion energy here on earth has proven to be far more difficult than \nthe early pioneers of fusion research ever envisioned. But the good \nnews is that there has been fantastic progress in the past decade, to \nthe point where now there is almost no doubt that large excess amounts \nof fusion energy can be created in the laboratory. The question is: Can \nfusion energy be made practical and affordable?\n  When proven practical, fusion will be capable of producing huge \namounts of base-load energy for our cities and our economy with no air \nor water pollution. Its fuel is virtually inexhaustible. It cannot blow \nup or melt down. Perhaps most tantalizingly, given our present \ncircumstances, no nation or region will have a monopoly because \neveryone will have the fuel--a common component of water.\n  I am very proud today to stand with my good friend from California, \nSenator Feinstein and introduce the Fusion Development Act of 2003. The \nFusion Development Act of 2003 is meant to hasten the day when we can \nanswer the question of practical and affordable fusion energy in the \naffirmative.\n  Last month, President Bush announced that the United States would be \njoining international negotiations on a major next step experiment on \nthe road to fusion energy, known as the ITER project. One of the \nprimary purposes of this bill is to authorize the Secretary of Energy \nto participate fully in this international magnetic fusion burning \nplasma experiment called ITER.\n  ITER is intended to establish once and for all that magnetically-\ncontrolled fusion energy reactions can produce power plant-sized \namounts of fusion energy and establish the scientific basis for doing \nso. Further, ITER will demonstrate some of the technologies necessary \nto construct a fusion power plant such as large superconducting magnets \nand plasma control systems. ITER will be an international science \nexperiment of a scale and importance second to none.\n  The siting and financing of ITER are currently being negotiated \nbetween Europe, Japan, Russia, Canada and China. This bill will help \ngive the Administration the license it needs to move forward and stake \nout a good place at the table of the ITER experiment. The importance of \nthe ITER experiment dictates that the United States must have a strong \nposition as the project moves forward.\n  In addition, our bill sets as a goal that the United States should \ndevelop the scientific, engineering and commercial infrastructure \nnecessary to be competitive with other nations in this new frontier of \nenergy. In this regard, it requires the Secretary of Energy to submit \nto Congress a plan to strengthen our existing fusion research efforts \nand to address the critically important issues of fusion materials and \ntechnology.\n  I ask that my colleagues devote their time to the extraordinarily \nimportant subject of our present and future energy supply. The deeper \none delves into this subject, the more self-evident it becomes that \nfusion is a must-have technology for the future.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help bring us closer to the \ntime when energy is less of a global political issue and energy \nproduction has minimal impact on our natural environment. Fusion is an \nimportant part of this vision and this goal. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3550-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3550-S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 79--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 9 THROUGH MARCH 15, \n                 2003, AS ``NATIONAL GIRL SCOUT WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \nClinton, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Warner, Mr. Allen, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Inhofe, and \nMr. Lugar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 79\n\n       Whereas March 12, is the anniversary of the founding of the \n     Girl Scouts of the United States of America;\n       Whereas by fostering in girls and young women the qualities \n     on which the strength of the United States depends, the Girls \n     Scouts has significantly contributed to the advancement of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts is the preeminent organization for \n     girls, dedicated to inspiring girls and young women to become \n     model citizens in their communities with the highest ideals \n     of character, conduct, and service to others;\n       Whereas the Girls Scouts, through its prestigious program, \n     offers girls ages 5 through 17 a wealth of opportunities to \n     develop strong values and skills that serve girls well into \n     adulthood; and\n       Whereas on March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts became the first \n     national organization for girls to be granted a Federal \n     charter by Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of March 9 through March 15, 2003, \n     as ``National Girl Scout Week''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     designating such week as ``National Girl Scout Week'' and \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the United States of \n     America with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important \nresolution recognizing the Girl Scouts of America.\n  On March 12, 1912, Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls in \nSavannah, Georgia for the first Girl Scout meeting. Girl Scouts of \nAmerica has a current membership of nearly four million girls and adult \nvolunteers.\n  It is the preeminent organization in the United States committed to \ninspiring girls and young women with the highest ideals of character, \nconduct, and service to others.\n  As the first National organization for girls to be granted a Federal \ncharter by Congress, Girl Scouts offers girls of all ages, races, and \nsocioeconomic backgrounds the opportunity to grow, develop friendships, \nand gain valuable life experiences.\n  The Girl Scout initiatives has enabled more than 50 million women in \nthe United States to participate in community service projects, \ncultural exchanges, athletic events, and educational activities that \nteach self-confidence, responsibility, and integrity.\n  Girl Scout initiatives have reflected the Nation's changing social \nand economic climate. For example, the National organization recently \nbegan a campaign to encourage girls to develop an interest in math, \nscience, and technology as a way to create greater diversity in the \nworkforce and to help bridge the techno-gender divide.\n  Today, one in nine girls is a member of the Girl Scouts, and over \ntwo-thirds of our female doctors, lawyers, educators, and community \nleaders were once Girl Scouts. I am proud to say that I, too, was a \nGirl Scout.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues in introducing this \nlegislation, which would designate the week beginning March 9, 2003, as \n``National Girl Scout Week.''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am very proud to join Senator \nHutchison\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\nin submitting this Resolution to designate March 9 through March 15 as \nNational Girl Scout Week. As former girl Scouts, we are so grateful for \nwhat Scouting has meant in our lives--and in the lives of millions of \ngirls.\n  Girl Scouts put their values into action. As a Girl Scout, you \nparticipate in a broad range of activities--from taking nature hikes to \ntaking in the arts. You serve in local food banks and learn about \npolitics. As your skills grow as a Girl Scout, so does your self-\nconfidence. The badges you earn serve as symbols for success, \nleadership, accomplishment, and service in your community. With help \nfrom the Girl Scouts, you can develop into a solid citizen in mind, \nbody and spirit.\n  As a Girl Scout, you also learn values and attitudes that serve as \ngood guides throughout life. You learn the importance of treating other \npeople fairly and with the dignity they deserve. You develop the \nconfidence to know that you can reach your goals. You learn to be a \nleader.\n  In today's hectic and uncertain world, Scouts are more important than \never. Young girls and boys need before and after school activities that \nare safe, educational, and fun. They need adult role models like the \ngirl Scouts, who are dedicated to helping young people. They need to \nlearn the high ideals of leadership, service, character, and good \nconduct. In sum, America needs the Girl Scouts to help us maintain a \ncivil society.\n  I applaud the Girl Scouts for what you do to help girls and to help \ncommunities. I thank you for what you meant to me and what you do for \nmillions of young women across the country. I hope the Resolution that \nSenator Hutchison  and myself have introduced here today raises more \npublic awareness of the good works that you do.\n  Congratulations to the Girl Scouts on your 91st anniversary. I am so \nproud of who you are and what you do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/11/senate-section/article/S3551-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 80--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A COLLECTION OF THE \n                 RULES OF THE COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Equity in Prescription \n     Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, or one half of all \n     pregnancies, in this country are unintended;\n       (2) contraceptive services are part of basic health care, \n     allowing families to both adequately space desired \n     pregnancies and avoid unintended pregnancy;\n       (3) studies show that contraceptives are cost effective: \n     for every $1 of public funds invested in family planning, $4 \n     to $14 of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-\n     related costs;\n       (4) by reducing rates of unintended pregnancy, \n     contraceptives help reduce the need for abortion;\n       (5) unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant \n     mortality, low-birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and \n     threaten the economic viability of families;\n       (6) the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \n     determined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 \n     percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used \n     contraception'';\n       (7) most women in the United States, including three-\n     quarters of women of childbearing age, rely on some form of \n     private insurance (through their own employer, a family \n     member's employer, or the individual market) to defray their \n     medical expenses;\n       (8) the vast majority of private insurers cover \n     prescription drugs, but many exclude coverage for \n     prescription contraceptives;\n       (9) private insurance provides extremely limited coverage \n     of contraceptives: half of traditional indemnity plans and \n     preferred provider organizations, 20 percent of point-of-\n     service networks, and 7 percent of health maintenance \n     organizations cover no contraceptive methods other than \n     sterilization;\n       (10) women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than \n     men on out-of-pocket health care costs, with contraceptives \n     and reproductive health care services accounting for much of \n     the difference;\n       (11) the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance \n     places many effective forms of contraceptives beyond the \n     financial reach of many women, leading to unintended \n     pregnancies;\n       (12) the Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended \n     Pregnancy recommended that\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\n     ``financial barriers to contraception be reduced by \n     increasing the proportion of all health insurance policies \n     that cover contraceptive services and supplies'';\n       (13) in 1998, Congress agreed to provide contraceptive \n     coverage to the 2,000,000 women of reproductive age who are \n     participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program, the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan \n     in the world; and\n       (14) eight in 10 privately insured adults support \n     contraceptive coverage.\n\n     SEC. __03.
