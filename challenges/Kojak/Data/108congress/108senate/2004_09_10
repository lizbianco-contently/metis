Mr. President, this morning we in the Senate honor the \nmemory of the victims of the September 11 attacks. Tomorrow, all \nAmericans will take time from the regular course of their weekend to do \nthe same--to reflect in their own personal way on the terrible events \nof 3 years ago.\n  The essence of the tragedy of September 11, 2001, remains self-\nevident: The victims were innocent. They were simply going about their \ndaily lives, working at their desks, answering emergency calls, \ntraveling on business or vacation.\n  All had families who loved them and still love them to this day. I \nthink of Brenda Vandever of Farragut, TN. She lost her brother, Tony \nKarnes, in the attack on the World Trade Center Towers. Brenda recently \nsaid:\n\n       I got over the car crash that my other brother died in, and \n     I dealt with it when my mom and dad died. But Tony went to \n     work that day thinking just like we do, that nothing is going \n     to happen. You just don't get over that.\n\n  We all feel a profound sadness for those who lost loved ones on that \nfateful day. There is little we can say or do to fill the immense void \nin their hearts. But we can hope and we can pray that one day the \nwounds of those who still hurt may heal.\n  September 11 impressed upon us that life is a precious gift. Every \nlife has a purpose. And I think we all have a duty to devote at least a \nsmall portion of our daily lives to ensuring that neither America nor \nthe world ever forgets September 11.\n  Something that Karyn and I did was to take our three boys, our three \nsons, to New York City to visit Ground Zero soon after the attacks. We \nwanted to sear in their minds a lasting and vivid memory of the worst \nthat evil can do in the world but at the same time the best that we can \ndo in America.\n  Our Nation will, of course, always remember the courage of the \nemergency workers who rushed to Ground Zero on that fateful day; who \nrushed to help in Shanksville, PA; who rushed to the Pentagon just a \nmile from here. These heroes risked their lives, and many lost their \nlives, so that others may live--or at the very least their families \ncould live--in peace.\n  Within 24 hours of when terrorists crashed flight 77 into the \nPentagon, 76 members of the Tennessee Task Force 1 were on the scene \nand were hard at work. They were dispatched to rescue but soon \ndiscovered that their work would be recovery.\n\n[[Page S9048]]\n\n  Ken Reeves, a Memphis Fire Department battalion chief, recalled:\n\n       I think everybody in the country was of the mindset, ``Just \n     let me have something to do,'' and we had something to do.\n\n  Well, they sure did. Tennessee Task Force 1 toiled 16 hours a day for \n9 straight days. They slept on cots in a warehouse not too far from \nhere, without air-conditioning. They often lost track of time, devoting \nevery second of the day, every ounce of energy and attention, to a task \nthat was as difficult and as gruesome as it was grueling.\n  September 11, 2001, drastically altered the future course of our \nNation. It also profoundly changed our individual lives. We will \nforever be touched by the outpouring of compassion, the outpouring of \ncharity, and the kindness of millions of our citizens and people all \naround the world.\n\n  Brenda Vandever said of what she hopes for this and future \nanniversaries: ``I just don't want [Tony] to be forgotten.''\n  To Brenda and to all of the families who lost their loved ones on \nthat morning of September 11, 2001, I say this morning: Your loved ones \nwill not be forgotten. We will remember them, we will honor them, and \nwe will cherish them on this day, every year, for as long as God wills \nthis Nation to endure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9048-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Tomorrow, in New York, at the Pentagon, in Shanksville, \nPA, and in communities all across our Nation, Americans will pause to \nremember the horror and the extraordinary heroism of September 11. \nCommemoration ceremonies will be held in firehouses, VFW halls, parks, \nchurches, synagogues, mosques, libraries, and countless other places.\n  Surely one of the most poignant remembrance events is an exhibit that \nis being held through Sunday at a small art gallery in New York City, \nnot far from where the twin towers once stood. It is an exhibit of \nartwork by children who lost family members--mostly parents--when the \ntowers came crashing down.\n  We all lost so much, so quickly, on that terrible day. But few lost \nmore than the children of September 11. Three thousand children lost a \nparent in the terrorist attacks on America. Nearly two dozen of those \nchildren never met their fathers; they were born after September 11.\n  Many thousands more children lost someone close to them: a \ngrandparent, a brother or sister, an aunt or uncle.\n  Over the last 3 years, 400 of the children of September 11 have \nsought comfort, strength, and answers in therapy programs offered by \nthe WorldTrade Center Family Center at South Nassau Communities \nHospital on Long Island. The exhibit this weekend showcases art these \nchildren have created during their therapy sessions.\n  With the permission of the children and their families, I would like \nto show you some of their work.\n  This was painted by a 9-year-old son of a New York City firefighter \nwho died in the collapse of the towers. This is a baseball diamond. In \nthe outfield are two huge crosses. The little boy who painted this \npicture said it is a picture of the moment he first realized how much \nhe missed his dad. He had just hit a home run; he was rounding the \nbases and looked up to search for his father's face in the stands.\n  Angels are a recurring image in the children's art. This angel looks \nlike the Statue of Liberty. She is delivering a message to heaven.\n  A month after the attacks, the children were asked to try to imagine \nhow they might feel about their loss over time. This series of \npaintings is a collective effort by about 40 of the children of \nSeptember 11 to answer that question. It is called ``Seasons of \nGrief.'' It shows four trees. The trees start out separate and alone. \nBy the last panel, they are leaning toward each other, almost as if \nthey are helping to hold each other up.\n  Even in the depths of unspeakable grief, the children of September 11 \nunderstood instinctively that there are sorrows we cannot bear alone, \nbut there is nothing we cannot get through together. That is a lesson \nwe all understood--immediately and instinctively--on that terrible day.\n  Three years later, what we remember about September 11 is not only \nthe shock, and horror, and grief. We also remember the stunning heroism \nof the firefighters climbing the stairs--the passengers and crew \nmembers of Flight 93 defying their hijackers and the rescue workers \ntoiling day and night.\n  We remember, too, how differently, and clearly, we seemed to see \nthings after the attacks. We saw beyond the old labels. We were not \nblack, white, red, brown, yellow, rich or poor, Republicans or \nDemocrats. We were one people, indivisible--broken-hearted but not \nbroken apart. Our recognition of our common bonds was our comfort, and \nour strength.\n  Three years later, we remember the great kindness and generosity with \nwhich people treated each other--even total strangers, even thousands \nof miles from the attack sites.\n  Don and Adele Hight own a family ranch in Murdo, SD. On September 11, \nthey had already struggled through 2 years of drought. They sold 100 \ncalves and donated the proceeds--more than $40,000--to help victims of \nthe attacks. The manager of the local Livestock Association called \ntheir donation ``an act of kindness, generosity and true Americanism.''\n  The Smith Equipment Company in Watertown, SD, makes heavy duty \ntorches. In the days after the attacks, their cutting supplies were in \nhigh demand. So 175 employees at Smith Equipment volunteered to work \naround the clock to produce tons of equipment and rush it to Ground \nZero.\n  A week after the Twin Towers fell, two men from Sioux Falls loaded up \na pickup truck with $20,000 worth of donated steel-toed boots, tube \nsocks, and work gloves, drove to New York, distributed the protective \ngear to rescue workers at Ground Zero, and then got back in their truck \nand drove straight home.\n  All across South Dakota, school children, Scout troops, church \norganizations, employees and customers of small businesses, and \ncountless others donated money for victims relief funds. At least one \ncouple donated their tax-refund checks. People stood in line to donate \nblood. Some enlisted, or re-enlisted, in the military. People \nsacrificed. And they prayed for those who died, and the families they \nleft, for the surviving victims, the rescue workers, and for our \nwounded nation.\n  Part of the sadness many of use feel as we approach this third \nanniversary of September 11 has to do with how divided our Nation \nsometimes feels now.\n  We cannot reclaim those we lost on September 11. But we can reclaim \nthe sense of unity and generosity that their sacrifice inspired in us. \nIt is still there. It is still within us.\n  The families of September 11 have endorsed a project called ``One \nDay's Pay.'' It encourages people to observe the anniversary of \nSeptember 11 by donating one day's pay, or one day's labor, to a \ncommunity organization--to channel our sadness and anger for \nconstructive purposes.\n  Those of us who have the privilege of serving our Nation in elected \noffices have another job to do as well. We can--and we must--work \ntogether, in good faith, to make America safer--without sacrificing the \nfreedoms that make America great. We do not have the luxury of delay.\n  The terrorists who attacked us struck at the symbols of our financial \nand military might because they thought those symbols were America's \ngreatest strengths. They were wrong. The real measure of America's \ngreatness is not in glass and steel. It is in our people. It is in our \nshared commitment to freedom and democracy--and to each other. As the \nchildren of September 11 understood instinctively, we need each other.\n  Wherever we find ourselves tomorrow morning, let us remember not only \nthe horror of September 11, but also the unity and the kindness we \nwitnessed that day. And let us vow to honor those we lost by keeping \nthe spirit of September 11 alive in our hearts. If we do, then, in a \nreal way, those we lost will live on forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9049]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9048-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9048-S9049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

So 175 employees at Smith Equipment volunteered to work \naround the clock to produce tons of equipment and rush it to Ground \nZero.\n  A week after the Twin Towers fell, two men from Sioux Falls loaded up \na pickup truck with $20,000 worth of donated steel-toed boots, tube \nsocks, and work gloves, drove to New York, distributed the protective \ngear to rescue workers at Ground Zero, and then got back in their truck \nand drove straight home.\n  All across South Dakota, school children, Scout troops, church \norganizations, employees and customers of small businesses, and \ncountless others donated money for victims relief funds. At least one \ncouple donated their tax-refund checks. People stood in line to donate \nblood. Some enlisted, or re-enlisted, in the military. People \nsacrificed. And they prayed for those who died, and the families they \nleft, for the surviving victims, the rescue workers, and for our \nwounded nation.\n  Part of the sadness many of use feel as we approach this third \nanniversary of September 11 has to do with how divided our Nation \nsometimes feels now.\n  We cannot reclaim those we lost on September 11. But we can reclaim \nthe sense of unity and generosity that their sacrifice inspired in us. \nIt is still there. It is still within us.\n  The families of September 11 have endorsed a project called ``One \nDay's Pay.'' It encourages people to observe the anniversary of \nSeptember 11 by donating one day's pay, or one day's labor, to a \ncommunity organization--to channel our sadness and anger for \nconstructive purposes.\n  Those of us who have the privilege of serving our Nation in elected \noffices have another job to do as well. We can--and we must--work \ntogether, in good faith, to make America safer--without sacrificing the \nfreedoms that make America great. We do not have the luxury of delay.\n  The terrorists who attacked us struck at the symbols of our financial \nand military might because they thought those symbols were America's \ngreatest strengths. They were wrong. The real measure of America's \ngreatness is not in glass and steel. It is in our people. It is in our \nshared commitment to freedom and democracy--and to each other. As the \nchildren of September 11 understood instinctively, we need each other.\n  Wherever we find ourselves tomorrow morning, let us remember not only \nthe horror of September 11, but also the unity and the kindness we \nwitnessed that day. And let us vow to honor those we lost by keeping \nthe spirit of September 11 alive in our hearts. If we do, then, in a \nreal way, those we lost will live on forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9049]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9049-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we will resume consideration of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill directly. As I indicated last \nnight, the chairman and ranking member have made substantial progress \non the bill. We will continue that progress over the course of today. \nAs we announced yesterday, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. We do expect amendments to be offered. That will begin \nshortly--during consideration of the bill this morning. I understand we \nhave some cleared amendments that we may dispose of shortly. I will \ndefer to the chairman for an update. We can begin that process shortly.\n  Any votes that may be ordered on the pending amendments will be \nordered to occur on Monday. Senators should expect more than one \nrollcall vote during Monday's session. We will say more about the \ntiming of these votes before we close later today.\n  Again, our goal is to complete this bill on Tuesday or early \nWednesday morning. This will require the cooperation of all Senators as \nwe move toward completion of this important legislation. We have made \nreal progress and we will continue to make real progress over the \ncourse of the day.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I reiterate what the majority leader has \njust announced and articulated. We have made progress. I appreciate the \ncooperation we are getting on both sides. We have gotten to the point \nwhere there is absolutely no reason why we cannot finish this bill \nprior to the time we adjourn for Rosh Hashanah next week.\n  We will continue to work as we have this week to winnow down the \namendments, to have time limits on what amendments need to be offered, \nand we will work with the majority leader to ensure we can reach that \ngoal. I am confident we can and we will continue to work at it \nthroughout the day and on Monday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thank you. I think the progress has been \nmade, and I will also state while the Democratic leader is here, we are \nmaking real progress on intelligence reform, both recommendations in \nterms of the relationship with the executive branch as well as internal \norganization and reorganization and potential reform there.\n  A lot of people do not see that much is going on, but we are working \nthroughout the day, each and every day, on what we both have mentioned \nthis morning is very important business that we need to act on before \nwe complete the session.\n  At this juncture I think we will turn to the chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9049-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9049-S9063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4567, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4567) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2005, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson of Florida amendment No. 3607, to provide funds for \n     the American Red Cross.\n       Schumer amendment No. 3615, to appropriate $100,000,000 to \n     establish an identification and tracking system for HAZMAT \n     trucks and a background check system for commercial driver \n     licenses.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 6 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no objection as long as Senator \nDurbin is recognized for a like amount of time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for up to 6 minutes and the \nSenator from Illinois is recognized for up to 6 minutes.\n\n\n                       On the Anniversary of 9/11\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the chairman for the time and the leadership.\n  I simply wish to join our leaders today in remembrance of the tragic \nevents of September 11. As I remember those events, I remember more how \nclearly our country pulled together in response. September 11 is one of \nour worst days but it brought out the best in us. It unified us as a \ncountry and showed our charitable instincts and reminded us of what we \nstood for and stand for. It showed that we had the resolve to fight \nagainst terrorism. We put partisanship aside in our Government offices. \nWe began to proudly say to the rest of the world, we know what it means \nto be an American.\n  The best way we can remember September 11 is to remember why this is \nan exceptional country. We are the only country in the world that has \ntaken people from so many different backgrounds, which is a great \nachievement by itself, but an even greater achievement is that we have \nturned all of that variety and diversity into unity. That unity depends \nupon a few principles in which we believe: liberty, equal opportunity, \nindividualism.\n  President Bush has eloquently spoken of the American character since \nSeptember 11. But we in the Senate have a role to play, too. That is \nwhy, with the support of many other Senators on both sides of the \naisle, I have been working hard to harness that spirit to help us \nremember for generations to come what it means to be an American. That \nmeans teaching it to our children and to those who become new citizens \nof our country.\n  One of the great tragedies of education in this country today is that \nhigh school seniors perform worse in American history than in any other \nsubject for which they are nationally tested. That is not right. The \nassistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid, and I proposed legislation \nlast year which passed the Senate without a dissenting vote to create \nsummer academies for outstanding students and teachers in U.S. history. \nThe House still needs to act on this bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and I have introduced \nlegislation that would allow our Nation's report card to test eighth \ngraders and high school seniors on U.S. history, on a pilot State-by-\nState basis. This will help us know where it is being taught well and \nwhere it is not so improvements can be made. Shining the spotlight on \nthese results also encourages school districts to work harder to teach \nAmerican history and civics as well.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and I have introduced \nlegislation to preserve the oath of allegiance in its present form, so \nthat oath--to which all new citizens swear on naturalization--is given \nthe same respect as we give to the Pledge of Allegiance, to the \nnational anthem, and to the American flag.\n  While that legislation is pending in committee, with the support of \nthe chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, the Senate unanimously \npassed yesterday an amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill to prevent the oath from being changed during the next fiscal year \nwhile the Senate works its will on the legislation proposed by the \nSenator from New York and me.\n  I am also working on a second amendment to that legislation to \nestablish a new foundation that will work with the Office of \nCitizenship to promote the teaching of English, history, and civics to \nthe soon-to-be new citizens of our country and to other new citizens. \nWe are a nation of immigrants. We are proud of that. We should do our \nbest to help those who are new to our country become thriving members \nof our society so they can learn our history, learn about citizenship, \nspeak our common language. That will help them on the path to the \nAmerican dream.\n  The Senate has been hard at work over the last 2 years to help \nenshrine the values and history that bind us together as Americans. \nNothing could be more important as we remember September 11, as we \nmourn those we lost, but take pride in what was found, our national \nunity. The best way to remember September 11 is to remember what it \nmeans to be an American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Illinois may \nspeak for up to 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\n                          America Has Changed\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week we mark two significant dates. \nTomorrow, September 11, the third anniversary of our attack which will \ntruly live in infamy as the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a moment when \nwe reflect on what has happened to America since that time.\n  A member of the diplomatic corps once asked me: Did Osama bin Laden \nwin that battle? The answer, clearly, is no. But did he change America? \nThe answer, clearly, is yes.\n  We are debating in the Senate a bill for billions of dollars to be \nspent in defense of America, which we might not have even considered 3 \nyears ago. Now it is reality.\n  In a few moments I will leave to go to National Airport. Before I \nboard my flight back to Illinois, I will take off my shoes and my belt \nand my watch and I will hold my arms out to be ``wanded,'' to make \ncertain that I am safe enough to go on the airplane. America has truly \nchanged.\n  But our values have not changed. Ted Sorensen may be one of the \ngreatest speech writers in the history of our Nation. On May 21 he \ndelivered a commencement address at the New School University of New \nYork where a friend and former colleague, Bob Kerry, is president.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Sorensen's commencement address be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCommencement Address of Theodore C. Sorensen Upon Receiving an Honorary \n            Doctor of Laws Degree From New School University\n\n                             A Time to Weep\n\n       As a Nebraska emigre, I am proud to be made an Honorary \n     Doctor of Laws by another Nebraska emigre, President Kerrey . \n     . . at an institution founded by still another, Alvin \n     Johnson.\n       Considering the unhealthy state of our laws today, they \n     probably could use another doctor.\n       My reciprocal obligation is to make a speech.\n       This is not a speech. Two weeks ago I set aside the speech \n     I prepared. This is a cry from the heart, a lamentation for \n     the loss of this country's goodness and therefore its \n     greatness.\n       Future historians studying the decline and fall of America \n     will mark this as the time the tide began to turn--toward a \n     mean-spirited mediocrity in place of a noble beacon.\n       For me the final blow was American guards laughing over the \n     naked, helpless bodies of abused prisoners in Iraq. ``There \n     is a time to laugh,'' the Bible tells us, ``and a time to \n     weep.'' Today I weep for the country I love, the country I \n     proudly served, the country to which my four grandparents \n     sailed over a century ago with hopes for a new land of peace \n     and freedom. I cannot remain silent when that country is in \n     the deepest trouble of my lifetime.\n       I am not talking only about the prison abuse scandal--that \n     stench will someday subside. Nor am I referring only to the \n     Iraq war--that too will pass--nor to any one political leader \n     or party. This is no time for politics as usual, in which no \n     one responsible admits responsibility, no one genuinely \n     apologizes, no one resigns and everyone else is blamed.\n       The damage done to this country by its own misconduct in \n     the last few months and years, to its very heart and soul, is \n     far greater and longer lasting than any damage that any \n     terrorist could possibly inflict upon us.\n       The stain on our credibility, our reputation for decency \n     and integrity, will not quickly wash away.\n       Last week, a family friend of an accused American guard in \n     Iraq recited the atrocities inflicted by our enemies on \n     Americans, and asked: ``Must we be held to a different \n     standard?'' My answer is YES. Not only because others expect \n     it. WE must hold ourselves to a different standard. Not only \n     because God demands it, but because it serves our security.\n       Our greatest strength has long been not merely our military \n     might but our moral authority. Our surest protection against \n     assault from abroad has been not all our guards, gates and \n     guns or even our two oceans, but our essential goodness as a \n     people. Our richest asset has been not our material wealth \n     but our values.\n       We were world leaders once--helping found the United \n     Nations, the Marshall Plan, NATO, and programs like Food for \n     Peace, international human rights and international \n     environmental standards. The world admired not only the \n     bravery of our Marine Corps but also the idealism of our \n     Peace Corps.\n       Our word was as good as our gold. At the start of the Cuban \n     Missile Crisis, former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, \n     President Kennedy's special envoy to brief French President \n     de Gaulle, offered to document our case by having the actual \n     pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba brought in. \n     ``No,'' shrugged the usually difficult de Gaulle: ``The word \n     of the President of the United States is good enough for \n     me.''\n       Eight months later, President Kennedy could say at American \n     University: ``The world knows that America will never start a \n     war. This generation of Americans has had enough of war and \n     hate . . . we want to build a world of peace where the weak \n     are secure and the strong are just.''\n       Our founding fathers believed this country could be a \n     beacon of light to the world, a model of democratic and \n     humanitarian progress. We were. We prevailed in the Cold War \n     because we inspired millions struggling for freedom in far \n     corners of the Soviet empire. I have been in countries where \n     children and avenues were named for Lincoln, Jefferson, \n     Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. We were respected, \n     not reviled, because we respected man's aspirations for peace \n     and justice. This was the country to which foreign leaders \n     sent not only their goods to be sold but their sons and \n     daughters to be educated. In the 1930s, when Jewish and other \n     scholars were driven out of Europe, their preferred \n     destination--even for those on the far left--was not the \n     Communist citadel in Moscow but the New School here in New \n     York.\n       What has happened to our country? We have been in wars \n     before, without resorting to sexual humiliation as torture, \n     without blocking the Red Cross, without insulting and \n     deceiving our allies and the U.N., without betraying our \n     traditional values, without imitating our adversaries, \n     without blackening our name around the world.\n       Last year when asked on short notice to speak to a European \n     audience, and inquiring what topic I should address, the \n     Chairman said: ``Tell us about the good America, the America \n     when Kennedy was in the White House.'' ``It is still a good \n     America,'' I replied. ``The American people still believe in \n     peace, human rights and justice; they are still a generous, \n     fair-minded, open-minded people.''\n       Today some political figures argue that merely to report, \n     much less to protest, the crimes against humanity committed \n     by a few of our own inadequately trained forces in the fog of \n     war, is to aid the enemy or excuse its atrocities. But \n     Americans know that such self-censorship does not enhance our \n     security. Attempts to justify or defend our illegal acts as \n     nothing more than pranks or no worse than the crimes of our \n     enemies, only further muddies our moral image. 30 years ago, \n     America's war in Vietnam became a hopeless military quagmire; \n     today our war in Iraq has become a senseless moral swamp.\n       No military victory can endure unless the victor occupies \n     the high moral ground. Surely America, the land of the free, \n     could not lose the high moral ground invading Iraq, a country \n     ruled by terror, torture and tyranny--but we did.\n       Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein--politically, \n     economically, diplomatically, much as we succeeded in \n     isolating Khadafy, Marcos, Mobutu and a host of other \n     dictators over the years, we have isolated ourselves. We are \n     increasingly alone in a dangerous world in which millions who \n     once respected us now hate us.\n       Not only Muslims. Every international survey shows our \n     global standing at an all-time low. Even our transatlantic \n     alliance has not yet recovered from its worst crisis in \n     history. Our friends in Western Europe were willing to accept \n     Uncle Sam as class president, but not as class bully, once he \n     forgot JFK's advice that ``Civility is not a sign of \n     weakness.''\n       All this is rationalized as part of the war on terror. But \n     abusing prisoners in Iraq, denying detainees their legal \n     rights in Guantanamo, even American citizens, misleading the \n     world at large about Saddam's ready stockpiles of mass \n     destruction and involvement with al Qaeda at 9/11, did not \n     advance by one millimeter our efforts to end the threat of \n     another terrorist attack upon us. On the contrary, our \n     conduct invites and incites new attacks and new recruits to \n     attack us.\n       The decline in our reputation adds to the decline in our \n     security. We keep losing old friends and making new enemies--\n     not a formula for success. We have not yet rounded up Osama \n     bin Laden or most of the al Qaeda and Taliban leaders or the \n     anthrax mailer. ``The world is large,'' wrote John Boyle \n     O'Reilly, in one of President Kennedy's favorite poems, \n     ``when its weary leagues two loving hearts divide, but the \n     world is small when your enemy is loose on the other side.'' \n     Today our enemies are still loose on the other side of the \n     world, and we are still vulnerable to attack.\n       True, we have not lost either war we chose or lost too much \n     of our wealth. But we have lost something worse--our good \n     name for truth and justice. To paraphrase Shakespeare: ``He \n     who steals our nation's purse, steals trash. 'Twas ours, 'tis \n     his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches our \n     good name . . . makes us poor indeed.''\n       No American wants us to lose a war. Among our enemies are \n     those who, if they could, would fundamentally change our way \n     of life, restricting our freedom of religion by exalting one \n     faith over others, ignoring international law and the \n     opinions of mankind; and trampling on the rights of those who \n     are different, deprived or disliked. To the extent that our \n     nation voluntarily trods those same paths in the name of \n     security, the terrorists win and we are the losers.\n       We are no longer the world's leaders on matters of \n     international law and peace. After we stopped listening to \n     others, they\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n     stopped listening to us. A nation without credibility and \n     moral authority cannot lead, because no one will follow.\n       Paradoxically, the charges against us in the court of world \n     opinion are contradictory. We are deemed by many to be \n     dangerously aggressive, a threat to world peace. You may \n     regard that as ridiculously unwarranted, no matter how often \n     international surveys show that attitude to be spreading. But \n     remember the old axiom: ``No matter how good you feel, if \n     four friends tell you you're drunk, you better lie down.''\n       Yet we are also charged not so much with intervention as \n     indifference--indifference toward the suffering of millions \n     of our fellow inhabitants of this planet who do not enjoy the \n     freedom, the opportunity, the health and wealth and security \n     that we enjoy; indifference to the countless deaths of \n     children and other civilians in unnecessary wars, countless \n     because we usually do not bother to count them; indifference \n     to the centuries of humiliation endured previously in silence \n     by the Arab and Islamic worlds.\n       The good news, to relieve all this gloom, is that a \n     democracy is inherently self-correcting. Here, the people are \n     sovereign. Inept political leaders can be replaced. Foolish \n     policies can be changed. Disastrous mistakes can be reversed.\n       When, in 1941, the Japanese Air Force was able to inflict \n     widespread death and destruction on our naval and air forces \n     in Hawaii because they were not on alert, those military \n     officials most responsible for ignoring advance intelligence \n     were summarily dismissed.\n       When, in the late 1940s, we faced a global Cold War against \n     another system of ideological fanatics certain that their \n     authoritarian values would eventually rule the world, we \n     prevailed in time. We prevailed because we exercised patience \n     as well as vigilance, self-restraint as well as self-defense, \n     and reached out to moderates and modernists, to democrats and \n     dissidents, within that closed system. We can do that again. \n     We can reach out to moderates and modernists in Islam, proud \n     of its long traditions of dialogue, learning, charity and \n     peace.\n       Some among us scoff that the war on Jihadist terror is a \n     war between civilization and chaos. But they forget that \n     there were Islamic universities and observatories long before \n     we had railroads.\n       So do not despair. In this country, the people are \n     sovereign. If we can but tear the blindfold of self-deception \n     from our eyes and loosen the gag of self-denial from our \n     voices, we can restore our country to greatness. In \n     particular, you--the Class of 2004--have the wisdom and \n     energy to do it. Start soon.\n       In the words of the ancient Hebrews:\n\n       The day is short, and the work is great, and the laborers \n     are sluggish, but the reward is much, and the Master is \n     urgent.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Mr. Sorensen said at one point in his \nspeech something we should reflect on as we think about September 11. \nHe said of America:\n\n       Our greatest strength has long been not merely our military \n     might but our moral authority. Our surest protection against \n     assault from abroad has been not all our guards, gates and \n     guns or even our two oceans, but our essential goodness as a \n     people. Our richest asset has been not our material wealth \n     but our values.\n       We were world leaders once--helping found the United \n     Nations, the Marshall Plan, NATO, and programs like Food for \n     Peace, international human rights and international \n     environmental standards. The world admired not only the \n     bravery of our Marine Corps but also the idealism of our \n     Peace Corps.\n\n  Mr. Sorensen's words are a reminder that if we are to win this war \nagainst those who wish us ill, those terrorists and those who use \nterrorism as a tactic, we need not only a strong national defense, we \nneed strong homeland security, but we also need to project the values \nof America in a positive way, not just with the forming of troops in \nformation but also with the forming of values in countries desperate to \nhave a future that emulates the freedoms of the United States.\n\n\n                     The Sacrifice of Our Soldiers\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the second noteworthy event this week was, \nof course, the acknowledgement that we have lost over 1,000 soldiers in \nIraq. It has touched my State of Illinois. Some 50 people from my State \nhave been killed in the war in Iraq, hundreds seriously wounded.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Chicago Tribune \ndated September 9, 2004, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 9, 2004]\n\n    Downstate Town Stung by Deaths; 2 Soldiers Dead, 15 Hurt in Iraq\n\n                (By Deborah Horan and H. Gregory Meyer)\n\n       Paris, IL.--The worst attack yet on Illinois Army National \n     Guardsmen serving in Iraq left two soldiers dead and 15 \n     wounded, and it left the Downstate town where their unit is \n     based stung by the news and fearful for the safety of \n     survivors.\n       Mortar rounds pounded the 1544th Transportation Company \n     southwest of Baghdad late Sunday afternoon, killing Sgt. \n     Shawna Morrison, 26, of Paris and Spec. Charles Lamb, 23, of \n     Martinsville, said Lt. Col. Alicia Tate-Nadeau, a Guard \n     spokeswoman. Three of the 15 wounded were seriously injured, \n     she said.\n       In Paris a radio station has put patriotic songs on heavy \n     rotation while locals drive cars tied with yellow ribbons \n     saying ``Pray for our troops.'' Morrison was the unit's first \n     female fatality, and the first soldier from Paris to die in \n     Iraq.\n       ``This is the first one to hit our community,'' said Jim \n     Cooper, the father of a 20-year-old guardsman who is \n     stationed at the base that came under attack. ``It has really \n     brought this home. It opens up a lot of people's eyes. They \n     say, `Hey, I know so-and-so. He may be next.' ''\n       The deaths brought the unit's total fatalities to four as \n     the nation's total military deaths in Iraq since last year's \n     invasion edged past 1,000.\n       The 1544th, headquartered in a brick armory in this town of \n     9,000, contains about 260 soldiers from four states, Tate-\n     Nadeau said.\n       Shirley Furry had posted a message under the price board \n     outside her Citgo station in Paris reading ``In memory of \n     Shawna.'' The young woman worked there several years ago, \n     Furry said. Morrison's mother called Furry Sunday night.\n       ``I said, `Oh, no,' '' Furry recalled. ``She said, `Yeah, \n     she's gone.' ''\n       Morrison attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-\n     Champaign and worked two jobs, one as a waitress and the \n     other as a bartender, to put herself through school.\n       ``She's always been very independent,'' said her father, \n     Rick Morrison. ``She never asked us for a dime from day one \n     when she moved out.''\n       Morrison was called up in November, sent to Kuwait in \n     December and arrived in Iraq by February where she worked in \n     communications, her father said. And while she was nervous \n     before the deployment, she was most worried about rumors of \n     spiders the size of paper plates that could jump 6 feet.\n       ``We spent many hours looking for spider spray,'' her \n     father said. ``And she never saw one.''\n       Sgt. Scott Johnson, a member of the 1544th who was wounded \n     in Iraq in May, said Morrison and Lamb had contrasting \n     notions of comfort on base. ``Shawna, she was really looking \n     to settle in. She rounded up a couple of the nicer mattresses \n     to make sure she slept well at night,'' he said. ``Charles, \n     he would rough it. He was kind of an outdoorsman. He didn't \n     mind getting dirty.''\n       Lamb, who grew up in a rural area near Martinsville, about \n     25 miles southwest of Paris, was a ``farm boy,'' said Mark \n     Harris, his agriculture education teacher at Casey-Westfield \n     High School, where he graduated in 1999.\n       A live wire as a student, Lamb was active in the FFA, \n     formerly known as Future Farmers of America, and trained for \n     forestry, livestock and dairy competitions. A trip to Kansas \n     City for an FFA convention was a big deal to him.\n       ``I think one of the reasons he signed up for the service \n     was to help other people out, make a better life and see the \n     country,'' Harris said.\n       Before he was called up for active duty, he had worked as a \n     mechanic in Martinsville and had recently married, said a \n     former employer.\n       ``He was planning on coming back,'' said a shop co-owner, \n     Shirley Goodwin. In Iraq he also worked as a mechanic.\n       Cooper leads a support group for families of soldiers from \n     the 1544th. He said that when attacks take place, he's the \n     one who calls families whose sons and daughters weren't hurt.\n       ``I can tell them they're OK, but I can't give them any \n     guarantees,'' he said. ``The unit is still running out there. \n     It makes it scary.''\n       His son is also based at Logistical Base Seitz, the camp \n     outside Baghdad where Morrison and Lamb were killed, but he \n     was uninjured in Sunday's mortar shelling.\n       ``Everybody's upset,'' he added. ``It is hard to walk into \n     a store without somebody recognizing me and saying, `How's \n     your son?' ''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this article speaks of one National Guard \nunit, the 1544th Transportation Company from Paris, IL. This unit of \nthe Illinois National Guard has sustained almost half of the deaths and \nmore than half of the injuries that our National Guard in Illinois has \nsustained, and just this last week two soldiers were killed and 15 \nwounded after another attack in Iraq.\n  It is a grim reminder that we are in a situation in Iraq with no end \nin sight. With 140,000 of our best and bravest in the field offering \ntheir lives every day for America, the fact that we would invade this \nnation of Iraq without a plan to deal with its reconstruction and \npacification is the strongest condemnation of any government, and yet \nthat is where we are today.\n  This morning it was reported on the news that if there is an election \nin Iraq--and I pray there will be--some\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nsections of that country will not even be able to vote because they are \nunder the control of terrorists and guerrillas. That is an indication \nof how far we still have to travel before the day arrives when our \ntroops can come safely home from Iraq, realizing that in reality their \nmission has been accomplished.\n  As we reflect on 9/11, we reflect on our values. As we reflect on the \nheroes of America and think of those on 9/11, remember, too, the \nthousands still serving our Nation overseas from towns such as Paris, \nIL, and many just like them who offer their lives every day in defense \nof the values of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I assume we are now on the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the leadership for \nmaking available time in the schedule for the handling of this bill and \ngiving us a chance to consider amendments that are proposed by other \nSenators to the bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. It is important to note that yesterday's action and the \naction of the full committee so far have set the tone for the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  First of all, to remind Senators, the bill contains funding at a \nlevel of $33.1 billion. Mr. President, $32 billion is for discretionary \nspending; the remainder is for mandatory programs or the allocation of \nfunds that are collected under other provisions of law. This represents \nan almost 10-percent increase in funding for the next fiscal year as \ncompared with the funding that is appropriated for this fiscal year, \n2004.\n  The fiscal year begins on October 1, as everyone knows. Substantial \nincreases are included in this legislation for the activities of the \nCoast Guard as well as the Transportation Security Administration. The \nbill fully funds the President's requested activity for Project \nBioShield, which is a very important new endeavor to further enhance \nthe security of our country against bioterrorism. The bill also \nprovides funding for a new program that is designed to enhance security \nfor our country by using new technologies to identify and verify \nvisitors coming into the country using visas. This program is called \nUnited States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology. Of \ncourse, it has its own acronym, US VISIT, so it is easy for us to \nremember.\n  One other feature of this year's appropriations bill is the \nlimitation that we are provided as a result of a provision included in \nthe defense appropriations conference report that limits, in effect, \nthe discretionary spending of all appropriations bills for fiscal year \n2005. The limitation is at a level of $821.9 billion. That is enforced \nthrough a mechanism of the Budget Act which permits points of order to \nbe made on amendments that would seek to increase the bill's funding \nbeyond the level of its allocation, which was established by the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  We are pleased that the Senate has recognized the validity of that \nlimitation. Yesterday we were able to exercise that point of order \nsuccessfully to defeat amendments that would have increased spending \nbeyond that allocated level of funding. We are at the limit of the \nallocation that is available to our subcommittee. The $32 billion in \ndiscretionary funding is the limitation that is provided to the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Today we are pleased to consider any other amendments Senators may \nwish to offer. We are ready to debate and dispose of amendments. We can \nagree to some, I hope, and we are happy to work with Senators \nthroughout the remainder of this session. We are happy the leader has \nindicated that any votes that may be ordered will go over to next week. \nThere will not be any recorded votes on this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now on the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3578\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Baucus, I send an \namendment to the desk. It is amendment No. 3578. I think it is already \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Baucus, for \n     himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n     Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 3578.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make available to the Under Secretary for Border and \nTransportation Security $200,000,000 to establish and operate air bases \n    in the States of Michigan, Montana, New York, North Dakota, and \n   Washington and to permit fees for certain customs services to be \n                     collected until June 1, 2005)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 515. (a) The total amount appropriated by title II for \n     the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and \n     Transportation Security under the heading ``air and marine \n     interdiction, operations, maintenance, and procurement'' is \n     hereby increased by $200,000,000. Of such total amount, as so \n     increased, $200,000,000 shall be available for the \n     establishment and operation of air bases in the States of \n     Michigan, Montana, New York, North Dakota, and Washington.\n       (b) Section 13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)) is amended \n     by striking ``March 1, 2005'' and inserting ``June 1, 2005''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is quite an important amendment for \nour Nation's security. I think it will help strengthen a key component \nof our national security strategy. We all know our Nation's security \nbegins here at home, by securing our land borders, our airspace, and \nalso our maritime ports. As we work to get the latest explosive \nscreening technology in our airports, or to inspect more containers \narriving in our Nation's ports, we should not forget the critical role \nof our vast northern border.\n  Contrary to what some people may think, out on the northern border we \nare no strangers to illegal crossings. The topography in my State of \nMontana makes it very difficult to protect our border. Customs and \nBorder Patrol are doing a great job with the resources they have, but \nImmigration and Customs enforcement investigators are just a little bit \nundermanned. They share valuable information they collect on illegal \nentries with numerous agencies.\n  But when it comes to tracking and intercepting unauthorized aircraft, \nour military planes fly much too high and too fast to provide proper \nservice along our northern border. As we beef up our security on other \nborders, especially in the South and on the coasts, the northern border \nhas become the Nation's backdoor that we cannot afford to leave \nunlocked.\n  While I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security has just \nestablished the first of five planned airbases along the northern \nborder that Congress authorized nearly 2 years ago, I am also quite \nconcerned. Why? Because the pace is so slow in standing up these bases. \nOne of the sites the Department of Homeland Security has chosen is in \nGreat Falls, MT. Between Malmstrom Air Force Base, the Air Force \nNational Guard at Great Falls International Airport, and the community \nthat supports these assets, we are ready to take on this new mission. \nWe are ready. We are set. We are happy. We are glad. We want to do it. \nThe mission is to help secure the northern border, not just for our \nState of Montana but for all Americans.\n  However, we are told we will have to wait. We will have to wait for \nmore than 3 years to get the planned airbase up and running in Great \nFalls. With all due respect, I do not think as a nation we can wait. We \ncannot afford to wait.\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\n  There are too many problems with the current funding schedule for the \nnorthern border air wing. First, the schedule is stretched out over far \ntoo long a period of several years. Once the first base in Bellingham, \nWA, is really up and running, what is going to happen? It is pretty \nobvious. Drug runners and other would-be terrorists and malcontents \nwill simply move eastward toward Montana's northern border, and still \nfurther east over other parts of our northern border.\n  Under the current funding schedule, they are going to enjoy a full 3 \nyears of exploiting the gaps in our Air Wing coverage before all five \nbases along the northern border--that is, the States of Washington, \nMontana, North Dakota, Michigan, and New York--have been established.\n  There is a second problem. What is that? It is that the budget allows \njust enough money to buy each base its requisite planes: two \nhelicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft. But once each base opens its \ndoors, it won't even be able to operate 5 days a week for 8 hours a \nday. The dollars just are not there for the operation. So I say, when \nit comes to securing our Nation, obviously, this is not good enough. We \nhave to get up and running right away.\n\n  Two months ago, when a plane deviated from its course over \nWashington, DC--we all remember it--the Air and Marine Operations \nCommand and Control at March Air Force Base in Riverside, CA, was \nwatching--way out in California. Local aircraft were dispatched, and \nthe Capitol complex was emptied. Luckily, it was just the Governor of \nKentucky. I should not say ``just.'' It was the eminent Governor of \nKentucky. But the system worked because a local plane was available and \nstaffed to respond. The folks in Riverside are responsible for \ndetecting unauthorized aircraft flying at low altitudes anywhere in the \nUnited States, but so far they have just one plane, staffed barely 40 \nhours a week, in Washington State, to dispatch if they get a hit \nanywhere on the 3,000-plus-mile-long northern border.\n  So let's be clear. Congress has already authorized the establishment \nof a northern border air wing with five airbases that will be \nresponsible for tracking, identifying, and intercepting any \nunauthorized aircraft that attempts to cross the northern border into \nU.S. airspace. But if we are going to take securing the northern border \nseriously, then we must take funding seriously. So my amendment makes \nsure the funding is there to get all five airbases operational 7 days a \nweek this next year.\n  I thank very much the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, \nand thank Senator Byrd, and many others, for helping to work to get \nthis crucial amendment in order so it will be adopted and, more \nimportantly, to make America safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Montana for his \namendment and Senator Frist and Senator Cochran for their cooperation \nin working on this amendment. This amendment provides $170 million for \nfour homeland security programs, in addition to the $200 million \nprovided for security on the Northern border.\n  First, $50 million is included for the fire grant program. With this \namendment, the total in the bill for equipping and training fire \npersonnel is $750 million, an increase of $4 million over fiscal year \n2004. Last year, the Department received over $2.6 billion of \napplications from 20,366 applicants. Clearly, there is a real need for \nthis additional funding.\n  Second, the amendment provides $50 million for the Federal air \nmarshals program. Last year, despite the continuing terrorist threat to \nour airlines and despite the fact that the number of flights grew by 6 \npercent last year, the number of Federal air marshals fell by 9 \npercent. This amendment will reverse that trend and allow the \nDepartment to move toward the staffing goal that was established after \n9/11.\n  Third, $50 million is provided for grants to nonprofit organizations, \nto help secure their at-risk facilities. Numerous reports from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the FBI indicate that al-Qaida has \nturned its focus to so-called soft targets such as hospitals, \nuniversities and houses of worship.\n  Finally, the amendment provides $20 million for the Emergency \nManagement Performance Grants program. This valuable program provides \nresources to States to prepare for all types of emergencies. The \nprogram's all-hazards planning approach ensures that States prepare, \nnot just for terrorist attacks, but also for hurricanes, floods, \nearthquakes and other types of disasters.\n  Again, I thank the Senators for their cooperation and I urge adoption \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3616 to Amendment No. 3578\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Specter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Voinovich, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \n     Murray, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3616 \n     to amendment No. 3578.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 2, line 5 insert:\n       ``(b) The total amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS'' \n     is hereby increased by $50,000,000. Of such total amount, as \n     so increased, $50,000,000 is for the continued operations of \n     the Federal Air Marshals program.\n       ``(c) The total amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``OFFICE OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COORDINATION AND \n     PREPAREDNESS, STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS'' is hereby increased \n     by $50,000,000. Of such total amount, as so increased, \n     $50,000,000 is for discretionary assistance to non-profit \n     organizations (as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986) determined by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to be at high-risk of international \n     terrorist attacks.\n       ``(d) The total amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``OFFICE OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COORDINATION AND \n     PREPAREDNESS, FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS'' is hereby \n     increased by $50,000,000. Of such total amount, as so \n     increased, $50,000,000 is for the program authorized by \n     section 33 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of \n     1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229).\n       ``(e) The total amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``OFFICE OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COORDINATION AND \n     PREPAREDNESS, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE GRANTS'' is \n     hereby increased by $20,000,000. Of such total amount, as so \n     increased, $20,000,000 is for emergency management \n     performance grants.''.\n       On page 2, line 5 strike ``(b)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is an amendment worked out in a \nbipartisan manner with the chairman and the ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee. I thank Senators Cochran, Byrd, and Baucus for \ntheir cooperation. This is an amendment that is cosponsored by Senators \nByrd, Cochran, Specter, Murkowski, Voinovich, DeWine, Burns, Clinton, \nMikulski, and Murray. It is a very simple amendment but an important \namendment to provide a small amount of additional resources for some \ncritical areas in our war against terrorism here at home.\n  The Baucus amendment extends custom user fees that will expire next \nMarch. He extends the fee for 3 months. This extension increases the \noffsetting receipts in the Federal budget by $370 million during that \nperiod of time. Senator Baucus uses these additional resources to \nincrease funds for a northern border protection program. Senator Burns \nis also a cosponsor of that amendment. However, the Baucus-Burns \namendment allocates $200 million of resources for this activity, \nleaving approximately $170 million in additional resources to fund \nother homeland security programs.\n  Working with Senators on both sides of the aisle, Senator Byrd and I \nhave crafted a second-degree amendment that further targets this \nadditional $170 million in funds as follows: An additional $50 million \nfor firefighters--Senator Murkowski and other Senators have been \nsupporters of finding additional funds for our dedicated firefighters; \nan additional $50 million for Federal air marshals; $50 million for \n501(c) nonprofit organizations that the Secretary of Homeland Security \ndetermines to be at risk of terrorist attacks--I, along with Senators \nSpecter,\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nByrd, and Mikulski, have focused on the need to provide assistance to \nthese soft targets as churches, synagogues, mosques, and various \nnongovernmental organizations that can fall prey to terrorists are at \nrisk--and an additional $20 million to emergency management performance \ngrants. This is a program strongly supported on both sides of the \naisle--on our side, championed by Senator Voinovich--to meet the needs \nof our State and local governments.\n  I believe the amendment has been cleared on both sides. I appreciate \nonce again the cooperation of all involved in finding a way to provide \nadditional resources to this important bill without violating the \nBudget Act or adding to the Federal deficit. Again, these amendments \nhave been worked out on both sides of the aisle, and I urge their \nadoption.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \namendment which I have been working on since the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security marked up the bill in July which would provide much-\nneeded resources to address the security needs of high-risk nonprofits. \nI am pleased that we have worked out a compromise where this language \nwill be included as part of Senator Baucus's amendment on custom user \nfees. This language will appropriate $50 million for a program at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, to provide security enhancements \nand training to nonprofit organizations determined to be at high risk \nof international terrorist attacks. Funds would be distributed by DHS \nbased on risk assessments, in consultation with State and local \nauthorities.\n  The $50 million figure is firm, and there is no doubt that there will \nbe a need for more than $50 million. This is a start. This is a start \non the protection of 501(c)(3)s, and the discretion of the Secretary of \nHomeland Security is limited to establishing the priority for the use \nof the $50 million. The assistance is intended for basic security \nenhancements to protect American citizens from car bombs and other \nlethal terrorist attacks. It is intended to be used for installation of \nequipment such as concrete barriers, blast-proof doors, mylar window \ncoatings, and hardened parking lot gates, as well as associated \ntraining.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that al-Qaida has \nturned its attention to ``soft targets.'' Al-Qaida's willingness to \nattack soft targets of all types has been made readily apparent with \nattacks in the United States, England, Canada, Spain, Germany, Iraq, \nTunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey, including an international Red \nCross building, synagogues, train stations, hotels, airports, \nrestaurants, night clubs, and cultural and community centers.\n  Many of these soft targets are nonprofit organizations which provide \nvital health, social, community, educational, and other services to \nmillions of Americans every day. If nonprofit organizations are forced \nto divert funds to cover the entire cost of security measures, those \nfunds will deplete resources for vital human services, including \ncapacity to respond to disasters.\n  I have been encourage to support this language by a wide cross \nsection of America's nonprofits. Supporters of this measure include: \nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; American \nJewish Committee; American Jewish Congress; American Red Cross; \nAmerican Society of Association Executives; Association of Art Museum \nDirectors; Association of Jewish Aging Services of North America; \nIndependent Sector, National Assembly of Health and Human Service \nOrganizations; National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities; Theater Communications Group; Union of Orthodox Jewish \nCongregations; United Jewish Communities, representing 155 Jewish \nFederations; United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism; United Way of \nAmerica; and YMCA of the USA.\n  The assistance would be delivered pursuant to pending authorizing \nlegislation which Senator Mikulski and I have introduced as S. 2275 \nwhich was ordered reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \nthank the chairman and other Senators involved in moving this important \namendment forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this effort \nthrough the conference committee and to the President's desk.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to support and cosponsor \nSenator Frist's second-degree amendment to provide much-needed funding \nfor homeland security. This amendment provides increased funding in \nthree vital areas, Federal air marshals, fire grants and emergency \nmanagement grants, and for the first time, it would give assistance to \nnonprofit institutions that are at high risk of terrorist attack.\n  Insuring that the brave men and women who are our first responders \nhave the resources they need is one of my highest priorities. We must \ndo our best to protect the protectors and they protect us everyday. \nThese are the people who risk their lives to keep us safe. The bill \nbefore us today actually cuts funding and the step we take today to \nincrease funding by $50 million for the fire grant program is a step in \nthe right direction. But it is a first step.\n  Our Nation's firefighters need more resources. They need to replace \naging fire engines and rescue vehicles, and they need self-contained \nbreathing masks. Additional money for the Fire Grant Program is not \njust about new equipment--it is about saving lives. It is about making \nsure that our firefighters and rescue workers are well prepared, \nwhether it is a terrorist attack or a hurricane. These brave men and \nwomen will be the first on the scene and we need to make sure that they \nhave the tools they need to protect against threats to American lives.\n  It is my hope that as we proceed with this bill in the coming days, \nwe will be able to add additional funding to provide the resources that \nfire departments across the Nation so desperately need. That is why I \napplaud my colleagues for taking this first step--the next step is to \nensure that we include additional funding to bring this model program \nup to the full funding level of $900 million. On Monday, I will offer \nan amendment to take that final step and make sure that our \nfirefighters have all the resources that they need. I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me then as we have all joined Senator Frist today, \nin supporting those much needed increases in fire grant funding.\n  This amendment also takes a great first step in helping nonprofit \norganizations who are at risk for terrorist attack. As the majority \nleader knows, I have worked closely with my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter on legislation to create a program to \nhelp nonprofits who serve communities throughout the Nation but who are \nthreatened daily by the risk terrorist attack. Today, I am proud to \nprovide funding to make our communities stronger and safer by \nprotecting these ``soft targets'' of terrorism all over the United \nStates.\n  We are all aware of recent terrorist attacks in the United States, \nSpain, Germany, Iraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey. These \nattacks by al-Qaida on an international Red Cross building, synagogues, \ntrain stations, hotels, airports, restaurants, night clubs, and \ncultural centers, show its willingness to attack ``soft targets'' of \nall types in order to conduct its campaign of terror.\n\n  I want to make sure that our communities are safe and the buildings \nwhere citizens live, learn, and work are strong and secure to safeguard \nAmerican lives in the vent of a terrorist attack. Local communities are \non the front lines in our war against terrorism. This Congress must do \nits share to make sure that they do not have to bear the full cost of \nthis war. We can do that by helping to provide funds for security \nenhancements in buildings that Americans visit everyday.\n  In this amendment we simply provide an additional $50 million to \nenhance the security and safety of high-risk nonprofits. This funding \nwill jumpstart the effort to make security improvements to these ``soft \ntargets'' of terrorism. These nonprofits are worried now, they are \nunder threat now, and then need our help now. This Congress must act \nnow to make these nonprofits and the communities that they serve safer \nand stronger.\n  As a Nation, our priority in fighting the war on terror is to be \nsafer, stronger, and smarter so that we are able to better detect, \nprevent and respond to acts of terrorism. This bill gets us one step \ncloser to meeting those goals by making vulnerable targets smarter in \ndetecting and preventing terrorist attacks and by making sure that if \nterror strikes one of these facilities, security\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\nand safety measures are in place to protect the lives of those inside \nand around these buildings.\n  Nothing the Senate does is more important than providing America \nsecurity and Americans safety. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment because it does exactly that. In the battle to protect our \nNation from terrorist attacks, we must be sure to provide assistance to \nfirst responders and to these high-risk nonprofit organizations that \nprovide vital health, social, cultural, and educational services to the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3616.\n  The amendment (No. 3616) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3578, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3578, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3578) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier this morning, Chairman Cochran \noffered on my behalf a bipartisan amendment that was adopted. Combined \nwith the second degree bipartisan amendment I offered to Senator \nBaucus's amendment, we have provided almost $700 million in additional \nfunds in this bill to enhance programs for our domestic security.\n  We did this without increasing the Federal deficit, because the \nincreased spending was offset with the extension until September 2005 \nan expiring custom user fee. That extension raised nearly $700 million.\n  Let me be the first to acknowledge that this offset is included in \nother legislation that is in various conferences such as the FSC bill \nand the highway bill. But until legislation is enacted to truly extend \nthis provision, it remains a real offset.\n  Final legislation will sort out the use of this offset before it \nbecomes law.\n  The amendment I offered and cosponsored by Senator Cochran, Byrd and \nVoinovich provided increased resources for critical areas of homeland \nsecurity:\n  An additional $120 million for Customs and Border Protection, \nSalaries and Expenses. Some of these funds will be used to provide for \nradiation detection devices, additional border inspectors and border \npatrol agents;\n  an additional $80 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \nprovide additional investigation personnel and additional detention \nfacilities;\n  an additional $81 million for rail and transit security grants;\n  and an additional $36 million for State and Local Governments' \nemergency management performance grants.\n  Again I thank all of my colleagues who worked on this amendment and \nappreciate the cooperation of Senator Byrd in finding a responsible \napproach to increased homeland security funding while not adding to the \nFederal deficit this next year.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, although I will be speaking on \nintelligence matters and other matters relating to the CR, I ask \nunanimous consent that my statement not be considered a violation of \nthe Pastore rule and I be able to speak on general matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Problems with a Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, a lot of people are talking about a \ncontinuing resolution for appropriations this year. This is not a \nnormal year. This is the end of Congress. This Congress goes out of \nbeing. We will come back next year and have to deal with new bills. I \nwant to talk a little bit about the problem of a continuing resolution \nfor a series of bills.\n  For instance, my State had over 5 million acres of timberland burned \nthis year. Forest fires were just enormous. We have provided in the \nInterior bill moneys for hazardous fuels reduction to try to reduce the \nfires, really, on some of the wildlands of the United States. If we had \nthat money we could probably prevent what we call follow-on fires. \nWhere lightning fires strike, the next year they strike almost in the \nsame place. The next year they strike almost in the same place. But as \nthey do in years following a fire, they are hitting timber that has \nbeen dried out, burned, dried out, and it is just like kindling. It \njust causes the whole area to burn more and then more and then more. \nThe way to stop that is to do the hazardous fire reduction program, go \ninto the area that burned and take that timber out--try to plant new \ntrees, but at least do something to prevent a follow-on fire the \nfollowing year. If the Interior bill doesn't pass, there will not be \nthat money available.\n  We have additional money for the Indian Health Service this year. We \nhave had substantial problems in health areas in the Indian community. \nThat money wouldn't be available under a CR.\n  Many people don't know what a CR is. It is a continuing resolution \nwhich continues the moneys that were appropriated in 2003 to be spent \nin 2004; now that same amount of money is going to be spent in 2005. \nJudgments of 2003 of what should be happening in 2004 are not valid in \n2005. We need each of these bills this year more than we ever have \nbefore.\n  Take, for instance, the hurricanes that just happened. We have in the \nbudget request what is called the beach renourishment policy. It is a \none-time funded program to try to replace some of these beaches that \nhave been lost in the hurricane season. There are approximately 43 \nprojects already outlined that have to be funded this year in order to \nundertake this new concept. It is sort of like the fires concept. If we \nmove in and repair these beaches now, a subsequent follow-on hurricane \nwill not aggravate the damage and leave even further destruction in the \narea. Again, unless we get the Energy and Water bill, it will not be \ndone. There will be no dredging of the low-use waterway and harbors \nthat have had extensive damage. These hurricanes change the bottom of \nthe sea in the areas adjacent to the shore of where the hurricanes come \nashore. We need new money to deal with that. The only way to get it is \nto get an Energy and Water appropriations bill passed.\n\n  If you look at the Department of Energy, we have a whole series of \nitems requested by the President and approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee on energy and water. The budget this year requests $1.16 \nbillion more than was enacted for this fiscal year of 2004. A \ncontinuing resolution will carry the figures for 2004 forward as long \nas the continuing resolution continues until Congress passes a bill \nnext year.\n  But meanwhile, the money that is needed for security and the \nsafeguard problems of our national weapons labs, the President asked \nfor $706 million to make those laboratories more safe and more secure.\n  He asked for $6.9 billion in energy environmental management \nactivities. That is an increase over 2004. This is expected to have a \nspecific effect on the environmental cleanup activities in Tennessee, \nWashington, Idaho, and South Carolina.\n  In terms of energy supply, we have money this year for energy \nresearch, including renewable resources such as hydrogen, solar, wind, \nand biomass. The President's request this year is $835 million, a 13-\npercent increase over 2004.\n  I will come back later. I don't want to monopolize the time. I keep \nreminding the Senate that we cannot operate under a CR for 2005. It is \nnot possible.\n  Take the Department of Agriculture: The 2005 bill is not passed and \nthe medical device user fee authority expires at the end of this fiscal \nyear because we did not provide the required level of funding \nauthority. This bill takes care of that. If the bill does not pass, \nthere won't be funding to maintain the participation rates for the WIC \nProgram.\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\nThe budget request is underestimated by over $300 million. That would \nbe required to continue the program in 2005. That would not be \navailable under 2004 money.\n  This Homeland Security bill is an example. If it does not pass, the \ncounterterrorism food safety money for FDA will not be available.\n  There are a whole series of things. I am sure the chairman, my \ndistinguished friend from Mississippi, has described that in more \ndetail.\n  But the real problem with our thinking about a continuing resolution \nis money would not be available to other Departments to meet emergency \nsituations--some caused by natural events such as hurricanes and fires \nand others caused by changes in the security requirements of the \ndepartments of the Government which have security requirements. They \nare conducting their business differently now after the Department of \nHomeland Security examined how they handled buildings and security of \nemployees. Each one of them now has a mandate to change the way they do \nbusiness. We have provided the money for those new directions in the \n2005 bills. That money for the security of the Federal buildings will \nnot be available under the 2004 program without substantial \nreprogramming, which couldn't be done until well into next year.\n  I am trying to make the case for the Members of the Senate to think \nabout getting all of these bills done this year. Don't think about a \ncontinuing resolution. A continuing resolution will not work for the \nappropriations process this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside for purposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3617\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3617.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that the Coast Guard has sufficient resources for \n                     its traditional core missions)\n\n       On page 14, line 2, strike ``$5,153,220,000, of which \n     $1,090,000,000 shall be for defense-related activities;'' and \n     insert ``5,253,220,000 of which $1,090,000,000 shall be for \n     defense-related activities; and of which, $100,000,000 shall \n     be for non-homeland security missions defined by Sec. \n     888(a)(1) of Public Law 107-296.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment calls for $100 million for \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. Senator Lautenberg at a subsequent time will come \nand debate this matter. It is my understanding that the leadership \nwishes to have this as one of the votes that would occur on Monday \nevening.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3618\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, this question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3618) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it \nappropriate now in morning business for the Senator from New Mexico to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                             Demand for Oil\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to share some highlights from \nthis week's news about oil and its effect on our economy. Yesterday's \nWashington Post quoted Dr. Alan Greenspan's testimony before the House \nBudget Committee.\n\n       The economy is doing reasonably well. If it weren't for the \n     oil spike, I would be very optimistic where the economy is \n     going.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan said the spring surge in energy prices weakened \nthe economy more than analysts expected. He suggested that uncertainty \nabout oil prices continues to cloud the economic outlook.\n  Financial analysts have also lowered the forecast expectations for \nour American economy growth over the next year. For example, an \neconomist with Global Insight said:\n\n       Persistent high prices of oil remain a shadow over the \n     recovery.\n\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\n\n  On Wednesday, the President of OPEC stated that high oil prices would \nundermine the economies of the United States and Europe by 2 percent. \nThese high prices exist primarily because of soaring demand for oil in \ntightly stretched markets.\n  In its weekly report, the Energy Information Administration reported \nthat spare capacity to pump more oil is near the lowest in decades. EIA \nsaid global oil production is running around 99 percent of estimated \ncapacity. Just yesterday, the EIA stated in its short-time market \noutlook that it expected oil prices to average $40 until mid-2005 \ndespite OPEC efforts to increase oil production. Low surplus capacity \nis obviously with us. Similarly, the Paris-based International Energy \nAgency acknowledged the same. Given the limited spare capacity, some \npeople are worried about whether there will be sufficient oil to meet \ndemand. We all know what that will do if it continues.\n  Yesterday in the Wall Street Journal there was an article entitled, \n``Demand for Oil Could Outstrip Supply.'' In the article, the \nWashington-based oil-forecasting group, PFC Energy, warned that the \nenergy industry may be without the capacity to produce sufficient oil \nto meet the needs. In their study, the PFC maintains the world will not \nbe able to produce more than 100 million barrels a day, only 20 percent \nmore than the current global supply of 82 million barrels a day.\n  Oil analysts who believe we are running out of oil or that we have \npeaked are still in the minority, but the numbers are getting more and \nmore ominous. We should heed these warnings.\n  PFC concluded that the limits of global oil production will mean the \ndemand for oil will have to be curbed and alternative sources of energy \nwill have to be found.\n  Herman Franssen, the President of PFC and a former chief economist \nfor the International Energy Agency, said the PFC's conclusion tells \npolicymakers that they have a decade to put our house in order. For \ninstance, it takes that long to retool the car industry to use another \nfuel. We must begin working on that, and we are. Well, we do not have a \ndecade to put our house in order. We cannot afford to wait until the \nhouse crashes in around us taking our economy, our energy security, and \nour future well-being down with it.\n\n  We need to act now before this session of Congress ends. We must show \nthe American people that our economy and our energy security matter, \nthat they are important.\n  We must show the American people we are willing to take steps to \nlessen our oil dependency by producing alternative sources of fuel that \nsends a signal to the world we are going to have more natural gas \nbecause we take steps, with far more renewables, that we are going to \nclean up coal so we can use it. Yes, we may even provide some \nincentives so we might produce, nuclear powerplants to add to this fast \npace. We need to correct the shortcomings of our electricity supply so \nwe do not have any blackouts anymore.\n  Well, guess where these things and more are found. They are not \nrunning around in the sky. They are not here in the rhetoric. They are \nin a bill. They are in an energy bill. We produced it and we lost it by \ntwo votes. Those who said they did not like it on the Democrat side \nsaid it was because of an additive clause regarding MTBE. It is a \nGovernment-approved additive. There was something in the bill that said \nwe are going to protect those who manufacture it because they are not \nto blame for what happens downstream. However, we were led to believe \nthat was enough to kill the bill. We took it out.\n  Madam President, up there at the desk, ready to be called up, ready \nto become our energy policy--because the House will accept it with some \nmodification of MTBE that will not be the hold-harmless provision, but \nyet we do not get anything from the other side that indicates they \nwould let us have a bill, they would let us pass a bill.\n  I think the American people--because we have not called the bill up \nand let them kill it like they did one time, two times--are wondering. \nBut I do not want them to wonder anymore. We have a very good energy \nbill. We have it ready to get passed. If the question is, Why haven't \nyou done it, it is not on this side. It is not on this chairman who \nworked 18 months to get a bill, with a lot of help from all sides, and \nultimately the House. It is the Democrats who will not let us get this \nbill, plain and simple.\n  If anybody on that side in a position of authority--the leader on \nthat side, Senator Bingaman on that side--would say, well, we need an \nenergy bill, we are part of the problem in America, we want to solve \nit--if they just say that, Americans, we would have a bill in 24 hours. \nI urge that we try to do that.\n  I am very concerned we are short of oil, but we are not sending any \nsignals that we are going to have a major policy shift that will permit \nus to have alternatives and not become dependent on the world for \nnatural gas. Can you imagine that with the chief new energy source--\nnatural gas--we are moving in the direction, without this energy bill, \nwhere soon we will say: What happened? We are in the same muddle on \nnatural gas as oil. We will become dependent on foreign countries.\n  Pretty soon we will say, well, we use natural gas to fuel our \npowerplants because it is clean. We are using it in our homes and \nbusinesses because it is great. But what do you think about that? We \nare dependent on foreign countries again.\n  We are leaving offshore natural gas, which can be drilled for, we are \nleaving it there because we need to change some rules or they cannot do \nit. We are leaving natural gas in Alaska that can be used--not the \nargument over crude oil in the wilderness area; that should be done for \nAmerica, but that is not the issue in this bill. In this bill it is \nnatural gas, in large quantities, delivered to Chicago for dispersion \nin America. Why don't we do that? Well, we cannot do it if we cannot \npass a bill.\n  So I do not need the whole 10 minutes. Perhaps I made my point. I \nhope so. I have been here twice this week. I guarantee you, if we do \nnot make some movement soon, some people on the other side are going to \nget tired of seeing me down here, but I will be here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment addresses one of the \nmost serious security threats facing our Nation: the threat of a \nterrorist attack on\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\na chemical facility. As in my State, the great State of North Carolina \nhas had some accidents with regard to chemical plants recently, and \nmany people believe it is one of the greatest vulnerabilities in our \ninfrastructure.\n  I have discussed this issue many times, as it is vital to my State, \nwhich has a heavy concentration of chemical plant facilities. There are \nthousands of these facilities across the Nation that can release and \nexpose tens of thousands of Americans to highly toxic gases--some \nfatal, some leading to great illness. It should not be lost on the \nAmerican public that we will be remembering the 20th anniversary of \nBhopal this year where as many as 7,000 people have ultimately passed \nfrom a chemical plant explosion. It was tragic at the time.\n  There are many other instances, and there is a great risk associated \nwith these plants. The reality is that many of them were built at an \nearlier time in our economy where now there are surrounding densely \npopulated areas. That is why this has been a great concern to people \nwho think about homeland security right in our neighborhoods. It is the \nreason we need to make sure that what could be attractive targets for \nterrorists are properly addressed in the Homeland Security \nappropriations process.\n  Unfortunately, there are currently no Federal standards for chemical \nfacilities. The private sector has been left to do whatever it chooses \ncompletely on a voluntary basis. I believe there are many chemical \nfacilities where people have done a good job. It is in their self-\ninterest to protect their employees, themselves, their proprietary \ninterests, and they have done a good job. But that does not mean that \nall facilities have. Quite frankly, since there are no standards and no \naccountability requirements, we don't know. We are vulnerable, at least \naccording to all of the experts who review homeland security. We are \nputting at risk literally millions of Americans. It is an unacceptable \nrisk, from my standpoint.\n  According to EPA, there are 123 facilities in 24 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 1 million people to highly \ntoxic chemicals. We have a chart showing where about 100,000 Americans \nare at risk. But there are 123, 8 of which are in my State, where 1 \nmillion people could be exposed to toxic chemicals. There are about 750 \nfacilities in 39 States where a chemical release could expose more than \n100,000 people, and there are nearly 3,000 facilities spread across 49 \nStates where a chemical release could expose more than 10,000 people to \ntoxic chemicals.\n  It is a broad problem around the Nation. It is acknowledged. I have \ndiscussed many times this issue in the Senate Chamber, on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It needs to be addressed. I \ndon't think we ought to be discussing this after there is a problem; we \nought to be talking about it and correcting the issue ahead of time. \nThere are no standards. The numbers are pretty staggering.\n  There are others who might define exposure somewhat differently. I \nnoticed recently the Department of Homeland Security, instead of \nlooking at a 360-degree circumference around a chemical plant, has \ntried to talk about the prevailing wind patterns in an area and lower \nthe numbers. But we are still talking about literally millions of \nAmericans being exposed to the possibility of toxic air masses coming \nout of one of these plants. It is time to act. It is not enough to just \nuse words and talk about voluntary standards. Frankly, there is ongoing \nwork in the EPW Committee to come up with a compromise proposal. I am \nsupportive of the idea that we want to move forward.\n\n  This security issue is real and present and needs to be dealt with. \nIn fact, the Department of Justice, a year and a half before September \n11, issued a report on April 16, 2000, about chemical plants. That was \nmentioned in the Hart-Rudman report. In almost every situation that \nsomeone speaks to homeland security, chemical plants show up in the \ndiscussion. But the Justice Department writes in the April 18, 2000, \nreport:\n\n       We have concluded the risk of terrorists attempting in the \n     foreseeable future to cause an industrial chemical release is \n     both real and credible . . . Increasingly, terrorists \n     engineer their attacks to cause mass casualties to the \n     populace and/or large-scale damage to property. Terrorists or \n     other criminals are likely to view the potential of a \n     chemical release from an industrial facility as a relatively \n     attractive means of achieving these goals.\n\n  It couldn't be stated more clearly. And that was before September 11. \nIf we thought there were risks then, we have to believe there are risks \nnow. That report should have awakened us.\n  We have comments after September 11 from people who are importantly \ninvolved in our homeland security efforts. For example, in \ncongressional testimony, Governor Ridge said:\n\n       The fact is, we have a very diversified economy and our \n     enemies look at some of our economic assets as targets. And \n     clearly, the chemical facilities are one of them. We know \n     that there have been reports validated about security \n     deficiencies at dozens and dozens of [plants].\n\n  Let me tell you about some of the reports to which Governor Ridge may \nhave been referring. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review conducted a major \ninvestigation about chemical plant security across the country--\nPennsylvania, Houston, Chicago, New Jersey, elsewhere. They found that \nintruders had unfettered access to some of the Nation's deadliest \nstockpiles of toxins and explosives. Security was so lax that in broad \ndaylight a reporter could easily walk up to tanks, pipes, and control \nrooms. If there is any intellectual integrity in these reports, this is \nabsolute proof that we have inconsistency, at best, with regard to \nimplementation of security requirements or security arrangements at a \nlot of our chemical plants.\n  I am not just relying on press reports. In fact, I have visited \nchemical facilities myself, seen lax security, some in my own State. \nThe fact is, we have to move on this. I visited one plant in New Jersey \nthat had gaping holes in the security fence. Along with a reporter from \nCBS 60 Minutes, I walked right onto a plant. This is one that was a \nmember of the society that is espousing voluntary standards. While it \nwas not all that much fun moving into one of these plants, it was easy \nto have accomplished. Had we been terrorists with just a small \nexplosive device, we could have easily caused a tragic and truly \ncatastrophic release of toxic chemicals.\n  It is uncertain about what the loss of life would be, but it happened \nto be another plant in New Jersey that is located right under a \nfreeway, with no guards or anything to keep somebody from pulling up, \nfaking a flat tire, and tossing a hand grenade over the side wall of an \noverpass into a chemical plant facility. It is actually one of the \nlargest exposures of the various plants in America. And, again, it was \na plant that was a member of the Chemical Society, which talks about \nstandards.\n  This is something which I think we need to recognize, that it is not \nalways the highest common denominator we have to work with. We have to \nworry about the exposures at the lowest common denominator. It is a \nreal threat and problem. We need to address that.\n  Let me add that I have not come down to bash the chemical industry, \nbecause I don't believe this is representative of everyone in the \nindustry. Many are doing everything the standards ask and call for. We \nneed to assure the American people we are doing that everywhere. We \nwould not accept that we have OK security at one nuclear powerplant but \nnot at another. We have standards and accountability applying to those \nsituations because it is a risk to the people in and around those \ncommunities. We demand 100-percent attention to detail. These plants \ncan be as deadly and as negative for the communities they are in as \nanywhere else.\n  We need to make sure everyone is acting in good faith--not only the \ngood actors but everyone. That is why I feel so strongly that we need \nto move the kind of legislation Chairman Inhofe is working on in the \nEPW Committee. We all need to get together and get away from purely \nvoluntary standards and into something that is actually more important \nfor all of us to do in order to make sure all facilities are addressed.\n  That is why, 3 years ago, I first introduced the Chemical Security \nAct. My bill would have required chemical facilities to assess their \nvulnerabilities, establish priorities in the Nation, develop plans to \nimprove security, and use inherently safer technologies. We have had to \nmove away from that to get something done. But I think we still need \nthose plans and we need accountability to make sure the plans\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nare in place. I would like to see us work with safer technologies that \nare available. I think we can help some of the companies transition \nfinancially if that were necessary. But I do think we need to move \nforward.\n  So far, we have not been able to get legislation passed and the \nexposure continues at least with some subset of the facilities around. \nI think it is time for us to move. I thought my approach was common \nsense, fairly simple, and it actually gave a lot of flexibility. It has \nbeen frustrating not to see this legislation dealt with. When it was \nfirst introduced, it got a 22-0 supporting vote in the EPW Committee, \nuntil the process of lobbying and other considerations came into play \nand a lot of folks backed away from it.\n  I am hopeful people will wake up to the reality that there is real \nexposure in our communities. It is time to act. Hot air and lots of \nwords by people doing television shows, ``60 Minutes,'' and writing \nnewspaper articles is not enough. We need to have accountability and \nreal standards to protect the American people. I know I feel that way \nabout our folks in New Jersey, and I am going to feel as if I have not \ndone my job if one of our plants is attacked and people lose lives \nbecause we have not done what we need to do to make sure they are safe. \nThis is a place that recognizes the problem--by the way, every time we \nsend out a Code Orange, we cite plant facilities as one of the areas \nthat needs to be attended to by State and local law enforcement. That \nis where my amendment comes in today. I am not actually talking about \nthis particular bill at this point in time. It actually hasn't come \nthrough another process.\n\n  In this particular amendment, the appropriations bill, I think there \nis the opportunity to make a modest first step by appropriating money \nto support State and local efforts to enhance chemical plant security. \nAs I said, when we raise the code levels, we are asking State and local \nfolks to go out and provide extra security around these plants. By the \nway, you may wonder why the public is doing the work in providing the \nsecurity; but since it is happening, I think we ought to provide \nresources to make that happen.\n  The amendment I am introducing would provide $100 million for that \npurpose. Funds could be used, for example, to strengthen law \nenforcement's presence around chemical plants, prepare officials for \nresponding to a terrorist attack in a chemical facility--a complicated \nissue, not exactly like fighting fire; it is somewhat different. It \nwill provide assistance to plant managers and other steps State and \nlocal officials might take to protect their communities.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. We need to put money and \nresources into this potentially deadly concern in our homeland \nsecurity. Not unlike port and rail security, I think this is an area \nwhere there is general recognition that there is exposure and we need \nto move forward.\n  As I have said, there are literally millions of people who have \nexposure. We have a legacy of these chemical plants being located in \ndensely populated areas, not everywhere. We should prioritize. We ought \nto have a different standard for ammonia plants in South Dakota than \nwhen you are in Carney, NJ, in the midst of 12 million people in the \nmetropolitan area of New Jersey and New York. There is a difference. \nBut we need to make sure we have security plans that people are held \naccountable to, both industry and the local communities. So I am \nhopeful we will be able to positively consider this $100 million first \nstep--a small step--and I will ask for a positive conclusion.\n  Assuming that a point of order is raised against this amendment--I \ndon't see anybody on the floor, but maybe the Chair will do it. It may \nnot happen. I will leave that for another time. I hope we can have a \npositive consideration of this amendment to protect chemical plants.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts rising. I \ncertainly don't want to stand in the way of his accessing the floor. I \nwas going to speak as in morning business on the economy. I intended it \nto be for 10 to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to wait. We look forward to hearing the \nSenator's assessment of the state of our economy today, as one of those \nwho has critical insight and opinions regarding the economy. I know the \nSenate will benefit from his comments.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate that courtesy from the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 15 \nminutes to speak as in morning business with respect to the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, over the summer, I came to the floor \nand gave a series of various discussions on something I care deeply \nabout, at least from my background, and have some reason to have \nopinions about, and that is the state of our economy.\n  It is absolutely vital for all of us in the Senate to try to get \neconomic policies that put people to work and make sure the economy is \ngrowing in a way that everybody shares the benefits of America's \nbounty. I think there is a tremendous responsibility on all of our \nparts to be serious about examining policies that lead to long-term \neconomic growth that can put us in a position where Americans are at \nwork, they have access to health care, and they have access to a very \nconstructive quality of life as we go forward.\n  Quite obviously, I think we can do better. In fact, I am one who \nbelieves the 1990s was one of the greatest periods of economic well-\nbeing our Nation has seen throughout its history. We can go through the \nlitany of 22 million new jobs, incredibly solid productivity growth, \nwent from huge budget deficits to a balanced budget.\n  As one who came from the private sector, I saw incredible \nentrepreneurial energy in the 1990s. It maybe got a little too \nenergetic at the close of the decade, but the fact was that we were \nmoving ahead. Real wages were moving ahead. We were reducing poverty. \nThere were lots of good indicators going on. We were actually beginning \nto edge away a little bit at even the health insurance problem in this \ncountry.\n  Things have changed in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, for lots of reasons. We \nhave suffered a very severe set of economic setbacks, in my view. One \ndoes not have to be a rocket scientist or analyst to understand that we \nhave lost jobs, on balance, over the 3\\1/2\\ years. It may be growing at \nthe moment, but the composite picture is we have lost jobs. We have not \ngained 22\\1/2\\ million; we have lost jobs. We have outsourced a lot of \nour high-quality jobs. We have lost whole industries to the exporting \nof jobs overseas.\n  A lot of our manufacturing jobs--in New Jersey, we are down to one \nauto manufacturing plant that is going to close in another 18 months. \nIt used to be the heart and soul of our business. We had a great \ntextile industry, just like I am sure was the case in North Carolina. \nIt is gone. Many of those jobs have gone overseas. The quality of jobs \nthat have replaced them has often been lacking, certainly, in economic \nwell-being, absolute status of those jobs, and benefits that accompany \nthem.\n  While we have had a recovery of sorts with regard to our stock \nmarket, we are still way off the top of where stock values were in the \n1990s, and certainly for the last year we have been bouncing along. \nThere has been no direction and it is not one that I think anybody \nwould say is a strong economic boon for those who are interested in \nequity values.\n  Maybe more importantly, we have mortgaged our future. We have a \nbudget deficit that exploded. We actually have another deficit, the \ntrade deficit, the current account deficit, which are really long-run \nindicators of the eroding health of our economy. They may not bite us \ntomorrow or a month from now, but one cannot continue to have to borrow \nmore money overseas to finance both personal debt and Federal \nGovernment debt--which is what we are doing right now with the kind of \ncurrent account deficit--without having our dollar erode and the \nunderlying values in America lost over a long period of time. It is \ncoming. It is not whether, it is when.\n  We have a zero savings rate in this country. That is not the way to \nbuild productive capacity as we go forward.\n  There is a huge difference between the 1990s and where we are now. I \nthink, though, when one puts all of this\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\ntogether, maybe the most significant problem facing our country gets \ndown to the human level. It is the issue that is on the minds of \nindividual Americans, and that is the continuing and dreadful squeeze \nthat we see on the middle class.\n  The vast majority of Americans who go to work every day, who drive \nthis economy--two-thirds of our economy is driven by consumer \nexpenditures, and that is the middle class. Those folks are suffering \nright now from what truly is a squeeze. Real income has declined. It is \nnot debatable. It is real. The last 3\\1/2\\ years we have seen real \nincome for the Americans who are in the lower 60 percent or the 60 \npercent from the bottom up diminish even more than the top. But every \nAmerican on average has lost real income in the last 3\\1/2\\ years. They \nhave been forced to pay higher prices that have outstripped income.\n\n  By the way, for the most vital elements of a family's budget, it is \nworse, it really is. Even though the Consumer Price Index might \nregister one way, when one is talking about things that are absolutely \nvital to a family's well-being: health care, access to higher \neducation, college tuition costs, energy prices to fuel the car and \nheat the home and keep the air-conditioner running, or property taxes, \nwe may have cut taxes in Washington, but what is going on at the State \nand local level--in New Jersey, they are up about 10 percent each year \nover the last 3 years cumulative, and we have seen the real cost of \nliving for individuals, apart from these questions of CPI and PPI and \nall the indexes, the things that really bite at an individual, the \nmiddle class family's pocketbook, has gone up.\n  I think there is a real problem. Between 2000 and 2003, family income \nfell by $1,535 or 3 percent. In fact, it has declined every year under \nthe current administration, and the declines have been even steeper for \nthose who are not lucky. I talked about the 60 percent of families, \nbuilding up from the lowest level income in the country, and there it \nhas declined by 4.6 percent. So it is a real deal. This is not \nsomething that can be denied. These are factual numbers. It is \nsomething that we seem to turn our backs on.\n  Contrast that with the record in the 1990s and during President \nClinton's tenure in office. The typical family income increased $7,200 \ncompared to a $1,500 decline. I think that is a pretty decent standard \nto measure whether things are working for middle class Americans and \nfor Americans in general.\n  Let us look at what happened at the cost of living: gasoline prices \nup 19 percent over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, college tuition costs up 28 \npercent, family health care premiums up 45 percent. I did not put out \nthe figures on property taxes but, as I said, they have gone up 10 \npercent each year in my home State. I know it is different in other \nplaces.\n  Another cost that has gone up under President Bush, an indicator of \nthe current state of our economy, is the cost of Medicare. Just 1 week \nago today, mysteriously the Friday before Labor Day, we had an \nannouncement that there has been a 17-percent increase in Medicare \npremium costs. It kind of gets lost in the shuffle, although I do not \nthink this one is going to get lost because people are going to find \nout that they are paying a heck of a lot more for their Medicare \npremiums. We tried to slip through this 17-percent increase, which by \nthe way is reflective of a 72-percent increase in Medicare premiums in \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  By the way, from 1996 to 2000, it was 7 percent. Again, we are \ntalking about the 1990s versus what we now see. Let us compare that \nwith that little bit under 3-percent increase in Social Security \nbenefits that has gone on over the same period of time. We are spending \neverything that comes out, or close to--actually it is about 60 percent \nof what we have had in increases in Social Security premiums right into \nMedicare premium increases that are being charged now.\n  This is a problem. Given these dramatic price increases and the \ndecline of family income, there is no wonder that families feel \nsqueezed. They have to. We are moving in the wrong direction on way too \nmany of these indicators, and I think it is time that we take a look at \nthe policies that are leading to this.\n  Under President Bush, moving on to another perspective, we have lost \n1.6 million private sector jobs. Mysteriously we have actually created \na lot of jobs in the Government sector. That reduces that job loss down \nto about a million. We are growing the Government, but we are not \ngrowing our private sector. I thought it was supposed to be the other \nway around. It is unprecedented in modern times that we are actually \nlosing jobs.\n  Remember, the population is growing and productivity is going up. And \nwe are losing jobs? We may have had a growth spurt of sorts--it has \nactually been pretty anemic by any historical standards because we need \nalmost 200,000 jobs a month just to stay up with population growth. But \nthe fact is, we have had the first administration since the 1930s--it \nis not that we have a Hoover-level economy, but it is the first \nPresident since Herbert Hoover that we have actually seen job losses in \nthis economy.\n  It is hard to believe. That is a pretty tough standard. Americans \nwant to work. They want to build a better world for their kids and \ntheir grandkids. Creating jobs is how we do that, and that is not \nhappening. It is certainly not happening with quality jobs.\n  We have all heard when you lose a job and then you get a job, \nafterwards there is a big deterioration in the economic well-being \nassociated with that job. On average it is $9,000 less. In those \nindustries that are contracting versus where people are hired, going \nfrom $33,000 down to $24,000, that is not the way to drive a healthy \neconomy, particularly one that is so consumer-driven. I believe people \nwill spend a little less money if they were making $33,000 and now they \nare making $24,000. You can talk about it in terms of arithmetic or you \ncan talk about it in terms of well-being of the family and ability to \npay, this is a problem in terms of quality of jobs, numbers of jobs, \nand the ability of people to have real income.\n  I believe it is reflective of the poor policies to truly stimulate \njob growth in this country. We are putting all our eggs in a very \nnarrow segment of people who are already doing well, whether it is \nthrough tax cuts or the advantages we have in this society. This is not \na complaint about people doing well. That is great. But we need to have \nthe resources to invest in other things that will make a difference in \npeople's lives. We need to have tax breaks that get our American \ncompanies to produce jobs here at home, not outsource them. We need to \nhave the resources to help corporate America and small business do \nsomething about health care. We need to share that burden so they are \nnot cutting jobs because the cost of benefits is too high. We need to \ndo something about that now, and we need the resources to do it without \nblowing up the budget deficit way beyond where it is when we have an \nentitlement problem just around the corner on Social Security and other \nelements.\n  We talked earlier about 19 percent fewer people have health care now. \nThe reason is, it is so costly. A lot of individuals just avoid it \nbecause they can't stick with those costs. Companies are cutting their \nhealth care benefits because it has turned into the biggest expense \nthey have, certainly the biggest growing expense. We need some policies \nthat actually address that and are making an effort on that. We have \nnot heard anything on that in the last 4 years.\n  There is a real plan on the table, talking about catastrophic health \ninsurance, making sure every child is insured, making sure we have tax \ncredits for small business and offering Federal employees health \nbenefits to small business so we have bigger pools. There are a lot of \nthings to do. We are not doing it, and it is undermining the basic \nhealth and well-being of our economic society. And that is outside the \ncontext of realizing that 5 million people are without health \ninsurance.\n  There is a lot to be done here. There has been a lot lost. All of \nthis is in the context of where we have gone from budget surpluses--a \ncouple of hundred billion on an annual basis--to what was announced \nthis week of a $422 billion deficit, the largest ever, and there is not \nmuch of a prospect we are going to get that under control in the next \nfew years. This is from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office. I \nthink we are\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\ntalking about $2.3 trillion over the next couple of years, with a whole \nbunch of things missing. It is a difficult, severe economic \ncircumstance that I believe our current set of policies allowed to be.\n\n  It is time for a change. I think our colleague Senator Kerry has \ngreat plans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. There is so much to do--on health care, job creation, \nand job training. We need the resources to be able to do it. We need to \nhave sound policies to be able to underwrite rational Medicare policy, \nhealth care policy. We have put ourselves into a position where we have \nno money to invest in that, not in a serious way.\n  There is a lot of work to do. The American people understand there is \na difference between the economic success we have had because we had \nthe discipline and the foresight to do the things that make a \ndifference, to create those 22 million jobs, to create real income \ngrowth, and what we have had in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, which has done \njust the opposite and particularly has been heavyhanded and harsh on \nmiddle-class America. I hope when we get to elections we will make the \neconomic choices that will relieve that economic squeeze and make a \ndifference in people's lives because it is truly important if we are \ngoing to have a longrun, sustained economic well-being for the Nation \nin the years and decades ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending business, and I call up amendment No. 3617, which is \ncurrently at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3617\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to address an amendment that \nwill ensure the Coast Guard will have adequate funding to complete its \nhomeland security missions without sacrificing its traditional duties. \nIn this appropriations bill, the one that is before us, the Senate \nwould provide $5.15 billion in operating expenses for the Coast Guard. \nThat is $250 million less than the amount authorized and $20 million \nless than the President's request.\n  This amount is supposed to cover operations for all Coast Guard \nmissions, both nonsecurity and security related. But the General \nAccountability Office has found that in times of elevated security \nlevels, the Coast Guard has had to delve into the budget for \ntraditional missions that are currently performed by the Coast Guard. \nThis amendment will cover the shortfall by adding $100 million for work \non nonhomeland-security-related missions.\n  We have even appropriated money for the Iraqi Coastal Defense Force. \nWith $260 million in the emergency supplemental last year for border \nenforcement in Iraq, we have gone out and purchased Chinese-built \npatrol boats shipped by a German company to Iraq, where we are training \ntheir crews to perform antismuggling operations, harbor and coastline \ndefense, search and rescue operations, and various other operations in \nIraq. If we can find money for the Iraqi Coastal Defense Force, surely \nwe can fully fund our own Coast Guard.\n  One month ago we enacted the Coast Guard and Marine Transportation \nAct of 2004 which reauthorizes the Coast Guard for fiscal years 2005 \nand 2006. Due to the leadership of Chairman McCain, Ranking Member \nHollings, as well as subcommittee leaders, Chairman Snowe and Ranking \nMember John Kerry, this important legislation was enacted. This law \nauthorizes some very important work and gives even more responsibility \nto the Coast Guard, which the occupant of the chair knows, coming from \na coastal State like North Carolina. The Coast Guard is always being \ngiven more work, more demands, performing with less resources, fewer \npeople, and still doing an outstanding job. But there is a point at \nwhich they just can't do that anymore. The work they do, we forget, \nincludes work on oil pollution, marine safety, improved fisheries \nenforcement, and work finding alternatives to double-hull vessel \ndesigns. This authorizes adequate funding. This authorization provided \nfor the additional $100 million in my amendment to ensure that the \nbudgets for traditional missions are not raided. The President signed \nthis act into law 1 month and 1 day ago, so there is an established \nneed for this amendment.\n  I want to be clear. My amendment does not add back the entire $251 \nmillion that was authorized but was left out here. Rather, it \nrecaptures only $100 million out of that. The amendment would not \naffect the homeland security budget of the Coast Guard.\n  Last year my staff heard from a New Jersey constituent who is in the \nCoast Guard. We have Coast Guard training facilities in the State of \nNew Jersey.\n  He told my staff that due to budget cuts, his unit was forced to \nshare personal equipment like specialized suits and other gear intended \nto be worn by one individual.\n  He said that this made it difficult to do his job, but he and his \ncolleagues were making do.\n  Nonetheless, I find this disturbing.\n  Because of inadequate budgeting, even the Coast Guard Commandant, \nAdmiral Collins, has been forced to do what I like to call the ``OMB \nDance.''\n  This is the ``Dance'' where agency heads come before Congress and \nsquirm while they tell us that they can ``made do'' with a clearly \ninadequate budget.\n  They don't volunteer details about how these funding shortfalls \nthreaten their ability to carry out their missions effectively.\n  Some of the traditional missions of the Coast Guard include search-\nand-rescue, marine safety, drug interdiction, aids to navigation, ice \nbreaking operations, living marine resources, migrant interdiction, \nmarine environmental protection, and other law enforcement activities.\n  In their report, the GAO discovered that ``resource hours'' for many \nof traditional functions are still well below pre-9/11 levels. For \ninstance, search-and-rescue is down 22 percent. Foreign fishing \nenforcement is down 16 percent, permitting further abuse of the \navailable supply of fish life. And interdiction of illegal drugs is \ndown 44 percent.\n  When we send Coast Guard cutters to the Middle East, it affects us at \nhome.\n  The administration will tell you, and I am sure you will hear during \ndebate, that based on ``performance factors,'' these areas have not \nbeen hurt--that they are doing their job more efficiently now, with \nbetter intelligence. Once again, you can only squeeze so far.\n  But how do you measure how many drug shipments were not seized?\n  How do you measure how many illegal aliens where not intercepted?\n  Or how many foreign fishing vessels violated international treaties \nand fished in U.S. waters without getting caught?\n  Under this bill, some of these functions are now considered \n``defense-related,'' but not all of them.\n  We must provide adequate resources for the Coast Guard to complete \nall of their missions.\n  If we continue to treat their non-homeland budget as a security slush \nfund, we will end up paying for it in other ways.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  We have an understanding that there will be a vote on this amendment \non Monday afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Florida who has \nurgent business. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized after he \nconcludes his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Intelligence Reform\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and good \nfriend, Senator Kennedy, for his courtesy in allowing me to make these \nremarks at this time.\n  Mr. President, this is a propitious moment.\n  At exactly 8:46 tomorrow--Saturday--morning, we will observe the \nthird anniversary of the crash of American Airlines Flight 11 into the \nNorth Tower of the World Trade Center.\n  That moment changed our Nation and our world forever--and in the \nhours and days that followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001, we in public office undertook an important obligation.\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\n  We vowed, in the memory of the nearly 3,000 innocent people who died \nthat day, to take action to prevent attacks of that magnitude from ever \nhappening again within our homeland.\n  In his speech delivered before a joint session of Congress on \nSeptember 20, 2001, President Bush put it this way:\n\n       Americans are asking, How will we fight and win this war?\n       We will direct every resource at our command--every means \n     of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of \n     law enforcement, every financial influence, and every \n     necessary weapon of war--to the disruption and to the defeat \n     of the global terror network.\n\n  Unfortunately, one day before the third anniversary of 9/11, we have \nnot met that commitment.\n  We have failed to adequately focus on what it will take to fight this \nnew threat, one that calls for new thinking and new governmental \ninfrastructure.\n  The No. 1 requirement for meaningful reform is strong and consistent \nPresidential leadership.\n  We have seen leadership lacking at several crucial turning points in \nrecent history, both before September 11, 2001 and since.\n  I have believed for many months--since well before the final report \nof the independent 9/11 Commission was released in July--that the \nproblems in our intelligence community are not a mystery, they are \nknown weaknesses that simply have yet to be fixed.\n  I commend the 9/11 Commission for its fine work, especially chairman \nand former Governor of New Jersey Tom Kean and vice chairman and former \nCongressman from Indiana Lee Hamilton.\n  And I am optimistic that their report has shaken our nation's leaders \nout of their lethargy and caused them to focus on the need for reform \nof our intelligence gathering and analysis.\n  But the record is clear. The 9/11 Commission's work built on a series \nof commissions and studies that offered recommendations for reform of \nthe intelligence community going back nearly a decade.\n  But those recommendations were--tragically--all but ignored.\n  Just to mention the reports that were before the Congress and before \nthe President, I would date these efforts to 1995, when Congress \ncreated the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United \nStates Intelligence Community, also known as the Aspin-Brown \nCommission.\n  Its final report was issued on March 1, 1996.\n  Since then, there have been the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic \nResponse Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass \nDestruction, also known as the Gilmore Committee, which issued the \nfirst of its five reports in December 1999, the National Commission on \nTerrorism, also known as the Bremer Commission, which issued its report \nin June 2000, and the National Commission on National Security in the \n21st century, also known as the Hart-Rudman Commission, which issued \nits final report in January of 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the membership \nof each of these commissions, which demonstrates the quality of the \nindividuals who studied these problems and made recommendations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Members of independent commissions that have reviewed the \n     Intelligence Community:\n       Hart-Rudman Commission (2001): Gary Hart (co-chair), Warren \n     Bruce Rudman (co-chair), Anne Armstrong, Norm R.

Mr. President, finally, there is the report of \nour own House-Senate Joint Inquiry into the intelligence failures that \nsurrounded 9/11, which I had the honor of co-chairing with \nRepresentative Porter Goss.\n  The Joint Inquiry file our report with its 19 recommendations in \nDecember 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of \nthe members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in the \n107th Congress who served on the Joint Inquiry.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 107th Congress \n                               Membership\n\n     Porter J.

The declassified version was released to the \npublic on July 24, 2003.\n  I filed legislation, S. 1520, September 11, the Memorial Intelligence \nReform Act, to implement those recommendations 1 week later on July 31, \n2003. Each of these panels, in common, concluded major changes were \nneeded to better protect the American people, including such steps as \nmuch longer human intelligence capabilities. Yet we did not see the \nleadership that was needed to fully implement any of those \nrecommendations. Rather, when it comes to reforming our intelligence \ncommunity, our Nation's leaders can be described as lethargic, at best, \nnegligent, at worst.\n  Let me be clear, my condemnation is not directed only at the current \nadministration but previous administrations, as well. For instance, in \nmy judgment, the Clinton administration was guilty of two principal \nfailures. One, it did not seriously consider or initiate the changes \nnecessary to move our intelligence agencies into the 21st century; \nsecond, it did not take adequate steps to wipe out the al-Qaida \ntraining camps in Afghanistan, camps which produced thousands of \nextremists trained in the effective skills of terrorism.\n  The blame is not totally at the White House. This Congress deserves \nblame for its failure to move with a greater sense of urgency. I will \ndiscuss those failures in a future date.\n  Now we have the 9/11 Commission report. We are likely to see passage \nof an intelligence reform package before the election. I am convinced \nthe American people will recognize that valuable time has been lost in \nthe 3 years since September 11, 2001, and should we suffer another \nterrorist strike on our land before these reforms are fully \nimplemented, we will not be able to dodge tough questions about why we \nfailed to respond sooner.\n  It is abundantly clear that had we heeded the lessons to be learned \nfrom September 11, we might have avoided the embarrassing failures of \nintelligence on weapons of mass destruction that led us into the war in \nIraq. President Bush should have exercised his full powers as Commander \nin Chief in the hours immediately after September 11 by calling \ntogether the leadership of the agencies whose failures contributed to \nthat tragedy. The President should, in the bluntest of terms, have \ndemanded a full review and a report and steps to correct these \ndeficiencies to be\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\nsubmitted to the Oval Office within no longer than 100 days.\n  The No. 1 lesson of September 11 is obvious: Our intelligence on the \nterrorist threat was unreliable. It was subject to major gaps of \nnecessary information and analysis. Had we applied exactly those same \nlessons learned as we prepared for the war in Iraq, the President would \nhave had less confidence in the intelligence he was being given on \nissues such as weapons of mass destruction and the conditions that our \nmilitary men and women would face during and after the initial assault.\n  Ponder this: What a difference that would have made as we learn from \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee report on the problems of pre-Iraqi \nwar intelligence. If we do not now take action to remedy those \nweaknesses, we will not be able to avoid accountability for our failure \nto detect and deter the next attack.\n  As has been demonstrated over the past decade, the fundamental \nopponent of intelligence reform is inertia and the natural tendency to \nmaintain the status quo. Before we can get people to reject the status \nquo, there has to be, first, an agreement as to what are the problems \nto which the status quo has contributed.\n\n  I have found that the medical model of first diagnosing a problem and \nthen prescribing a remedy to be a useful prescription with social \nproblems. Today, I want to give the diagnosis of our intelligence \ncommunity that a careful physician might offer. Next week, I will come \nto the Senate to offer my prescription.\n  This is what I consider to be five major problems and challenges \nfacing American intelligence. One, the failure to adapt to a changing \nadversary and a changing global threat environment. Just as it was \ndifficult 40 years earlier for the intelligence community to make the \ntransition from the practices of the OSS against Germany and Japan, \ntoday's intelligence community has found it even more difficult to \nshift from the cold war to the war on terror.\n  Our new enemy is distinctly different than we are. It is a non-nation \nstate, asymmetrical in the extreme. It is motivated by a religious \nbelief that denies the legitimacy of governments which intrude on the \ndirect relationship which should exist between all law and man. We are \nalmost deaf to the numerous, frequently arcane languages that our new \nadversaries speak. As a people and as a nation, the United States has \nlimited expertise in their cultures. By the failure to make the \ntransition to this new world we inhabit and the new threats we face, \nAmerican intelligence is rendering itself less and less capable of \nbringing the security which our citizens need and deserve.\n  A second failure is the repeated instances in which the intelligence \ncommunity did not provide effective, strategic intelligence. In the \nsummer of 2001, intelligence was reporting to American decisionmakers \nthat, yes, al-Qaida was something of a threat to U.S. interests, but \noutside the country, not inside the homeland of the United States. So \nwhile we spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fortify our embassies \nabroad, we did virtually nothing to increase the safety of domestic \ncommercial aviation.\n  As the planning for the war was intensifying in the winter and spring \nof 2003, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense \nWolfowitz reached two conclusions which were validated by intelligence, \nmuch of which came from the intelligence agencies within the Department \nof Defense. They claimed that after the war the U.S. troops would be \nreceived as liberators and that the Iraqi people would shower our \ntroops with flowers, as the American soldiers had been welcomed in \nParis in 1944. They went on to say that the Iraqis would turn on the \nfaucets of that nation's oil riches and pay for the occupation and \nrebuilding of their nation. Sadly, of course, neither of these \nprojections has come true.\n  The third failure is the failure to establish within the intelligence \ncommunity broad priorities and then to deploy the resources of the \nintelligence community behind those priorities. In December of 1998, \nformer CIA Director George Tenet declared terrorism was the \nintelligence community's primary target, that America was at war with \nal-Qaida.\n  The problem is that within the CIA and the other intelligence \nagencies few heard the battle cry and even fewer responded.\n  Rather than set up intelligence systems to validate convenient \npolitical notions, we need a system that pursues mutually agreed-upon \npriorities\n  Fourth, the intelligence community has not implemented the policies \nnecessary to recruit, train, reward or sanction, maintain the talents \nor diversify its human intelligence capabilities.\n  The U.S. human intelligence at the end of the cold war has been \ndescribed as very deep in our knowledge of the Soviet target, almost \nignorant about everything else.\n  In the places where we most need human intelligence, such as in the \nMiddle East and Central Asia, we are woefully deficient.\n  The intelligence community's current recruitment and training \nregimes, which rely heavily on college campus career days, has been \ninadequate to overcome this handicap.\n  We are confronting terrorists with a band of men and women who are \nenthusiastic to perform the challenging intellectual work of an analyst \nor the dangerous undertaking of an operative, but often lack the \nnecessary skills to be effective.\n  In my opinion, we need to rethink our system of intelligence \nrecruitment, training, and performance evaluation.\n  The fifth failure is the failure to realize that many of the most \nimportant decisions made by the intelligence community that were \npreviously described as tactical have now become strategic.\n  Unfortunately, the level and perspective of those tasking the \ngathering of that intelligence has not changed, often with highly \nadverse consequences.\n  One of the reasons that congressional oversight of the intelligence \ncommunity exists is because in 1960, in the days before a planned \nsummit between President Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita \nKrushvchev, the Soviet Union downed an American U-2 spy plane.\n  The tension surrounding the plane's mission and its downing aborted \nthe summit, and that enraged Senator Mike Mansfield. This is what \nSenator Mansfield said:\n\n       Not a single member of the Cabinet nor the President \n     exercised any direct control whatsoever over the ill-fated U-\n     2 flight at the critical moment at which it was launched.\n\n  He continued that the decision to undertake the flight\n\n     ``owes its origin more to bureaucratic inertia, lack of \n     coordination and control and insensitivity to its potential \n     cost than it does to any conscious decision of politically \n     responsible leadership.''\n\n  In other words, a tactical blunder had set back a strategic goal.\n  Today, even more than in 1960, tactical intelligence gathering \noperations need to show an appreciation--a greater appreciation than is \ntrue today--for their strategic implications.\n  Mr. President, it has been 3 years since we suffered the horror of \nSeptember 11. The time to act is long since past.\n  In future days, I will discuss recommendations to address what I \nthink are the major challenges we face, and to urge the courage and \ncommitment, will and urgency, to protect the American people in the way \nthat we failed to do on September 11, 2001.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9063-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9063-S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ADMINISTRATION'S INCOMPETENCE ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yesterday, the Senate Armed Services Committee held two \nhearings to consider the reports by General Fay and General Jones and \nthe report by former Defense Secretary Schlesinger about the Abu Ghraib \nprison debacle.\n  The abuses at Abu Ghraib are just one part of a much larger failure, \nfor which our soldiers have been paying a high price since day one. \nBecause of the Bush administration's arrogant ideological incompetence \nand its bizarre ``mission accomplished'' mentality, our troops and our \nintelligence officers and our diplomats had neither the resources nor \nthe guidance needed to deal with the worsening conditions that steadily \nbegan to overwhelm them and continue to do so.\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n  On issue after issue in Iraq, the administration has failed the basic \ntest of competence.\n  Before the war, the administration mishandled the intelligence, \ncausing great damage to U.S. respect in the world, making the war on \nterrorism far harder to win. It is preposterous for the administration \nto pretend that the war in Iraq has made America safer. No President in \nAmerica's history has done more damage to our country and our security \nthan President Bush.\n  The American people know where the buck stops.\n  The administration bungled prewar diplomacy on Iraq, leaving us \nisolated and unable to obtain real allied support.\n  The administration failed to consider the possibility that the \nliberation of Iraq might not be the cakewalk they predicted. They \nfailed to consider the possibility that their preoccupation with Iraq \ncould undo much of our achievement in Afghanistan and give the al-Qaida \nterrorists time to regroup and plan murderous new assaults.\n  Far too many of our soldiers were not adequately trained for their \nmission in Iraq and they did not have adequate equipment for their \nmissions either.\n  The administration failed to send enough troops to do the job of \nkeeping the peace. They disbanded the Iraqi army, and they are \nstruggling now to recreate it.\n  The administration's failures have also put a huge strain on the Army \nand our Reserve Forces and imposed great hardships on the families of \nour soldiers.\n  The number of insurgents in Iraq has gone up. The number of brutal \nattacks has gone up, and so have the casualties.\n  When President Bush recklessly declared ``mission accomplished,'' the \ncivilian leaders in the Department of Defense took him seriously and \nleft our Armed Forces in Iraq underprepared, understaffed, and underled \nfor the mission that was only just beginning.\n  President Bush has stated that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic \nsuccess. He is half right--the war has been a catastrophe.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for our soldiers, who were foolishly \nsent to war with no plan--no plan--to win the peace.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for their loved ones.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for our Nation's standing in the world \nand for the war on terror. As I have said, it has distracted us from \nthe real threat of al-Qaida in Afghanistan and elsewhere, made the war \nagainst terrorism far harder to win, and made America more hated in the \nworld than at any other time in our history.\n  Nothing I have said detracts from the extraordinary heroism of our \nsoldiers. They have responded to their mission in Iraq with immense \ncourage and dedication. But their outstanding service does not and \ncannot excuse the incompetence of their civilian leaders.\n  That incompetence was on vivid display again yesterday, in the Armed \nServices Committee, where we heard testimony on the report by General \nJones and General Fay about Iraq. Their findings were chilling.\n  Their report states point blank that the Pentagon expected our \ntroops, under General Sanchez, to provide stability and support for the \nCoalition Provisional Authority ``in a relatively nonhostile \nenvironment'' in Iraq. Those are the exact words of the report--``a \nrelatively nonhostile environment.''\n  That description is no surprise. The administration had been doing \nits best to convince the American people that the war would be easy.\n  In February 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld told troops that the war ``could \nlast, you know, 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months.'' As Secretary \nRumsfeld well knows, it has now been three times as long as that, with \nno end in sight.\n  In March 2003, Vice President Cheney said we would ``be greeted as \nliberators'' and dismissed out of hand any suggestion that we would be \nviewed as conquerors in a long, bloody occupation.\n  Before the war, the Pentagon flagrantly ignored the postwar planning \ncarried out by the State Department in its ``Future of Iraq'' project. \nThe civilian leaders at the Defense Department were dismissive of any \nopposing view. They were convinced that the war would be easy, cheap, \nand fast.\n  They ridiculed General Shinseki, then Chief of Staff of the Army, and \nLarry Lindsey, formerly President Bush's top economic advisor, who said \nthat a successful war in Iraq would require hundreds of thousands of \nsoldiers, and hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  They put their own ideology above practical military planning, and we \ncontinue to see the catastrophic results today.\n  Simply put, the civilians at the Pentagon did not anticipate or \nprepare for the insurgent fighting that occurred, despite the prewar \nwarnings from military leaders.\n  Even after the shameful failure at Abu Ghraib came to light, the \nadministration continued to pour out statements that were completely at \nodds with the facts.\n  On May 7 this year, Secretary Rumsfeld testified before the Armed \nServices Committees of both Houses of Congress. He told Senators that \n``a small number of the U.S. military'' had perpetuated the abuses. He \ntold the House that ``a few members of the U.S. military were \nresponsible.'' A week later, President Bush tried to minimize the \nscandal by saying it involved ``disgraceful conduct by a few American \ntroops.''\n  But as we now know, it wasn't just a few bad apples at Abu Ghraib.\n  The Fay Report found 54 military intelligence, military police, \nmedics, and civilian contractors who had ``some degree of \nresponsibility or complicity in the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib. \nLeaders in key positions failed to properly supervise the interrogation \noperations at the prison.''\n  The Fay Report identified not just individual failures but systemic \nfailures, including: ``inadequate interrogation doctrine and training, \nan acute shortage of MP and MI soldiers, the lack of clear lines of \nresponsibility between the MP and MI chains of command, the lack of \nclear interrogation policy for the Iraq Campaign.''\n  The Schlesinger Report found that military leaders in and out of Iraq \nand civilian leaders in the Department of Defense ``failed in their \nduties and that such failures contributed directly or indirectly to \ndetainee abuse.'' The report faults the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for failing to ``set in motion \nthe development of a more effective alternative course of action.'' \nPlainly, senior leaders did not do what was necessary to prevent these \nabuses.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld told the Armed Services committee that the abuses \nwere brought to light by Specialist Joseph Darby in January 2004, and \nthe military chain of command ``acted promptly on learning of those \nabuses.''\n  This claim, too, is false. Senior leaders had ample warning that \nthese abuses were occurring long before January 2004.\n  General Jones' report found that indications and warnings had \nsurfaced at General Sanchez's level ``that additional oversight and \ncorrective actions were needed in the handling of detainees,'' \nincluding at Abu Ghraib.\n  The report pointed to many specific warnings from within the Army \nabout clear problems that were ignored by the Pentagon's civilian \nleadership. It cited an incident in which a detainee was abused at Camp \nCropper after a prison riot. It cited investigations by the Army's \nCriminal Investigative Division into incidents of abuse and \ndisciplining soldiers. It cited the death of a CIA detainee at Abu \nGhraib. It cited the totally inadequate filing system for tracking \ndetainees, which consisted of a hodge-podge of computers and filing \nboxes.\n  The civilian leaders at the Pentagon also had ample warnings from \noutside the Army, which they also ignored. The International Committee \nof the Red Cross reported on abuses in the prisons as early as May \n2003, soon after the fall of Baghdad. During a visit to Abu Ghraib 5 \nmonths later, in October 2003, Red Cross inspectors were so upset by \nwhat they found that they halted their visit and demanded an immediate \nexplanation from U.S. military authorities. Yet the worst abuses at the \nprison occurred over the next 3 months, from October to December of \nthat year.\n  Clearly, Secretary Rumsfeld misled the Congress and the American \npeople when he said that the leadership had\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nacted swiftly to address the abuses, when in fact, they allowed abuses \nto continue and allowed the situation to fester. They acted only when \nthe public disclosure of the abuses in the press made it impossible for \ntheir cover-up to continue.\n  The administration then attempted to minimize the abuses at Abu \nGhraib as part of its overall strategy to bury any bad new from Iraq \nand hide its incompetence, or worse, from the American people. But as \nthese reports show, the catastrophe is far too great to be wished away \nwith political spin.\n  The Jones-Fay report states very clearly that ``the military police \nand military intelligence units at Abu Ghraib were severely \nunderresourced.''\n  The report says that a failure to distinguish between Iraq and other \ntheaters of operation led to ``confusion'' about which particular \ninterrogation techniques were authorized in Iraq.\n  It says, ``The intelligence structure was under-manned, \nunderequipped, and inappropriately organized for counter-insurgency \noperations.''\n  What the report is saying, put in plain language, is that the \noperation was botched--totally botched.\n  We know from General Taguba's report that few, if any, of the \nmilitary police assigned to Abu Ghraib were trained on how to run a \nprison, or even on the basic requirements of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Yesterday, the generals told us that additional missions had \noverwhelmed General Sanchez's headquarters, leaving them unable to \nmanage the growing crises at Abu Ghraib and unable to respond to the \nmany warning signs from the Red Cross.\n  We heard over and over again about the impossible strains imposed on \nGeneral Sanchez and his headquarters, because he was suddenly forced to \ntake on two huge missions in Iraq--supporting the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority and beginning the reconstruction--in addition to fighting a \ngrowing insurgency.\n  The Jones-Fay report says that General Sanchez was missing two-thirds \nof the personnel needed for his own command in Iraq. It says ``of the \n1,400 personnel required, the [Fifth] Corps staff transitioned to only \n495, or roughly a third, of the manning requirements.'' This was barely \nenough to fight the war, and far too few to rebuild a country or \nsupervise the detention system.\n  The obvious basic questions are who put our military forces in this \nuntenable position? Who decided that the war would be short, cheap, and \neasy? Who decided that the war was over and that we needed to start \nrebuilding Iraq? Who decided to play ``Mission Accomplished?''\n  The problems at Abu Ghraib are just symptoms of these larger \nfailures. We sent our troops into battle without enough life-saving \nbody armor and armor for their humvees on patrol. Those shortages were \nallowed to last for over a year, while our casualties continued to \nmount.\n  We had far too few troops in place to prevent the looting of Baghdad \nand many other parts of the country.\n  Huge ammunition depots went unguarded, and insurgents kept getting \nmaterials and bombs to use against our troops.\n  We disbanded the Iraqi military, at one time the fourth largest \nmilitary in the world, only to begin training a new one from scratch \nwhen the blunder was finally admitted.\n  In his report, General Jones gave us a definition of a leadership \nfailure: where ``leaders did not take charge, failed to provide \nappropriate guidance'', ``failed to accept responsibility or apply good \njudgment''. By this standard, and on this record, President Bush and \nhis administration are clearly guilty of leadership failure.\n  Despite these colossal failures of leadership and this gross \nincompetence, no one has been held accountable.\n  The military holds its soldiers accountable for leadership failures. \nA few weeks ago, the Navy fired the captain of the USS John F. Kennedy \naircraft carrier for running over a small boat in the Persian Gulf. The \nNavy didn't hide incompetence and gloss it over. It responded \ndecisively and plainly stated that it had ``lost confidence'' in the \ncaptain's ability to operate the carrier safely. He was the eleventh \ncommanding officer of the Navy to be fired this year alone. The Navy \nfired 14 commanding officers in 2003.\n  In February 2004, the Commanding Officer of the frigate USS Samuel B \nRoberts was fired for a ``loss of confidence,'' after he spent a night \noff the ship during a port visit to Ecuador.\n  In October 2003, the Commanding Officer of an EA-6B Prowler Aircraft \nSquadron lost his job after one of his jets skidded off a runway. The \nNavy cited a ``loss of confidence'' when they made the decision to \ndismiss him.\n  In December 2003 and January 2004, Commanding Officers of the \nsubmarine, Jimmy Carter and the frigate USS Gary were fired, both for \n``loss of confidence.''\n  For military officers in the Navy, the message is clear--if you fail, \nyou're fired. The message to the civilian leadership in this \nadministration is equally clear--if you fail there will be no \nconsequences and no accountability, even if 1,000 American lives are \nlost.\n  It is time for the Department of Defense run a tighter ship at all \nlevels of command, including the civilian leadership. The civilian \nleaders at the Pentagon should be held at least to the same standard of \naccountability that military officers in the Navy are held to.\n  Obviously, it is different to place overall blame on our military \nleaders when their only fault may well be that they couldn't talk their \narrogant civilian leaders out of a flawed plan for Iraq.\n  But someone must be held accountable for the massive failures in \nIraq. The buck has to stop somewhere!\n  Civilian control of the military is one of the great cornerstones of \nour democracy. But what if the civilian leaders don't know what they're \ndoing, and mindlessly order our troops into battle unprepared?\n  Alfred Lord Tennyson said it well in those lines in his famous poem, \n``Charge of the Light Brigade'':\n\n     Not tho' the soldiers knew\n     Someone had blundered.\n     Theirs not to make reply,\n     Theirs not to reason why,\n     Theirs but to do and die.\n\n  This is what the administration has done to our troops in Iraq, and \nif Tennyson were writing today, he might well call his poem, ``The \nCharge of the Bush Brigade.''\n  Clearly, there must be accountability for this breathtaking \nincompetence, which has resulted in the death of over a thousand \nAmerican soldiers so far, put more in daily danger, and weakened \nAmerica's national security.\n  Yesterday, at the Armed Services Committee, former Defense Secretary \nHarold Brown described the key to accountability:\n\n       At each level, the question is loss of confidence. And in \n     the Navy, the loss of confidence goes with grounding your \n     ship. At a higher level the loss of confidence has to be \n     determined on a basis that's somewhat broader, the full \n     performance. And I think that applies at the highest military \n     levels. And it applies at the level of the Secretary of \n     Defense and his staff. . . . And the electorate has to decide \n     on the basis of its confidence at election time.\n\n  This administration has had its chance--and it failed the basic test \nof competence. If failed to deploy adequate forces in Iraq to win the \npeace. It failed at Abu Ghraib. It failed in granting sweetheart deals \nto Halliburton. It has failed the loss of confidence test, the basic \ntest of Presidential leadership.\n  The President seeks re-election based on his ability to fight the war \non terror.\n  The administration has lost confidence of the so-called ``coalition \nof the willing.'' Country after country is withdrawing troops, leaving \nAmerica responsible for 90 percent of all the troops on the ground and \n90 percent of all casualties.\n  On November 2d, the American people will decide, whether a majority \nof the country have lost confidence in the President's leadership \nbecause of his failures in Iraq and his failures on a wide range of \nimmense important domestic issues as well. There can only be one \nanswer--America needs new leadership. As I have said before, the only \nthing America has to fear is 4 more years of George Bush.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9063-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9063-S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ADMINISTRATION'S INCOMPETENCE ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yesterday, the Senate Armed Services Committee held two \nhearings to consider the reports by General Fay and General Jones and \nthe report by former Defense Secretary Schlesinger about the Abu Ghraib \nprison debacle.\n  The abuses at Abu Ghraib are just one part of a much larger failure, \nfor which our soldiers have been paying a high price since day one. \nBecause of the Bush administration's arrogant ideological incompetence \nand its bizarre ``mission accomplished'' mentality, our troops and our \nintelligence officers and our diplomats had neither the resources nor \nthe guidance needed to deal with the worsening conditions that steadily \nbegan to overwhelm them and continue to do so.\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n  On issue after issue in Iraq, the administration has failed the basic \ntest of competence.\n  Before the war, the administration mishandled the intelligence, \ncausing great damage to U.S. respect in the world, making the war on \nterrorism far harder to win. It is preposterous for the administration \nto pretend that the war in Iraq has made America safer. No President in \nAmerica's history has done more damage to our country and our security \nthan President Bush.\n  The American people know where the buck stops.\n  The administration bungled prewar diplomacy on Iraq, leaving us \nisolated and unable to obtain real allied support.\n  The administration failed to consider the possibility that the \nliberation of Iraq might not be the cakewalk they predicted. They \nfailed to consider the possibility that their preoccupation with Iraq \ncould undo much of our achievement in Afghanistan and give the al-Qaida \nterrorists time to regroup and plan murderous new assaults.\n  Far too many of our soldiers were not adequately trained for their \nmission in Iraq and they did not have adequate equipment for their \nmissions either.\n  The administration failed to send enough troops to do the job of \nkeeping the peace. They disbanded the Iraqi army, and they are \nstruggling now to recreate it.\n  The administration's failures have also put a huge strain on the Army \nand our Reserve Forces and imposed great hardships on the families of \nour soldiers.\n  The number of insurgents in Iraq has gone up. The number of brutal \nattacks has gone up, and so have the casualties.\n  When President Bush recklessly declared ``mission accomplished,'' the \ncivilian leaders in the Department of Defense took him seriously and \nleft our Armed Forces in Iraq underprepared, understaffed, and underled \nfor the mission that was only just beginning.\n  President Bush has stated that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic \nsuccess. He is half right--the war has been a catastrophe.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for our soldiers, who were foolishly \nsent to war with no plan--no plan--to win the peace.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for their loved ones.\n  The war has been a catastrophe for our Nation's standing in the world \nand for the war on terror. As I have said, it has distracted us from \nthe real threat of al-Qaida in Afghanistan and elsewhere, made the war \nagainst terrorism far harder to win, and made America more hated in the \nworld than at any other time in our history.\n  Nothing I have said detracts from the extraordinary heroism of our \nsoldiers. They have responded to their mission in Iraq with immense \ncourage and dedication. But their outstanding service does not and \ncannot excuse the incompetence of their civilian leaders.\n  That incompetence was on vivid display again yesterday, in the Armed \nServices Committee, where we heard testimony on the report by General \nJones and General Fay about Iraq. Their findings were chilling.\n  Their report states point blank that the Pentagon expected our \ntroops, under General Sanchez, to provide stability and support for the \nCoalition Provisional Authority ``in a relatively nonhostile \nenvironment'' in Iraq. Those are the exact words of the report--``a \nrelatively nonhostile environment.''\n  That description is no surprise. The administration had been doing \nits best to convince the American people that the war would be easy.\n  In February 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld told troops that the war ``could \nlast, you know, 6 days, 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months.'' As Secretary \nRumsfeld well knows, it has now been three times as long as that, with \nno end in sight.\n  In March 2003, Vice President Cheney said we would ``be greeted as \nliberators'' and dismissed out of hand any suggestion that we would be \nviewed as conquerors in a long, bloody occupation.\n  Before the war, the Pentagon flagrantly ignored the postwar planning \ncarried out by the State Department in its ``Future of Iraq'' project. \nThe civilian leaders at the Defense Department were dismissive of any \nopposing view. They were convinced that the war would be easy, cheap, \nand fast.\n  They ridiculed General Shinseki, then Chief of Staff of the Army, and \nLarry Lindsey, formerly President Bush's top economic advisor, who said \nthat a successful war in Iraq would require hundreds of thousands of \nsoldiers, and hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  They put their own ideology above practical military planning, and we \ncontinue to see the catastrophic results today.\n  Simply put, the civilians at the Pentagon did not anticipate or \nprepare for the insurgent fighting that occurred, despite the prewar \nwarnings from military leaders.\n  Even after the shameful failure at Abu Ghraib came to light, the \nadministration continued to pour out statements that were completely at \nodds with the facts.\n  On May 7 this year, Secretary Rumsfeld testified before the Armed \nServices Committees of both Houses of Congress. He told Senators that \n``a small number of the U.S. military'' had perpetuated the abuses. He \ntold the House that ``a few members of the U.S. military were \nresponsible.'' A week later, President Bush tried to minimize the \nscandal by saying it involved ``disgraceful conduct by a few American \ntroops.''\n  But as we now know, it wasn't just a few bad apples at Abu Ghraib.\n  The Fay Report found 54 military intelligence, military police, \nmedics, and civilian contractors who had ``some degree of \nresponsibility or complicity in the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib. \nLeaders in key positions failed to properly supervise the interrogation \noperations at the prison.''\n  The Fay Report identified not just individual failures but systemic \nfailures, including: ``inadequate interrogation doctrine and training, \nan acute shortage of MP and MI soldiers, the lack of clear lines of \nresponsibility between the MP and MI chains of command, the lack of \nclear interrogation policy for the Iraq Campaign.''\n  The Schlesinger Report found that military leaders in and out of Iraq \nand civilian leaders in the Department of Defense ``failed in their \nduties and that such failures contributed directly or indirectly to \ndetainee abuse.'' The report faults the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for failing to ``set in motion \nthe development of a more effective alternative course of action.'' \nPlainly, senior leaders did not do what was necessary to prevent these \nabuses.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld told the Armed Services committee that the abuses \nwere brought to light by Specialist Joseph Darby in January 2004, and \nthe military chain of command ``acted promptly on learning of those \nabuses.''\n  This claim, too, is false. Senior leaders had ample warning that \nthese abuses were occurring long before January 2004.\n  General Jones' report found that indications and warnings had \nsurfaced at General Sanchez's level ``that additional oversight and \ncorrective actions were needed in the handling of detainees,'' \nincluding at Abu Ghraib.\n  The report pointed to many specific warnings from within the Army \nabout clear problems that were ignored by the Pentagon's civilian \nleadership. It cited an incident in which a detainee was abused at Camp \nCropper after a prison riot. It cited investigations by the Army's \nCriminal Investigative Division into incidents of abuse and \ndisciplining soldiers. It cited the death of a CIA detainee at Abu \nGhraib. It cited the totally inadequate filing system for tracking \ndetainees, which consisted of a hodge-podge of computers and filing \nboxes.\n  The civilian leaders at the Pentagon also had ample warnings from \noutside the Army, which they also ignored. The International Committee \nof the Red Cross reported on abuses in the prisons as early as May \n2003, soon after the fall of Baghdad. During a visit to Abu Ghraib 5 \nmonths later, in October 2003, Red Cross inspectors were so upset by \nwhat they found that they halted their visit and demanded an immediate \nexplanation from U.S. military authorities. Yet the worst abuses at the \nprison occurred over the next 3 months, from October to December of \nthat year.\n  Clearly, Secretary Rumsfeld misled the Congress and the American \npeople when he said that the leadership had\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nacted swiftly to address the abuses, when in fact, they allowed abuses \nto continue and allowed the situation to fester. They acted only when \nthe public disclosure of the abuses in the press made it impossible for \ntheir cover-up to continue.\n  The administration then attempted to minimize the abuses at Abu \nGhraib as part of its overall strategy to bury any bad new from Iraq \nand hide its incompetence, or worse, from the American people. But as \nthese reports show, the catastrophe is far too great to be wished away \nwith political spin.\n  The Jones-Fay report states very clearly that ``the military police \nand military intelligence units at Abu Ghraib were severely \nunderresourced.''\n  The report says that a failure to distinguish between Iraq and other \ntheaters of operation led to ``confusion'' about which particular \ninterrogation techniques were authorized in Iraq.\n  It says, ``The intelligence structure was under-manned, \nunderequipped, and inappropriately organized for counter-insurgency \noperations.''\n  What the report is saying, put in plain language, is that the \noperation was botched--totally botched.\n  We know from General Taguba's report that few, if any, of the \nmilitary police assigned to Abu Ghraib were trained on how to run a \nprison, or even on the basic requirements of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Yesterday, the generals told us that additional missions had \noverwhelmed General Sanchez's headquarters, leaving them unable to \nmanage the growing crises at Abu Ghraib and unable to respond to the \nmany warning signs from the Red Cross.\n  We heard over and over again about the impossible strains imposed on \nGeneral Sanchez and his headquarters, because he was suddenly forced to \ntake on two huge missions in Iraq--supporting the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority and beginning the reconstruction--in addition to fighting a \ngrowing insurgency.\n  The Jones-Fay report says that General Sanchez was missing two-thirds \nof the personnel needed for his own command in Iraq. It says ``of the \n1,400 personnel required, the [Fifth] Corps staff transitioned to only \n495, or roughly a third, of the manning requirements.'' This was barely \nenough to fight the war, and far too few to rebuild a country or \nsupervise the detention system.\n  The obvious basic questions are who put our military forces in this \nuntenable position? Who decided that the war would be short, cheap, and \neasy? Who decided that the war was over and that we needed to start \nrebuilding Iraq? Who decided to play ``Mission Accomplished?''\n  The problems at Abu Ghraib are just symptoms of these larger \nfailures. We sent our troops into battle without enough life-saving \nbody armor and armor for their humvees on patrol. Those shortages were \nallowed to last for over a year, while our casualties continued to \nmount.\n  We had far too few troops in place to prevent the looting of Baghdad \nand many other parts of the country.\n  Huge ammunition depots went unguarded, and insurgents kept getting \nmaterials and bombs to use against our troops.\n  We disbanded the Iraqi military, at one time the fourth largest \nmilitary in the world, only to begin training a new one from scratch \nwhen the blunder was finally admitted.\n  In his report, General Jones gave us a definition of a leadership \nfailure: where ``leaders did not take charge, failed to provide \nappropriate guidance'', ``failed to accept responsibility or apply good \njudgment''. By this standard, and on this record, President Bush and \nhis administration are clearly guilty of leadership failure.\n  Despite these colossal failures of leadership and this gross \nincompetence, no one has been held accountable.\n  The military holds its soldiers accountable for leadership failures. \nA few weeks ago, the Navy fired the captain of the USS John F. Kennedy \naircraft carrier for running over a small boat in the Persian Gulf. The \nNavy didn't hide incompetence and gloss it over. It responded \ndecisively and plainly stated that it had ``lost confidence'' in the \ncaptain's ability to operate the carrier safely.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer my thoughts \non the eve of the third anniversary of the September 11, 2001, \nterrorist attacks. Rather than show divisiveness and criticism, or talk \nabout politics, I think it is important to reflect on how much that \ntragedy has changed our lives and challenged all of us--not just \nRepublicans, not just Democrats, but all Americans--to do all that we \ncan to protect all that is good and wholesome about America.\n  Tomorrow, Saturday, American families will be doing what they have \ndone for generations in the early fall. In Charlottesville, the \nUniversity of Virginia will be hosting the Tar Heels from North \nCarolina; in Columbia, SC, the University of Georgia football team will \nbe playing the Gamecocks of South Carolina; in Richmond, Saturday \nnight, there will be more than 100,000 fans there for the big NASCAR \nrace; at the wonderful and traditional Wrigley Field in Chicago, the \nCubs will be playing the Florida Marlins; and families, in the \nafternoon, will be having cookouts in their backyards; others will be \ngathered as a family at their dinner tables.\n  During all of these wonderful, truly American events, we will all \npause to remember a day when such innocence was shattered by the vile, \nhate-filled attacks on our homeland that manifested themselves so \nviciously in New York City, at the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, and in \nSomerset County, PA. We will remember the loss of 3,000 Americans that \nday, and we will pray for their souls and certainly pray for their \nfamilies. We will remember friends and we will remember neighbors lost \non that day.\n  At all of those sporting events, when the National Anthem is sung, I \nventure to guess that song will be sung with greater vigor, more \nloudly, and with greater patriotism than one would normally hear. When \nthey conclude those final lines talking about how we are the ``land of \nthe free,'' and because we are the ``home of the brave,'' we will be \nthinking of our troops who are serving and protecting us in precarious \npositions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and prosecuting the war on terrorism.\n  In some ways, September 11, 2001, seems a long time ago. Yet we have \ndone so much in only a few years, and we will continue to do so in the \nfuture, to prevent such attacks on America.\n  Our focus in Government and our private lives has obviously \nprofoundly changed. We see it with our fortified airports, greater \nprotection in our public buildings, our shipping ports, and even \ncyberspace.\n  We have strengthened and updated law enforcement capabilities and \nintelligence, and our work on the Senate floor in the next few weeks \nwill further enhance those efforts with meaningful improvements and the \nuse of innovations of technology to better gather and analyze \ncounterterrorism information.\n  We have been more vigilant in watching enemies and threats at home \nand abroad. We have intercepted financial assistance to terrorists.\n  Yes, through it all, the fabric of our Nation has become stronger and \nmore appreciated as we face these unprecedented challenges. Our resolve \nand our focus is more clear. Our determination to protect freedoms here \nand around the world is greater than ever before.\n  We are so appreciative of the men and women in uniform who are \nprotecting us, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq or on ships around the \nworld. For our security, they are taking the offensive to the \nterrorists overseas. We are grateful for those who are active or maybe \nin the Guard or in the Reserves, or their employers here at home. Of \ncourse, we are so grateful to their families who have sent their sons \nand daughters, their loved ones and their friends overseas to protect \nus.\n  Our economic ingenuity, our competitiveness, our strength is being \nrekindled and reignited by free people and free enterprise. In many \nways, those who brought us harm on September 11 surely miscalculated \nthe character of the American people. We are a Nation of bravery and \nheroism.\n  I will never forget the stories about the first responders in New \nYork City going into the Trade Centers, breathing their last breaths of \nlife trying to save a few more innocent victims. The same with the \nPentagon. The responders came in not only from Arlington but all over \nnorthern Virginia, from Maryland, and even some from the District of \nColumbia, rushing into acrid, toxic air, trying to save those who had \nbeen hit, whether on the plane, but mostly those who were the surviving \nor people working at the Pentagon. These people ignored their personal \nsafety. They rushed into harm's way to help their fellow Americans on \nthat day.\n  Yesterday, I was at the Pentagon. In fact, I went in through the side \nof the Pentagon where American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into it. It \nis all rebuilt. It is strong, in fact stronger than ever. The reason I \nwas at the Pentagon is the Secretary of the Navy, Secretary England, \ndecided to name two new marine landing ships. They are named the USS \nArlington, because that is where the Pentagon is and was hit, and \nSomerset after Somerset County, PA, to honor the victims of 9/11 who \ndied in Pennsylvania and Virginia. These two ships will be a tangible \ndemonstration of our shared resolve in this country. For our friends, \nneighbors, and loved ones who lost their lives, they will be fitting \nreminders of their sacrifice.\n  One of those who lost their lives was a captain of American Airlines \nFlight 77, Captain Chic Burlingame. He had with him a wonderful poem. \nIt is a poem his brother and sister gave to me. We were making sure he \nwas properly buried at Arlington Cemetery, and I have kept it in my \npocket until the Phoenix Project had the rebuilding of the Pentagon. \nWhere I get my neckties and get dressed every morning, I have this \npicture they gave me. The picture is important, but also what is \nimportant is what is on the back of it, and that is a poem Captain \nBurlingame had on him when they crashed into the Pentagon.

Mr. President, while Congress was in recess, the news \nmedia have reported several important studies in the field of wellness \nand disease prevention. Collectively, these studies are another loud \nwake-up call. It is time for fundamental change in our approach to \nhealth care in the United States.\n  I have been saying for years that currently we have a sick care \nsystem, not a health care system. We have a system that, if you get \nsick, you get care.\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nBut there is precious little support, incentives or otherwise, to keep \nyou healthy in the first place. We are paying very dearly for this \nfoolish choice of having a sick care system rather than a health care \nsystem.\n  The latest evidence comes from a new study by health economist \nKenneth Thorpe. Mr. Thorpe found it cost $200 billion more in 2000 to \ntreat diseases and conditions in this country than it did in 1987. Just \n15 health conditions accounted for a whopping 56 percent of the growth \nin spending between 1987 and 2000. Indeed, a closer look shows that \njust five conditions accounted for one-third of the $200 billion \nincrease: heart disease, pulmonary conditions, mental disorders, \ncancer, and hypertension. What do all these conditions have in common? \nIn many if not most cases, these conditions are preventable. The Thorpe \nstudy also confirmed that chronic conditions, which are responsible for \nmore than 75 percent of all health care expenditures, cost tens of \nbillions of dollars more than just two decades ago.\n  Diabetes is one of those chronic conditions responsible for the \nexplosion in health care costs. Yet experts agree that the impact of \ndiabetes can be dramatically reduced by encouraging treatment \nguidelines on diet, exercise, and other preventive measures. The same \nis true for other chronic conditions. By emphasizing prevention and by \nfollowing best practices guidelines, we can dramatically reduce health \nspending.\n  It is alarming to me that many health experts now predict that the \ngeneration of kids growing up today will be the first that does not \nlive longer than their parents' generation. Let me repeat that. Health \nexperts now predict that the generation of kids growing up today will \nbe the first generation that does not live longer than their parents' \ngeneration.\n  As many children return to school this month, there is fresh evidence \nthat we are failing them in terms of wellness and disease prevention. \nConsider a study released this week by the National Institute for \nHealth Care Research and Educational Foundation. The study found that \nonly 16 percent of kindergarten programs meet recommendations of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention for daily physical \neducation. Instead, about 60 percent of kindergarten programs offer \nphysical education less than twice a week; 13 percent offer physical \neducation less than once a week. On average, grade school kids spend \nless than an hour a week in PE classes.\n  As many of my colleagues know, because of the No Child Left Behind \nAct and its obsession with testing and preparing for tests, many \nschools are eliminating recess in the elementary years and further \nneglecting PE in the middle and senior high school years. Some new \nelementary schools are being built without playgrounds. Make no \nmistake; this neglect of physical education has severe consequences. \nObesity has nearly tripled since 1970, and about 16 percent of children \nare now overweight. However, the study I just mentioned suggested that \nadding 1 hour of physical education per week could decrease the \noccurrence of overweight by as much as 10 percent. The study also found \nthat schools with low-income or minority students have a greater \nlikelihood than their peers to have no physical education in \nkindergarten. This is deeply troubling as these groups are especially \nat risk for obesity.\n\n  On a related note, we received further evidence last month about the \npotential risk of diabetes and obesity associated with soft drink \nconsumption. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation shows that women who drink at least one serving of nondiet \nsoda or fruit punch per day have a greater risk of gaining weight and \ndeveloping type 2 diabetes than women who do not. Women who consume one \nor more sweetened drinks per day are 83 percent more likely to develop \ndiabetes than those who drink less than one serving per month. During \nthe period of the study, women who drank at least one serving of \nsweetened drinks per day gained an average of 17 pounds, compared with \nan increase of only 6 pounds for women who drank less than one serving \nper month.\n  So why in the world are we allowing the proliferation of vending \nmachines filled with unhealthy foods and soft drinks in our schools? We \nare sending all the wrong signals to our kids. We put in all these \nvending machines with soft drinks up and down the hallways in our \nschools. It is saying to our kids, not only is that allowable, it is \nacceptable, it is encouraged that you have a soft drink during the day.\n  How many parents know--how many people know? Not even parents, how \nmany young people know that one 20-ounce soft drink, sweetened soft \ndrink, Coke, Pepsi, RC, whatever, one 20-ounce drink--that is what you \nget out of the vending machines now--contains the equivalent of 16 \nteaspoons of sugar?\n  I asked someone, you get a 20-ounce Coke or Pepsi--I don't mean to \npick on one or the other, but when you get a 20-ounce Coke, you think \nnothing about drinking it. What if someone measured out 16 teaspoons of \nsugar into a cup and said: Here, eat this. You would think they were \ncrazy. But they will drink a 20-ounce soft drink that has the same \nthing in it. And you wonder why people are getting diabetes.\n  The good news this month is that an additional four States will be \noffering the Free Fruit and Vegetable Program I started in the farm \nbill in order to encourage healthier eating habits at the earliest \npossible age. The bad news is that thousands of schools are continuing \nto make room for vending machines selling candy, soda pop, and other \njunk food on school grounds.\n  We are missing a prime opportunity to reduce the health risks facing \nour children by not emphasizing prevention, healthy lifestyles. A new \nstudy published in the Pediatric Journal found that 10 percent of \npediatric patients were obese; however, only half of those patients \nwere noted by the physician to be obese. What this means is we are \nmissing a critical opportunity to diagnose obesity and intervene at the \nearliest stage--during childhood--when lifestyle changes can be easier \nto make.\n  We also have new information from the American Cancer Society. More \nthan a dozen cancers are linked with obesity, and the American Cancer \nSociety estimates that of the 563,000 cancer deaths each year, excess \nweight is a factor in more than 16 percent of the cases. While overall \ncancer death rates have decreased over the last few years, we know now \nthat obese men and women are at a major increased risk for colorectal \ncancer. A postmenopausal woman's risk of breast cancer increases by 30 \npercent if she is overweight and by 50 percent if she is obese.\n  We also have new information about high blood pressure, which is a \nmajor contributor to heart disease and stroke.\n  It has skyrocketed over the past decade with almost one-third of \nadults suffering from hypertension. From 1988 to 1994, there was a 30-\npercent increase in the incidence of high blood pressure. We know that \nmuch of this increase is due to the rise in obesity.\n  On a variety of fronts, August was not a month of progress for those \nof us who care about wellness and disease prevention. The various \nstudies I have cited tell us that we are still heading in the wrong \ndirection. Much work needs to be done to transform America's sick care \nsystem into a true health care system--a system that keeps us out of \nthe hospital in the first place.\n  As I have said, again and again, it is time for a new paradigm in \nAmerican health care, a prevention paradigm. Again, we have a sick care \nsystem in this country and we need a genuine health care system focused \non wellness and prevention and keeping people out of the hospital in \nthe first place.\n  To that end, I have introduced legislation, the Help America Act, \nalso known as the Healthier Lifestyles and Prevention Act, S. 2158. And \ntoday the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee \nhas reported our bill for fiscal year 2005. This year's bill has \nespecially strong emphasis on wellness and prevention programs.\n  For example, we will be providing $440 million for research at the \nNational Institutes of Health into the causes and cures of obesity. \nThat is a 10-percent increase over last year.\n  We have included more than $50 million in grants to States to fund \nprograms that address nutrition, physical activity, and obesity.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n  We will provide more than $114 million for tobacco prevention and \ncessation activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nTobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease \nin our society today.\n  Our committee allocated $35 million for public health research at \nCDC. This year we are encouraging the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention to pay particular attention to research on business-based \nwellness programs for employees. We want to identify and disseminate \nthe best practices in this area, and we have asked the CDC to develop a \nmodel wellness program for businesses.\n  Our appropriations bill also includes $75 million for the Carol White \nPhysical Education for Progress Program, otherwise known as the PEP \nProgram. This provides grants to school districts to expand physical \neducation opportunities for K-to-12 students. Again, bear in mind, as I \nsaid, the average public school student gets less than 1 hour of \nphysical education per week, and many get none at all.\n  Our appropriations bill funds a new School Mental Health Services \nProgram. This will train public school personnel to recognize early \nwarning signs of mental illness, and it will expand student activity to \nhigh-quality mental health services.\n  I would like to add that the bill provides $2 million to support \nimplementation of the YMCA's new Activate America initiative, which is \nencouraging cities to develop communitywide approaches to wellness and \ndisease prevention. I am most grateful to the National YMCA for their \ngreat leadership in disease prevention, wellness, and health promotion. \nI am also pleased that our capital city of Des Moines, IA was selected \nas one of the first cities to participate in this program.\n\n  I also want to compliment and commend my chairman, Senator Arlen \nSpecter of Pennsylvania, for his great leadership in getting our bill \ntogether and getting it through our subcommittee. All of the items I \nhave mentioned that we are providing for wellness and prevention we \nhave worked on together in a true bipartisan fashion. I thank Senator \nSpecter for his leadership and for working to make sure we fund these \nprograms for wellness and prevention.\n  To sum it up, we are making some progress in advancing a broad, \ncomprehensive wellness agenda here in Congress. With all of the \npolitical bickering here on Capitol Hill people sometimes wonder if we \nare accomplishing anything. The Labor, Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill takes real, concrete steps to address problems such \nas obesity and chronic disease--problems that people care deeply about.\n  Again, I salute the hard work and leadership of Chairman Specter. He \ntoo cares passionately about issues of wellness and disease prevention. \nHe too realizes that our current sick care system which gives short \nshrift to prevention is leading us off a cliff.\n  I am optimistic. I know we will not get everything done this year. \nBut hopefully we will make progress and we will make more progress next \nyear. What I sense is growing support from both sides of the aisle for \na new emphasis on wellness and prevention. I am more and more confident \nabout the prospects for passing the Help America Act in the next \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the purpose of my remarks today is to \nsuggest a way to come to a solution in the debate we have been having \nas to what extent Congress should interfere with State and local \nregulations and taxation of high-speed Internet access.\n  In April, after a good many months of discussion, the Senate came to \na good temporary compromise on the issue. Our legislation, the Senate \nlegislation, allows States already collecting taxes on Internet access \nto continue to do so for 2 or 4 years, depending on the type of access \ntax. It makes clear that State and local governments can continue to \ncollect taxes on telephone services, including telephone calls made \nover the Internet. Our work here in the Senate modified legislation \nthat came over from the House of Representatives that would have \npermanently taken away from State and local governments authority to \ninclude high-speed Internet access in its taxation plans and would put \nat risk literally billions of dollars in revenues that States and \ncities and towns now depend on to pay for police, for schools, for \nparks, and for other essential local services.\n  Both sides in this debate have legitimate points to make. We see here \na conflict of the principles of federalism in free markets, and I \nbelieve it is a debate about whether there is any justification for \ngiving additional government subsidies to the high-speed Internet \naccess industry, which, so far as I can tell, must already be the most \nheavily subsidized new technology in our country today.\n  For now, I would respectfully suggest the logical course would be for \nthe House of Representatives to adopt the Senate modification. This \nwould provide temporary certainty in this policy area. But it is an \nunsatisfactory long-term solution. For the long term, here is my \nsuggestion. I propose that representatives of States, of cities, of \ncounties, and of the telecommunications industry meet together between \nnow and the opening of the 109th Congress in January and develop a \nframework to assist Congress with how to approach this highly technical \nbut very important set of issues.\n  In developing this framework, I suggest the parties ought to abide by \nthe following principles. No. 1, separate the issues of taxation and \nregulation. This fall, in some preliminary work on legislation proposed \nby Senator Sununu from New Hampshire, the Senate Commerce Committee did \njust that. They produced a bill regarding the regulation of Internet \ntelephony, but also preserving the right of State and local governments \nto make their own decisions about how to tax the industry.\n  Put in its simplest terms, I agree that it makes sense to have a \ndifferent, simpler kind of regulation of this new technology which we \ncall broadband. But I want to achieve this in a way that does no harm \nto State and local government revenue bases.\n  Second, when making decisions about regulation, the principle to \nhonor should be simplicity, so that the new technology can continue to \nflourish. Voice over the Internet technology is not the same as plain \nold telephone service. Our regulatory structures need to recognize \nthat.\n  Finally, when these representatives of industry and State local \ngovernments get together, as I hope they will, in determining tax \npolicy, the principles to consider should be simplicity, certainty, and \ndoing no harm to State and local governments.\n  There are more than 11,000 State and local tax jurisdictions in the \nUnited States of America. Obviously, it would be burdensome for a small \nInternet telephone company who offers services in most or all of these \ndistricts to file that many or even more returns. On the other hand, \nthere is no justification whatever that I can see for depriving a State \nor local government of 5 or 10 percent of its existing revenues simply \nto exempt an already heavily subsidized industry from paying its fair \nshare of taxes.\n  The idea of inviting those who will be most affected by our decisions \nabout taxation and regulation to suggest a policy to us is not a new \nidea. For example, in February of this year, something called the Voice \non the Net Coalition announced that a number of VOIP providers would \nwork together to establish voluntary agreements on how to integrate E \n9-1-1, access to the disabled, and Government wiretapping, into this \nnext generation of telephone technology.\n  They might well also consider universal service in this discussion--\nhow we would continue to provide telephone service to people in rural \nareas with this new kind of technology.\n  In another example of groups working outside the Congress to make it\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\neasier for us here, for the last several years something called the \nStreamline Sales and Use Tax Project has been going on. States have \nbeen building the technical and legal foundations for a system in which \nonline sellers or merchants would be required to collect taxes on sales \nover the Internet and forward the money to the State where the buyer \nlives. This will make it much easier for Congress to then enact \nlegislation authorizing such collections.\n  So in the same way I believe industry representatives working with \nState and local representatives could quickly suggest a framework that \nwould make our work here in Congress simpler and speedier. If this does \nnot happen, I believe we are in for a long debate with a likelihood of \na poor result or even no result. This would serve no one's purpose.\n  The telecommunication companies and high-speed Internet access \nindustry would benefit from certainty and simplicity. Governors, \nlegislators, and mayors at the same time need to know where revenues \nare coming from. They want certainty, too.\n  There are other, bigger fish to fry in the telecommunications area. \nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 needs a fresh look in some \nfundamental ways. When Congress enacted it, maybe no one in the Senate \nor the House knew very much about high-speed Internet access. State and \nlocal governments would like to move ahead with their streamline tax \nproject. Neither is likely to happen until the Internet access tax \nissue is resolved.\n  Let me say a final word about the technology we are discussing, high-\nspeed Internet access or, as we sometimes call it, broadband. Last \nyear, during our debate, there were dire predictions that if States \nwere allowed to continue to tax this access, it would become a terrible \nburden for the industry and restrict its growth and put the United \nStates in some kind of technological backwater. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Almost every day in my mailbox comes a new \noffer from someone to sell me high-speed Internet access. From my phone \ncompany, from my long distance company, from my satellite TV company--\neven electric companies are selling high speed-Internet access. Next \nthing you know I expect the milkman to show up offering to provide me \nwith high-speed Internet access.\n\n  And the prices, as usually happens with a new technology and \ncompetition, are going down. Most of the offers I receive in my mailbox \nare in the range of $20 a month, and in many states and communities--\nTexas is an example--these costs to the consumers are further reduced \nby government subsidy.\n  Here are some of the facts. Market data from the research firm \nNielsen/NetRatings shows in July of 2003 38 percent of home-based \nInternet users had a broadband connection. One year later, in July \n2004, that number had jumped to 51 percent. The same report shows that \nthe number of broadband connections altogether in July 2004 rose 47 \npercent from a year ago.\n  Meanwhile, investment in broadband over powerlines, as I mentioned \nearlier, is gaining steam. According to the Chartwell research firm, \nthe percentage of utility companies planning or considering broadband \ndeployment rose from 6 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2003. This \nmeans if you have an electric line coming into your house, you have \naccess to high-speed Internet access.\n  Internet telephones, called VOIP, are experiencing the same kind of \nrapid growth. According to the telecommunications industry, by the end \nof this year, in only 4 months, there will be 6 million VOIP access \nlines. They expect that figure to rise to more than 19 million by 2007.\n  Cablevision Systems began offering VOIP service in November of 2003 \nand in 2 months had 29,000 customers and was signing up new customers \nat the rate of 2,500 a week.\n  The VOIP explosion has hit traditional telephone service providers. \nIn August, the Washington Post reported both MCI and AT traditional \nlong-distance services are suffering, in part from the increase in \ntelephone calls made over the Internet with VOIP service. As a result, \neven these companies have moved into the VOIP market. AT has \nintroduced its CallVantage VOIP service and now has it available in 39 \nstates as well as the District of Columbia. Sprint has teamed with Time \nWarner Cable to begin offering VOIP services to 11 million customers \nand is forging new relationships with other cable providers to expand \nits services availability.\n  Finally, one of the pioneers of the VOIP industry, Vonage, announced \nin August that investors had sunk another $105 million in venture \ncapital into the company, the largest venture capital deal to date this \nyear.\n  So the bottom line is this: Broadband, or high-speed Internet access, \ncontinues to be adopted at a tremendously rapid rate. It is being \nadopted at a faster rate than CD players, than cell phones, than color \nTVs and VCRs were being adopted during the same periods in their \ndevelopment.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office has specifically told Congress, \nthere is absolutely no justification whatever for additional Government \nsubsidy for this industry. High-speed Internet access is a fine, \nremarkable, admirable, new technology. But so was television, so was \nradio, so was electricity, so was the internal combustion engine. It is \nnot the American way to subsidize such new inventions. It is the \nAmerican way to let these inventions earn their way forward in the \nmarketplace. Americans never got a tax break to buy a television set \nand TV manufacturers never got a subsidy, so far as I know, to build \nthem. Yet 30 years after they were introduced to the market, almost 90 \npercent of Americans owned a television set. That is the American way.\n  Telephone companies, in the same way, introduced cell phones without \nany prompting from the U.S. Government. In less than 15 years, more \nthan 40 percent of all households now own cell phones.\n  Of course, what is especially galling to me is that Congress would \neven consider creating this big tax break or tax subsidy for Internet \naccess companies and then send the bill for that tax break to State and \nlocal governments who are already struggling with additional costs \nbecause of our failure to create a rational health care policy and our \nfailure to create a national immigration policy and our bad habit of \nenacting expensive ideas in Washington, DC, taking credit for them in \npress conferences, and then sending the bill for the ideas to mayors \nand Governors and legislators and city council men and women.\n  It is my hope that the telecommunications industry representatives, \nGovernors, and mayors will spend some time with one another during the \nnext 3 or 4 months and figure out a framework for resolving how \nCongress should approach these issues in the most sensible way. I would \nbe glad to be a part of such discussions if I could be helpful. I am \nsure other Members of Congress would as well. The Federal \nCommunications Commission could provide technical advice.\n  May I say one word to Governors and mayors. And perhaps I can do this \nmore appropriately because I once was a Governor. I know Governors are \nbusy, and they have staffs to help them do their work. But this matter \nwill not be resolved by a few phone calls from Governors or by staff \nmembers to staff members on Capitol Hill. If Governors and mayors want \nthe Internet tax issues resolved in a way that does no harm to State \nand local governments, in a way that does not threaten 5 to 10 percent \nof their base, in a way that does not cost them billions of dollars, \nthen Governors and mayors are going to need to become personally \ninvolved in helping to resolve this issue, meeting with the \ntelecommunications industry representatives, and coming up with a \nrational way to provide certainty and simplicity for this new \ntechnology and, at the same time, do no harm to State and local \ngovernments.\n  Mr. President, I believe this will be the speediest, most sensible \nway to resolve the conflict we have between principles of federalism \nand free markets and to clear the way for Congress to move beyond the \nissues of taxing and regulating high-speed Internet access to other \nlarger, more important telecommunications policy issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the 3 years since 19 terrorists hijacked \n4 planes and changed the course of American history, we have learned \nmuch about our vulnerabilities, our strengths, and the steps we must \ntake to protect ourselves.\n  Tomorrow, America will remember the images of the Twin Towers \ncollapsing, of terrified office workers jumping to their deaths, of \nbrave New York City firefighters rushing into those burning buildings \nto save people trapped inside, of soot-covered men and women streaming \nout into the streets dazed and overcome. We will remember the shock of \nlearning that a third plane had smashed into the Pentagon, and a fourth \nwas possibly headed to the White House or the Capitol.\n  We will remember our sense of helplessness, our horror, and our utter \ndisbelief as the terrible events occurred that bright morning, a \nmorning not too dissimilar to today. In our grief on our day of \nnational mourning, let us also recall our unity and those words of Todd \nBeamer to his fellow passengers on flight 93: Let's roll.\n  The highest priority of the Senate is to protect the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. But as the 9/11 Commission report \noutlines, before 9/11 we were not attuned to the growing threat of \nIslamic terror. There had been attacks, and the attacks were growing \nbolder, but our attention was ``sporadic and splintered across several \ncommittees.''\n  Mr. President, 9/11 changed everything, and the Senate is committed \nto reforming its oversight functions so that it can, in the words of \nthe Commission report, provide ``strong, stable, and capable \ncongressional committee structure to give America's national \nintelligence agencies oversight, support, and leadership.''\n  Senator McConnell and Senator Reid are leading a leadership-appointed \ntask force which is meeting to hammer out a legislative framework. We \nplan to consider that legislation no later than October 1. As has been \ndiscussed this week, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is \nleading the reorganization of the executive branch. Under the superb \nleadership of Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, the committee is \nworking diligently to address the Commission's recommendations. They \nstarted hearings immediately after those 9/11 recommendations were made \nto this body and to the country and continued those hearings through \nAugust, and now that we are back in session, over the course of this \nweek.\n  On Wednesday, the Governmental Affairs Committee had another hearing \nto discuss options. Those hearings will continue. Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman will likely mark up legislation on the week of \nSeptember 20, and the bill will then be brought to the floor the \nfollowing week.\n  These dual efforts--one, the Governmental Affairs Committee dealing \nwith the relationships and the definition and the legislation \nsurrounding the executive branch, and the other led by Senators \nMcConnell and Reid, overseeing the reorganization within this body--\nwill present recommendations and that legislation to the U.S. Congress \nwith the goal of strengthening our national security and safeguarding \nus, the American people, against future acts of terrorism.\n  The President and his administration, meanwhile, have already begun \nto address 36 of the remaining 39 recommendations, the last three \ncurrently being under study. Two days ago, we had the opportunity to \nmeet with the President, Republican and Democratic leadership from both \nsides of the aisle in this body meeting with leadership and Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives, listening \nto his plans, his vision of intelligence reform.\n  On the Senate floor yesterday I spoke a little bit about the \nPresident's plan to establish a national intelligence director, the \nNID, to oversee these 15 intelligence agencies that we have. This \nafternoon, briefly, I would like to highlight the President's action to \ncreate a national counterterrorism center. We know that the \nintelligence community generates massive amounts of information. In the \naftermath of 9/11, this point became tragically clear. There had been \nclues. There had been arrests, analysis, and warnings. But because \nthese pieces of information were scattered across agencies and not \nproperly shared, they became missed opportunities.\n  In the words of the 9/11 report:\n\n       The system of ``need to know'' should be replaced by a \n     system of ``need to share.''\n\n  The national counterterrorism center President Bush has created by \nExecutive order will act as a central knowledge bank, a clearinghouse \nwhere intelligence can be shared across agencies, can be prioritized, \nanalyzed, and used in the field to thwart terrorist attacks. In other \nwords, the left hand will learn what the right hand is doing.\n  I commend the President on his consistent leadership and his \ncommitment to reforming our intelligence community. He is already \ntransforming the FBI. He has led the most extensive reorganization of \nthe Federal Government in 50 years in the creation of the Homeland \nSecurity Department. He recognized immediately that terrorism was not \nmerely a law enforcement issue but a grave threat to America, world \npeace, instability. It required mobilization of all of our resources.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue to \nadvance America's national security and improve our intelligence \nfunctions. The \n9/11 Commission report was bipartisan and unanimous. Likewise, I am \ngratified by my colleagues' sense of unity and shared vision in making \nAmerica safer sooner rather than later, before ``if'' becomes ``when.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9070-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9070-S9071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 3 years ago this September 11, al-Qaida \nterrorists launched a brutal attack on American soil. Every American \nremembers that clear Tuesday morning when two planes smashed into the \ntwo World Trade Center towers in New York and brought them crumbling to \nthe ground. A third plane crashed into the Pentagon outside Washington, \nDC. A fourth plane may have been destined for this very Capitol were it \nnot for the heroic passengers on that flight who put their country \nahead of their lives.\n  Today and every day we honor the innocent victims who died that day \nwhile conducting America's business. We also honor the heroic first \nresponders--police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical \npersonnel--who rushed in to save others. We honor the volunteers of \nthat day and every day forward who lined up to help their fellow \nAmericans. Millions donated money, time, efforts, and blood.\n  And we honor the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who have \nrisked their lives so Americans don't have to live in fear of being \nattacked again. Some have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Our all-\nvolunteer military is the best in the world, and as full of courage as \nthe military heroes from our Greatest Generation.\n  It is worth looking at what we have accomplished in the last 3 years. \nPresident Bush has led America in a global war on terror to destroy \nthose who would attack us again. We have made incredible progress.\n  We have led an international military coalition to eradicate two of \nthe vilest terrorist regimes on Earth--the Taliban in Afghanistan, and \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq. We have liberated over 50 million people. Over \n10 million have registered to vote in this fall's election in \nAfghanistan. And Iraq has national elections scheduled for early next \nyear.\n  Using diplomacy and sanctions, and with the help of the international \ncommunity, we have pressured a third terrorist regime in Libya to \nabandon its path to weapons of mass destruction, that could have been \ngiven to terrorists. The lesson of Saddam Hussein surely served as an \nexample here, and should continue to serve as such to despots around \nthe globe who would do us harm.\n  Of the senior al-Qaida leaders, operational managers, and key \nfacilitators that our government has been tracking, nearly two-thirds \nhave been brought to justice or had justice brought to them. And with \nthe help of our allies, we have severely disrupted\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\nthe networks and organizations that flow money, supplies, people, and \ninformation to the terrorists.\n  Here at home, the defense and intelligence capabilities of the \nFederal Government have been reorganized more sweepingly than at any \npoint since the 1940s, to prepare them for this, the first war of the \n21st century. We have created a Department of Homeland Security and are \ncurrently weighing how best to strengthen our intelligence services to \ndeal with today's threats.\n  Finally, America has reaffirmed her commitment to liberty across the \nworld. Despite the negative words of a few naysayers in high places, \nmost people around the globe draw strength from America's commitment to \nlead the global war on terror. Over 30 nations joined us to liberate \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We have never wavered in our pledge to root out \nthe terrorists and punish the states that may harbor them. The world \nhas been reminded that America lives up to its word.\n  We have made great progress in 3 years, and will continue to make \ngreat progress. The president has told us that this will be a long \nstruggle lasting years, perhaps decades. We cannot be sure when the war \nmay be won. But we can be sure that it will.\n  For nearly 50 years, America grappled with another seemingly \nentrenched enemy--the Soviet Union and the spread of communism \nthroughout the world. For much of the cold war, the struggle seemed to \nbe without end. Some said it couldn't be won. Some said coexistence was \nthe best America could hope for. Some even morally equated American \nfreedom with Soviet tyranny, and refused to take sides.\n  But today, schoolchildren learn that the Soviet Union collapsed, \nrotten from the inside, as an inevitable fact. We take our victory in \nthe Cold War for granted today, but it took decades of resolve, \nperseverance, and faith that our way of life was superior to \ntotalitarianism. Well, the American way of freedom--freedom to worship, \nfreedom to speak, freedom to vote--is still the best way of life on \nEarth.\n  Today's generation must maintain that same faith. We cannot lose on \nthe battlefield. We cannot lose the war of ideals. As long as we \nmaintain our will to win, we will prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9071-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot let September 11 pass without \nreflecting on this painful anniversary, and heralding the strength of \nour Nation in the three years that have passed since that terrible day.\n  Three years ago, a global network of terrorists attacked our country, \ntaking the lives of nearly three thousand innocent men, women, and \nchildren. Today, we are still angered by the cruelty of these attacks. \nWe are still awed by the courage of our first responders, and of the \neveryday Americans who were heroes on that day, whose acts of bravery \nand kindness were a source of solace for the Nation in the days after \nthe attacks. Their strength became our strength, and with each passing \nday, and each passing year, our resolve to stop the forces of terror \nhas only deepened.\n  This month, as the Senate moves forward to address the critically \nimportant recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, we mark the \nthird year that has passed since the attacks. But this anniversary is \nnot simply about the events of a single day. It is about our continued \nsadness and grief, and our overwhelming pride in the way our Nation \nresponded to the tragic events of that day. It is also about the \nabiding strength of our convictions; our deep and profound commitment \nto fighting the forces of terror, to making our families safer, and to \npreserving the freedoms at the heart of our national character.\n  We remember September 11 every day. On this anniversary, we simply \nshare in that remembrance--both with other Americans, and with people \naround the world who stand with us in the fight against terrorism. \nToday I pay tribute to the lives we lost, and I honor the men and women \nacross this country who give this Nation its greatest source of \nstrength: our faith in our country, in our communities, and in each \nother.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9071-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    staff sergeant bruce j. pollema\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SSG Bruce \nJ. Pollema, a fellow Iowan originally from Hull, IA. The Iowa National \nGuard regretfully announced the death of Staff Sergeant Pollema when he \nwas killed on August 27, 2004 along with fellow soldier, Spc. Dustin S. \nColby, when their military motor vehicle rolled over into a ditch near \nCamp Dodge. Staff Sergeant Pollema was a heavy vehicle operator with \nthe 2168th Transportation Company, based in Sheldon, IA. Staff Sergeant \nPollema is survived by his wife, Teri Winter, father and mother, Wilmar \nand Betty Pollema, his older brother, Waylon, and his twin brother, \nBrandon. This brave soldier was thirty years old.\n  The family of Bruce Pollema issued the following statement in \nresponse to the news of their son's death: ``Our hearts, minds, spirits \nand prayers are with the rest of the Troops and we wish them God speed. \nWe will be there for them when they come back.''\n  It is fitting that we should honor Staff Sergeant Pollema today for \nhis service to our country. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family \nand friends. I know his memory will live on in the hearts of everyone \nhe knew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9071-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9071-S9072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TIME IS RUNNING SHORT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in less than one week, the 1994 assault \nweapons ban will expire and our Nation will once again be vulnerable to \nguns known to most in the law enforcement community as ``the weapons of \nchoice for criminals.'' If the ban is allowed to expire on September \n13, potential criminals, including terrorists, could have access to 19 \nof the highest powered and most lethal firearms capable of being \nproduced. These guns have no sporting purpose and no place on our \nstreets.\n  In addition to banning 19 specific weapons, the current ban also \nincludes prohibitions on semiautomatic weapons that incorporate a \ndetachable magazine and two or more specific military features. These \nfeatures include folding/telescoping stocks, protruding pistol grips, \nbayonet mounts, threaded muzzles or flash suppressors, barrel shrouds, \nor grenade launchers. Common sense should tell us that there is no \nreason for civilians to have easy access to guns with these features.\n  Los Angeles Chief of Police Bill Bratton has said the following about \nthese weapons: ``Since the Assault Weapons Ban was passed in 1994, we \nhave seen a 66% decline in the frequency of assault weapon use in \ncrime. Violent criminals love these weapons because they give them far \nmore firepower than conventional weapons that greatly increases their \ncapacity to kill. We cannot allow these weapons to get back into their \nhands.''\n  It is important to listen to Chief Bratton and other law enforcement \nofficials who support an extension of the assault weapons ban. The ban \nis important for the safety of all Americans but is especially \nimportant for the safety of our police officers.\n  In 1994, I voted for the assault weapons ban and in March of this \nyear I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend \nthe ban for 10 years. Unfortunately, despite Senate passage of the \namendment, it appears that this important gun safety law will be \nallowed to expire. The House Republican leadership opposes \nreauthorizing the law and President Bush, though he has said he \nsupports it, has done little to keep the law alive.\n  Time is running short. We should support our law enforcement officers \nand reauthorize this common sense ban on assault weapons. Congress \nneeds to act immediately to reauthorize the ban. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of some of the organizations supporting this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n     International Association of Chiefs of Police\n     Major Cities Chiefs Association\n     Police Foundation\n     Police Executive Research Forum\n     International Brotherhood of Police Officers\n     National Association of School Resource Officers\n     National Fraternal Order of Police\n     National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives\n     Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\n     National Black Police Association\n     National League of Cities\n     US Conference of Mayors\n     National Association of Counties\n     US Conference of Catholic Bishops\n     National Education Association\n     American Bar Association\n     NAACP\n     Americans for Gun Safety\n     Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the \n         Million Mom March\n     Church Women United\n     Episcopal Church, USA\n     American Academy of Family Physicians\n     American Public Health Association\n     Family Violence Prevention Fund\n     National Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n     National Network to End Domestic Violence\n     National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems\n     National Association of Social Workers\n     Physicians for a Violence Free Society\n     American Association of Suicidology\n     Mothers Against Violence in America\n     Child Welfare League of America\n     Alliance for Justice\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9072-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET ACCESS AND DRUG SAFETY ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2328, the \nPharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2004, and to \nexplain my reasons for becoming a cosponsor of this bipartisan \nlegislation, which was introduced by Senators Dorgan and Snowe earlier \nthis year. My decision to cosponsor this bill has come after serious \nand careful deliberation. I know that there are many who oppose the \nimportation of prescription drugs, and I have carefully considered \ntheir arguments.\n  However, I have come to the conclusion that this bill can be helpful \nto ensuring that Americans have access to the drugs they need, with the \npeace of mind that the medications they are taking--or giving to a \nfamily member--are safe.\n  Mr. President, all of us are aware of the unfortunate news released \nover the last several weeks about the state of health care in our \ncountry. In many respects, we have the greatest health system in the \nworld, but far too many Americans are unable to take advantage of this \nsystem. According to data released by the Census Bureau in August, 45 \nmillion Americans were without health insurance in 2003--an increase of \n1.4 million over 2002. The primary reason for the continued increase in \nthe number of uninsured is that employers are dropping their health \ncoverage. That's right Mr. President, most of the newly-uninsured are \nworking Americans.\n  Employers are not dropping health coverage out of malice they are \ndoing so because they can no longer afford to provide this benefit. \nYear after year, health care costs increase by double digit \npercentages. The cost of employer-sponsored coverage increased by 14 \npercent in 2003. And year after year, the increase in the cost of \nprescription drugs stands out as a driver of the overall cost increase. \nOver the last three years, drug costs have increased by over 50 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I do not subscribe to or participate in the attacks on \nour prescription drug industry. The American drug industry is an \nextraordinary success story. As a result of the innovations that this \nindustry has spawned, millions of lives have been improved and saved in \nour country and around the globe. Because of the importance of these \nmedicines to our health and well-being, I have consistently supported \nsound public policies to help the industry to succeed.\n  These policies include authoring a successful statute to ensure that \ndrug manufacturers receive appropriate incentives for ensuring that \ntheir products are safe and effective for children. I have also co-\nauthored legislation to make sure that new drugs can more swiftly move \nthrough the approval pipeline and move quickly into the hands of the \npatients who need them. I have worked to create a fair balance between \nthe need to protect drug patents for their full patent life, and the \nneed to ensure that generic pharmaceuticals are able to come to market \nwhen that patent life has expired. I have always encouraged \npharmaceutical research and development. I have also supported trade \nagreements to help open international markets for American \npharmaceuticals. The American pharmaceutical industry is the best in \nthe world, and it has succeeded, and will continue to succeed, in a \ncompetitive global environment.\n  Prescription drugs are an absolutely integral part of our health care \nsystem. I am proud that many of these medicines are made in my home \nstate of Connecticut. But Mr. President, I am saddened that such a \nbasic and necessary part of modern health care is becoming unaffordable \nfor the average American--including many thousands of men, women, and \nchildren in Connecticut. Americans should not be put in the position of \nchoosing whether to purchase groceries or medicine. And yet I have \ntalked to far too many of my constituents who are faced with that \nchoice every day.\n  We have an obligation to seek opportunities to lower drug costs. I \nwas disappointed that such an opportunity was missed during our \nconsideration of the Medicare Modernization Act. That law now prohibits \nthe Federal government from using its purchasing power to bargain for \nlower drug prices. Such a measure is inconsistent with the economic \nprinciple of competition that is fundamental to our economy.\n  We are now faced with another opportunity to control prescription \ndrug costs by allowing the importation of FDA-approved prescription \ndrugs from Canada and other industrialized nations. I have long taken \nthe position that drug importation should only be allowed if we can \nensure that it is safe. I do not want affordable medicines to come at \nthe cost of quality and safety for American consumers. I have looked at \nevery importation proposal with these priorities in mind.\n  Mr. President, Senate bill 2328, while not perfect, is a sensible \napproach to the issue of drug importation. I believe that it addresses \nthe safety concerns that have been raised in the past, and in my \ndiscussions with opponents of this bill, I have yet to hear an argument \nthat makes me believe that the medicines imported under this bill would \nbe unsafe. In fact, I believe that it has the potential to be \nsignificantly safer for American consumers than the status quo. \nCurrently, an American can easily go on the Internet and order drugs \nfrom another country. But there is no guarantee that these drugs are \nsafe, and no way to prevent these drugs from entering the country. We \nare being flooded with counterfeit and compromised medicines, and \npeople are being hurt.\n  Under the Dorgan-Snowe bill, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nwould be given the authority and resources necessary to make drug \nimportation a safe proposition. Importers would be required to register \nwith the FDA, so Americans can know where it is safe to purchase \nimported medicines.\n  Mr. President, with the issue of safety addressed, this really \nbecomes an issue about what is best and what is fair for American \nconsumers. At the moment, Americans pay significantly more for \nprescription drugs than those in other industrialized nations. Based on \nthat fact, it is my belief that we should work toward a more open \nglobal market for prescription drugs, just as we do for countless other \nproducts that we trade internationally.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I am confident that the American drug \nindustry can compete with that of any other nation. I am committed to \nensuring that this continues to be true. We should, in my view, take \nsteps to bring about fairer trade, freer trade, and safer trade for \nprescription medicines. This legislation represents one such step.\n  I intend to continue to talk to all interested parties about this \nbill. If safety concerns should arise in the future that have not been \npreviously considered, I will do everything in my power to address them \nwith the sponsors of this legislation. But it is past time for us to do \nsomething about the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, and I \nsupport this bill as a step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9072-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9072-S9073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GARRETT LEE SMITH MEMORIAL ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my sincere condolences to Senator Smith and his family, as \nyesterday marked the 1-year anniversary of Garrett's passing and today \nwould have been his 23rd birthday. The Smith family has endured a \nterrible tragedy, but has taken their loss and their pain and committed \nthemselves to raising public awareness about youth suicide and\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\nthe need for appropriate mental health services.\n  Senator Smith has also worked tirelessly these past few months to \nmove the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. During a time of partisanship \nand divisiveness, a majority of members in the House and Senate have \nbeen able to set aside those differences to help expeditiously move \nthis important legislation.\n  I have had the honor and pleasure of working with my colleague from \nOregon on this very personal tribute since the beginning. As my \ncolleagues may recall, this legislation is comprised of two separate \nlegislative initiatives that were introduced earlier this year, the \nYouth Suicide Early Intervention and Prevention Expansion Act, \nsponsored by Senators Dodd and DeWine and the Campus Care and \nCounseling Act, which I introduced along with Senator DeWine.\n  The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to the increasing \nproblem of suicide among our youth as well as providing additional \nresources to our Nation's colleges and universities as they struggle to \noffer the kinds of support students need to grow and achieve \nacademically as well as personally. Information, outreach and access to \nmental and behavioral health services is becoming an increasingly \nimportant part of that equation.\n  The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act contains many important provisions \nthat I hope will help to stem the growing numbers of youth suicides in \nthis country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, suicide and self-inflicted injuries remain a pressing \npublic health concern. We hope this legislation will help to change \nthis by enabling States, local communities and institutions of higher \neducation to implement effective youth suicide prevention and \nintervention strategies.\n  Two months ago, a unanimous Senate passed the Garrett Lee Smith \nMemorial Act. Since that time, the bill has undergone what I would \nconsider to be considerable changes to address concerns raised by \nEnergy and Commerce Chairman Barton and others.\n  I have always been willing to entertain and accommodate issues that \nhave been raised that have related to the substance of this bill. I am \ndeeply concerned, however, by the insistence of some in the other body \nto inject partisan ideology in this bill.\n  Just prior to the August recess, a few members of the other body \nscuttled movement on the bill when they insisted on adding language \nthat would create a new parental consent standard, layered onto one \nthat has been in law, under the General Education Provisions Act, GEPA, \nwhich was recently updated as part of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  While the majority has made it clear they will not abide changes in \nother parts of the No Child Left Behind Act, even common sense fixes \nthat school administrators, principals, teachers, and parents have been \ncalled for, they insisted on language--which could prevent the very \nyoung people we are trying to help from accessing the mental health \nservices they need.\n  We worked in good faith over the past month to come up with a \ncompromise, and while the language has improved from the version \ninitially proposed, it still raises some fundamental concerns.\n  I am appreciative of the efforts of Senator Smith to add a \nclarification that the language has no impact on the No Child Left \nBehind Act. Unfortunately, the language does not include a similar \nassurance on the standards for parental notice and consent included \nunder sections 444 and 445 of the General Education Provisions Act.\n  As a result, we have created a different standard for assessments, \nprograms, and services in elementary and secondary schools relating to \nyouth suicide, as compared to other health and mental health \nassessments, programs, and services that occur in our schools. Not only \ndoes this language set a new precedent, we are adding a confusing and \nburdensome layer of requirements on school personnel at a time when \nthey are struggling to meet the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act \nand trying to do the best they can to help our young people.\n  However, in recognizing how important the overall bill is to our \nNation's young people and college students, and the commitment of the \nSenator from Oregon to address this language in the future. I support \npassage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. I praise my colleagues \nin both Chambers for their continued diligence on this bill and \nappreciate the willingness of the majority and minority leaders to set \naside time so that this important piece of legislation can finally move \nto the President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9073-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF SUMMIT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, ASHLAND, KY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

On June 22, \n2004, the Schools of Distinction Awards program gave Summit Elementary \nan Award of Distinction for their dedication to excellence in \neducation.\n  The Schools of Distinction Awards program was created by Intel \nCorporation, Scholastic Inc., and the Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence \nFoundation, to recognize the finest K through 12 schools in the United \nStates. Winners of the program's awards are selected based on their \nimplementation of creative programs that foster improvement in \neducation.\n  Summit Elementary School received the award for its practice of \ninvolving the parents of schoolchildren in the educational process. As \nthe father of nine children, I am aware of the great importance of \nparental involvement in education. It can't be overestimated. It is a \nmotivator to the children, a guidance to the teachers and a helping \nhand to all involved. I believe that any school which recognizes the \nneed for parental involvement is on the right track and certainly \ndeserves a School of Distinction Award.\n  In closing, I thank, not only Summit Elementary, but the parents, \nteachers, and students of this fine institution. The effort they have \nall put into ensuring that the future of America is bright is a \nblessing on us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9073-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9073-S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING LUTHERAN SOCIAL SERVICES OF MICHIGAN FOR 70 YEARS OF \n                   SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

We would also like to recognize and honor LSSM's \nstaff and volunteers for their tireless efforts and outstanding \ncommitment to helping those in need.\n  LSSM's legacy of service dates back to the early years of the 20th \ncentury when the Lutheran churches in Detroit formed the Missionsbund, \na society dedicated to providing humanitarian assistance in Detroit. \nThe Lutheran Inner Mission League of Greater Detroit grew out of this \neffort and was soon thereafter called the Lutheran Charities and \nformally incorporated in 1934. Under the leadership of its first \nexecutive director, the Rev. Carl E. Schaffnit, its efforts included \nchild welfare work, a settlement house, and services to the elderly. By \n1959 Lutheran Charities gained a new name, the Lutheran Social Services \nof Michigan, and has since expanded its mission to serve others in the \nname of faith with 80 programs in 44 cities throughout Michigan's lower \npeninsula.\n  Over 20,000 people from diverse backgrounds feel the warm embrace of \nLSSM on an annual basis by utilizing the many services it has to offer. \nLSSM's excellence can be seen by the success of its programs in the \nrealm of foster care, adoption, childcare, subsidized housing, nursing \nhomes, community centers, and services to the homeless, refugees, and \npersons with developmental disabilities. Its efforts to preserve and \nenhance human dignity across Michigan have created hope for so many. We \nshare this organization's vision for a community that upholds human \ndignity, decries complacency and affirms equality and justice. We are \nsure that our Senate colleagues will join us in offering our heartfelt\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\ncongratulations for this long and outstanding record of \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9074-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN HONOR OF THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CENTER FOR PROCESS ANALYTICAL \n                               CHEMISTRY\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words \nin honor of the 20th anniversary of the Center for Process Analytical \nChemistry, located on the University of Washington campus. The center \nhas made numerous contributions to the world of manufacturing, the \nUniversity of Washington, and the progress of its students that I wish \nto recognize today.\n  In 1984, CPAC was initiated by the National Science Foundation as an \nIndustry/University Cooperative Research Center with the specific \nmission of supporting the restoration and continuous improvement of \nU.S. industry by enhancing globally competitive manufacturing.\n  Through the discovery and development of new analytical technologies \nfor use in the manufacturing process, CPAC research has developed new \nmeasurement tools to provide continuous real-time measurement needed \nfor industrial and environmental processes. The information gathered \nwith these tools is used to implement process optimization and control, \nthus enabling product and process quality management, environmental \nprotection, pollution prevention, crisis alerting, and worker safety.\n  For 20 years, award-winning faculty, research scientists, \npostdoctoral associates, visiting scientists, and graduate students \nhave gathered at CPAC to collaborate on research projects. As a result, \nover 100 graduate students have been granted their Ph.D.s while working \nwith CPAC, making immediate contributions to their employers because of \ntheir exposure to the challenges of industry.\n  Through partnership with leaders in industry, and the sharing of \nresearch funding between the University of Washington, leading global \ncorporations such as the Boeing Company and Systematix Controls, \nseveral national laboratories, and the National Institute of Standards \n& Technology, CPAC has produced more than 20 patented inventions, \nmeeting the demand for advanced technology in the aerospace, petroleum, \nchemical manufacturing, pharmaceutical and food industries.\n  Streamlining the manufacturing process is critical to meeting the \never-changing demands of the world's economy. Long-term economic \ntrends--including technological advances and increasing globalization--\nwill continue to increase the demand for greater efficiencies, and \nimproved processes. The fact that the majority of original industry \npartners continue to work with the CPAC to improve their products is a \ntestament to the relevancy and quality of the work conducted at the \ncenter. I congratulate the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry on \ntheir 20th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9074-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JACK VALENTI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nmy good friend Jack Valenti, who retired last week after 38 years as \npresident and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, MPAA, \nand its international counterpart, the Motion Picture Association, MPA.\n  Jack came to MPAA in 1966 directly from the White House, where he had \nserved with distinction as special assistant to President Lyndon \nJohnson. His Government background prepared him to become an effective \nambassador for the motion picture industry both at home and abroad. \nDuring his long and productive tenure at MPAA, he worked with eight \nPresidents of the United States and established an international \n``diplomatic corps'' with offices around the world to promote the movie \nindustry and protect its intellectual property rights.\n  When Jack Valenti took the helm at MPAA, its member companies were \nfocused on domestic production and distribution, with little thought \nabout international markets. Today American films, TV programs, and \nhome entertainment are shown in more than 150 countries worldwide, with \ninternational revenues of more than $16.5 billion a year.\n  Along with his work in the global arena, Jack will be remembered as \nthe pioneer of the film industry's voluntary movie rating system. In \ndeveloping the system, Jack reached out to film studios, independent \nproducers, writers, directors, theater owners, the religious community, \nand children's advocacy groups. The resulting system helps families to \nmake informed decisions about the movies they see.\n  Under Jack Valenti's leadership, the U.S. film industry has thrived \nand remained a vibrant source of entertainment, creativity, jobs, and \neconomic growth. Along with moviegoers across America and round the \nworld, I thank him for his brilliant work and wish him all the best in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9074-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9074-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9074-5", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 5006.

A bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act \nof 1998 through fiscal year 2007, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join with Senator Biden today to \nintroduce legislation reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation \nAct of 1998 (TFCA) through fiscal year 2007. Since its creation, the \nTFCA has helped conserve 40 million acres of tropical forests in the \nworld.\n  The current TFCA authorization, P.L. 107-26, expires at the end of \nfiscal year 2004. The House of Representatives has already voted in \nfavor of H.R. 4654, which is identical to the legislation we introduce \ntoday. We hope the Senate will be able to take speedy action on this \nimportant program.\n  Senator Biden and I proposed TFCA in 1998 based on the 1991 \nEnterprise for Americas Initiative (EAI) that allows the President to \nrestructure debt in exchange for conservation efforts in Latin America. \nThe TFCA expanded on the EAI and allows protection of threatened \ntropical forests worldwide through ``debt-for-nature'' mechanisms.\n  With TFCA, the State Department has reached agreements generating \n$70.4 million in long-term commitments for tropical forest \nconservation. In addition, private donors, including the Nature \nConservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society \nand Conservation International, have contributed more than $5 million \nto TFCA swaps, leveraging U.S. Government funds.\n  Seven TFCA agreements have been concluded to date in Bangladesh, El \nSalvador, Belize, Peru, the Philippines, Panama and Colombia. With the \nreauthorization of TFCA, the State Department will be able to complete \nnegotiations with Jamaica and Sri Lanka, and pursue agreement with \nGuatemala, Ecuador, Paraguay, St. Vincent, Botswana, Costa Rica, the \nDominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Kenya.\n  This legislation authorizes appropriations for debt reduction for \neligible countries through fiscal year 2007 at $20,000,000 in fiscal \nyear 2005 (as the President requested); $25,000,000 in fiscal year \n2006; and $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2007.\n  A new section authorizes that funds can be used for audits and \nevaluations of the program. In addition, an amendment allows for TFCA \ndebt reduction agreements to redirect reduced principal payments for \nforest conservation activities. Current law allows only the redirection \nof reduced interest payments into forest conservation funds.\n  The debt-for-nature mechanisms in the TFCA have proven to be an \neffective, market-oriented tool to leverage scarce funds available to \ninternational conservation. The host country places an amount in its \ntropical forest fund that typically exceeds the cost to the U.S. \nGovernment of the debt reduction agreement.\n  In addition to forest conservation and debt relief, TFCA strengthens \ncivil society in participating countries by creating local foundations \nto support small grants to nongovernmental organizations and local \ncommunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the grant program of the Department of \nJustice for reentry of offenders into the community, to establish a \ntask force on Federal programs and activities relating to the reentry \nof offenders into the community, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSantorum today and introduce a bill that will have a dramatic and \npositive effect in the lives of individuals re-entering society after \nincarceration. The Second Chance Act: Community Safety Through \nRecidivism Prevention is a bill that will not only protect our Nation's \ncitizens but will more importantly help to reduce recidivism in our \nNation.\n  A hallmark of any just society lies in its ability to protect the \ninterest of all its citizens, and I am proud that the United States is \na leader in this regard. Yet, while we continue to strive toward this \nlofty goal, we must realize that there are areas in which we, as a \nsociety and as government, must do more to improve. Nowhere is that \nmore apparent than in our Nation's prison system.\n  Today, we have challenges within the prison system that range from \nhigh recidivism rates to budgetary and safety concerns. With this bill, \nwe will be able to address this pressing problem within our society. \nAlready we have seen innovative and model programs within the States \nand the faith community, and I am proud to say that Kansas is a leader \nin this regard. However, we must stimulate innovation in this area on a \nnational level, and that is what this bill will accomplish. It is \nparamount that we ensure the safety of our communities and ensure that \nthose incarcerated have the tools necessary to succeed after they \nrejoin society.\n  With this bill, we will be able to combat the extremely high \nrecidivism rates plaguing the prison system, currently as high as 70 \npercent, as well as address the financial burdens that hinder many of \nour State penitentiaries. We will also be able to help those \nincarcerated make positive changes within their lives so that when they \ndo rejoin society, they will be able to do so with the confidence of \nknowing that they can contribute to society in a positive manner.\n  Specifically, this bill facilitates change within our current \ncorrectional system, and promotes coordination with the Federal \ngovernment to better assist those returning to our communities after \nincarceration and their children. The bill reauthorizes the Re-Entry \nDemonstration Project with an enhanced focus on jobs, housing, \nsubstance-abuse treatment, mental health, and the children and families \nof those incarcerated. The bill authorizes $160 million over a period \nof two years to fund these demonstration program and creates \nperformance outcome standards and deliverables. It will also encourage \nStates to enhance their re-entry services and systems with grants to \nfund the creation or enhancement of State re-entry councils for \nstrategic planning and review the State barriers and resources that \nexist.\n  Additionally, the bill creates a Federal interagency taskforce to \nfacilitate collaboration and identify innovative programs and \ninitiatives. The taskforce will review and report to Congress on the \nFederal barriers that exist to successful re-entry.\n  Finally, the bill will create a $45 million two-year mentoring \nprogram geared toward reducing recidivism and the societal costs of \nrecidivism. This mentoring program will help ex-offenders re-integrate \ninto their communities. This initiative will specifically harness the \nresources and experience of community-based organizations in helping \nreturning ex-offenders.\n  We have an incredible opportunity to re-shape the way in which this \nNation's prison systems operate. Much like welfare reform in the mid \n1990s, we have a chance to make real and effective change in an area \nwhere change is sorely needed. I look forward to pushing this \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2790. A bill to provide the conveyance of certain public land in \nnorthwestern New Mexico by resolving a dispute associated with coal \npreference right lease interests on the land; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing the \nBisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act, which will resolve a conflict \nregarding coal mining leases in New Mexico and which will confirm the \ncompletion of all Navajo Nation land selections in New Mexico under the \nNavajo-Hopi Settlement Act. Arch Coal Company and the Navajo Nation \nhave been deadlocked within the Department of Interior appeals process \nregarding certain preference right lease applications (PRLAs) in the \nBisti region of northwestern New Mexico. When enacted, this legislation \nwill resolve a complex set of issues arising from legal rights the Arch \nCoal Company acquired in Federal lands, which are now situated among \nlands which constitute tribal property and the allotments of members of \nthe Navajo Nation. Both Arch Coal and the Navajo Nation support this \nlegislation to resolve the situation in a manner that is mutually \nbeneficial. In addition, this legislation will serve to mandate the \ncompletion of a long-standing set of land selections the Navajo Nation \nmade under the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act. In 1984 Amendments to that \nAct, Congress provided the Navajo Nation with its final opportunity, \nwithin 18 months of passage of the Amendments, to select lands in New \nMexico as provided in Section 11 of the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act. The \nNavajo Nation exercised its rights under the 1984 Amendments, but since \nhas sought to review, revise, and seek to select other lands to the \npotential detriment of mineral lessees holding leases on Federal public \nlands near the Navajo Reservation. This legislation would clarify \nCongress' intent that the Nation no longer has land selection rights \navailable to it in New Mexico under the Navajo-Hope Settlement Act.\n  There are many reasons the solution embodied in this bill achieves \nbroad benefits to the interested parties and the public. It will \nresolve a long-standing conflict between the Navajo Nation and Arch \nCoal and allow the Navajo Nation to complete the land selections in New \nMexico that were made in the 1980s to promote tribal member \nresettlement following the partition of lands in Arizona to the Hopi \nTribe. Specifically, Section 4(a)(1) will clarify and confirm that the \nNavajo Nation already has selected the lands to which it is entitled \nunder the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act and has no further rights under \nthat Act to select lands in New Mexico other than those already \nselected by the Navajo Nation in the 1980s.\n  The bill also guarantees that Arch Coal, Inc. will be compensated for \nthe economic value of its coal reserves. An independent panel will make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of Interior regarding the fair market \nvalue of the coal reserves, gives the company bidding rights, protects \na State's financial interest in its share of federal Mineral Leasing \nAct payments, and allows the Navajo Nation beneficial ownership in \ntheir lands.\n  The Secretary of Interior will issue a certificate of bidding rights \nto Arch Coal upon relinquishment of its interests in the PRLAs. The \namount of that certificate will equal the fair market value of the coal \nreserves as defined by the Department of Interior's regulations. A \npanel consisting of representatives of the Department of Interior, Arch \nCoal, and the Governors of Wyoming and New Mexico will help determine \nfair market value. While the Interior Department is authorized to \nexchange PRLAs for bidding rights, the Department has not done so, \nlargely because of the difficulty it perceives in determining the fair \nmarket value of the coal reserves. The panel method in this legislation \nwill promote the objectivity of that process.\n  Upon the relinquishment of the PRLAs and the issuance of a \ncertificate of bidding rights, the Department of Interior will execute \npatents to the Navajo Nation of the lands encompassed by the PRLAs. \nThis is a win-win situation for all parties involved; is endorsed by \nthe affected parties, and is a fair resolution to this on-going \nproblem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bisti PRLA Dispute \n     Resolution Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

PERIODS OF DEPLOYMENTS OF RESERVES OVERSEAS.\n\n       (a) United States Central Command Deployments.--\n       (1) Limitation.--During a period when there is in effect a \n     policy of assigning units or members of one or more of the \n     active components of the Armed Forces to duty in the area of \n     responsibility of the United States Central Command for a \n     specified period of time of not less than one year, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall provide that the length of such an \n     assignment in the case of members of the reserve components \n     of the Armed Forces may not exceed the length of such period \n     for the corresponding active component reduced by the period \n     of time between the date of entry of the reserve component \n     members onto active duty and the date of the deployment of \n     such members for such assignment.\n       (2) Transition.--Paragraph (1) applies to members of \n     reserve components assigned to duty in the area of \n     responsibility of the United States Central Command on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act and to such \n     members assigned to such duty before such date who as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act have more than 90 days \n     remaining in such assignment.\n       (b) Communication of Lengths of Deployment Periods to \n     Reserves in Operation Iraqi Freedom.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Members of all components of the Armed Forces, active \n     and reserve, exhibit a remarkable commitment and willingness \n     to serve their country in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other \n     United States military efforts around the world and, in doing \n     so, frequently face grave risks and difficulties.\n       (B) While the members of the Armed Forces have clearly and \n     consistently demonstrated their dedication to duty, much \n     uncertainty has arisen among them about the lengths of their \n     deployments and when they will be returned to their loved \n     ones. This confusion impairs our troops' morale and places \n     undue strain on their families and their civilian employers.\n       (C) Fairness to the men and women of the Armed Forces \n     deployed overseas requires that the Department of Defense--\n       (i) have clear policies regarding lengths of deployment \n     periods; and\n       (ii) communicate these policies and other deployment-\n     related information to them and their families.\n       (D) While many military units were deployed months before \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched on March 19, 2003, the \n     Department of Defense did not announce a policy about the \n     length of deployments until August 2003.\n       (E) Even after the Department of Defense issued its so-\n     called ``one year boots-on-the-ground'' policy regarding \n     lengths of deployment periods, many of the members of units \n     deployed overseas in Operation Iraqi Freedom learned shortly \n     before their scheduled return dates that their deployments \n     would\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n     be extended for months beyond the one-year period provided \n     under that policy.\n       (2) Report.--\n       (A) Requirement for report.--Not later than March 1, 2005, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a report on Department of Defense policies governing the \n     length of deployment periods applicable to members of reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces in connection with Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom, and on the communication between the \n     Department of Defense and reserve component personnel and \n     their families regarding the length of the deployment \n     periods.\n       (B) Consultation requirement.--In preparing the report \n     under this section the Secretary shall consult with the \n     Chairman and other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \n     with such other officials as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (C) Content.--The report under this paragraph shall contain \n     a discussion of the matters described in subparagraph (A), \n     including the following matters:\n       (i) The process by which the Department of Defense \n     determined its policy regarding the length of deployment \n     periods.\n       (ii) The reason that no such policy was in place before \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom began.\n       (iii) A comparison of the policy during Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom with Department of Defense deployment policies that \n     applied to previous contingency operations.\n       (iv) The timeliness of the process for notifying reserve \n     component units for activation.\n       (v) The process for communicating with activated reserve \n     component members and their families about demobilization \n     schedules.\n       (vi) The family support programs provided by the National \n     Guard and other reserve components for families of activated \n     Reserves.\n       (vii) An assessment of lessons learned about how the \n     increased operations tempo of the National Guard and other \n     reserve components can be expected to affect readiness, \n     recruitment and retention, civilian employers of Reserves, \n     and equipment and supply resources of the National Guard and \n     the other reserve components.\n       (D) Matters for Particular Emphasis.--In the discussion of \n     the matters included in the report under this subsection, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall place particular emphasis on--\n       (i) lessons learned, including deficiencies identified; and\n       (ii) near-term and long-term corrective actions to address \n     the identified deficiencies.\n       (E) Form of report.--The report shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More children and young adults die from suicide each \n     year than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, \n     stroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\n       (2) Over 4,000 children and young adults tragically take \n     their lives every year, making suicide the third overall \n     cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24. According to \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is \n     the third overall cause of death among college-age students.\n       (3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n     and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, children and young adults accounted for 15 \n     percent of all suicides completed in 2000.\n       (4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in children and \n     young adults tripled.\n       (5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among young \n     adults ages 15 to 19 increased 11 percent.\n       (6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among children \n     ages 10 to 14 increased 109 percent.\n       (7) According to the National Center of Health Statistics, \n     suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 \n     times the national average for other groups, with young \n     people ages 15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.\n       (8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public \n     health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems \n     and that youth suicide early intervention and prevention \n     activities are national priorities.\n       (9) Youth suicide early intervention and prevention have \n     been listed as urgent public health priorities by the \n     President's New Freedom Commission in Mental Health (2002), \n     the Institute of Medicine's Reducing Suicide: A National \n     Imperative (2002), the National Strategy for Suicide \n     Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action (2001), and the \n     Surgeon General's Call to Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).\n       (10) Many States have already developed comprehensive \n     statewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention \n     strategies that seek to provide effective early intervention \n     and prevention services.\n       (11) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college \n     counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of \n     students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, \n     the American College Health Association found that 61 percent \n     of college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent \n     said they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 \n     percent felt suicidal.\n       (12) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of \n     depression among college students. According to a survey \n     described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, \n     2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2 \n     percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers \n     recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for \n     school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self-\n     medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third \n     leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''.\n       (13) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in \n     Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-\n     2001) at Kansas State University stated that ``students are \n     experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than \n     they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education, \n     February 14, 2003).\n       (14) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on \n     Drug Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college \n     students use illicit drugs.\n       (15) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also \n     reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are \n     dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In \n     addition, the study found that ``serious mental illness is \n     highly correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among \n     adults with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were \n     dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the \n     rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 \n     percent.''.\n       (16) A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center \n     Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the \n     increasing number of students with more serious psychological \n     problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric \n     services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing \n     demand for services without an appropriate increase in \n     resources.\n       (17) The International Association of Counseling Services \n     accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n     1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher's Survey of \n     Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to \n     students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at \n     institutions of higher education with more than 15,000 \n     students.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 127\n\n       Whereas across the United States and around the world, \n     people of all ages and walks of life collectively witnessed \n     an event of immense tragedy on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the events of that day instantly transformed many \n     lives, some through personal loss and many others through an \n     unfamiliar sense of individual and national vulnerability;\n       Whereas an unprecedented, historic bonding of the people of \n     the United States arose from the collective shock, unifying \n     the United States in a sustained outpouring of national \n     spirit, pride, selflessness, generosity, courage, and \n     service;\n       Whereas on that day and the immediate days that followed, \n     many brave people heroically, tirelessly, and courageously \n     participated in an extraordinarily difficult and dangerous \n     rescue and recovery effort, in many cases voluntarily putting \n     their own well-being at risk;\n       Whereas September 11 will never and should never be just \n     another day in the hearts and minds of all people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the creation of memorials and monuments honoring \n     the lives lost on September 11, 2001, as well as the efforts \n     of those who participated in rescue and recovery and \n     voluntary service efforts, are necessary, proper, and \n     fitting, but alone cannot fully capture the desire of the \n     United States to pay tribute in a meaningful way;\n       Whereas it is fitting and essential to establish a lasting, \n     meaningful, and positive legacy of service for future \n     generations as a tribute to those heroes of September 11, \n     2001;\n       Whereas many citizens wish to memorialize September 11 by \n     engaging in personal and individual acts of community service \n     or other giving activities as part of a national day of \n     recognition and tribute; and\n       Whereas to lose this opportunity to bring people together \n     for such an important endeavor would be a tragedy unto \n     itself: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     designate September 11 as an annually recognized day of \n     voluntary service, charity, and compassion; and\n       (2) Congress urges the President to issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe this \n     day with appropriate and personal expressions of service, \n     charity, and compassion toward others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9086-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONVEYANCE OF THE REAL PROPERTY LOCATED AT 1081 WEST MAIN STREET IN \n                             RAVENNA, OHIO\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

For the information of all Senators, on Monday, following\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nmorning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. The chairman and ranking member will be \nhere on Monday to work through the remaining amendments. There are \ncurrently four amendments pending. Additional amendments will be \noffered on Monday.\n  Under the previous order, we will vote in relation to the Schumer \nHAZMAT truck amendment at 5:30 p.m. Any other votes ordered during \nMonday's session will be stacked to occur immediately after the vote in \nrelation to the Schumer amendment. Therefore, Senators should expect \nmore than one vote on Monday afternoon.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that next week the Rosh Hashanah \nholiday begins Wednesday. It is imperative that we finish the bill \nprior to that time. Senators should expect busy days during next week \nwith numerous rollcall votes.\n  Finally, I thank every one for their hard work this week. Earlier \nthis week we were able to expedite and pass an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to help fund FEMA's efforts in Florida. Last night \nwe passed S. 1368 relating to awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to \nthe Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King. \nChairman McCain secured passage of H.R. 361, the Sports Agent \nResponsibility and Trust Act.\n  Yesterday the Senate passed S. Res. 421, which condemned the \nterrorist attack in Beslan, Russia, and sent condolences, on behalf of \nthe leaders and the U.S. Senate, to the families of those victims.\n  Earlier this week we confirmed three additional district judges, and \nI hope we will continue that pattern of considering judicial \nnominations before we conclude our work this year.\n  Finally, on a personal note, our colleague, Senator Smith of Oregon, \nwho is occupying the chair now, was on the floor of the Senate last \nnight to ensure that the Senate passed S. 2634, the Garrett Lee Smith \nMemorial Act, which the Democratic leader, our leadership, and both \nsides of the aisle joined together to unanimously support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9087-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, this year marks the 60th anniversary of \nthe GI bill of rights.\n  That law, debated and passed in the same week Allied Forces invaded \nEurope, not only demonstrated America's enormous gratitude to the men \nand women who fought for its freedom, it creates the foundations of the \nextraordinary prosperity that followed the end of the war.\n  The bill encapsulated all that was best in America. Those who \ndefended the American dream were offered a share of the American dream.\n  Harry Colmery, a Republican from Pennsylvania who served as the \nNational Commander of the American Legion at the time, wrote that ``it \n[was] the duty, the responsibility, and the desire of our grateful \npeople to see to it that those who served actively in the armed \nservices . . . not only should not be penalized as a result of their \nwar service, but also that upon their return, they should be aided in \nreaching the position which they might normally have expected had the \nwar not interrupted their careers.''\n  Our military has changed a great deal in the past 60 years.\n  Increasingly, our national security is defended by members of our \nNational Guard and Reserve forces--men and women who volunteer to put \naside their jobs, and leave their families and communities any time our \nNation is threatened.\n  Forty percent of the troops fighting in Iraq are members of the \nNational Guard or Reserve. One-hundred-sixty have given their lives.\n  Just as Congress thanked the men who liberated Europe and Asia and \npreserved democracy 60 years ago, the time has now come for Congress to \nrepay our debt to the reservists fighting the war on terror around the \nworld and struggling to bring peace and security to the people of Iraq.\n  The time has come for America to show a commitment to them that \nmatches their dedication and service to us.\n  Many of the current benefits, policies, and support systems for \nreservists have been in place for decades and their value has eroded \nover time.\n  Moreover, the experience of reservists in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and \nIraq has demonstrated serious gaps in the benefits we offer them.\n  Moreover, even as we place a heavier burden on reservists, commanders \nwarn that lower recruitment numbers and higher rates of retirement pose \na threat to the continued readiness of our Reserve forces.\n  We cannot afford to close our eyes and hope this problem solves \nitself.\n  We have only a handful of weeks before the 108th Congress adjourns.\n  National security should sit alone at the top of our agenda, and \nthere are few things more important than ensuring our Reserve forces \nhave the tools they need to achieve the missions we assign them.\n  Therefore, in the spirit of the GI bill, in gratitude for their valor \nand sacrifice, and in recognition of our growing reliance on a powerful \nand effective Reserve force, I am introducing the National Guard and \nReserve bill of rights.\n  This bill codifies a set of rights the men and women serving in our \nNational Guard and Reserve have earned with their service to our \nNation.\n  First, every reservist has the right to straight answers about their \ndeployments. In the last few years, the Department of Defense has often \nfailed to communicate to citizen soldiers and their families when they \ncan expect to be reunited.\n  South Dakota's 740th Transportation Company, for example, was first \ntold in February 2004 that their work in Iraq was over and that they \nwould be heading home.\n  In the final days before their departure, they received word that \nthey would remain in Iraq until April, 1 year after they had first \nreached Iraq.\n  As this date approached, their deployment was extended for an \nadditional 90 days. These soldiers ultimately returned home in July, \nnearly 18 months after their activation date.\n  This kind of situation undermines troop morale and places an unfair \nburden on their families, businesses, and communities that rely on \nGuard and Reserve troops. I believe we owe our soldiers honest answers.\n  My bill would require the Pentagon to treat Active Duty and Reserve \nforces equally. If active duty forces are deployed abroad for 1 year, \nreservists would also be activated for 1 year.\n  It would also require the Department of Defense to conduct a \n``lessons learned'' review of Reserve forces' deployments in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, so that the miscommunications and mistakes reservists have \nexperienced recently will not be repeated in the future.\n  Second, every reservist has the right to the best equipment the \nNation has\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nto offer. Reservists are serving on the front lines alongside full-time \nsoldiers. They are facing the same bullets.\n  They deserve state-of-the-art equipment. However, since the beginning \nof the Iraq war, we have heard disturbing reports from many Guard and \nReserve families in South Dakota, and from national media, that \nreservists have experienced severe shortages of body armor, night-\nvision goggles, rifles, and other critical equipment.\n  I am calling on the GAO to conduct a study about equipment \nreconstitution in the Guard and Reserve following Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom to assess their equipment needs for future \ncontingencies.\n  Third, every reservist has the right to adequate, timely, and \nproblem-free compensation.\n  The GAO has issued two reports in the last several months that call \nattention to deep-rooted problems in the automated pay system for \nreservists.\n  Their most recent report found that as many as 95 percent of \nreservists have experienced pay problems during their deployments in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  My bill will create a position within the Defense Department whose \nprimary responsibility will be to implement the GAO's recommendations \nand fix the problems with the pay system once and for all.\n  I also believe that reservists should be compensated for their \nincreased commitment for the last few years. My bill will double the \nvalue of re-enlistment bonuses and extend them to career reservists who \nserve longer than 14 years.\n  Fourth, every reservist has the right to quality, affordable health \ncare.\n  For 2 years, Senator Lindsey Graham and I have been working across \nthe aisle to provide access for all reservists to the military's \nTRICARE health care system.\n  This initiative is critical to maintaining readiness among Guard and \nReserve units, and will serve as an important recruiting and retention \ntool as well.\n  My bill would permanently provide all reservists with access to the \nmilitary's TRICARE health care system, ensuring that Guard and Reserve \npersonnel are fit to answer duty's call whenever it comes.\n  Fifth, every reservist has the right to child care during his or her \ndeployment. When members of the Guard and Reserve are deployed for \nduty, many leave behind families with small children.\n  For many, Reserve duty makes child care become both more necessary \nand less affordable. No reservist should have to sacrifice care for his \nor her children in order to serve their country.\n  That is why my bill, following on the good work of my colleague \nSenator Murray, would increase funding for child care for families with \nparents deployed away from home.\n  Sixth, every reservist has the right to employment when he or she \nreturns from active duty. We cannot ask reservists to fight for their \ncountry and then force them to fight for their job once they come home.\n  Unfortunately, the number of complaints filed by reservists who \nexperience problems with returning to their jobs after a deployment has \nrisen by 50 percent since the war on terrorism began, and there may be \nhundreds or even thousands of other reservists who have had problems \nbut have not filed complaints.\n   My bill will strengthen the protections USERRA offers and ensure \nthat reservists know their rights.\n  Seventh, every reservist has the right to education benefits. The \nMontgomery GI bill, passed in 1984, set reservists' educational \nbenefits at 47 percent of the benefits offered to Active Duty soldiers.\n  Twenty years later, that proportion has fallen to only 27 percent. \nThis erosion is even greater considering the high increases in the cost \nof higher education.\n  My bill would raise reservists' education benefits to the level set \nby the Montgomery GI bill at the time of its passage, and would ensure \nthat the value of these benefits rise at the same pace as the cost of \nhigher education.\n  Eighth, every reservist has the right to a fair retirement plan. As \ndeployments grow longer, citizen soldiers are being prevented from \ncontributing to their civilian retirement plans.\n  Service to one's country should not come at the expense of a secure \nretirement.\n  My colleague, Senator Corzine, has led the fight to improve the Guard \nand Reserve retirement plan, which has not changed in over 50 years.\n  Like Senator Corzine's bill, my legislation would reduce reservist \nretirement age from 60 to 55, a proposal that is endorsed by several \nleading advocates for National Guard and Reserve personnel.\n  This proposal is especially critical for States like South Dakota, \nwhere many reservists have jobs on farms or with other small businesses \nthat have no civilian retirement plans.\n  Finally, every reservist has the right to representation at the \nhighest levels of the Department of Defense. Our military force--Active \nand Reserve--is undergoing a transformation to make it better suited to \nconfront the security challenges of the 21st century. We must ensure \nthat the needs and concerns of National Guard and Reserve personnel \ncontinue to be heard at the highest levels of the Defense Department \nduring this transformation.\n  My bill will create a new Deputy Undersecretary for Reserve Affairs \nwho will participate in all decisions involving reservists and carry \nreservists' concerns to the most senior Pentagon leaders.\n  These nine rights should be guaranteed every member of our Reserve \nforces. Serving in the Guard or Reserves is no longer a one-weekend-a-\nmonth commitment.\n  Reservists are serving on the front lines, facing the same bullets as \nfull-time soldiers. Battlefield commanders are relying on them to serve \nwith courage and skill, and reservists are meeting the challenge.\n  The sacrifices we ask of reservists are many. But as the authors of \nthe GI bill realized 60 years ago, America owes a debt to the men and \nwomen who defend its freedom. We should not compound their sacrifices \nthrough neglect or indifference. The brave men and women of the Guard \nand Reserve have earned the benefits and improvements I am proposing.\n  The time has come for the Government to recognize this new role and \nredouble our support for these courageous Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in \nsupport of the National Guard and Reserve bill of rights, and to move \nswiftly to pass it into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/10/senate-section/article/S9088-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9088-S9090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HOLLOW TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I begin my words today by reading from the \n33rd verse of the 18th chapter of the Second Book of Samuel, the King \nJames version of the Holy Bible.\n\n       And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber \n     over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my \n     son, Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died \n     for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow will be a day of painful remembrance for our \nNation. The passage of time has done little to numb the anguish of that \nSeptember morning 3 years ago--how we do remember--when 19 ruthless \nterrorists commandeered four commercial aircraft and transformed them \ninto the stuff of nightmares. The memories are still too raw, the \nimages are still to vivid, the toll of human misery is still too \noverwhelming.\n  And so we remember, and in our remembrance we pay homage to the \nvictims and the heroes of 9/11. But we owe more. We owe more to those \nwho perished on September 11, 2001, than merely remembrance. And we owe \nmore to the American people than merely paying lipservice to their \nsafety.\n\n  That is the primary reason that we are here today, debating the \nHomeland Security funding bill. We are here because of the rescue \nworkers who moved so quickly, so valiantly, to save lives, only to \nsacrifice their own. We are here because of those thousands of men and \nwomen who, on that crystal clear morning of September 11, 3 years ago, \nwere sitting at their desks, walking through the halls, doing their \njobs, only to have such brutality abruptly\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nend their lives. We are here, Senators, because we can never forget--\nnever forget--that day, and because we never want to repeat that day of \nhorrors.\n  Congress has passed a blitz of legislation and appropriated billions \nof dollars over the past 3 years in response to the 9/11 attacks on \nAmerica. Congress overcame the objections of the President and created \na new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security. With great fanfare \nand acclaim, we passed legislation to strengthen both port and border \nsecurity. We have tightened airport security, turned our most prominent \npublic buildings into barricaded fortresses, and acquiesced in the \nsuspension of basic rights to privacy in the name of security.\n  And frankly, to little avail--to little avail, I say. Today, 3 years \nout from the 9/11 attacks, we are living under the yoke of an \n``imminent'' threat of future attacks. Sectors of New York, New Jersey, \nand Washington are functioning under a heightened ``orange alert'' \nthreat level while the rest of the Nation perches uneasily under the \numbrella of a yellow, or elevated, threat. Security at virtually any \nmajor public event--from the political conventions to the Olympics--is \noppressive. We quake, we tremble, at the notion that the November \nelections might spark another devastating terrorist attack on these \nUnited States.\n  We can talk until we are blue in the face about all the steps we have \ntaken to enhance security since 9/11, but the bottom line is this: Does \nanybody really feel safer and more secure than they did 3 years ago?\n  Much of the legislation that Congress has passed since 9/11 was \nenvisioned as a legacy to those 3,000 men and women who lost their \nlives on that day 3 years ago. Yet, I fear it is becoming a hollow \nlegacy. Congress has been thwarted at every turn by a White House that \nspends lavishly on rhetoric yet demonstrates a pinch-purse mentality \nwhen it comes to delivering on its promises. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity that we took such pains to create has been hamstrung from the \noutset by inadequate funding from the White House. Our port and border \nsecurity initiatives, so essential to fighting terrorism, are \nlanguishing for lack of money. The people hear that their safety, their \nsecurity, are the paramount priority of this White House. Have you \nheard that? Yes. Time and again, the people have heard that their \nsecurity is the paramount priority of this White House down at the \nother end of the avenue, but then see the very same administration play \nshell games with security funds.\n  Surely this is not the legacy we want to leave to the victims of 9/\n11.\n  The President crisscrosses the country claiming that he has made \nAmerica safer. Don't believe it. He has signed legislation intended to \nprotect our airplanes from hijackers. He has signed legislation \ndesigned to close the porous borders in our north and south. He has \nsigned bills to stop terrorists from slipping through our seaports. But \nwhat he hasn't signed is the check.\n  The President tells the country that we are safer because of him, but \nhe has forced dangerous cuts to the Federal Air Marshal program.\n  The President tells Americans that they can rest easy because of him, \nbut he has refused to approve funds that would help to prevent Madrid-\nstyle bombings at our train stations.\n  The President campaigns on an image of being tough on terrorists--the \ntwo-gun slinger, the man at high noon, as it were. But he has rejected \neffort after effort to invest critical dollars in police officers and \nfirefighters. It is as if the President wants our emergency responders \nto pay for homeland security with bake sales and bingo nights. When it \ncomes to protecting this Nation, there should be no distinction between \nproviding necessary resources for troops in Iraq and for first \nresponders at home in America.\n  To continue this homeland security hoax pays little tribute. To tell \nthe American people that they are safe, when, in fact, they are not, \nhonors few memories of those victims of 9/11. This White House has made \nan absolute sham of homeland security.\n  And yet there is more. This President has staked his credibility and, \nto a large extent his Presidency, on the assertion that the war in Iraq \nis an extension of the war on terror--do not believe it--despite the \nfact that no Iraqis were among the 9/11 hijackers and despite the fact \nthat no credible evidence of a link between Saddam Hussein and Osama \nbin Laden has ever been documented.\n  Oh, the President loves to tell us over and over again that America \nis safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power in Iraq, but the \nPresident fails to mention that post-war Iraq has become the foremost \nbreeding ground of anti-American terrorism on the globe. The President \nlikes to talk to the troops, and he likes to talk with the background \nof troops standing behind him. But he doesn't like to talk about the \nsteadily mounting death toll in Iraq.\n  Why are the people mute about the death toll in Iraq? Despite the \nPresident's rose-colored view of Iraq, the number and recently the rate \nof American and Iraqi deaths and injuries are continuing to rise. Yes, \nIraq may be free of the yoke of Saddam Hussein, but it is not free of \nthe yoke of violence. As of this very week, the death toll of American \nmilitary personnel in Iraq has exceeded 1,000.\n  I can hear the cries at night of the fathers and the mothers of those \nsoldiers, marines, and military personnel who have laid down their \nlives in the hot sands of Iraq. I hear again, as though it were the \nking, crying:\n\n       O my son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom! Would God I had \n     died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\n\n  Unlike the mass casualties of September 11, American military \npersonnel in Iraq have died in relatively tiny clusters over the course \nof the past 18 months, one or two here or five there or seven at a \ntime. In spite of the transfer of sovereignty in Iraq more than 2 \nmonths ago, fighting continues to rage on in that crippled country, and \nAmerican casualties continue to mount.\n\n       My son, my son, O Absalom, my son, my son!\n\n  The death toll of American military personnel in Iraq may not yet \napproach the death toll of civilians on September 11, but it is no less \nsignificant and no less heartbreaking.\n  The September 11 terrorist attacks on America may or may not have \nbeen preventable. The missed intelligence cues, the missed \ncommunications, the ``what ifs,'' will haunt us forever. But the \nreturns are already in on the war in Iraq. This President, President \nBush, took this country to war in Iraq for the wrong reasons, based on \nfaulty assumptions, with unanticipated and deadly results for untold \nnumbers of Americans.\n  As we pause to remember the moment when the airplanes struck the \nWorld Trade Centers, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania field, we will \nremember the sacrifice of the mothers and the fathers, the husbands and \nthe wives, the brothers and sisters and the children, the firefighters, \nthe police officers, the ambulance drivers. We will remember all of \nthose who lost their lives in that tragic time and those tragic \nmoments, and we will remember those who have been sent to battle in \ntheir name against the terrorist forces of al-Qaida and the Taliban in \nAfghanistan.\n  That was the war in which America was attacked. America was invaded \nby an invader in the form of hijackers in the cockpits of airplanes \nused as deadly missiles. Tragically, this has become an enemy of our \nown making, through our own invasion, through our own attack, through \nour own pernicious doctrine of preemption, an enemy of our own making \nin Iraq. And the sorrow of those who have given their sons and \ndaughters in that unprovoked war, the sorrows will not end at election \nday. The sorrows will not end this year or next or next or the next, \nbut the sorrows will continue as long as there are memories of those \nwho once sat in those vacant chairs around the kitchen tables of \nAmerica. Those mothers and fathers will continue to weep. The tears \nwill continue to fall. Those loved ones will cry out, as did the king, \nKing David, cry out for their sons as David cried out for his.\n\n       And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber \n     over the gate and wept: and as he wept, thus he said, O my \n     son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom! Would God I had died \n     for thee, oh Absalom, my son, my son.\n\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
