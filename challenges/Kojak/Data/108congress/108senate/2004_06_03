Mr. President, I want to take a few moments and comment on \nour economy. It was just over a year ago that the Senate passed and the \nPresident signed into law $350 billion in tax relief. That was the \nthird largest tax cut in history. By so doing, we brought the tax \nburden to the lowest level in 37 years. We cut taxes across the board \nfor 136 million hard-working, taxpaying Americans. For America's \nfamilies, we increased the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per \nchild, and we made those rebate checks available immediately, and they \nwere sent out immediately.\n\n  Combined with tax cuts of 2001, which were signed into law almost 3 \nyears ago today, this year 111 million individuals and families will \nreceive an average tax cut of over $1,500.\n  If you are married, you are 1 of 49 million married couples who will \nhave an average tax cut of $2,600. For those families with children, \nyou are 1 of the 43 million families with children who will receive an \naverage tax cut of $2,000.\n  We have 14 million elderly individuals who will see their taxes go \ndown on average by nearly $1,900. That is $1,900 more that senior will \nbe able to have to spend, to invest, or to use however they want.\n  If you are a small business owner, you are 1 of 25 million small \nbusiness owners who will receive an average tax cut of $3,000. In my \nhome State of Tennessee, more than 2 million Tennesseans will have \nlower tax rates this year.\n  President Bush's tax cuts are working. Not only are the tax relief \npackages, the tax cuts putting more money back in workers' pockets, \nthey are boosting the economy, and we are seeing the results today. \nSince we passed the tax cuts last year, over 1 million new jobs have \nbeen created. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, lower \nthan the average unemployment rates for the past three decades. The \nnumber of working Americans has reached an all-time high. In \nparticular, manufacturing employment has done especially well. It is at \nthe highest level in almost 20 years.\n  Real gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in more than 20 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nReal disposable personal income--meaning how much money families and \nindividuals have--is up. Household wealth is at an all-time high. Home \nownership is at a record high. Consumer confidence is up. The stock \nmarket has risen from 7,000 to 10,000. Business confidence is higher \nthan it has been in 20 years, and business spending and investing is \nbooming.\n  Four years ago, President Bush inherited an economy that was in \nrecession. Now because of his firm fiscal and tax leadership, the \neconomy is booming. American families feel better off today because \nthey are better off today.\n  The optimism shows up in national polls. A Harris poll released this \nweek finds a clear majority of Americans feel their situation has \nimproved since the last administration left office. Over two-thirds \nexpect their personal situation to improve over the next 5 years. \nAfrican Americans and Hispanics are particularly hopeful. A remarkable \n86 percent in each group expect their lives to improve in the next 5 \nyears.\n  It is imperative we keep up the pace. We can only do that by making \nthe tax cuts permanent. My constituents have written to me again and \nagain pleading to preserve the tax cuts. Yet there are some who would \nlike for those tax cuts to expire. Worse yet, others are calling for \nimmediate repeal. Not only would that be the largest tax hike in \nhistory, it would cut short America's new economic recovery.\n  The tax cuts are working. We need more, not less. We need to keep \nAmerica moving forward, and we need to keep passing appropriate \nlegislation that stokes the fires of the world's largest and most \ndynamic economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to support these progrowth, projob \npolicies that create opportunity for every American. Everyone who wants \na job should be able to find one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week marks the 1-year anniversary \nof the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, a bill signed into law on May 28 \nlast year. And now, a year later, we see by every conceivable economic \nmeasure of prosperity and well-being the Bush recovery is roaring \nahead.\n  The Bush recovery has American families on the right course. The Bush \nrecovery has American businesses, services, manufacturing, and exports \nall moving ahead at full steam.\n  The Bush recovery has workers' income rising, their job opportunities \nexpanding, and their take-home pay increasing. A record number of \nworkers are working. The Bush recovery is broad, it is growing, it is \nsubstantial, and it is a record of achievement of which any President \nwould be justly proud. But the remarkable aspect of the Bush recovery \nis not what it has obtained but what it has overcome.\n  Go back to January 2000, when President Bush was still Governor Bush. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 11,723. That was the peak in \nJanuary of 2000. The Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 11,723. Two \nmonths later, it lost one-fifth of its total value. A couple of months \nlater, in March of that year, Nasdaq peaked. But by the end of 2000, \ntech stocks had lost more than half of their value. By the fall of \n2000, the economy had slipped into recession.\n  Again, this all occurred while President Bush was still Governor Bush \nof Texas.\n  President Bush took office with an economy already stalled, a stock \nmarket tanking, and 8 months later America suffered an unprecedented \nterrorist attack, on September 11. We are all aware of the toll of \nlives from that tragic day, but few appreciate the full effect on our \nfreedom and on our prosperity. Planes were grounded for days, and new, \nexpensive security measures were imposed. Business in America came to a \nscreeching halt, each one collectively seeking to reassess the risk and \nthe opportunity of all their endeavors, not only here but overseas. \nAverage Americans took stock of the threats and warnings out there and \nacted cautiously for the sake of their loved ones.\n  As our freedom to act without fear was diminished, so, too, was the \neconomic activity that is a reflection of that freedom. A new world of \nuncertainty was created by 9/11, and while many have completely \nforgotten the attacks even occurred, their full ramifications are felt \ntoday, not only militarily and politically but economically as well.\n  Despite all that, America is back and stronger than ever, and much of \nthat strength can be traced back to the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003. By \nletting workers, families, and businesses keep more of their own money, \nthat legislation, along with the President's 2001 tax relief, laid the \nfoundation for economic growth and job creation, not only now but for \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, 111 million individuals and families will receive an \naverage tax cut of $1,586; 49 million married couples will have an \naverage tax cut of $2,602; 43 million families with children will \nreceive an average tax cut of $2,090; 14 million elderly individuals \nwill see their taxes fall on average by $1,883, and 25 million small \nbusiness owners will receive an average tax cut of $3,001.\n\n  This tax relief has prompted the growth of a surging, vital economy. \nSince the President signed that bill, the stock market is up 18 \npercent, increasing America's capital base by more than $2 trillion. \nReal business investment in equipment and software is up 14 percent \nannually, the fastest third-quarter increase since the late 1990s. More \nmanufacturers have been reporting increased activities and new orders \nthan any other time in the last 20 years, and real GDP grew at a 5.6-\npercent annual rate, the fastest in nearly 20 years.\n  As tax relief has prompted a surging economy, families have benefited \nin the last year. Real disposable personal income rose at an average \nannual rate of 3.9 percent, household wealth hit a record high of $44 \ntrillion, and home ownership has risen .4 percentage points to a record \nhigh of 68.6 percent.\n  With families stronger and businesses growing, the Bush recovery is \nbuilding strong momentum in the jobs market. In just the last year, \nover 1 million new jobs have been created for America's workers. The \nunemployment rate fell from 6.1 percent to 5.6 percent. That is lower \nthan the average unemployment rates in the 1970s, the 1980s, and the \n1990s. If that were not enough, State unemployment rates fell in 47 out \nof 50 States.\n  America is headed in the right direction. Looking at this chart, \nsince President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act last \nMay, the 5.6-percent increase in GDP is the best in 20 years; 1.1 \nmillion new jobs since last May; 800,000 new jobs this calendar year \nalone; the stock market rebound, up 18 percent since the President \nsigned the tax relief bill. Home ownership is up to 68.6 percent, an \nalltime high since the President signed the tax bill. Disposable income \nis up 3.9 percent--more take-home pay. All of this has occurred since \nPresident Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act last May.\n  We have had an extraordinary period of economic growth. Some say the \neconomy should be growing faster, but their solution is to lock up the \nbrakes and whip a u-turn. That is what an agenda of more taxes, more \nregulation, and more Government spending would do.\n  Under President Bush's leadership, America is finally headed in the \nright direction. The economy is picking up steam, and families, \nbusinesses, and workers across America are reaping the benefits. This \nis not the time to turn backward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6389-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6389-S6390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EDUCATION OF INDIAN CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time this morning.\n  This is the cover of a recent Parade magazine. The man in this \nphotograph is the great-great-great-grandson of Sitting Bull, one of \nthe most extraordinary leaders America has ever produced.\n  His name is Ron. His horse is Thunder. He is part of the new \ngeneration of American Indian leaders. He is a lawyer by training, but \neducation is his life's work. He is president of the Sitting Bull \nCollege in Fort Yates, ND, on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, and \nchairman of the President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities.\n  The subtitle of this article expresses a fundamental truth that \nSitting Bull taught and that people I talk with throughout Indian \nCountry still believe today: Education is the key to a better future \nfor the American Indian people. Education, more than anything else, \ngives a person the power to determine his or her own destiny. It is the \nmost effective tool there is to relieve the grinding poverty that \nexists today in too many tribal communities throughout America.\n  When Native Americans surrendered their lands more than a century and \na quarter ago, the United States Government promised to provide the \ndescendants of Sitting Bull and all Native Americans, free education, \nhealth care and other basic necessities of life, forever. That is one \nreason I am disturbed by the results of two new audits by the Interior \nDepartment's inspector general.\n  The first audit reveals that, over a 3-year period, the BIA's Office \nof Indian Education Programs used at least $5 million from a \ncontingency fund for non-emergency purposes, including staff retreats, \nbean bag chairs, televisions and puppets. This misuse of contingency \nfunds shortchanged Indian schools of money they need for emergencies.\n  The second audit, which concerns the BIA school construction program, \nalso documents numerous examples of poor management and lack of \naccountability. It found that Indian children are being forced to try \nto learn, and their teachers are trying to teach, in schools that put \nthem at undue risk of injury because ``no one in BIA ensures that \nschool buildings are not occupied'' until hazards are corrected. That \nis shameful.\n  This second report also found that 30 percent of the school \nconstruction and repair projects it reviewed failed to meet the BIA's \nown goal of completing design and construction within 3 years.\n  The IG made nine recommendations that it said could strengthen the \nBIA school construction program and increase the program's benefits for \nNative Americans. Those nine recommendations were included in a draft \ncopy of the report the IG gave to BIA officials for comment.\n  Incredibly, despite being given an extended deadline, Bureau \nofficials failed to respond to the draft. As a result, when the report \nwas released publicly, it noted that ``all nine recommendations are \nconsidered unresolved.''\n  I do not know why the BIA failed to even acknowledge those nine \nrecommendations for improving the Indian school construction program; I \ndo not know if it was arrogance, indifference, incompetence or simply a \nresult of being overwhelmed. But I know that it is unacceptable.\n  The BIA operates or funds 187 schools in 23 States, including South \nDakota. Most of these schools were built in the 1940s or 1950s. Many \nare decades older than that. Few are equipped to support computer labs \nor other sorts of modern equipment that are now considered essential in \nmost school districts.\n  I have visited BIA schools where children had to place trash cans \nbeneath the holes in the roofs to catch the rain. I have been to BIA \nschools in which cold winds whipped through broken windows. I visited a \nschool, which has since been replaced, in which neither the furnace nor \nthe bathroom plumbing worked. That is not keeping our promise to \neducate Indian children. That is a disgrace.\n  The Cheyenne Eagle Butte School and dormitories on the Cheyenne River \nSioux Reservation in South Dakota were built by the BIA around 1960. \nThe floor tiles in both the school and the dormitory contain asbestos, \na known cause of lung cancer and emphysema.\n  To date, the BIA's remediation efforts consist of recommending that \nthe school ``keep the boiler room door shut'' and keep the floors waxed \nso the tiles will not chip and flake.\n  Three years ago, the Cheyenne Eagle Butte School was first on the \nBIA's priority list for school replacement. Then the BIA changed its \ncriteria, and the school dropped down on the list. Today, the tribe has \nno idea when the school will be replaced.\n  Several weeks ago, I spoke on this floor about the Crow Creek Tribal \nSchools in Stephan, SD.\n  Two years ago, Crow Creek's middle school was condemned and replaced \nwith modular trailers. The elementary school and high school still need \nto be replaced. Throughout the high school, crumbling walls are \nsupported by steel braces; one can see exposed electrical wires.\n  The Crow Creek Council has been lobbying for money to fix the schools \non the reservation for 25 years. Recently, the Crow Creek school \nsuperintendent received this letter from the South Dakota state fire \nmarshal. I have had it reprinted and enlarged here. I will quote:\n\n       [T]he buildings are dangerous and represent a threat to \n     life.\n\n  The State fire marshal ``strongly recommends discontinued use of \nboth'' the elementary and high schools.\n  Two weekends ago was graduation weekend at Crow Creek Tribal Schools. \nThe school had originally planned to hold the graduation ceremony \noutside because the gym has been condemned--but it rained on graduation \nday. So 1,500 people--the graduates, their families and friends--\ncrowded into a condemned gymnasium that threatened to fall down around \nthem.\n  I ask you, what other group of children would we allow to be treated \nthis way?\n  The BIA has committed to replace the Crow Creek gym--but it is \nunclear when. Tribal officials had thought students would be playing \nbasketball in the new gym this fall, but the construction funds have \nonce again been delayed.\n  In the last several months, Crow Creek schools have experienced a \ncrisis of suicides among students. Mental health experts call such \nepisodes ``cluster suicides.'' Six young people on the Crow Creek \nReservation have killed themselves in the last 6 months--and many more \nhave tried. In April, there were 21 suicide attempts; the month before, \n28. Last month, a 14-year-old girl tried to hang herself behind the \nelementary school. She was discovered and cut down just in time. The \nmost recent suicide was a 19-year-old young man who had dropped out of \nschool. Had he stayed, he would have graduated last month.\n  Clearly, the suicide crisis at Crow Creek schools is not caused only \nby crumbling schools. This is a complex crisis with very deep roots. It \ninvolves public health issues and myriad other issues.\n  But what message does it send to young people when they are forced to \ntry to learn in a condemned building?\n  There are school buildings like the Crow Creek Tribal Schools \nthroughout the BIA system. All told, the BIA school construction \nbacklog is estimated at $1 billion. At the current funding levels, it \nwould take decades to get through that backlog.\n  In 2000, when he was running for President, then-Governor Bush met \nwith tribal leaders in New Mexico and promised to invest $1 billion to \nfix crumbling BIA schools. Yet, the President's proposed budget for \nnext year cuts funding for Indian school replacement for the second \nyear in a row. That is wrong.\n  America's commitment to build new schools for children in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is admirable, but it does not erase our treaty obligations \nto provide good schools for Indian children in this country.\n  The JOBS bill the Senate just passed last month includes a promising \nprogram that was first suggested by tribal educators in my State. The \nprogram would allow tribal governments to issue school construction \nbonds; the Federal Government would pay the interest and the principal \non the bonds.\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\nThe BIA school construction bond program would increase by about half \nthe number of BIA schools that are currently being replaced or repaired \neach year.\n  Yesterday evening, I met with two officials from the Porcupine school \nboard on the Pine Ridge Sioux Reservation. Those two gentlemen are with \nus this morning.\n  The grade school in Porcupine is 40 years old and overcrowded. The \nfoundation is unstable. The boiler is unreliable. There is no \ncafeteria; the children eat their meals in the hallways.\n  The Porcupine elementary school is number two on the BIA's school \nconstruction replacement list. School board officials say they have \nbeen told that construction on a new school could start in July--not \nthis year, not next year, not the year after that, but in 2008--more \nthan 4 years from now.\n  The new Indian school bonding program would enable us to replace and \nrenovate more schools faster.\n  For the sake of the children at the Porcupine elementary school, and \nall the children in crumbling and inadequate BIA schools throughout \nAmerica, Congress needs to get the JOBS bill--with the BIA school \nconstruction plan--to the President and get this important program up \nand running as soon as possible.\n  Once the law is signed, we are going to insist that the BIA report \nregularly to Congress on how the BIA school construction program is \nbeing implemented and managed. We expect progress and results. We will \nnot tolerate the lack of accountability that is documented in the two \nrecent audits of the BIA's Office of Indian Education Programs.\n  This chart says it so poetically and prophetically. More than a \ncentury ago it was said the first time. Sitting Bull implored \nrepresentatives of the Federal Government:\n\n       Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make \n     for our children.\n\n  In that same spirit, we must now put our minds together and hold our \nGovernment accountable to keep the promises it made in trusts and \ntreaties and laws to Native Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about continued \nprogress for the American economy, especially back home in Minnesota.\n  I have been coming down to the Senate floor now from time to time to \ntalk about how the policies of President Bush and a Republican \nmajority, working across the aisle with some like-minded Democratic \nfriends in the Congress, are putting America's economy back on track \nand Americans back to work.\n  I remember back in October when I came down to the floor and talked \nabout early signs of economic growth that would set the stage for the \njob creation we have been witnessing in the last 8 months. Right after \nI spoke, my friend the assistant Democratic leader challenged me a bit, \nquestioning whether my prediction for a brighter economy were not a \nlittle premature.\n  As the saying goes, ``There is nothing more horrible than the murder \nof beautiful theory by a brutal gang of facts.''\n  What may have been a trickle of good economic news last October has \ncascaded into a steady stream of good news. Even that most persistent \ncritics of the President's economic program must now concede. The \neconomic engine of America is humming. Job growth is a reality.\n  Two weeks ago, I talked about a Minneapolis Star Tribune article \nappropriately entitled, ``Minnesota Jobs Roar Ahead,'' which reported \nthat Minnesota broke all kinds of jobs records in April when Minnesota \nexperienced the largest one-month drop ever in its unemployment rate \nand more manufacturing jobs were created at a record pace as well.\n  Today, I want to talk a little about an article in my home town \npaper, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press, entitled ``Factories on a Roll.'' \nThe article highlights that U.S. Manufacturing activity expanded for \nthe 12th consecutive month last month, and factories boosted employment \nto meet strong demand for their products.\n  This is true back home in Minnesota. A regional survey by Creighton \nUniversity economists found that Minnesota's ``Business Conditions \nIndex'' rose to a 10-year high.\n  Also, Minnesota enjoyed its best month-to-month gain in jobs in April \nsince October of 1999. The progress of the last few months has led \nnumber of economists to describe Minnesota's economy as ``spectacular'' \nand ``breathless,'' and indicates that employment opportunity in the \nmanufacturing sector will continue to improve.\n  I stand by what I said in October. The President's commonsense tax \nrelief has played the crucial role in helping the economy to rebound \nfrom the recession that began during the final months of the Clinton \npresidency.\n  More than 1.9 million Minnesota taxpayers saw their taxes decline \nthis year under the President's tax relief. More than 1.2 million \ncouples in Minnesota will benefit from the reduced marriage penalty and \nmore than 475,000 couples and single parents will see an increase in \ntheir child tax credit.\n  I wonder if some folks on the other side of the aisle would still \nprefer I hold my tongue while we wait for more evidence. If so, I would \nsuggest that perhaps ``irrational exuberance'' has given way to \n``unreasonable pessimism.''\n  I would even go so far to say that one of the economy's chief risk \nfactors today is those who continue to talk it down. And why? Could it \nbe perhaps that for some, economic good news might be political bad \nnews? Much of the howling about the economy has fallen silent. But \nwhere is the consistency? If the President was to blame for the economy \nbefore, isn't he to be praised for its performance now? I can't wait to \nsee how this one is spun.\n  The economy has overcome great obstacles and is firing on all \ncylinders in Minnesota and elsewhere. No, we have not died and gone to \neconomic heaven; problems remain. There is good and bad in every \neconomic period. But considering where we are and what we have come \nthrough, this is solid, broad-based and even historic progress.\n  I was optimistic last October. Why? Because this is what always \nhappens when you give people control of more of their own paychecks.\n\n  Federal programs are not the engine of economic growth: Regular folks \nwho save, invest and consume are. But that doesn't mean there aren't \nthings we can do right now to help.\n  For the sake of working families across the country, we need to focus \non maintaining that economic growth and jobs creation through a forward \nlooking legislative agenda. We need to pass an energy bill, a highway \nbill, and important legal reforms that alone would create 3.5 million \nnew, and good paying jobs.\n  We need to make permanent the President's tax code in enforcing this \neconomic growth. We need to keep the economy going down the track it is \non.\n  The optimist sees the light at the end of the tunnel. The pessimist \nassumes it is an oncoming train. With all the evidence in hand, it is \ntime to doubt the doubters and call them to account.\n  Although we saw the signs last fall for the economic growth and jobs \ncreation that was beginning to unfold, some folks had doubt. But, as \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt put it better than a half century ago, \n``The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of \ntoday. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.'' Hopefully \nthis continued good news from Minnesota and across America will help \nthe doubting Thomas's still among us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nin celebrating this anniversary. In 2001 and again in 2003, Congress \nhad the wisdom to pass two bold tax cut plans. I firmly believe they \nwere the key to turning around this economy.\n  When the President came to office, the economy was already taking a \nturn for the worse. Job growth was slowing down, the stock markets were \nmoving in the wrong direction. A dose of strong medicine was needed. \nOur President came up with a bold plan for tax relief, to get more \nmoney out of Washington and put it back into the pockets of workers and \nthe small business owners who earned it.\n  President Bush knows, as President Kennedy knew, and as President\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\nReagan knew, the best way to jump-start the economy is to leave more \nmoney in the hands of the American people.\n  When people and businesses can keep more of their own money in their \nown pockets instead of having to send it to the ``National Center for \nIncome Redistribution on the Potomac,'' it follows they will spend more \nand they will invest more and they will expand their businesses more. \nWhen that happens, the result is new jobs and a growing economy. That \nis exactly what has happened.\n  I was proud to be a cosponsor of those tax relief plans which lowered \nthe tax bills for 111 million taxpayers, including 25 million small \nbusiness owners. Americans have been using this extra money to pay \ntheir bills, get the kids in new clothes, or start a saving plans for \nthemselves. Small businesses are investing in new equipment and \nexpanding their operations. Workers are opening their 401(k) statements \nto see the numbers are going up instead of down.\n  As a result, our economy is on the upswing. We have had 10 \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth. In the last 3 quarters, the \neconomy has been stronger than any 3 consecutive quarters in nearly 20 \nyears. Jobs are coming back, too. More than 1.1 million jobs have been \ncreated since last August and more are on the way. Manufacturing \nactivity is picking up, and the business community is more confident \nthan ever that they feel this turnaround taking root.\n  President Bush has done an outstanding job shepherding our economy \nthrough these tough times. I have one wish as we celebrate this \nanniversary. I wish this Congress would take one more step with these \ntax cuts. I wish we would do what we should have done in the first \nplace, make these tax cuts permanent.\n  I have asked this question before and I will ask it again: How can \nanyone, how can any business, make any long-range plans for a business \nor for a family with a ``here today, gone tomorrow'' tax cut, a tax \npolicy that has a perishable date on it, like a quart of milk?\n  The fastest way to show our taxpayers we are serious about tax \nrelief, the fastest way to ensure this economic growth continues, is to \nmake the tax cuts permanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I compliment my colleague, Senator \nMiller from Georgia, for his statement, but also for his courage last \nyear in not only supporting this package but cosponsoring this package \nwith me. Every once in a while we do something in Congress that makes a \ndifference. Last year, Senator Miller helped pass a budget that enabled \nthe Senate to pass a tax bill.\n  The tax bill we passed we called the economic growth package 2003. It \ndid a lot of things. It accelerated some tax cuts that were already \npassed in 2001 that were being phased in very slowly. We accelerated \nthose. We made the maximum tax rate 35 percent. It accelerated tax \nchanges for families, moved tax credits for children from $700 to \n$1,000. It gave marriage penalty relief. It meant married couples would \npay 15 percent on taxable income up to $58,000. It expanded the 10-\npercent tax bracket. It cut capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to \n15 percent. It cut the tax rate on corporate dividends. We tax the \ndistribution of dividends from corporations higher in the United States \nthan any other country in the world. It cut that tax by more than half. \nIt cut it from ordinary rates to 15 percent.\n  It would not have happened if it were not for Senator Miller. He \ncosponsored the bill. He made it possible. By passing a budget, we \npassed a bill. We passed it with the Vice President breaking a tie. The \nnet result is we have had economic growth, very significant economic \ngrowth as a result of that tax bill, as a result of the budget we \npassed last year.\n  The proof is in the pudding. We have now seen the results. Both \nsides, Democrats and Republicans, said, We need to do something to \nstimulate the economy. We did. We passed the package. The President \nsigned it a little over a year ago, May 28 of last year. Now we can \nlook at the results. The results are outstanding. So we ought to \nacknowledge it.\n  We have had the most rapid expansion of gross domestic product in 20 \nyears. The last 4 quarters averaged 4-point-some-odd percent: 3 \npercent, 8 percent, 4.1 percent, 4.5 percent--the highest in 20 years. \nThat has happened since we passed our package a little over a year ago.\n  The results in the stock market have been dramatic. The Dow Jones \nindustrial average, when we introduced this bill, I believe it was in \nFebruary of last year, was less than 8,000. It is over 10,000 now--an \nincrease of 27 percent from when we introduced the President's budget \nand introduced his bill. That is dramatic. I remember telling my \ncolleagues, if we eliminate double taxation on dividends, we might have \na Dow Jones industrial average above 10,000. That is the way we passed \nit in the Senate, but the way it came back from conference, we said the \ntax on dividends would be 15 percent. That is a big improvement over \nordinary tax. Corporations have to pay 35 percent on their corporate \nprofits. Then we pay individual tax of 15 percent. But as a result, we \nnow have a Dow Jones industrial average that has risen 27 percent. The \nNASDAQ is actually up even more than that. It surged from about 1350 in \nMarch to today almost 2000. That is a 47-percent increase since \nFebruary. That is very significant. That means the market cap has \nincreased by trillions of dollars.\n  People ask, what does that mean? It means the value in your 401(k) \nfunds has risen from $11 trillion to over 15 some trillion, an increase \nof about $4.5 trillion. That is phenomenal growth, that is phenomenal \nwealth creation, due in large part to the tax bill we passed last year \nbecause we tax corporate profits differently, because we allowed \ncorporations to have a bonus depreciation up to 50 percent.\n  We made tax changes and there are consequences to those changes we \nmade, positive changes. There are positive changes on employment and \nthe unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has declined dramatically \nfrom over 6.3 percent in June of last year. Keep in mind, we introduced \nthis bill in February when the unemployment rate was about 5.9 \npercent. It went all the way up to 6.4 percent. And now, today, we are \nlooking at an unemployment rate of about 5.6 percent--a very \nsignificant reduction in the unemployment rate. So that is positive.\n\n  Payroll growth has increased dramatically. That is usually a lagging \nindicator. The stock market moved up earlier, and now payrolls are \nstarting to increase, with over 1.1 million jobs in the last 8 months \nalone. You can see the growth trend is very positive. We had a decline \nin jobs for some time. We were experiencing significant job losses. We \nsaid: We need to do something to stimulate the economy. We did. We \nintroduced the tax cut bill in February. We passed the bill in late \nMay. Now you can see it is really starting to take off. We have had \nvery significant job growth as a result of that.\n  Even in manufacturing--if you look at the trend in manufacturing over \nthe last 40 years, it has been on a decline. Because of some of the \nchanges we implemented--primarily the bonus depreciation, and, again, a \nchange in the way we tax dividend distribution--you are now seeing \ninvestments in manufacturing plants and facilities. Investments are up \nin manufacturing, and investments in companies, dramatically. Now we \nare seeing growth in manufacturing output, which has been significant. \nWe have had very significant manufacturing output.\n  We are also seeing, for the first time in a long time, actual growth \nin manufacturing employment. I used to be a manufacturer. That is good \nnews. That is reversing a trend that has been on the books and, \nfrankly, in progress for a long time.\n  The point I am making is a year ago we passed a bill. The bill was a \nbig change in tax policy, a big change I think that has had very \npositive economic results. Senator Miller said: Well, there is one \nthing we should do. This bill was passed, and it was passed under \nreconciliation, which means, by law or definition, it had to be for a \nset period of time. It sunsets. We need to make it permanent. We want \nthese growth trends to continue. We want the growth in the number of \njobs to continue. We want to see manufacturing continue to increase. We \nwant to see GDP continue to increase.\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\n  Some people have said: Well, no, we want to take away some of those \ntax cuts. We want to take away some of the tax cuts for the upper 1 or \n2 percent. I will tell you, that will not work. I was one of the \narchitects of that plan. I was the principal sponsor, with Senator \nMiller, to cut taxes on capital gains and dividends. If you try to do \nthat and say, ``We will leave the rate at 15 percent for everybody in \nAmerica except for the upper 1 or 2 percent,'' that will not work.\n  To tell everybody in America, ``Your capital gains rate is going to \nbe 15 percent, unless you make over $200,000, and your rate is going to \nbe 25 percent higher,'' that is a real disincentive. Or to tell \ncorporations, ``We are going to tax proceeds on corporate dividends at \n15 percent, and, oh, if you have income over $200,000, we are going to \ntax yours at 35 percent''--and under some proposals it would be much \nhigher than that; they want to increase maximum rates maybe well beyond \n39.6 percent--that is distorted, and it will undermine the whole idea \nof saying: Wait a minute; let's not tax corporate dividends twice.\n  If you tax some corporate dividends at 39.6 percent on the corporate \nside, and have a corporate rate of 35 percent on top of it, you are \ntaxing corporate dividend distributions of 75 percent plus, and you are \ndiscouraging people from making investments in corporations and \ndistributing those proceeds to their owners. Therefore, it would be \nvery counterproductive.\n  So those who are making those recommendations have not thought them \nthrough. I do not think they will work. Or if they did work, it would \nbe very counterproductive, and you would see GDP declining; you would \nsee jobs declining, and you would see a very stalled or stagnated \neconomy.\n  I think we can be proud of the fact we passed the tax bill last year. \nThe President signed it, and it has had a positive impact. Those are \nthe facts, just the facts. I compliment my colleagues, and particularly \nSenator Miller, who made it happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNevada. I very much appreciate him pointing out one of the great flaws \nin the discussion I am hearing on the floor. It seems we only want to \nfocus on a very short period of time and a very limited measurement or \nmetric on how well the economy is doing.\n  I have been on the floor over the last 6 or 8 weeks trying to address \nissues on the budget, taxes, and growth in our economy. I feel very \nstrongly that we need to have this debate. I am glad it is happening \nbecause the American people, I think, actually understand what is \nhappening in their pocketbook and their own sense of where we are in \nthe economy. It is a lot different than this tsunami of good news that \nis being quoted and cited.\n  People like to talk about statistics. We need to deal with what is \nactually going on in people's lives. That is why a whole series of us \nhave come down and asked that question Ronald Reagan asked in the 1980 \nPresidential campaign: Are you better off than you were 4 years ago?\n  Remember, 4 years ago, we had come through a period of creating 22.5 \nmillion jobs. This is an administration that has overseen the loss of \n1.8 million jobs. So we have had the loss of 1.8 million jobs, after \ncreating 22.5 million jobs, when we saw real income growing every \nsingle year. Now we are asked to say: Wow, isn't it wonderful we have \nseen such a change in the last 2 or 3 or 4 months? And at what cost has \nthat come?\n  As the Senator from Nevada said, we have the largest deficits in the \nhistory of mankind. You can always spend yourself into economic growth. \nMaybe that is what we are doing, but it is coming at a huge cost to \nthis generation and future generations.\n  But that is not what I wanted to talk about today. I want to talk \nabout who is better off than they were 4 years ago. There is a clear, \ncommonsensical view among people, at least in the State of New Jersey, \nwhom I live with every day, that things are not so well in their home, \nin their bank accounts, in their financial condition.\n  I will go through some of the data. Are they better off? We have had \nflat wages for the last 3 and a half years. To be absolutely accurate, \naverage weekly earnings have grown 1 percent over 4 years. College \ntuition costs, on the other hand, are up 28 percent at the same time; \nup 13 percent in New Jersey last year at State schools. Gas prices are \nover $2 a gallon, up 34 percent in a 4-year period. Family health care \npremiums are up 36 percent. These are expenses people have to pay every \nday out of their budgets.\n  Some cite macrostatistics such as the GDP is growing. What is \nhappening is, individual average weekly earnings are up 1 percent. \nHealth care costs are up 36 percent. Gas prices are over $2 a gallon, \nand there has been a 28-percent increase in college tuition. It is off \nthe charts.\n  State and local taxes in almost every State in the country have gone \nup in the last 4 years. In New Jersey, the average property tax has \ngone up 7 percent each year because the Federal Government is not \npicking up its responsibilities, such as Leave No Child Behind, and \nwith other mandates we have put on them for which we then don't provide \nthe money. Now we are hearing we are going to be cutting back on some \nof that.\n  There is a case for middle-class Americans to say things are not so \ngreat. Average weekly earnings are up 1 percent. We have everything \nelse in our budget going off the charts.\n  It is possible, though, when we look at this picture of middle-class \nAmerica getting squeezed, that there are people who are actually doing \nwell in this world. That is what I want to talk about because there are \nsome people who are better off than they were 4 years ago. It comes \nfrom the concept that there is a ladder in America. People like to get \non that ladder and climb up and have great opportunity. This is a \ncountry that has aspirations that are a part of people's lives.\n  But we seemingly want to make sure the people at the top of the \nladder are doing really well and we are squeezing the folks at the \nbottom. Average weekly earnings, as I said, had relatively flat growth. \nBut HMO profits are up 50 percent. There is a correlation between that \n38-percent increase in family health premiums to HMO profits. I used to \nbe a CEO so I can talk about this with some knowledge. Compensation for \npeople who are leading corporations is up 61 percent during the same \nperiod--one percent or zero-percent average weekly earnings growth for \nmiddle-class Americans, while CEO compensation is up 61 percent.\n  To give a little perspective, back in 1980 the average CEO made 31 \ntimes the lowest average worker in a corporation. Today it is over 500 \ntimes. It grew 61 percent last year. Somebody is better off, aren't \nthey?\n  It strikes me that the numbers are working. Somebody is getting it \nand somebody is not. As I said, it is most visible when you compare HMO \nprofits versus what is going on with health care costs for average \nAmericans. It is tough to argue that things are a lot better when we \nare seeing growth in\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\nHMO profits and growth in CEO compensation, and you wonder who is \nbetter off than they were 4 years ago.\n  Another way to look at this is to focus on the oil companies. Are \nthey better off or not? In New Jersey, we have the average cost of \ngasoline at $2.04 cents a gallon. We see over $40-a-barrel oil. We \ncould think about supply and demand conditions and maybe tap into the \nStrategic Oil Reserve, but that is a story for another day.\n\n  The fact is, middle-class Americans are paying the freight, $2.04 a \ngallon, and somebody is benefiting from that. Are the people paying the \n$2.04 better off or are the oil companies that have seen their profits \nsoar as the price of a barrel of oil has gone up enormously right in \nfront of our eyes? British Petroleum's earnings are up 165 percent, \nyear over year; Chevron-Texaco, 294 percent; Conoco only got 44 \npercent; and Exxon is up 125 percent.\n  Thirty-four percent was the increase in the cost of gasoline for \nAmericans. That is middle-class folks going in, pulling up to the gas \npump, putting it in, paying for it. That is coming out of their pocket. \nRemember, those are the people who are getting a 1-percent increase in \nweekly earnings. And Chevron-Texaco has a 294-percent increase in \nprofitability.\n  I am not against profitability. We want people to be profitable. But \nthere needs to be some balance in how the economic pie is actually \nworking for folks in America. It is very troubling that some are huge \nwinners and other people are getting the scraps, with a zero-percent to \n1-percent increase in real weekly earnings.\n  There is another group besides HMOs and CEOs and oil companies. There \nis the issue of those who actually despoil our environment. It sort of \ngoes at the oil company topic. Instead of debating how we are going to \nget the price of oil down, House Republicans are now insisting on \ngiving oil companies immunity in cases where they have contaminated \nground water with MTBE. In New Jersey, there is a serious problem \nbecause we have MTBE all over the State, and it is increasingly thought \nto cause all kinds of health problems. We are proposing to give a break \nto the oil companies--the ones making 294 percent higher profits this \nyear than they did last year--a $29 billion break in damages in 43 \nStates around the country.\n  Who is better off today than they were 4 years ago? Is it the oil \ncompanies or the people potentially exposed to MTBE? By the way, I \ncould go on to ``polluter pays'' taxes; who is paying, who is not \npaying, for clean air. You could go through a whole series of \nenvironmental applications and ask, who is winning, who is losing.\n  This is not about class warfare. This is about who is winning and who \nis losing: a 294-percent profit increase, or are we actually going to \ndeal with MTBE? Are we going to have the resources to clean it up? Or \nare we going to take the $29 billion in damages and lay it on the \nshoulders of working Americans? Are we going to pass it along?\n  Let me talk about another issue. This gets at some of the tax \ndiscussion I hear so much about as being so beneficial to everyone in \nthe world. You could talk about where the tax breaks go. Those making \n$1 million or more are getting $123,000. Those in the top 1 percent are \ngetting about a $34,000 tax break, almost $35,000. If you do the \nanalysis, the middle 20 percent of Americans is getting about $647. \nThat is the average.\n  Anybody can talk about statistics. They can pick it out different \nways. They can mush all this together. They can put the 7 footer with \nthe 5'4'' person and come with an average height that sounds as if you \nare 6'2''. But the fact is, so much of the tax break is actually going \nto the people who make $1 million or more, the top 1 percent, and very \nlittle is going to middle-class Americans.\n  But that fits. We are only getting a 1-percent increase in mean \nweekly earnings to the middle class. We are creating tax breaks that \nprimarily go to those who are already doing well. Again, the aspiration \nof Americans to try to work their way up the ladder is perfectly \nacceptable. That is the American dream. I know a little bit about it \nbecause I know how it happened in my life. But when you get the ladder \ndown and you put it up, why roll it down?\n  That is what we are doing here. We are giving tax breaks to people \nwho could always use them. Everybody could always use a tax break. But \nhow are we going to fund Leave No Child Behind? How are we going to \ndeal with making sure special education is properly funded? When are we \ngoing to get it that we need to make sure we share the benefits in this \nsociety? This makes almost no sense.\n  It is not an issue of class warfare. It is how do we make sure every \nAmerican has an opportunity to have access to the American dream.\n  It is incredible to hear some of the discussions that go on. By the \nway, I want to take this one step further. One of the reasons this \nnumber is so high and this is so low is so much of that income comes in \nthe form of capital--capital gains, dividends--and people with capital \ngains and dividends are paying 15 percent. But if you are working and \nyou are up in the $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 area, you are paying 28 \npercent; your marginal rate is significantly higher.\n  We are charging more for working people's earnings than we are for \ncapital. I don't think that is right. I don't think it is right that we \nturn around and allow situations where somebody pays a 15-percent \nmarginal rate against some kind of income--i.e., capital income--and we \ncharge much higher rates for the poor guy who has to go to work every \nday. Why are we advantaging capital over wages? It makes no sense and \nwe end up with a distribution like this.\n  Again, there is nothing wrong with getting good returns on capital or \nwith people working their way up the ladder and being successful. But \nwe have a lot of choices in this country, and we are making them so \nthat these guys up here are ending up with most of the benefits--unless \nyou are one of those oil companies that get an MTBE break and huge \ngrowth in profits. But the wages are not growing. The cost of living is \ngoing up, as is health care, college tuition, and State and local \ntaxes, and there is so much need that I don't understand why we are \nturning around and skewing everything the way we have.\n  That is why I think it is fair to ask who is better off in 2004 \nversus 2000. Is it the people who were at the top of that chart, the \ntop of the ladder or is it the people in the middle of the ladder, who \nare aspiring to get up the ladder? Who is benefiting from this $400 \nbillion or $450 billion budget deficit? I think it is a very hard case \nto make.\n  As the chief economist from Merril Lynch said, ``We've had a \nredistribution of income [in this country] to the corporate sector.'' \nIt is through this capital gains distribution of dividends and cutting \nof the marginal tax rates. It is very clear that somebody is winning, \nbut somebody is getting a little less of that break. I think it is very \nhard to answer the question ``who is better off today'' without going \nback through those HMOs, CEOs, oil companies, and a lot of the folks \nwho are gaining their income from capital as opposed to wages.\n  I believe that is a tough way to argue to the American people that \nthings are going really well in the economy. I think we have an answer \nto the question. We have seen someone do better, and it is those who \nhave had that redistribution to them through the tax system. That is \nsomething we need to debate on the Senate floor, we need to debate it \namong the American people, and we need to come to a conclusion about \nwho really deserves to have the fair benefits as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I direct a question to my friend from New \nJersey. Would my friend agree that these huge deficits that are piling \nup at unprecedented rates are also, long term, very damaging to our \neconomy?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Nevada asks a particularly appropriate \nquestion. Anytime the Federal Government is competing for money in the \ncapital markets, instead of us having that money go into the private \nsector, instead of being invested in the kinds of growth you see in \nNevada or what we hope will happen in New Jersey, it undermines the \neconomic health of the country, and we have fewer jobs, wages are less, \nand you get a negative cycle. It is absolutely dangerous to the longrun \nhealth of this country.\n\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator also agree that during the last 3 years \nof\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nthe Clinton administration, we were actually spending less money as a \nFederal Government than we were taking in--meaning we were paying down \nthe debt? Was that not a good sign for the economy, to the rest of the \nworld, and to our own taxpayers?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Nevada is leading the witness because \nat that point in time we were in the process of creating 22.5 million \njobs over that 4 years--10 million in the last sector. People would \nearn money and spend money, and it would multiply through the economic \nsystem. We were creating wealth in the greatest single period of time, \nwhen the Federal Government was running from the pulling down of \ncapital and stayed out of the capital markets and put money where it \nwas most efficient.\n  What we are doing right now is setting up a dynamic that will reverse \nthat. We are going to see less investment over a period of time because \nthe Federal Government has taken up all the dough and it is going to \nshow lower growth in jobs, lower creation of wealth, and nobody will \nargue that the longrun deficits at the level we are running them now \nmake any sense for this country. I don't think anybody would argue \nthat--with the kinds of policies we have now, our taxes are about 15.5 \npercent of GDP. They were about 18 percent when this administration \ncame in. But we have grown spending under this administration and the \nCongress, led by the other side of the aisle, up to about 21 percent. \nPresident Clinton's administration cut that to about 18 percent--a \nlittle lower, because we were running surpluses. The track we are on is \nabsolutely a potion for disaster.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, everybody within the sound of my voice \nshould understand that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is a \nperson who understands the business world. Before coming to the Senate, \nhe was one of the Nation's leading economic advisers, a person who had \nbeen so distinguished in the economic world that he was known all over \nthe United States and in many parts of the world. When the Senator from \nNew Jersey speaks about aspects of our economy, people should really \nlisten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6394-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6394-S6395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today many people in the Chamber came to \nwork extremely early. The reason is they wanted to avoid being stuck in \ntraffic. They got up early in the morning. They came to work earlier \nthan they were required to come to work because they were afraid of \nbeing late for work because of the traffic jams in the Washington, DC, \narea. You may say, well, Washington is a unique place. But it is the \nsame in Las Vegas, Reno, or anyplace else in our country. We have \ntraffic jams, highway problems, too few mass transit systems, and those \nwe do have need renovation and replenishment.\n  To mention a road in Las Vegas or here on the capital beltway as \nbeing a place to stay away from during rush hour, certainly everybody \nunderstands that. Is there going to be an accident in the morning? \nMaybe there was an accident. Maybe it is just routine congestion that \ncreates difficult problems. People sit, losing precious time they could \nbe spending with their families or getting to work and getting things \ndone. But they are stuck in traffic.\n  As the Senator from New Jersey and I have talked about on the floor \nof the Senate a lot of times, the price of gasoline is tremendous. You \nsit there with your car idling, wasting precious fuel. In Nevada, there \nare places now where you are paying $2.70 a gallon for gasoline. People \nare locked in these traffic jams that are unbelievably difficult. They \nkeep us away from our families and our work, and that also adds to the \nstress of the individual involved.\n  But while Americans are stuck in traffic all over America, a bill to \nget America moving again is stuck in Congress. The highway bill is \nstuck in Congress. Why? Where is it stuck? It is across this great \nCapitol in the House of Representatives. They have refused to appoint \nconferees so that we can go to conference.\n  We were able to work out an arrangement in the Senate where we \nappointed very good conferees. The Republicans have 11 and the \nDemocrats have 10. They are anxious to go to work and do something \nabout the comprehensive 6-year surface transportation bill on which we \nhave to work.\n  The House passed a version. The Senate passed a version. We like ours \nbetter, but they are both bills on which we need to work out the \ndifferences.\n  During the Memorial Day recess, staffs held bicameral meetings to \nbegin a dialog between the two bodies. But because the House has not \nappointed conferees, these meetings mostly dealt with procedural \nmatters. In effect, we did not do much.\n  I cannot imagine why the House is taking so much time to appoint \nconferees. We are losing weeks of valuable time. Before we can get to \nthe meat of this bill and sit down with members of the conference to \ntake votes on issues, staffs have to spend weeks going over this very \ncomplicated bill. It is a 6-year bill. It is a bill of hundreds of \npages dealing with problems we have with our highways and problems we \nhave with our transit systems all over America. We need to have \nsomething done yesterday. We need to meet this country's growing \ntransportation needs which are improving safety and relieving \ncongestion.\n  In 2003, the last year for which we have statistics, more than 43,000 \npeople in America lost their lives on our roads, the highest number of \nfatalities since 1990. In addition to the personal tragedy associated \nwith these accidents, they cost an estimated $137 billion each year in \nproperty losses, productivity, and medical costs. There is not an \namount you can put on the loss of a life. In addition, we have a \nsituation where we talk about 43,000 people--more than 43,000 people--\nbeing killed, but hundreds of thousands of people are injured. People \nbecome paralyzed. People lose eyes. I have visited a facility in Las \nVegas where they deal with head trauma. The vast majority of people in \nthat facility are the result of automobile accidents.\n  This year, Americans will lose more than 3.6 billion hours to traffic \ncongestion. That is 3.6 billion hours they will not be able to spend \nwith their families, their friends, or at work. The cost of wasted fuel \nwill be about $70 billion.\n  The bipartisan Senate bill--and it was bipartisan, led by the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe, and the \nranking member, Senator Jeffords--this bipartisan Senate bill invests \n$318 billion over 6 years, allowing States to improve safety and reduce \ncongestion on roads.\n  Even this big bill is only an effort to keep a level playing field. \nWe do not make any advancements, as we probably should, but at least it \nallows us to tread water in most places to keep from drowning with the \nproblems we have with traffic in our country. The $318 billion \nrepresents an investment in our transportation infrastructure, protects \nour economy and quality of life, and it creates hundreds of thousands \nof jobs. Why the President would pick this vehicle to flex his muscles \nis something I do not understand. There have been other issues that \nhave come out of this Congress that maybe he should have taken a look \nat, but certainly not the highway bill. It creates hundreds of \nthousands of jobs.\n  We need to move forward on this legislation. I think we need to let \neveryone know that the House of Representatives is the cause of our not \nmoving forward on this bill. If the House appointed conferees today, we \nmight be able to complete this conference by the end of the Congress, \nbut it is going to be a close call. There is so much work to do, and we \nneed the House to work with us, not against us.\n  There are some reports that the chairman of the full committee in the \nHouse--and I have not talked with him; he is my friend--does not want a \nbill; that he is so disappointed with what has happened with the White \nHouse that he just says: I don't want a bill.\n  I hope that is wrong. I am confident the Members of the Senate and \nthe House can work out the differences on this legislation, and we will \ndo it with the number that will be appropriate to take care of the \nneeds of this country. I think $318 billion is a good figure. If the \nPresident vetoes the bill, it will just be overridden. I have spoken \nwith the leadership in both the House and the Senate, and they \nacknowledge that would happen. But please let the Members vote to do \nthis.\n  Again, all the Senators who have come to me and asked what is \nhappening to the highway bill, I say we\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\nhave done everything we can in the Senate. It is now up to the House to \nappoint conferees. Once that is done, we will move as quickly as \npossible to solve the differences we have with the House of \nRepresentatives and move forward on this bill.\n  I yield my time back and urge we move to the legislation. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We do not believe there is such a \nprecedential effect and we believe it is very clear there is not, but \nbecause some have raised that question, we would like to simply amend \nthe legislation that is before us today to make it perfectly clear \nthere is no precedential effect of this language on any State other \nthan South Carolina.\n  For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to amend \nmy own amendment, which is at the desk, in the form of an amendment \nwhich we have presented to the other side.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nhours of debate equally divided on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take but a few moments because the \nSenator from Washington is on the floor to debate her amendment. It is \nan important and serious amendment she brings, but what she has refused \nto allow Idaho to do this morning, by objecting to the unanimous \nconsent request of Senator Crapo, is to deny Idaho and Washington the \nright to assure that the legislation that was passed is not precedent \nsetting to the agreements Idaho and Washington now have.\n  In 1995, Idaho's Governor Phil Batt, with my assistance, negotiated a \nmilestone agreement with the Department of Energy on the cleanup and \nremoval of nuclear waste in Idaho. After that agreement was in place, I \nteamed with the then-Senator, now Governor, Dirk Kempthorne, to codify \nthat agreement into law as a provision in an annual Department of \nDefense authorization. What Senator Graham of South Carolina has done \nIdaho did in 1995. That became the basis for Idaho to operate and in \nlarge part then for Washington to proceed to begin the cleanup of a \nvery serious problem the State of Washington has at Hanford.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Washington and I, and my colleague from \nIdaho, recognize the complexity and the seriousness of this problem. \nThat is not in dispute. When DOE then asked to change and modify some \nof those relationships, a judge said, no, you cannot do that without a \nrulemaking process. DOE has determined to go ahead with that, but up \nuntil then they have said, their attorneys have said and the attorneys \nat OMB have said, you do not have a clear path forward to cleanup. \nIdaho disagrees and Washington disagrees.\n  At the same time, DOE does not plan to spend the money, denying us \nthe cleanup we expect and we believe is under the milestone agreement \ncrafted by Idaho, accepted by DOE, and accepted by this Senate in 1995.\n  What the Senator from Idaho tried to do, and the Senator from \nWashington refused to allow him to do, which is very frustrating to \nunderstand, is to assure any action taken today that South Carolina \nwould want to take, that their Governor, their attorney general and \ntheir environmental agencies want to take, is no way precedent setting \nagainst the court agreement or against the Idaho relationship and \nagreement Governor Batt crafted and that the State of Washington has.\n  Is that confusing to anyone? Well, it should not be. There are fairly \nclear lines out there. I do not understand why we are not allowed to \nclarify that at this moment. If we cannot, then we will clarify it in \nother ways over the course of the action on this bill.\n  There are a variety of vehicles we can take because it is paramount \nthat we, as we think we have, assure our State agreement is in place, \nand most importantly that DOE can move forward in this fiscal year to \nspend some $97 million in cleanup they are now saying they cannot do \nbecause the advice from their attorneys and the advice from OMB is not \nto spend; they do not have a clear path forward.\n  We believe the legislation offered by Senator Crapo offers that clear \npath forward, and clearly that is the direction we want to go, to \nassure Idaho's agreement, to assure Washington is on firm ground but, \nmost importantly that we do not lose 12 or 14 months of cleanup and \nthat the $97 million slated to head to Idaho drifts off and is spent \nsomewhere else, along with the cleanup money for Washington being spent \nsomewhere else.\n  We want it on the ground at Hanford. We want it on the ground at the \nINEEL in Idaho Falls doing what DOE and Idaho and Washington are \nproceeding to do. At the same time, I cannot, nor will I, step in front \nof a State that has worked its way through its process and believes it \nis on safe ground to move forward with its cleanup.\n  There are some five tanks in South Carolina to be cleaned up. Others \nare being cleaned up now. I am sure South Carolina wants that process \nto go forward. We all know in a rulemaking process, and the vetting \nthat goes forward in a rulemaking process, we may well be 24 months \naway from that kind of a decision once the rule is made, once it is \ntested, once it is aired in the public and, I am quite confident, once \ntwo or three lawsuits are filed against it. Idaho does not have that \nkind of time, nor does the State of Washington, nor does the State of \nSouth Carolina. We want cleanup. We want cleanup now. And we want it to \nmeet the standards under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. We believe what \nwe are doing offers that, profoundly.\n\n  Now we are here to debate what the Senator from Washington and I \nbelieve is a disagreement between the two of us. I don't disagree with \nall of her bill. I certainly support parts of it. But what I do \ndisagree with is that the State of Washington or Idaho or South \nCarolina or any one of the sovereign 50 States of our Nation cannot sit \ndown with a Federal agency, under Federal law, and craft an agreement \nthat gets them to the appropriate cleanup, acceptable by the \nenvironmental community in South Carolina, by their Governor, by their \nattorney general. That is exactly what Idaho did in 1995, exactly what \nIdaho's Senators, myself and then-Senator Dirk Kempthorne, brought to \nthis Senate floor and brought to the Defense authorization bill--and \nthis Senate passed it.\n  Why should we deny or refuse those kinds of State relationships? Does \nthe Federal Government in all instances totally dominate as long as the \nState is within the construct of the law, the Federal law that governs \nnuclear waste, because that is within the sole jurisdiction of the \nFederal Government. We all understand that. I don't\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\nthink so. I think South Carolina did what they felt they needed to do. \nDOE agrees with them. Now, by action, a voice vote of this Senate, the \nSenate agrees with them. Let's affirm that, protect the State of \nWashington and protect the State of Idaho, make sure their agreements \nare what we want them to be, and move forward. The Idaho Governor and \nthe Idaho congressional delegation stand united in that position and in \nthat opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. The Senator from \nWashington controls the time.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am going to start this debate on the \nCantwell amendment, which is the pending amendment before us, and take \n15 minutes or so, if the Chair will give me recognition of that time \nbeing up. Then, depending on how we organize the debate, I would like \nto defer to Senator Hollings of South Carolina because this impacts \nhim.\n  We are here today to talk about whether we as a body want to change \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act and redefine high-level waste as something \nother than waste that should be taken out of tanks in Savannah River, \nout of Washington State Hanford tanks to be stored in a permanent \nrepository, or whether we are going to leave some of that in the tanks \nin the ground and have ground water continue to be contaminated.\n  What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done is put \ninto the Defense authorization bill a change to nuclear waste policy. \nIt is a change in 30 years of science and policy in this country that \nsays that spent nuclear fuel from reactors is highly radioactive, high-\nlevel waste, and should be reprocessed into glassified logs, vitrified \nlogs, and taken to a permanent storage site.\n  DOE is now trying to say some of that we can leave in the tanks. We \ndon't know how much. We would like to just say it is generally up to \nour discretion and leave some of that in the tanks and thereby not be \nclear with the Congress about what level. That is a change to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 set the \nstandard. If my colleagues want to have a debate about changing the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, this Senator is more than willing to have \nthat debate, have the proper hearings, have the proper process, and \nhave the debate.\n\n  The actual jurisdiction for that is the Energy Committee, and that is \nwhat the Parliamentarian has ruled, that the DOD authorization bill \nthrough the Senate Armed Services Committee was not the appropriate \nauthority for changing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the language that \nconflicts with that within the underlying Graham amendment that we just \nmodified--the underlying bill language which was just modified by the \nGraham amendment.\n  Why are we in this predicament? Why are the American people waking up \non this day finding out that a national debate is about to ensue about \nchanging the definition of high-level waste? And that affects every \nState in this country. If you are going to allow one State and the DOE \nto negotiate and change the definition of high-level waste, why not \njust change the definition of transuranic waste or other kinds of waste \nand then, obviously, have that definition apply to States on \ntransportation issues, on storage issues, and many other issues?\n  Let's review where we are and why I am so concerned, because it \nimpacts Washington State. The Hanford Reservation in Washington State \nhas 50 million gallons of highly radioactive nuclear waste that is \nalready leaking into the ground water. You can see the Hanford \nReservation site here, and the Columbia River. Imagine my concern about \ntanks leaking into the ground and the fact that leakage contaminates \nground water, and that affects the Columbia River, a major tributary \nthrough the Northwest. It affects the vitality of our economy in many \nways--in fishing, in tourism, in energy generation. No one in the \nregion wants to believe that somehow radionuclides are now in the \nColumbia River--which, in fact, they are--and that it is going to grow \nto an amount where we cannot protect humans, fish, and safe drinking \nwater. But that is where we are heading if we don't clean up this \nnuclear waste.\n  What does it really look like at Hanford today? I point out to my \ncolleagues, because the Hanford site, which is on the map here--you can \nsee this is the entire Hanford site. This is the picture showing the \nColumbia River. This red spot here is the contaminated ground water \nthat is already leaking into the ground from tanks at Hanford. It is an \n80-square-mile area. That is a plume of various chemicals that have \nalready leaked out of the tank at Hanford. Similar leakage is happening \nat Savannah river. How this is going to be cleaned up given that the \nleakage is already starting to affect the Columbia River is a major \nissue for the Northwest.\n  So we don't take lightly the fact that DOE has now snuck into the \nDefense authorization bill a change in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nthat would reclassify this waste and say some of it is low level and we \ncan simply grout it. By that they mean they can pour cement and sand on \ntop of it and say that it is now fixed.\n  I ask the question of my colleagues, If DOE and the State of South \nCarolina had the authority to make a decision on this and work \ntogether, why don't they just do it? If they are not trying to change \nexisting law, why don't they just come together and make an agreement \non cleanup? They are not because they are trying to change existing \nlaw. They are trying to change the definition of what is high-level \nwaste. They are trying to do that without having the proper hearings, \nwithout going through the proper committees of jurisdiction, without \ngiving people enough time and enough notice on this issue.\n\n  We could continue this debate for many days and not clearly give the \nAmerican people the insight to 30 years of history of nuclear waste \npolicy. But let's look at the various definitions of nuclear waste \nbecause it is an immense framework, that 50 years of disposal law, and \nwhat is high-level waste and its definition. It is under the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. What is spent nuclear fuel? It is a definition under \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. That is what this underlying bill tries \nto change, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act definition of ``nuclear high-\nlevel waste'' and how spent nuclear fuel can be treated. That is being \ndone without a full debate and hearings in the proper committees of \njurisdiction. What DOE and South Carolina are trying to do is change \nthat definition so they can leave some of that storage in the tanks.\n  My colleagues would like to say this does not set a precedent. I can \ntell you that is not the way it is being viewed around the country. It \ncertainly is setting a precedent. In fact, the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nsaid this provision:\n\n     . . . would also set a troubling precedent for waste handling \n     in other states. . . . If shortcuts can be taken at Savannah \n     River, why not at Prairie Island?\n\n  In their site? Why not Idaho, in their facility? Why not as you deal \nwith transuranic waste in New Mexico, in Arizona, or in other States? \nBecause if you are going to give States and DOE the ability to just \nnegotiate definitions and change them, why are we stopping here with \ntank waste?\n  Why aren't we considering other things? This is an issue that needs \nthe full attention of this Congress. It needs the full attention not \nonly of the Members who come from States where we have ground water \nleaking and contamination. Members should realize this vote is about \nchanging a Federal policy that has been 30 years on the books without \nthe debate and without the science. This is an inappropriate time to be \nchanging this policy.\n  What about the waste we have in these States? One report I will read \nfor some of my colleagues before I turn it over to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina who wants to make a few points about this, the ground \nwater contamination at Savannah River is just as serious as it is in \nWashington State. Yes, they have fewer tanks than we do in Washington \nState, but it is some of the most contaminated waste that exists.\n  I am very concerned that we actually do something to clean up the \nground water. This report entitled ``Nuclear Dumps By The Riverside: \nThreats to the Savannah River from Radioactive Contamination at the \nSavannah River Site,'' which was done in March of this\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nyear, says that the contamination in the ground water and surface water \noften greatly exceeded safe drinking water limits in both radioactive \nand nonradioactive toxic materials. This material threatens the \nSavannah River and possibly other resources in the region and comes \nfrom the radioactive hazardous waste being dumped in trenches, \ncontaminated soil, and from the high-level waste tanks that are not \nbeing retrieved.\n  This is a report saying it is leaking into the ground water at \nSavannah River, that it is causing an impact; it is contaminating that \nground water; it is causing pollution in the Savannah River. I find \nthat very much a concern.\n  In Washington State, along the Columbia River, this stretch of the \nColumbia River has one of the largest bedding grounds for salmon in our \nState. Now those fish are being contaminated in a similar way if we do \nnot come up with an effective cleanup plan.\n  What is the tritium and drinking water standard at Savannah River? \nWater that is tritium-tainted is far more dangerous to children and \ndeveloping fetuses than to adults. Recent research indicates the \ncurrent safe drinking water standards for tritium are not adequate to \nprotect developing fetuses to the level comparable for that of \nnonpregnant adults.\n  What are we saying to people at Savannah River? Do not go fishing in \nthe Savannah River? Do not provide some sort of safety for consumers \nwho are depending on that?\n  The report goes on and talks about subsistence fishing in the \nSavannah River. We have many tribes in the Northwest that fish out of \nthe Columbia River, too. We are not going to protect them because the \nlevel of contamination that is already in the water now is starting to \nshow very dangerous signs for both ground water standards and \nsubsistence fishing?\n  We need to do our job and clean this up. For 30 years the policy has \nbeen to take the waste out of the tanks, move it, glassify it, and put \nit in a permanent storage. We are changing that with very little debate \nin the Senate today.\n  Obviously, I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment \nwhich would strike this reclassification and say to DOE: Here is the \ncleanup money for the States of Washington, Idaho, and for Georgia, and \nthe money should be spent on this cleanup effort.\n  It continues the process of cleaning up the tanks that have been \nclassified as high-level waste, and it makes the cleanup process \ncontinue to move forward.\n  We took the language from Governor Kempthorne. Governor Kempthorne \nsaid to many people, including my colleagues from Idaho, that he had \nconcern with the current underlying bill. In fact, Governor Kempthorne, \nlike our Governor in Washington, has had to deal with this in a major \nway. This is what he said about the legislation:\n\n       [I]t would be a huge step backward, reinforcing public \n     fears about our nation walking away from nuclear cleanup \n     obligations.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article from the Idaho \nStatesman in which former Governors Cecil Andrus and Phil Batt said the \nsame thing, that to adopt this legislation could jeopardize the full \nimplementation and agreement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Idaho Statesman, June 3, 2004]\n\n     Former Governors Raise Concern About DOE Bill on Nuclear Waste\n\n       Two former Idaho governors urged Idaho's senators Wednesday \n     to defend a 1995 nuclear waste agreement as they vote today \n     on two Department of Energy issues.\n       Former Gov. Cecil Andrus and Phil Batt raised concerns \n     about an amendment to the $450 billion annual defense budget \n     bill, which would allow DOE to leave some radioactive waste \n     in the ground in South Carolina.\n       Critics say the bill threatens the agreement Batt \n     negotiated for removal of nuclear waste from the Idaho \n     National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Idaho's \n     two Republican senators say it doesn't.\n       ``We caution our congressmen not to adopt legislation which \n     would in any way alter or jeopardize the full implementation \n     of the agreement,'' Andrus and Batt said in a joint \n     statement.\n       Idaho's Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Larry Craig \n     say they agree with Batt and Andrus, but believe the bill \n     doesn't threaten Batt's agreement. They say a second \n     amendment they sponsor, which also is up for a vote today, \n     would restore $95 million to the budget to ensure DOE keeps \n     its commitment to Idaho.\n       ``We are working overtime now, not only to honor those \n     commitments, but to secure the necessary monies to allow the \n     cleanup to continue at the INEEL,'' Craig said.\n       Craig and Crapo find themselves at odds with Idaho Gov. \n     Dirk Kempthorne and Idaho's two Republican U.S. Reps. Mike \n     Simpson and C.L. ``Butch'' Otter, who oppose the plan to \n     reclassify South Carolina's nuclear waste. They argue that \n     passing the bill sets a precedent threatening to undercut an \n     Idaho victory in federal court last year that stopped DOE \n     from reclassifying waste sludge in buried tanks from high-\n     level to low-level waste.\n       ``This legislation would be a huge step backward, \n     reinforcing public fears about our nation walking away from \n     nuclear cleanup obligations,'' Kempthorne said recently.\n       Crapo disagrees. DOE had tried to get he and Craig and \n     Washington senators to sign on to the reclassified definition \n     of waste, which would allow the government to clean up Cold-\n     War era sites like the INEEL at far lower costs. But they \n     refused.\n       They agreed, however, with Republican Sen. Lindsey O. \n     Graham of South Carolina, that states ought to be able to \n     negotiate separate waste deals that would reclassify the \n     waste differently than elsewhere, Crapo said.\n       ``Each state has different needs and circumstances,'' Crapo \n     said.\n       Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington has introduced \n     an amendment that would pull Graham's agreement out of the \n     defense bill. She has criticized Graham, Crapo and Craig for \n     proposing the reclassification in South Carolina without a \n     public hearing and national debate.\n       ``If somebody thinks this is an issue that affects the \n     state of Washington, or affects just Idaho, or affects South \n     Carolina--it doesn't,'' she said. ``There are bodies of \n     water, with the potential of nuclear waste in them, that flow \n     through many parts of our country.''\n       Crapo said he and Craig are willing to strengthen the \n     language in Graham's amendment to ensure it doesn't threaten \n     Idaho, if necessary. Under the 1995 agreement, the federal \n     government is required to remove specific nuclear waste at \n     the INEEL to certain specifications and under deadlines, or \n     face monetary penalties.\n       If DOE doesn't respect the deal, shipment of spent nuclear \n     fuels to the INEEL from Navy reactors would have to stop.\n       ``All I'm saying is leave our agreement alone,'' Batt said.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Obviously, we want to move forward with the language \nthat Kempthorne's office and others in our State of Washington and \nothers say to DOE, to move ahead on your cleanup plans under the \ncurrent law, which says that hazardous nuclear fuel, spent nuclear \nfuel, needs to be taken out of tanks, glassified, and put into a \npermanent repository. That is what we have been working toward.\n  This is not a debate we should be having in one afternoon on the \nSenate floor. It is far more complex than that. This Senator certainly \ndid not want to have this complex debate on the Senate floor. This \nSenator wanted this policy to go through the normal channels for \ndiscussion.\n  This Senator did not fill the amendment tree last week with a process \nin which this Senator had to object just to get a vote. So now we are \nhaving a debate which gets a time limit on my amendment. But this \nSenator was not the person who set this process in motion. I will stand \nhere and debate the policy that is before the Senate.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We did have a committee hearing on February 25, 2004. We \nhad the committee hearing and Mr. Roberson testified in front of that \ncommittee. On March 23, 2004, there was a committee hearing on the very \nsame issue. Those two previous committees were within my subcommittee \non Armed Services. On March 31, 2004, Senator Domenici in his committee \nhad this debate. It has been going on in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee back to 2000. We have testimony from there. There has \nalready been a lot of discussion about this subject and the proper way \nof disposing it.\n  This is the same kind of procedure we have used in Colorado to clean \nup Rocky Flats where we have had an expedited procedure. The people of \nColorado are delighted because now we have closure and we have it ahead \nof time and under budget, so far. Hopefully, we can get this to apply \nto other areas.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator have a question? I don't know that I \nheard the question, but let me say the underlying Graham language was \nnever debated by the Energy Committee. The underlying Graham language \nwas never seen prior to the Energy Committee--before this bill came out \nof the SASC Committee. In fact, the ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee sent a\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\nletter saying that this SASC Committee did not have jurisdiction over \nthis issue.\n  So the Graham language in this bill has not been before the Energy \nCommittee regarding its exact language and the impact of that language.\n  Now, broad concepts about whether DOE has the right to reclassify \nwaste, yes, have been a big subject of debate. In fact, that is why I \nbelieve the courts basically said the Department of Energy does not \nhave jurisdiction over this issue and that they have to change the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act if they want to have this authority.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator will yield, I would like to clarify that \nit was not the Energy Committee, it was the Appropriations Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee. Make that clear for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 15 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell, and my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin. They have been carrying the ball for a national policy \nparticularly as it affects my State of South Carolina.\n  The truth is, I just heard that the Appropriations Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, upon which I serve, had hearings about \nSavannah River. I had never heard of the hearings. I know they did not \nhave hearings in the Armed Services Committee and they did not consider \nit in the Armed Services Committee.\n  Now, right to the distinguished request made by my wonderful \ncolleague from Idaho, they seem to think there is sort of a States \nrights.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will get through my thought and I will yield.\n  They seem to think there is sort of a States rights to high-level \nradioactive nuclear waste. I can tell you, I have the distinction of \nstanding at the desk of John C. Calhoun, the grandfather of States \nrights. But there are no States rights when it comes to high-level \nradioactive waste.\n\n  I am having a hard time getting a logical grasp to this particular \nproblem because I want to be super cautious and understanding of my \ncolleague, Senator Graham. He is a wonderful Senator. He and I work \ntogether on everything, but we differ on this one. It is not a \npolitical difference; it is a matter of policy.\n  I have been involved with nuclear policy over some 50 years. Forty-\nnine years ago, as Lieutenant Governor of the State of South Carolina, \nI was chairman of the Regional Advisory Council on Nuclear Energy. It \nwas a compact of some 17 States. We were talking about the high-level \nradioactivity waste. At that particular time we were cautioned by the \nexperts in nuclear fission that the Savannah River was not a place for \npermanent storage, whatever, in that we had the Tuscaloosa aquifer, \nwhich is the water supply going into the Savannah River that now \nfurnishes Savannah, Augusta, and other cities along that river their \nwater supply.\n  Otherwise, it is on the very edge of an earthquake fault. The \nearthquake fault comes right through from Calhoun County to Orangeburg \nCounty over to Aiken County. I had hearings about the San Andreas \nearthquake fault out in California in the Commerce Committee some 30 \nyears ago. I know how dangerous this is.\n  We are all familiar about the dangerous nature of trying to store \nhigh-level radioactive waste in the Savannah River site. We were told \nat that time: Don't worry they will only be there for 2 years. And now, \nas I stand on the Senate floor, the 2 years has become 4, the 4 has \nbecome 8, the 8 has become 16, the 16 has become 32; and now it is \nalmost 50-some years and we are still dealing with this problem.\n  It is a complex problem, but it has been dealt with nationally with \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. \nThey ascribed to the Department of Energy the administration of high-\nlevel radioactive waste.\n  Along came the State of Kentucky, along with this so-called scheme \nthat is afoot--the Kentucky case against the United States--and \nKentucky tried to redefine high-level radioactive waste.\n  In the Kentucky decision, under the exclusionary clause, the court \nfound they could not do that; that is, States were only relegated to \nsolid waste, not radioactive or high-level waste.\n  So under that particular decision, citing, of course, the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act of 1976, they said the States could, yes, \ndeal with the solid waste but not with the high-level radioactive \nwaste. And we had subscribed. That is what is confusing to this Senator \nand the Senators from Idaho and California and the State of Washington \nand everywhere else, because under that exclusionary clause of the 1954 \nAct, you cannot just come around with a little State amendment, and try \nto redefine high-level radioactive waste for the other 49 States or the \nother 48 States.\n  That is why, if it were able to be handled just at the State level, \nthe Senators from Idaho or the Senators from Georgia or the Senators \nfrom South Carolina could handle it on their own. It would just be \nhandled on their own. That is the dilemma we are in. Because my \ndistinguished colleague has not only put in what the New York Times has \ncalled a stealth amendment, with no hearings and no consideration \nwhatsoever, and gone around to his colleagues, obviously, over on the \nother side of the aisle, because he has been looking for assistance \nfrom Georgia and Idaho and Washington and all the other States that \ncould be affected, and he said: Now this only affects my State. My \nGovernor is for it and I am for it. I have talked to the Energy \nDepartment, and this is how to get moving and accelerate the removal of \nthis waste. And what I am interested in is the removal of this waste.\n  Well, I am interested in the removal of the waste just as \nexpeditiously and as safely as possibly can be done. Let me emphasize--\nand it will show in an affidavit by David E. Wilson, the Assistant \nBureau Chief for Land and Waste Management of the Department of Health \nand Environmental Control of South Carolina. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the entire affidavit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   CASE NO. CV-01-413-S-BLW--AFFIDAVIT OF DAVID E. WILSON, JR., P.E.\n\n       Carlisle Roberts, Jr., General Counsel; Samuel L. Finklea, \n     III, Chief Counsel for Environmental Quality Control, Office \n     of General Counsel, SC Department of Health and Environmental \n     Control, Columbia, SC.\n       United States District Court for the District of Idaho, \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.; Snake River \n     Alliance, Petitioners, vs. Spencer Abraham, Secretary, \n     Department of Energy; United States of America, Respondents.\n       David E. Wilson, Jr., P.E., being duly sworn upon oath \n     deposes and says:\n       1. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) owns the Savannah \n     River Site (SRS) located in South Carolina.\n       2. Reprocessing of nuclear fuel at the Savannah River Site \n     (SRS), reprocessing occurred at the F and H-Area Chemical \n     Separations Facilities, otherwise known as the F and H-Area \n     Canyons.\n       3. Each facility used different suites of chemicals to \n     derive preferred radioactive isotopes, including, but not \n     limited to plutonium, uranium, and neptunium.\n       4. Although different suits of chemicals were used in \n     reprocessing, the general process was the same; irradiated \n     nuclear fuel and targets were first dissolved in corrosive \n     chemicals, then other chemicals were added to separate the \n     preferred radioactive isotopes from the fission and \n     activation products in the fuel and targets.\n       5. The preferred isotopes were then used for weapons \n     manufacture and other uses, and the separated fission and \n     activation products, along with the chemicals they were \n     suspended in (first and second cycle raffinate streams), were \n     disposed of in under ground tanks.\n       6. During the course of reprocessing at SRS, approximately \n     37 million gallons of liquid wastes were generated containing \n     approximately 426 million curies of radioactivity.\n       7. The waste placed in these tanks over the years have \n     settled and precipitated out solid materials in a layer of \n     sludge at the bottom of the tanks.\n       8. There are 3 million gallons of this sludge (8% of the \n     volume) containing 226 million curies of radioactivity (55% \n     of the curies).\n       9. The material above the sludge layer consists of \n     concentrated supernate liquids and post-evaporation salt \n     cake.\n       10. There are approximately 34 million gallons (92% of the \n     volume) of supernate and salt cake containing 200 million \n     curies of radioactivity (45% of the curies).\n       11. The reprocessing wastes were placed in 51 underground \n     tanks at SRS, ranging in size from 750,000 gallons to over \n     1,300,000 gallons.\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\n       12. Twenty-four (24) of the 51 tanks are constructed of \n     carbon steel inside concrete containment vaults and do not \n     have fully secondary containment.\n       13. The remainder of the tanks have full secondary \n     containment.\n       14. All 24 tanks that do not have full secondary \n     containment tanks are well beyond their design lives and 9 of \n     the 24 have had known leaks to their secondary containment.\n       15. Two of these tanks have been closed through a process \n     approved by the State of South Carolina.\n       16. To date, the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) \n     has treated approximately one million gallons of liquid waste \n     containing 30 million curies radioactivity.\n       Further your affiant sayeth naught. David E. Wilson, Jr., \n     P.E.\n       March 24, 2003, Columbia, SC.\n       SWORN TO before me this 24th day of March, 2003.\n       Notary Public for South Carolina.\n       My commission expires 12/5/05.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me just state at the outset that South Carolina has \n70 percent of all of the Nation's defense-related radioactivity. Under \nsection 8 of Mr. Wilson's affidavit, there are 3 million gallons of \nthis sludge containing 226 million curies of radioactivity, 55 percent \nof the curies. That is over half of the radioactivity. You are not \ndealing with just little remains and harmless sludge that we can pour \nsand over and then seal with concrete.\n  Incidentally, it is not going to leak from the top. The only thing \nthat leaks from the top is the Ship of State. That is the White House. \nWe all know that. These containers ship and leak from the bottom. We \nhave three types of containers: the one single wall, the second type is \nthe single wall with a saucer underneath, and then they made the double \nwall.\n  We have found, from a recent report by the Alliance for Nuclear \nAccountability, the type 1s and 2s have leak sites. The third type tank \nhas small amounts of ground water that have leaked into the tanks, and \nso forth.\n  So we are dealing with fire, and we are dealing with it on a national \nbasis. Heaven knows, I have worked with it on an international basis.\n  In earlier years, they had a plane that, unfortunately, let go of a \nhydrogen bomb into the Mediterranean. If anybody wants to travel to the \nCote d'Azur or the Mediterranean, all they have to do is come to Aiken, \nSC, because they loaded up the marsh and the sand all where this bomb \nhad been dropped in the Mediterranean, put it in 55-gallon drums, \nbrought it across the harbor there at Charleston, carried it up and \nburied it in Aiken, SC.\n  I have worked with the 5-year compacts, and that is why I was \nastounded and aghast at this idea that somehow this is a little problem \nfor South Carolina and it would be easily handled. It is not that \neasily handled.\n  This is what the amendment says, and this is, I think, the intent of \nthe distinguished colleague from South Carolina, because we have to \nsign off on it.\n  Well, under the Kentucky case, there is not any signoff on it. Now, \nof course, the Department of Energy--and they are all friendly with the \ndistinguished Secretary Abraham. But I do not trust them--not honest-\nwise. I know Senator Abraham is as honest as the day is long, but I do \nnot trust his disposition with respect to nuclear. In fact, I had to \nstand on the floor when he was trying to abolish the Department of \nCommerce and Energy. President Bush's Secretary of Energy wanted to \nabolish his Department before he became Secretary.\n  This particular amendment has been put on the Armed Services bill, \nwithout hearings, without us knowing anything about it, and certainly \nwithout the Attorney General knowing about it. I called two members of \nthe South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, and \nthey did not know anything about it.\n  They were appalled and aghast. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Law with respect to \n     materials stored at a Department of Energy site at which \n     activities are regulated by the State--\n\n  ``At which activities are regulated by the State.'' Now, that goes to \nthat 1976 act, which says that the States under that particular \nprovision regulate solid waste but not radioactive. That is why we have \nhad this difference. One lawyer would say, reading that: Why, it starts \noff ``at which activities are regulated by the State,'' and that could \nonly relate to solid waste, not radioactive waste. It doesn't amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1954 which exclusively relegates to the \nCongress and to all 50 States the designation of high-level waste.\n  But then he goes on to add this language:\n\n       High level radioactive waste does not include radioactive \n     material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear \n     fuel that the Secretary of Energy determines is in deep \n     geological repository and has, to the maximum extent \n     practical, in accordance been removed.\n\n  And you get into these fancy words ``to the maximum extent \npractical.'' Now, why do I say what I do? On the one hand, you know \nwhat the intent is. The intent of Senator Graham of South Carolina is \nthe same intent of Senator Hollings of South Carolina: to protect South \nCarolina from this high-level radioactive waste. But that doesn't \nhappen that way because of the Kentucky case and everything else of \nthat kind.\n  You can go and read the Kentucky decision. I don't want to take up \nall of the time. In other words, it isn't the intent. And if I was \nseated as a judge on a court saying, well, let's try to find out what \nthe congressional intent was, the congressional intent was not to \nredefine high-level radioactive waste; it was just to allow an \nagreement with the State of South Carolina and the Department of Energy \nto work out how to remove that sludge. But it didn't go to the basic \nlaw. That would be one argument.\n  Another argument would say: Wait a minute; with the State of South \nCarolina, we can do whatever we want, and we could give permission to \nthe Department of Energy, the right to reclassify high-level \nradioactive waste.\n  So you have this duplicity in this particular amendment, particularly \nas you see how it is drawn. Section D of the amendment says: Defined in \nthis section, the term ``State'' means the State of South Carolina.\n  So all you have to do is run around to the colleagues and work the \namendment and legislation in the same way. I don't fault my colleague, \nbut I think he is making a grievous error in the sense that he is \nsaying this just applies to the State of South Carolina, and we can \nprotect the State.\n  The Governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, has been strong on the \nenvironment. I knew he wouldn't approve it. Now I have his letter \npurportedly approving it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      State of South Carolina,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, May 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to support Section 3116, \n     Defense Site Acceleration Completion, in the FY 2005 \n     Department of Defense Authorization bill, S. 2400. More \n     specifically, this section of the bill will allow for an \n     accelerated clean up of the Savannah River Site in South \n     Carolina.\n       This Administration is concerned about the prospect of \n     long-term storage of radioactive waste in aging tanks at the \n     Savannah River Site. Under the current Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act, the cleanup process could leave the waste in those \n     storage tanks for an additional 30 years.\n       However, the amendment allows the U.S. Department of \n     Energy, working with the South Carolina Department of Health \n     and Environmental Control, to move more quickly to clean up \n     the Savannah River Site. In fact, the estimated cleanup time \n     will be reduced by 23 years, at a savings of $16 billion to \n     the taxpayers.\n       Most important is ensuring that the State of South Carolina \n     will be able to retain an oversight role in the cleanup \n     process. According to analysis by the South Carolina \n     Department of Health and Environmental Control, the state's \n     environmental regulatory agency, the clean up process will \n     still require an equal partnership with the State.\n       As you move through the legislative process, we urge you \n     and your colleagues to retain two very important goals for \n     South Carolina: 1. allow for a more accelerated clean up \n     process, and 2. provide strong language to protect the \n     State's sovereignty within the process of accelerated \n     cleanup.\n       Thank you for your leadership in the United States. I look \n     forward to working with you on this and many other matters of \n     importance to our State.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mark Sanford,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is on May 20. He addresses it to Senator Graham \nand says: I am writing about this section to allow an accelerated \ncleanup. The administration is concerned--he is talking about the \nprospect of long-term\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\nstorage at Savannah River. However, the amendment allows the Department \nof Energy, working with the State of South Carolina Department of \nHealth and Environmental Control, to move more quickly to clean up the \nSavannah River site.\n  He doesn't say to reclassify high-level waste. And in fact, the \nestimated cleanup time will be reduced. Here is the key paragraph of \nthis particular letter:\n\n       Most important is ensuring that the State of South Carolina \n     will be able to retain an oversight to the cleanup process.\n\n  No. Under the exclusionary clause, there is no oversight by the State \nof South Carolina, the State of Idaho, the State of Colorado, the State \nof Michigan, the State of Washington. There is no oversight to that \nparticular provision because you have the categorical law under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act where the Congress alone defines it and not by \nagreement between the health and environmental department of a \nparticular State and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n  So you can see that the Governor thinks he has something. But then he \ncancels it out. It reminds me when we had the reorganization of our \ninsurance department. The Capital Life Insurance Company was \nreorganizing and looking for a slogan. And the winning slogan was by \nSam B. King. He said: Fritz, do you know what the new slogan is? \nCapital Life will surely pay if the small print on the back don't take \nit away.\n  So you have a similar kind of situation here in this amendment and in \nthis letter and in this understanding and this intent. You have to go \nto congressional intent. He says: It ensures that the State of South \nCarolina will be able to retain an oversight. You don't retain an \noversight over the exclusionary clause of the definition of high-level \nwaste by an agreement between a DEHC department and the Department of \nEnergy. Come on. That is exactly what we have in play here.\n  The House of Representatives over on the congressional side, they \nconsidered this and said: Wait a minute; if we are going to redefine \nhigh-level radioactive waste in America, let's go to the National \nAcademy of Sciences and get an expert. Don't listen to Senator Hollings \nor Senator Graham or any other Senators or any other Secretary that is \ntrying to save money because they have been engaged in this over the \nyears. Let's go to the National Academy of Sciences. Let's have \nhearings. Let's get the expert opinion. And if there is a redefinition \nof high-level radioactive waste, we will have it. But let's not do it \nthis way.\n  I have many an authority here with respect to it, but the most recent \nauthority is the State itself. You can get a letter from the Governor, \nbut here is the amicus brief in the National Resources Defense Council \nv. Spencer Abraham whereby in Idaho they have already lost the case. \nThe council brought it in the State of Idaho. The State of Idaho joined \nwith them and everything else like that, and they lost at the district \nlevel.\n  Then on appeal, we have a brief signed by Samuel L. Finklea, the \nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 \nBull Street, Columbia, SC, dated 23 March. So as of March 23, the State \nof South Carolina on appeal said: No way; we are with Idaho. We are \nwith the decision. We are not redefining high-level radioactive waste.\n  And yet you have the State of South Carolina's Governor writing this \nletter but saying, provided further that the State has a sign-off, \nwhich legally it can't. You can't designate to the State under the \nexclusionary clause one State sign off to the thing. That is what has \ncaused the confusion here and the misunderstanding between the \nparticular colleagues.\n  I am going to cut it short because I know everybody wants to move \ntoday. I think I have made our position clear. I have letters here. I \nask unanimous consent that letters and citations from the South \nCarolina Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club, and various other \norganizations that I will enumerate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    South Carolina\n\n\n                                          Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, June 2, 2004.\n     Senator Fritz Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Today I am writing you because we at \n     the South Carolina Wildlife Federation are concerned and \n     appalled at the effort to reclassify certain categories of \n     nuclear waste at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Merely \n     changing the name of the waste from high-level with the wave \n     of a magic wand does not make the risk to the environment any \n     less. On the contrary, it means that an unnecessary and \n     unacceptable risk will be inflicted upon the citizens and \n     wildlife of South Carolina, Georgia and the country as a \n     whole.\n       The South Carolina Wildlife Federation opposes the proposed \n     changes to the Defense Authorization bill to reclassify these \n     high-level wastes as ``incidental'' thereby lowering the \n     standard for cleanup.\n       The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act is specific in its policy \n     regarding the disposal of nuclear waste as it clearly states \n     for this waste to be buried deep underground in a repository \n     chosen for disposal of this waste. The Department of Energy \n     (DOE) has made several attempts in the past to shirk its \n     responsibility and the courts have soundly rejected its \n     reclassification attempts.\n       Failing to clean up the tanks and remove the waste can lead \n     to serious long-lasting pollution of the Savannah River and \n     the groundwater resources of South Carolina, resources that \n     provide water for drinking, industry, and agriculture. The \n     Savannah River is also an extremely important recreational \n     resource for boating and fishing, and it provides critical \n     wildlife habitat for diverse fishery, waterfowl and other \n     species.\n       Thank you for once again coming to the rescue of the \n     environment through your co-sponsorship of the Cantwell-\n     Hollings Amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill, S. \n     2400. Your amendment would remove the reclassification \n     language from the Defense Authorization bill. We fully \n     support you in this effort.\n       Such an important change in the nuclear waste storage \n     policy should only be given serious consideration in a stand-\n     alone bill where it can be put forth for full debate in the \n     light of day, not bobtailed onto a spending bill. Thank you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Angela Viney,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Sierra Club\n\n\n                                       South Carolina Chapter,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, June 2, 2004.\n     Re: S. 2400 Defense Authorization\n\n     Senator Ernest Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: The South Carolina Chapter of the \n     Sierra Club thanks you for the Cantwell-Hollings Amendment to \n     S. 2400, the Defense Authorization Bill.\n       Senator Lindsay Graham has decided that the best way to \n     eliminate an environmental hazard is to redefine it. We find \n     this unacceptable.\n       When Department of Energy Secretary Abraham visited the \n     Savannah River Site (SRS) recently he named SRS a national \n     laboratory specializing in nuclear waste cleanup. For a \n     moment we rejoiced in thinking that both the environment and \n     economic development would benefit simultaneously.\n       That thought did not last long. Senator Graham said we do \n     not need to make every effort to clean-up highly radioactive \n     waste. According to him it can be abandoned on the site \n     permanently with an amendment to the Defense Authorization \n     Bill.\n       Congress is needlessly debating whether to lower our \n     standards for protecting our water supplies from radioactive \n     waste leaking from nuclear weapons production sites. We \n     appreciate you being on the right side of this issue.\n       The SRS complex houses approximately 37 million gallons of \n     high-level radioactive waste, much of it in the form of \n     liquid sludge. That is enough radioactive waste to fill every \n     bathtub in Richland, Lexington and Aiken counties in South \n     Carolina.\n       When SRS was built in the 1950's, the plan was to move out \n     the waste from nuclear weapons production within 10 years. \n     The deadly waste is still there 50 years later. If Graham's \n     amendment passes, South Carolina will be stuck with it \n     forever.\n       This dangerous waste is stored in old tanks that have been \n     known to leak. The tanks sit in the water table in one of the \n     largest and most important watersheds in the Southeast. The \n     Savannah River and the entire watershed serve agriculture, \n     industry, fishing, and recreational activities. Failing to \n     clean up the tanks will lead to a serious and long-lasting \n     pollution threat that is detrimental to the entire nation.\n       Graham proposes mixing the radioactive sludge with grout \n     and using the tanks as permanent waste depositories. This \n     action was declared illegal by a federal judge in Idaho. That \n     is why Graham has introduced his amendments, to make what is \n     now illegal, legal.\n       Before jumping into this risky method of waste storage, \n     most studies need to be done on the potential for water \n     supply contamination by waste leaching out of the grout. This \n     method of storing the waste may actually make it more \n     difficult to retrieve it in the event of a leak.\n       State Attorney General Henry McMaster has filed an amicus \n     brief on behalf of South Carolina agreeing with the National \n     Resources Defense Council, the environmental\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n     group that initiated the lawsuit, that the waste not remain \n     in its current location.\n       Another concern about Senator Graham's provision is that it \n     would allow DOE sole discretion in deciding what constitutes \n     high-level radioactive waste in South Carolina, severely \n     limiting the state's voice on such matters. The state would \n     no longer be the final say on what defines high-level waste \n     in our own backyard and the state would have limited or no \n     power to halt DOE from abandoning this highly radioactive \n     waste. So much for ``states rights'' and ``checks and \n     balances.''\n       The Sierra Club urges the deletion of sections 3116 and \n     3119 of the Defense Authorization Act. Please do not allow \n     the abandonment of high-level radioactive waste at SRS.\n       Again, Senator Fritz Hollings, thank you for standing up \n     for South Carolina and safeguarding the welfare of our future \n     generations by opposing the Graham amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dell Isham,\n\n                                              SC Chapter Director,\n                                                      Sierra Club.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

It emphasizes why we don't have \nStates' rights with respect to high-level radioactive waste. We are \nplaying with fire here on the Armed Services bill. This is a stealth \namendment with no hearings and no consideration. I know my State as \nwell as anybody. In the majority of the State, everybody is against \nthis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Shortcut on Nuclear Waste\n\n       The Senate may consider today whether to allow the Energy \n     Department to reclassify certain nuclear wastes at a weapons \n     plant in South Carolina so they can be disposed of faster and \n     cheaper than if the department complied with current law. \n     Although many senators may be tempted to skim over this issue \n     as a matter of parochial concern to South Carolina, they need \n     to consider this matter carefully lest they set a terrible \n     precedent. The Energy Department has a notoriously poor \n     record in handling environmental issues. It should not be \n     granted such unbridled power to define its waste problems \n     away with the stroke of a pen.\n       The Savannah River site in South Carolina has accumulated a \n     huge inventory of radioactive wastes left over from weapons \n     production, some 37 million gallons held in 51 underground \n     tanks. Under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, virtually all \n     of this material is deemed high-level waste, which must be \n     disposed of in a deep repository like the one being built at \n     Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\n       For some years now, the Energy Department has been hoping \n     to separate its wastes into two streams, reserving deep \n     burial for only the part with high radioactivity. In the case \n     of the South Carolina site, the department is prepared to \n     pump most of the waste out of the tanks for disposal through \n     deep burial. But it wants to leave a hard-to-remove residue \n     of sludge in the tanks and bury it under grout.\n       Officials estimate that this approach could save $16 \n     billion and trim 23 years from the lengthy cleanup process. \n     But those plans were stymied when a federal judge in Idaho \n     concluded that the scheme violated the waste-policy act.\n       Now Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, \n     has inserted language in a defense authorization bill that \n     would achieve the same end. It would allow the department to \n     reclassify the wastes in South Carolina in a way that would \n     allow the disposal of some material on the site. Mr. Graham \n     notes that the state's governor and its health and \n     environmental regulators have signed off on the plan, and he \n     says the decisions on how to handle each tank will be made \n     collaboratively by federal and state officials.\n       Senator Graham's language is potentially a highly \n     significant change in nuclear waste policy, yet it was \n     inserted into a broad military authorization bill behind \n     closed doors, without the benefit of hearings or open \n     discussion. This is unacceptable, given that few areas could \n     have more potential impact on public health for thousands of \n     years into the future.\n       The Energy Department is largely empowered to set its own \n     waste disposal policies, with only minimal oversight from the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Before allowing the department \n     to reclassify its waste products, the Senate should follow \n     the lead of the House and call for an in-depth study of the \n     approach by the National Academy of Sciences. The decision \n     should not be left to an agency that is desperate to get past \n     a staggeringly difficult waste disposal problem.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Washington for her leadership, and also \nSenator Levin for alerting me to this particular danger. This is a \nhighly dangerous matter. We should not be running around with a little \nlegislative rider on the Armed Services bill on a single State \nexception, even if it were legal. I don't think it is legal. But even \nif it were legal, it would all of a sudden indirectly, and without \nother States being involved, redefine high-level radioactive waste. We \ndon't want to do that. This is no way to legislate, and no way to treat \nthis highly dangerous element.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In a moment, I will call on the junior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  First of all, I want to clarify this for the Record. We have had \nthree hearings this year on this very issue. Prior to this year, we \nhave had a number of hearings dealing with the disposal of nuclear \nwaste. I know for a fact the Environment and Public Works Committee had \na hearing in 2000 on the disposal of nuclear waste.\n  On February 25, 2004, the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed \nServices Committee held a hearing on the development of an energy \nenvironmental management program, and a key witness was Jesse Roberson, \nand we talked about this very issue.\n  On March 23, 2004, in the Armed Services Committee hearing we had on \nthe Department of Energy programs, a key witness in that particular \nhearing was Secretary Spencer Abraham.\n  On March 31, 2004, at the Appropriations Energy and Water \nSubcommittee hearing on environmental management, a key witness was \nJesse Roberson.\n  Having clarified that for the Record, I yield 10 minutes to the \njunior Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, in terms of my senior \nSenator, who I respect greatly, there is no doubt in my mind that he \nloves his State. Secondly, this is not about who loves South Carolina. \nWe have a policy disagreement about what is best for our State. That \nhappens on occasion in politics. Senator Hollings has been more than \ngracious in terms of helping me adjust to the Senate and coming to my \noffice, and I publicly acknowledge that. I regret that we differ, but \nwe do.\n  I assure my colleagues that I just did not wake up one day, as the \njunior Senator from South Carolina, sneaking around everybody to come \nup with an amendment that would change the whole national policy on \nnuclear waste for the heck of it. I didn't do that. I have been in \nCongress now for 10 years and in the Senate for a little over a year \nand a half. In the House, I represented the Savannah River site, our \nState's largest employer. It is the facility that was intricately \ninvolved in winning the cold war. We have over 50 tanks full of high-\nlevel liquid waste.\n  The Clinton administration and myself had a bumpy road. I think it is \nfair to say I did not agree with the Clinton administration a lot, but \none thing that we did find common ground about in the 1997 timeframe \nand I think Senator Allard probably remembers this--is that the Clinton \nadministration came up with a new way of looking at high-level waste, \nhow you characterize it.\n  There was a hearing about this in 2000 in the Senate before I got \nhere. During the Clinton administration, the policy was--and before the \nClinton administration--that if the material started out life as high-\nlevel liquid waste, no matter what happened in the\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\nintervening time or whatever characterization it had after being \ntreated, it would have to be considered high-level waste--defense  \nmaterial, high-level waste. The Clinton administration said that is not \nvery logical. What we need to do is look at the characterization of the \nwaste at the end, not where it came from. There was a hearing in May of \n2000 about that concept. I supported that concept then and I support it \nnow.\n\n  In all due deference to my senior Senator, there is nothing in this \namendment that changes the definition of high-level nuclear waste. The \nway you look at high-level nuclear waste and the way you characterize \nit was changed in the Clinton administration in a logical way. We have \ncleaned up two tanks. That has been lost in this debate. There are 50-\nplus tanks of high-level liquid waste. Two of them have been dried up \nand cleaned up. The procedures to clean up those tanks have worked. \nThat has been several years ago. This amendment allows more money to be \nput on the table to clean up the rest of the tanks.\n  Here is what we have been able to do. We have been able to strike an \nagreement between the environmental regulators in South Carolina and \nthe Department of Energy defining what ``clean'' is in terms of those \ntanks. All of the liquid waste will be taken out. There will be about \nan inch and a quarter of material left in the bottom of the tank, like \nthe other two tanks that have already been closed. There will be a \nprocess to treat that inch and a quarter. The NRC has been consulted \nand has blessed this project, saying what is left in the bottom of the \ntank after it is treated is waste incidental to reposit.\n  About people and their opinions regarding what is best for the safety \nof my State, my senior Senator has been an advocate for my State for a \nvery long time. I respect him. I can assure you I share his concerns \nabout what is best for the environment of this region.\n  I have some letters I would like to introduce. I have a letter from \nthe Governor of South Carolina that I think he has already introduced. \nLast week, when we talked about this, Senator Hollings said he cannot \nbelieve the Governor would support this. He has been a great \nenvironmentalist.\n  Mark Sanford, our Governor, does have a very good environmental \nrecord, depending on what scorecard you want to look at. But Mark comes \nfrom the coast. I think most people would say he has been \nenvironmentally sensitive.\n  The letter that Senator Hollings read, please do not misunderstand at \nall, this is an absolute total endorsement of this amendment by our \nGovernor. I am not the type of Senator who would not tell our Governor \nwhat we are doing. The Governor was given the language a long time ago.\n  On April 27, we had a delegation meeting about this language. I have \nbeen shopping this language around for weeks. We have been talking \nabout how to clean up Idaho, Washington, and South Carolina for years. \nWe have had hearings in Senator Allard's committee about this very \ntopic, where DOE came in and talked about the plan to clean up these \ntanks and talked about the two tanks that had already been cleaned up.\n  There have been negotiations going on between Idaho, Washington, and \nSouth Carolina, independent of each other, with the DOE to try to find \na common ground in those States as to how to clean up this high-level \nliquid waste.\n  To my colleague in Washington, who truly is a friend, and I am sorry \nwe got so off stripped on this, we will get over it and work together \nfor the common good when this is over.\n  On January 26, 2004, Congressman Hastings, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Cantwell sent a letter to Governor Locke and Secretary Abraham \nand asked them to work together to resolve the ongoing dispute over \nwaste classification. They did a very good thing in that regard. I ask \nunanimous consent to print that letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2004.\n     Hon. Gary Locke,\n     Governor, State of Washington,\n     Olympia, WA.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Secretary, Department of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Governor Locke and Secretary Abraham: We have become \n     increasingly concerned about the lack of an agreement between \n     the State of Washington and the Department of Energy to \n     resolve the ongoing dispute pertaining to the classification \n     of High Level Waste.\n       Our primary and overriding concern is the safe and timely \n     cleanup of the Hanford site. We know that we share this goal \n     with both the State of Washington and the United States \n     Department of Energy.\n       We are calling on you to take the initiative to establish \n     immediate high level discussions between the State of \n     Washington and the Department of Energy to resolve this \n     issue. We would like to see a commitment to continue the \n     dialogue until such time as a mutually acceptable agreement \n     can be reached.\n       We know the parties have legitimate disagreements. We would \n     ask that such conversations take place without preconditions \n     being set, which could serve to hinder successful \n     negotiations.\n       The stakes are incredibly high and the price of failure is \n     the continued exposure of the people and the environment to \n     unnecessary risks, by potentially slowing the pace of cleanup \n     activities.\n       We know you share our commitment to making our communities \n     safe. We ask for your leadership to create momentum for a \n     successful resolution of this issue.\n       In the past when seemingly intractable problems have faced \n     cleanup obstacles, they have been solved by your common \n     commitment to rise above the obstacles to reach shared \n     objectives. We are confident that working together this \n     outcome can be reached.\n           Sincerely,\n                 Congressman Doc Hastings,\n                 Senator Patty Murray,\n                 Senator Maria Cantwell.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, the letter was an effort \nby the legislative delegation in the State of Washington to get the DOE \nto come up with some classification system for Hanford.\n  Our distinguished Presiding Officer from the State of Idaho has been \nworking for months now for his State to see if they could come up with \na classification system for the State of Idaho. In February 2004, the \nGovernor of Washington indicated he would designate someone to enter \ninto discussion on behalf of the State of Washington. Governor Locke's \nchief of staff called the Deputy Secretary to indicate he was the \nGovernor's designee to hold discussions with the Department of Energy. \nShortly thereafter, the Department of Energy shared draft language with \nthe State of Washington.\n  What has been going on here for a very long time is a collaborative \nprocess between the three States and the Department of Energy to \nremediate the environment when it comes to high-level waste in a manner \nacceptable to the State. That is the process. That has always been the \nprocess, and that must be the process.\n  But here is what we do not want to do as we negotiate individually. \nWe do not want to, as my senior Senator said, have a State have the \nability to define high-level waste because it is a national concern and \na national issue. So we have been jealously guarding that concept. This \namendment does not give the State of South Carolina the ability to \ndefine high-level waste because we would have 50 different versions. \nWhat it does do is it requires a collaborative process. We have already \nclosed two tanks, and before those two tanks could be closed, South \nCarolina had to issue a permit saying: Yes, they are able to be closed. \nThis amendment gives the State of South Carolina permitting authority \nover tank closure. That is exactly what Washington and Idaho are trying \nto pursue.\n  Governor Locke has been working with DOE. The difference is South \nCarolina has gotten there, and to my friend from Washington, there will \ncome a day--soon, I hope--where you can negotiate classification of \nwaste with DOE satisfactory to Washington. And there will come a day \nwhen the Governor of Washington, whoever that may be, will say: That is \na good deal. And the regulators in the State will say: That is a good \nclassification with which we can live.\n  The truth is, if that day ever arrives, because of the way the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act is written, you are going to need legislative \nlanguage to bless that agreement.\n  Washington has a severe problem with tank leakage. I want to tell my\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nfriends from Washington, if that day arrives to where you can find a \nstandard acceptable to your State--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I ask for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. If that day ever arrives, the Senator \nfrom Washington is going to come to this body, and I am going to help \nher. I say the same to my friend from Idaho. That day has arrived in \nSouth Carolina. We have vetted this proposal with everybody I know.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Speaker of the South \nCarolina House, David Wilkins, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    South Carolina\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, May 27, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: It has come to my attention that you \n     have included language in the FY 2005 Department of Defense \n     Authorization bill, S. 2400, which would allow for \n     accelerated cleanup of the Savannah River Site. I write today \n     to express my support of Section 3116.\n       I understand that the South Carolina Department of Health \n     and Environmental Control has worked with you since August of \n     last year to craft legislation that gives South Carolina ``a \n     seat at the table'' when determining what radioactive \n     materials will remain in South Carolina. I support that goal \n     and the expedited cleanup of the radioactive waste tanks at \n     the Savannah River Site.\n       South Carolina and the Department of Energy have had a good \n     working relationship over the years. It is my sincere hope \n     that your legislation will allow this partnership to continue \n     in a mutually beneficial way which cleans up SRS more \n     expeditiously and in a fiscally prudent manner.\n       I concur with Governor Sanford. This language will allow \n     for a more accelerated cleanup process and will help protect \n     the State's sovereignty with respect to the accelerated \n     cleanup.\n       Thank you for your service to the State. I look forward to \n     working with you on this and other issues of importance to \n     the State and Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David H. Wilkins,\n                                             Speaker of the House.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter from the deputy commissioner of the South Carolina \nEnvironmental Quality Control, Robert King, Jr., be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \n           Control,\n                                       Columbia, SC, May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Sec. 3116. Defense Site Acceleration Completion\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Department has reviewed the above \n     referenced language proposed to be added to the S. 2400 \n     National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2005. As you are \n     aware, the Department considers the storage of high-level \n     radioactive waste in aging tanks at the Savannah River Site \n     to be the single most potentially hazardous condition to the \n     environment and people of South Carolina. In fact, the \n     Department has worked closely with the Department of Energy \n     (DOE) to safely close two of the original fifty-one storage \n     tanks.\n       It is the Department's position that the above referenced \n     language will provide a process to close the remaining \n     storage tanks in a similar manner. This will include removing \n     highly radioactive radionuclides to the maximum extent \n     possible and will also provide for public participation in \n     the decision-making process.\n       As always, alternative language could be developed; \n     however, this proposed language allows DOE to move forward \n     with the important task of removing the high-level \n     radioactive waste from the storage tanks while providing a \n     decision-making framework in which the State is included.\n       If you have any questions or need any further information, \n     please have your staff contact David Wilson at (803) 896-\n     4004.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Robert W. King, Jr.,\n\n                                Deputy Commissioner, Environmental\n                                                  Quality Control.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, this letter to me says \nthat the agreement they have achieved with DOE is environmentally sound \nfor South Carolina; we would like to move forward with tank cleanup. \nHere is why this is so important to my State: It will allow $88 million \nto be put on the table. It will allow these tanks, now that we have \nreached an agreement to become dry and safe and secure and closed up, \nto be closed 23 years ahead of schedule. I invite everybody in this \nbody to come to Aiken, SC, and the surrounding community to enjoy golf, \nleisure, and fishing. I will take you fishing in the Savannah River, if \nyou would like to go.\n  I do not want 23 years to go by and the chance of the tanks leaking \nto grow. I do not want the problem that Washington has. I want \nWashington to be able to fix their problem, and I will help the State \nof Washington. But I have a chance to do something in my State that we \nhave not had a chance to do in 10 years. The origin of this being done \nstarted in the Clinton administration, and we are building on what \nhappened then.\n  This amendment is focused only on the agreement in South Carolina. \nSenator Crapo, Senator Craig, and Senator Alexander have an amendment \nto make it absolutely certain. I think it already is, but I am not here \nto put any other State in a bad situation. I am not here to make \nWashington do what we are doing in South Carolina or to prejudice Idaho \nat all. I am just simply asking this body to listen to the people who \nare responsible for the ground water who tell me this is a good \nagreement, it will help my State if we move forward on it, and it will \nsafe $16 billion, for whatever that is worth.\n  The attorney general of South Carolina was mentioned by my \ndistinguished senior Senator. I have a letter from him supporting this \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      the State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                                     May 18, 2004.\n     Re: Sec. 3116. Defense Site Acceleration Completion\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: It is my understanding that the South \n     Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control \n     supports your proposed amendment to be added to the S. 2400 \n     National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2005.\n       DHEC considers the storage of high-level radioactive waste \n     in aging tanks at the Savannah River Site to be potentially \n     the most hazardous environmental situation in South Carolina. \n     Your proposed amendment allows federal authorities to remove \n     this radioactive hazardous waste, while ensuring that the \n     State is statutorily included in the process, with ultimate \n     ``veto'' power on removal decisions.\n       Please allow this letter to serve as my official statement \n     of support for your amendment.\n       Thank you for all that you do on behalf of South Carolina \n     and its grateful citizens.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                   Henry McMaster.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, when we talk about \npeople with agendas, there are all kinds of political agendas when one \ntalks about nuclear programs. That is just politics, and that is the \nstrength of America. There is nothing wrong with that.\n  I have a letter from the Aiken County, SC, legislative delegation--\nDemocrat and Republican house members and senators--who say please \napprove this agreement because it will clean up these tanks ahead of \nschedule, and it will be a good thing for our community. The difference \nbetween them and the New York Times, which is a great paper, is they \nlive there. The Savannah River site is located in Aiken, SC.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Aiken County,\n\n\n                                       Legislative Delegation,\n\n                              Aiken, South Carolina, May 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: We are writing to support Section \n     3116, Defense Site Acceleration Completion, in S. 2400. As we \n     understand it, this section of the bill will allow The \n     Savannah River Site to accelerate cleanup of the Site's \n     remaining waste tanks in a manner consistent with the way \n     Tanks 17 and 20 were closed in the late 1990s.\n       We believe that your language will allow the establishment \n     of environmentally prudent regulations regarding tank waste \n     that will allow the Department of Energy, in conjunction with \n     the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \n     Control, to move more quickly to clean up the Savannah River \n     Site.\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n       We especially appreciate your efforts to work with the \n     State to ensure the State of South Carolina will have a seat \n     at the table when determining the ultimate disposition of any \n     materials left in the state. We concur with Governor Sanford \n     that according to analysis by the South Carolina Department \n     of Health and Environmental Control, the cleanup process \n     envisioned by Section 3116 will provide ``a decision making \n     framework in which the State is included.''\n       We appreciate your efforts on behalf of the Aiken Community \n     to get this cleanup done expeditiously and your continued \n     efforts to do it in a way that decreases the impact on the \n     taxpayers of this nation.\n         Senator W. Greg Ryberg, Senator Thomas L. Moore, Senator \n           Nikki Setzler, Representative Robert S. Perry, Jr., \n           Representative Donald C.

Roland Smith, \n           Representative James ``Jim'' Stewart, Jr., \n           Representative Ken Clark.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I have another letter \nfrom the mayor of Aiken, Fred Cavanaugh, who worked at this site, \nsupporting this agreement. In addition, I have a letter from Ronnie \nYoung, the chairman of the Aiken County Council, where the council \nendorses this amendment.\n  I have a letter from the Chamber of Commerce, the people who have to \nmake a living. I can assure you the Aiken County Chamber of Commerce \nbelieves this will not poison the area. It will do absolutely the \nopposite. It will make it more attractive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print those letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            City of Aiken, SC,\n\n                                                     May 26, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I want to thank you for the positive \n     work you are doing on behalf of the citizens of our country, \n     South Carolina and closer to home, Aiken County. More \n     precisely, thank you for seeking a resolution to the \n     questions related to the definition of--radioactive waste \n     incidental to reprocessing (WIR). As we know, radioactive \n     waste stored in underground tanks is the greatest potential \n     risk to public health and the environment at the Savannah \n     River Site (SRS), and unless resolved, the WIR lawsuit and \n     related issues will stop these critical activities. Your \n     amendment to the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     Authorization Bill will allow for the continued removal and \n     disposition of the waste in a safe manner, and we believe it \n     is critical that it be enacted into law.\n       Your amendment allows SRS to continue to remove waste and \n     close tanks to the same standards and with the same diligence \n     as in the past. It has the endorsement of SC/DHEC and the \n     Governor of South Carolina. Under your amendment SC/DHEC will \n     continue to oversee and approve all SRS waste removal and \n     disposal activities thus assuring continued protection to the \n     public and environment.\n       Conversely, without your amendment, activities to remove \n     and dispose of high level radioactive waste will be stopped \n     and wastes will remain in the less safe liquid form in fifty \n     year old underground tanks. Instead of completing waste \n     removal by 2018, wastes will remain in the old tanks. Equally \n     critical will be the loss of trained and skilled SRS workers \n     because this critical work will stop. I support your \n     amendment as being in the best interest of the citizens of \n     South Carolina who are interested in the safe removal and \n     disposition of high level radioactive wastes. Please convey \n     my position on this important matter to your colleagues in \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Fred B. Cavanaugh,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Aiken County Council,\n\n                                          Aiken, SC, May 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: This letter comes as confirmation of \n     my support of Section 3116, Defense Site Acceleration \n     Completion in the FY 2005 Department of Defense Authorization \n     Bill, S. 2400. This bill will allow for an accelerated clean \n     up of the Savannah River Site.\n       Aiken County is very concerned with the storage of high \n     level radioactive waste in aging tanks at the Savannah River \n     Site. Under the present Nuclear Waste-Policy Act, the cleanup \n     could leave the waste in the aging storage tanks for \n     approximately 30 additional years. This possibly is the most \n     potentially hazardous condition to the people and environment \n     of South Carolina.\n       However, with the acceptance of Section 3116, Defense Site \n     Acceleration Completion, the Department of Energy and the \n     South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control \n     will be able to move much more quickly to cleanup the \n     Savannah River Site, with an estimated savings of $16 billion \n     to the taxpayers.\n       During the cleanup, it is of major importance to the \n     citizens of South Carolina that we are allowed to retain an \n     oversite role in the cleanup process.\n       I urge you and your fellow statesmen to allow for the \n     accelerated cleanup process at the Savannah River Site and to \n     provide a decision making framework in which the State of \n     South Carolina is included.\n       If you have additional questions or need other information, \n     please contact me at (803) 642-1690.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ronnie Young,\n     Chairman, Aiken County Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Greater Aiken Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                     May 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Let me begin by saying thank you for \n     your efforts in seeking a resolution to the uncertainties \n     related to the definition of radioactive waste incidental to \n     reprocessing (WIR). Radioactive waste stored in underground \n     tanks is the greatest potential risk to public health and the \n     environment of the Savannah River Site, and unless resolved, \n     the WIR lawsuit and related issues will stop those critical \n     activities. Your amendment to the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee authorization bill will allow for the continued \n     removal and disposition of waste in a safe manner.\n       SRS has safely removed radioactive wastes from underground \n     tanks for almost ten years and has permanently closed two \n     tanks. These efforts were permitted by the South Carolina \n     Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC/DHEC) with \n     the oversight of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \n     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has reviewed the SRS \n     program and stated that it is comparable to commercial \n     requirements and standards.\n       The Chamber supports your amendment as being in the best \n     interest of those citizens in Aiken and South Carolina who \n     are interested in the safe removal and disposition of high-\n     level radioactive wastes.\n       Without your amendment, activities to remove and dispose of \n     high level radioactive wastes will be stopped and wastes will \n     remain in the less safe liquid form in fifty-year old \n     underground tanks. Instead of completing waste removal by \n     2018, wastes will remain in tanks for a significantly longer \n     period of time. Additionally, the SRS cannot afford to loose \n     these highly trained and skilled employees.\n       In closing, the Greater Aiken Chamber of Commerce, \n     representing 900 businesses and 40,000 employees within the \n     region believes that it is critical that your amendment be \n     enacted into law. Again, thank you for your continued support \n     of the greater Aiken region.\n           Signature,\n                                                    Charles Weiss,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I have letters from the \nmayor of Jackson, SC, which is down site; the Aiken Electric \nCooperative; the Economic Development Partnership from Aiken; the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission has blessed this project saying that what \nis left in the tank is waste incidental to reprocessing; the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board has looked at this amendment; the North \nAugusta Chamber of Commerce, a community on the other side of the site; \nand the SRS Retiree Association, people who worked their whole lives \nout there supporting this.\n  Mr. President, quickly, we will have more time to talk. This is a big \ndeal to my State. Similar efforts are ongoing in other States, and I \nhope they get there. I am not going to do anything to prejudice their \nability to get there on their terms. I am simply asking that the deal \nstruck between the environmental regulators and our Governor in South \nCarolina be approved so that we can clean up the rest of these tanks, \nthe 49 remaining, in an economically and environmentally sound fashion.\n  That is all this has ever been about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Allard for yielding to \nme at this time.\n  I rise today in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from \nWashington, but I do so by first saying that this is an extremely \ncomplex issue. I happened to be presiding one night when the Senator \nfrom Washington stood up and talked about her amendment. I respect very \nmuch the issues she has delineated. She has done a very good job of \narticulating the complexity of this issue and why it needs to be \nthought through so carefully before we vote, as we are going to do \ntoday.\n  After carefully reviewing the facts, I am convinced the language \nadopted in\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nthe Armed Services Committee related to disposal of nuclear waste at \nthe Savannah River Site is prudent and that this language should not be \nstruck.\n  The Savannah River site is located in Aiken, SC, right on the South \nCarolina-Georgia border. About half the folks who work at the Savannah \nRiver site live in my State. Operations and the treatment of waste at \nthe Savannah River Site affect my State, as well as South Carolina, \nbecause if there is any polluting, if there is any leakage, it will go \ninto the Savannah River which is on the border of South Carolina and \nGeorgia.\n  Current provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in the fiscal year \n2005 funding for the Savannah River Site restrain and preclude planned \nrisk reduction activities in the treatment and disposition of \nradioactive waste. Section 3116 is extremely important to the \nDepartment of Energy's environmental remediation and cleanup efforts at \nthe Savannah River Site. It will resolve both the nuclear waste policy \nand funding issues and allow these risk-reduction activities to \ncontinue.\n  This provision will allow the cleanup of these materials 23 years \nearlier and at an estimated cost savings of $16 billion. Regardless of \nthe cost savings, it is imperative that the cleanup of the Savannah \nRiver Site be completed at the earliest date possible.\n  The Savannah River Site is currently home to 49 tanks containing 35 \nmillion gallons of radioactive material that is divided into three \ntypes of waste: liquid, sludge, and sediment. Section 3116 will allow \nSouth Carolina and the Department of Energy to execute the agreement \nthat has been reached on how best to treat this tank waste.\n  In 1997, the Savannah River Site became the first site in the \nDepartment of Energy complex to close a high-level waste tank. The \nlanguage in the bill was worked out with great care between the State \nof South Carolina, State environmental regulators, Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, and the Department of Energy.\n  I quote from a letter sent to the Secretary of Energy from the \nDefense Nuclear Facility Safety Board in relation to section 3116 of \nthe Defense bill, the section this amendment will strike.\n  The letter states:\n\n       The Board believes that disposal of wastes as contemplated \n     in Section 3116 can be accomplished safely and should enable \n     efficient disposition of the radioactive waste.\n\n  It is true that an Idaho district court struck down the DOE rule \nwhich set procedures for nuclear waste disposal across the board. \nHowever, the court struck down this rule based not on the content of \nthe rule but because they thought the rule exceeded DOE's jurisdiction. \nI agree DOE should not have unilateral ability to determine nuclear \nwaste disposal policy. However, I believe the procedures DOE has \nimplemented at the Savannah River Site are sound and that these \nprocedures should be allowed to continue while the question of who has \nthe authority to set cleanup standards and policies is resolved. In \nfact, the procedures which section 3116 would allow have been in place \nsince the early 1980s.\n\n  I would also like to note, in response to those who believe the low-\nyield sludge should be removed in the tanks at the Savannah River Site \nand other facilities, that the process of removing that sludge would \nincrease the risk to workers by sevenfold and significantly increase \nthe risk to the environment based on the risk of extracting the tanks \nand transporting the additional fuel thousands of miles across country, \nsignificantly increasing the exposure to the population at large.\n  Section 3116 in the underlying bill will prevent substantial delays, \nthe accompanying health and safety risks, and increases in the expense \nof removing and disposing of this material, a delay in expense not \ndriven by public health and safety considerations but, in fact, \ncontrary to public health and safety.\n  Without clarifying the law, the delay would likely create more \nserious health and safety risks to workers and members of the public by \nleaving the waste in tanks longer and risking leaks to ground water. \nDelays in increased costs will require DOE to divert resources from \nother efforts across the complex in a manner that would significantly \ndistort the Department's cleanup and other priorities. There is less \nrisk to the workers, the environment, and the communities by removing \nthe waste from the tanks, extracting the high-level waste from the \nother types of waste for appropriate disposal, and stabilizing any \nsmall amount of low-level waste residues in place in the tanks using a \ncement grout.\n  Physicists, not lawyers, should determine if radioactive waste is \nhigh- or low-level waste. The physical characteristics, not the source, \nof radioactive waste should determine if it is high-level or low-level \nwaste.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment by \nsupporting an expeditious and safe cleanup of the nuclear waste at the \nSavannah River site.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from New \nMexico, the ranking member of the Energy Committee, to give a \nstatement, but before that I want to enter into the record a couple of \ndocuments and make a statement.\n  First, I have great respect for the junior Senator from South \nCarolina and his work on so many issues. He did a great service for \nmany men and women in this country by leading a battle in getting \nhealth care coverage for the National Guard. There is a large \npercentage in our State serving in the National Guard in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and I know my State thanks him on this.\n  On this issue, we certainly disagree. I think it is a change in \nstrategy, or at least a deal that has been cut behind closed doors, \nbecause I do view it as a change to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. That \nis the way my State views it. That is the way 20 newspapers across the \ncountry view it. That is the legal opinion of staff, that it is a \nchange to the definition of what is high-level waste.\n  I point out that South Carolina, up until the Senator's amendment, \nhas been pretty consistent. I have an August 12, 2003, letter sent to \nthe Secretary of Energy from the State of South Carolina, signed by the \nState of South Carolina saying DOE already has the tools it needs to \naddress this issue; that it does not need to use a sledge hammer to get \nthe job done, and goes ahead and says they should use the current \ndefinition of the law.\n  Also in March 2004, a couple of months ago, South Carolina said DOE \ncannot ignore Congress's intent by simply calling high-level waste by a \ndifferent name. And later, South Carolina goes on to say this poses a \nthreat to the citizens' health and natural resources.\n  So I find it very interesting that the State of South Carolina filed \nthose documents in court, sent letters to the Secretary of Energy \nmaking those statements, and now all of a sudden South Carolina has \nchanged its position. I don't know if they were saying they didn't \nbelieve in their case and that is why they wanted to spend the State's \nlegal time and money filing it. I don't know if they have their cabinet \nofficials signing letters to the Secretary of Energy that they don't \nbelieve. But I think actually the issue is the State of South Carolina \nhas been pretty consistent. In fact, the House Members, when this issue \nwas before the House of Representatives, said let's not put any \nlanguage in changing the definition of what is high-level waste. If \nthere needs to be a study, we are willing to study it. That is what the \nmembers of the South Carolina delegation voted on. So I think they have \nbeen pretty consistent.\n\n  While my colleague, the junior Member from South Carolina, is trying \nto move ahead on nuclear waste cleanup, I think we have a disagreement \namong ourselves and with what South Carolina's position has been \nconsistently for several years now, and that is that DOE has the \nauthority. What DOE wants to do is leave waste behind. They don't have \nthe authority to do that, nor does science think that is a prudent way \nto deal with this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that material printed in the Record, \nMr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\n                          Summary of Argument\n\n\n   natural resources defense council, et al. versus spencer abraham, \n                secretary, department of energy, et al.\n\n       In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Congress recognized that \n     spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste generated as a \n     result of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel pose a \n     grave, long-term threat to public health and the environment. \n     As a consequence of this threat, Congress enacted the NWPA to \n     ensure that this waste is permanently isolated in a deep \n     geologic repository. In both the NWPA and the Atomic Energy \n     Act (AEA), Congress defined ``high-level radioactive waste'' \n     to require DOE to consider first, the source of the waste and \n     second, the concentration of fission products in solidified \n     wastes. The definition follows: ``(A) the highly radioactive \n     material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear \n     fuel, including the liquid waste produced directly in \n     reprocessing and any solid material derived from such liquid \n     waste that contains fission products in sufficient \n     concentrations; and (B) other highly radioactive material \n     that the Commission, consistent with existing law, determines \n     by rule requires permanent isolation.'' 42 U.S.C. 10101(12). \n     The AEA incorporates this definition by reference. 42 U.S.C. \n     2014(dd).\n       By using the same definition in the NWPA and AEA, Congress \n     made plain its intent to include spent nuclear fuel \n     reprocessing waste resulting from defense activities within \n     the scope of the HLW disposal scheme that Congress \n     established in the NWPA. Congress clearly intended that the \n     definition of HLW would apply to both commercial and defense \n     waste and that HLW from both sources would be permanently \n     isolated. This intent becomes even clearer when reading this \n     definition in the context of Congress's reasons for enacting \n     the NWPA, to wit, permanently isolating radioactive waste \n     because of the long-term danger it poses to human health and \n     the environment.\n       The evaluation method of DOE Order 435.1, however, \n     establishes a system for reclassifying high-level radioactive \n     waste that provides DOE unlimited discretion to determine \n     whether a large volume of highly radioactive waste stored in \n     or near our states is required to be disposed of in a deep \n     geologic repository. Such unfettered discretion is not \n     provided for in the NWPA or AEA and this Court should affirm \n     the District Court's decision invalidating DOE's attempt, \n     through Order 435.1, to ignore the criteria in these \n     statutes.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  August 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Department of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Abraham: The Department of Energy and states \n     affected by DOE facilities face technical, political, and \n     fiscal challenges as we decide how to treat and dispose of \n     high-level waste created by Cold War-era reprocessing. It \n     will take our combined efforts to devise and implement \n     responsible, effective policies that protect human health and \n     the environment as well as respect taxpayer dollars.\n       We write to express concern with DOE's current strategy for \n     addressing this key issue. DOE's recent proposal to reopen \n     the Nuclear Waste Policy Act runs counter to our mutual \n     interests.\n       Fortunately for our shared high-level waste challenge, \n     reasonable solutions exist within the current law without \n     undermining public trust in DOE's efforts to properly manage \n     nuclear waste. DOE already has the tools it needs to address \n     this issue by making internal policy changes; it doesn't need \n     a sledgehammer to do the job.\n       DOE's recent statements to Congress appear to exaggerate \n     the impacts of the recent judicial decision on high-level \n     waste classification. The federal court decision only \n     confirmed long-standing national policy, which requires \n     disposal of high-level waste in a geologic repository while \n     allowing properly treated, less radioactive wastes to be \n     disposed elsewhere.\n       The court's ruling allows DOE to proceed with retrieval and \n     treatment of liquid waste from tanks at Hanford, Savannah \n     River and INEEL. If the wastes in question are not highly \n     radioactive following treatment, DOE has the ability now to \n     develop a classification strategy to qualify these wastes for \n     management, including disposal, outside a high-level waste \n     repository. What the court rejected was giving DOE free rein \n     to override national policy as expressed in the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act.\n       The States of Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington \n     participated in the lawsuit, not as parties, but as friends \n     of the court to protect our interests in safe, cost-\n     effective, timely cleanup and responsible use of repository \n     capacity. As you may know, last November the states made a \n     concrete proposal to resolve these issues outside of \n     litigation, outlined, the legal and practical risks \n     associated with continuing to litigate this matter, and \n     offered to enter into mediation with the parties. DOE \n     rejected our efforts and choose to litigate instead.\n       Today we renew our offer to work with DOE to develop a \n     waste classification strategy that ensures protective, cost-\n     effective, and timely disposal of the nation's defense high-\n     level radioactive waste in a manner consistent with the \n     court's opinion.\n       We urge you to reconsider your strategy and to work with \n     the states on a reasonable solution within the framework of \n     existing law. By doing so, we can do the job right without \n     jeopardizing progress on repository development, slowing down \n     cleanup or undermining public trust in our efforts.\n     C. Stephen Allred,\n       Director, State of Idaho Department of Environmental \n     Quality.\n     Tom Fitzsimmons,\n       Director, State of Washington Department of Ecology.\n     R. Lewis Shaw,\n       Deputy Commissioner, South Carolina Department of Health \n     and Environmental Control.\n     Michael W. Grainey,\n       Director, State of Oregon Department of Energy.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico who, \nas the ranking member from the Energy Committee, knows of our efforts \nto try to get the Senate Armed Services Committee not to deal with this \nissue since they didn't have jurisdiction over it. He sent a letter to \nthe committee urging them on that and has had a great deal of history \non this issue.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Washington for yielding me \ntime to speak to her amendment to strike section 3116 and follow-on \nsections. Section 3116 is labeled the Defense Site Acceleration \nCompletion. That is the name of the section. That is a fair \ncharacterization of what the provision intends to do. It does propose \nto hasten the day when the Department of Energy can declare its work \ncomplete.\n  In my view, it does not accelerate in any way the cleanup of DOE \ndefense sites. It does accelerate the date that DOE can declare its \nresponsibility completed. In fact, to the contrary, the provision \nallows the Department of Energy to abandon its commitment to clean out \nthese sites and to walk away from them while there are substantial \namounts of high-level radioactive waste still in the ground.\n  Section 3116 is not a model of clarity. I am told the provision no \nlonger applies to DOE sites in Washington State, Idaho, and in New York \nas it once did. It now only applies to high-level radioactive waste \ntanks at Savannah River, S.C. There is not specific language in the \nprovision saying that, but I am certainly willing to accept the intent \nof the provision.\n  The obvious question is, what is in the Savannah River tanks? From \n1953 until the end of the cold war, the Department of Energy at \nSavannah River has made plutonium for our nuclear weapons. It did so by \nirradiating uranium fuel in five nuclear reactors on that site and it \nthen reprocessed the spent fuel to separate the plutonium from the \nhighly radioactive waste products. The waste material consists of a \nmixture of highly toxic, hazardous chemicals used in the chemical \nseparation process--a mixture of that along with a wide variety of \nhighly radioactive fission products and transuranic elements, formed \nduring the nuclear reaction. Some of these fission products emit \nintense amounts of radiation over a short period of time. Others emit \nless intense amounts of radiation over a much longer period of time. \nBoth pose a serious danger to the public health and to the environment.\n  The short-lived radionuclides remain dangerous for hundreds of years. \nThe long-lived ones remain dangerous for thousands of years.\n  The Department of Energy has been storing this mixture in 51 steel \ntanks at Savannah River. The tanks each hold on average about a million \ngallons of waste. In other words, each is about the size of our Capitol \ndome. I repeat, we have 51 of those tanks, each about the size of the \nCapitol dome, located at Savannah River. The waste in the Savannah \nRiver tanks is, by definition, high-level radioactive waste. We have \nbeen using that term in our laws now for over 30 years. Different laws \nhave worded the definition differently, but they have all said \nessentially the same thing, and that is that high-level radioactive \nwaste is the material that results from reprocessing spent fuel, and \nthat includes both the liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing \nand any solid material that settles out of the liquid or is derived \nfrom it.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  There are two important legal consequences that flow from this tank \nwaste being defined as high-level radioactive waste. The first legal \nconsequence is that its disposal is subjected to licensing and \nregulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That is required under \nthe Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which was signed into law by \nPresident Ford.\n\n  The second legal consequence is the waste must be buried in a deep \ngeological repository, rather than being left where it is. This is a \nrequirement we put into law in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 \nwhich was signed into law by President Reagan.\n  The Department of Energy has begun removing the liquid waste from the \ntanks at Savannah River and turning it into glass logs and storing the \nglass logs until they can be buried in a geologic repository which is \nexpected to be built at Yucca Mountain. Removing all of the sludge that \nhas settled to the bottom of these tanks clearly is going to prove \ndifficult and expensive. So to sidestep that requirement, the \nDepartment of Energy would like to reclassify the waste as something \nother than high-level radioactive waste and leave it where it is.\n  Years ago the Department of Energy adopted an administrative order \nasserting that they had the authority to do that. Last fall a Federal \njudge in Idaho held the order was unlawful.\n  The Department is now asking Congress to change the law and to give \nthe Department of Energy the power the court said the Department did \nnot have. Section 3116 would do that, so far as the Savannah River \ntanks are concerned. The language of 3116 is very clear. It says \nnotwithstanding all of the laws that say Savannah River wastes are \nhigh-level radioactive wastes, the Secretary of Energy, in his \ndiscretion or her discretion, can decide they are not high-level \nradioactive wastes.\n  The Secretary's discretion would not be entirely without limits. \nSection 3116 imposes three tests that have to be met for the Secretary \nto exercise this discretion, but on close examination those tests \nimpose very few restrictions on the Secretary. Let me talk a minute \nabout each of these three tests.\n  The first test is that the material ``does not require permanent \nisolation in a deep geologic repository.'' As I said before, the high-\nlevel radioactive waste is made up of both intensely radioactive short-\nlived radionuclides and less intensively radioactive long-lived \nradionuclides. The first step speaks to the second group of less \nintensely radioactive long-lived radionuclides. The need for permanent \nisolation correlates with the length of time the material remains \nradioactive. According to the Department of Energy, over 99 percent of \nthe radioactivity now present in the high-level waste tanks is from \nshort-lived radionuclides. These will remain dangerous for several \nhundred years. But because they will decay to safe levels sometime \nbefore the end of this millennium, they do not, according to the \nDepartment of Energy, require permanent isolation in the deep geologic \nrepository.\n  The first test in section 3116 may look like a serious hurdle, but \naccording to the Department of Energy, 99 percent of the radioactivity \nin the tanks passes that test.\n  The second test is no better. It requires the secretary to determine \nthat ``highly radioactive radionuclides have been removed to the \nmaximum extent possible.'' The second test speaks to the first proof of \nradionuclides, intensely radioactive, short-lived ones which DOE \nbelieve make up 99 percent of the radioactivity in the tanks.\n  The second test is no test at all. It does not require DOE to reduce \nthe highly radioactive short-lived radionuclides to meet a public \nhealth and safety standard based on the maximum safe dose to the public \nor a maximum concentration level. It simply says do what can be done \n``to the maximum extent practicable.''\n  That means, as the court said last summer, ``if DOE determines that \nit is too expensive or too difficult to remove short-lived \nradionuclides from the waste, DOE is free to say the waste is no longer \nhigh-level radioactive waste, even though it will remain dangerous for \ncenturies.''\n  The third test is the most illusory of the three. At first glance it \nappears to subject the disposal of the tank wastes to State regulation. \nIf the third test is meant to do that, it marks a major departure in \nthe law. The courts have consistently held that the Atomic Energy Act \npreempts the States from regulating nuclear waste disposal. The third \ntest confers no authority on the State to regulate nuclear waste \ndisposal. It clearly states that South Carolina's Regulatory Authority \nmust be ``conferred on the State outside this Act.'' So far as I am \naware, there is no Federal law that gives South Carolina or any other \nState the authority to regulate the disposal of high-level radioactive \ndefense waste.\n  The only agency with authority to regulate the disposal of high-level \nradioactive waste is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC has had \nthat authority for 30 years. Section 3116 strips it of that authority, \nlimits its role to one of ``consultation'' and ``review'' of criteria.\n  My conclusion is that section 3116 is a very troubling provision. It \nderegulates the disposal of the Savannah River tank waste in all but \nname. It is essentially the legislative equivalent of the ``Mission \nAccomplished'' banner we saw on the aircraft carrier that allowed the \nDepartment of Energy to declare its work was done and to walk away from \nits obligations.\n  Section 3116 also sets a terrible precedent, in my view. If we agree \nto give DOE this authority at Savannah River in this bill this year, \nwhy not give the same authority with regard to Hanford next year and \nwith regard to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory next year? And with regard to West Valley Demonstration \nPlant the year after that?\n  Enactment of section 3116 may also toll the death knell from the \nCivilian Nuclear Waste Program that we have had in place for many \nyears. That program is already in serious jeopardy. It is years behind \nschedule. It is likely to be grossly underfunded this year. It is beset \nby lawsuits and serious technical challenges. Shipping nuclear waste on \nthe public highways and railways will be extremely unpopular. Section \n3116 sends the message that we do not need a deep geologic repository \nfor Savannah River tank waste, that it is safe to leave those wastes \nwhere they are.\n  The obvious question is, If it is safe to leave high-level waste in \nthe Savannah River tanks, why not leave those same kinds of wastes at \nHanford and at the Idaho laboratory? If it is safe to leave defense \nwastes where they are, why not leave commercial powerplant wastes where \nthey are, as well?\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator \nCantwell's amendment and to strike section 3116 from the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I reiterate for the record this was a collaborative approach between \nthe State of South Carolina and the Department of Energy. They sat down \nfor hours and they looked at wherever jurisdiction was and said: We \nhave a common goal. We would like to remove this waste as soon as \npossible. So they have worked out an agreement.\n  That is what this amendment is all about that Senator Graham is \ntalking about. It is good science. We have a lot of support out there. \nIn fact, in an Environment and Public Works hearing in the year 2000, \nmy colleague from South Carolina mentioned that particular hearing \nwhere they talked about the disposal of nuclear waste. The Natural \nResources Defense Council actually said the regulation of radioactive \nwaste should be based on its hazardous characteristics and not when it \nwas generated.\n  That is what has been proposed by the Department of Energy. The \nNuclear Regulatory Commission had this to say about what the Department \nof Energy is trying to do with the work:\n\n       In all cases, the NRC staff found that DOE's proposed \n     methodology and conclusions met the appropriate WIR criteria \n     and therefore met the performance objectives and dose limits \n     that would apply to near-surface low-level waste disposal and \n     would protect public health and safety.\n\n  This was out of the letter sent May 18, 2004, to the Chair of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, James Inhofe.\n  I have another letter from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety \nBoard.\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nWhen it comes to safety, they are strong advocates for safety. One \nsentence illustrates what this letter is all about, dated May 14, 2004:\n\n       The Board believes that disposal of waste as contemplated \n     in Section 3116 can be accomplished safely and should enable \n     efficient disposition of the radioactive waste.\n\n  This is the agreement, again, worked out between South Carolina and \nthe Department of Energy.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 61 minutes for the Senator from \nWashington and 86 minutes 41 seconds for Senator Allard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am strongly in support of the \nCantwell-Hollings amendment. To me, this debate is about process, \npolicy, and precedent. In my view, the provision in the underlying bill \nthat the Cantwell amendment replaces fails all three tests.\n  As my colleagues have explained, the reason we are in the Senate \ndebating this issue is that the Armed Services Committee added language \nto the Department of Defense authorization bill, giving the Department \nof Energy broad new authority to reclassify nuclear waste so it can be \nleft in place rather than disposed of according to the best technical \nknow-how.\n  Along with the Presiding Officer, I am privileged to serve on the \nArmed Services Committee. I consider it a great honor and \nresponsibility. However, I simply do not think we should be including a \nshift in nuclear waste cleanup policy in the DOD bill. Any major change \nto the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which is what the underlying language \nrepresents, should be considered by the committees of jurisdiction, the \nEnergy Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee. Any \nmajor change in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act should be considered in \nopen hearings where a range of views can be expressed.\n  Instead, a major change was made to this essential policy of our \nNation in a closed markup of the Armed Services Committee. The \ncommittees of jurisdiction were not consulted about the language in the \nbill. We have had no hearings about this language yet here we are on \nthe Senate floor debating it. Even some of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle who are supporting it have cloaked their support in \nlukewarm language because it is not all clear what the full \nimplications of these changes would be.\n  A few years ago, the Department of Energy decided to change the \ndefinition of high-level waste by its own fiat, notwithstanding years \nof precedent and statutory language to the contrary.\n  Now, I do not have enough technical knowledge--I do not even dream of \nunderstanding all that would go into making a decision about how to \ndefine high-level nuclear waste--but people were concerned about that \ndecision by the Department of Energy, and so they sued over the change.\n  When the Department of Energy lost in court, a suit on which my State \nof New York filed an amicus brief, in support of overturning the \nDepartment of Energy change, then, obviously, the Department of Energy \nchose a different route.\n  They first tried it on the Energy bill. But because of other \nconflicts over the Energy bill, they were not successful. So then they \ncame back with the Department of Defense bill. Unfortunately, this was \na closed process, and many people who would otherwise have an opinion \nwere not able to participate.\n  I think this is not in the best interests of making policy on such an \nimportant issue. It may very well be that an open policy process--with \nhearings with the committees of jurisdiction being involved--would lead \nto the State of South Carolina having different options than other \nStates. I could understand that. But that is not how this has come \nbefore us.\n  Certainly, on behalf of the State of New York, they are very much \nopposed to the underlying language in the DOD authorization. I want to \nexpress the State's opposition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from Gov. George Pataki, dated May 6, 2004, addressed to \nSenator Levin, as well as an editorial from the Buffalo News dated May \n10, 2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            State of New York,\n\n                                          Albany, NY, May 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I urge you to oppose language proposed \n     by the Department of Energy (DOE) in the FY05 Department of \n     Defense Authorization Act that could allow DOE to reclassify \n     high level radioactive waste contained in underground tanks \n     at several DOE sites across the country, including the former \n     spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facility at West Valley, New \n     York. In July 2003, a federal district court ruled that DOE's \n     order permitting such reclassification violates the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act. DOE has appealed that decision to the \n     United States Circuit Court of Appeals, and the appeal \n     remains pending. New York and the States of Washington, \n     Oregon, Nevada, and South Carolina filed an amicus brief in \n     that case opposing DOE's position that it has the authority \n     to reclassify high level radioactive waste in order to shirk \n     its responsibility to safely remove it.\n       The reclassification of high level radioactive waste would \n     allow DOE to leave the high level waste in the ground where \n     the tanks are located, instead of shipping the high level \n     waste to a federal repository, as required under the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act. This reclassification would be particularly \n     egregious at West Valley, where DOE is proposing to close \n     underground storage tanks containing thousands of gallons of \n     radioactive material, and then leave it to New York State to \n     monitor and maintain the closed tanks to protect the \n     groundwater for thousands of years.\n       While I am in favor of expediting the cleanup of \n     radioactive waste, speed should not come at the expense of \n     completing cleanups essential to protecting public health and \n     safety. It is my understanding that there is sufficient work \n     for DOE to do at all of the sites in question, including West \n     Valley, while DOE works with the states, tribes, and public \n     health and environmental advocates to develop final cleanup \n     solutions that are acceptable to all parties.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 George E. Pataki,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, May 10, 2004]\n\n Dangerous Games--Federal Effort To Bury Nuclear Wastes at West Valley \n                           Is Unconscionable\n\n       The federal Department of Energy is trying to use \n     administrative sleight of hand to avoid its responsibility in \n     the cleanup of nuclear waste at West Valley and several other \n     states.\n       This contemptible effort involves downgrading the threat of \n     nuclear waste, thereby allowing the government to bury that \n     dangerous material at West Valley and other sites instead of \n     shipping it to a permanent repository as called for in a 1982 \n     law.\n       Fortunately, New York Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Hillard \n     Rodham Clinton recognized this downgrading for what it was, a \n     threat to West Valley and surrounding areas from the \n     possibility of future leakage of this radioactive material. \n     After they protested the legislation, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a \n     Republican from South Carolina who introduced the bill that \n     would have allowed the DOE to downgrade the threat of nuclear \n     wastes, altered his bill. It now will apply only to the waste \n     remediation project at Savannah River, S.C.\n       But that doesn't remove the danger. The House, essentially \n     led by Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, still has to \n     consider the DOE legislation. That cannot be a comforting \n     thought to residents living near West Valley.\n       The department argues that the wastes should be classified \n     as ``high-level'' based only on how they originated, not what \n     they are. But what they are is still bad, still radioactive \n     and still a federal responsibility.\n       Decades of expensive cleanup progress have improved safety \n     at West Valley, but the work is far from over. The \n     radioactive liquid wastes from a nuclear fuels reprocessing \n     effort have been solidified into safer glass logs, which were \n     supposed to be stored elsewhere. But the anticipated long-\n     term storage facility at Yucca Flats is years from \n     completion. Tanks and residual wastes still remain at West \n     Valley, and an underground plume of water is contaminated \n     with radioactive strontium. Covering wastes with concrete \n     won't help that.\n       The 600,000 gallons of West Valley wastes have their \n     counterpart in nuclear weapons production wastes at other \n     sites--53 million gallons at Hanford on the Washington-Oregon \n     border, 34 million gallons at Savannah River near Aiken, \n     S.C., and 900,000 gallons at the Idaho National Engineering \n     and Environmental Laboratory.\n       West Valley is the only site where the state shares the \n     cost of cleanup.\n       Those costs may run into the tens of billions of dollars \n     over decades, but the mess remains a federal issue. At West \n     Valley, the risk includes not only the site's land but water \n     drainage that flows into Buttermilk\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n     Creek, Cattaraugus Creek and Lake Erie. Trace amounts of that \n     radioactivity have been tracked as far as Buffalo.\n       The DOE also is threatening to withhold $350 million in \n     cleanup money from military-related cleanup efforts unless it \n     gets a change in the definition of what constitutes high-\n     level waste. That bit of weaseling does the department no \n     credit. These sites were created by the federal government, \n     and the federal government should not be allowed to walk away \n     from them.\n       Acceptable cleanup at West Valley involves removal of all \n     wastes and dismantling and removal of the contaminated \n     structures that were used to process and store them. The \n     government cannot be allowed to escape that responsibility \n     through administrative trickery.\n       If the federal government truly could end a problem by \n     renaming it, we'd already be at ``mission accomplished'' in \n     Iraq.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am concerned how this is being portrayed, and I am \nsure it is meant to be a fix for a specific situation in South \nCarolina, but it is setting a precedent. That is what we do around \nhere. We set precedents. It is hard to imagine that the Department of \nEnergy would be satisfied only taking their new definition to one \nState. It would be South Carolina first, but then what would be next?\n  In particular, I am concerned about western New York where we have a \nsite known as West Valley. Through the West Valley Act, the Federal \nGovernment and the State of New York agreed, decades ago, to partner to \nreprocess commercial nuclear waste. In many respects, this project has \nbeen a success, but in the last several years the site has been the \nsubject of a bitter debate between the Federal Government and the State \nof New York. Why would that be? Because, in New York's view, the \nDepartment of Energy is not fulfilling its responsibilities for the \ncleanup obligations it assumed under the West Valley Act.\n  I bring this up because it is directly relevant, even though it is \nnot the same act. The West Valley site has the same type of waste that \nthe Department of Energy would be able to reclassify at Savannah River \nunder section 3116 of the Department of Defense bill. That is no \ncoincidence.\n  Rather, the language that the Department of Energy originally sought \nto include in both the Energy bill last year and the DOD bill this year \nwould have provided the DOE with general authority to reclassify high-\nlevel wastes at Hanford, Savannah River, the Idaho labs, and West \nValley.\n  Now, obviously, West Valley does not have the mind-boggling \nquantities that are present at other sites, but we are still talking \nabout 600,000 gallons of waste. That is a significant amount. It is not \na problem that New York State or the local governments in the area will \nbe able to handle if the Department of Energy decides it can wash its \nhands literally of its responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. So when the Department of Defense markup approached, \nNew York Governor George Pataki wrote to Chairman Warner and Ranking \nMember Levin urging them not to include DOE's language in the bill.\n  While the provision was changed before the markup, and it is now \nintended only to affect the Savannah River site, DOE's original \nlanguage would have affected West Valley and the other sites I have \nmentioned. We know that is exactly what DOE is aiming for. That is \ntheir goal and their objective, to try to reclassify nuclear waste.\n  So New York State remains opposed to section 3116 of the bill. On \nbehalf of the Governor and my State, I am supporting the Cantwell \namendment, because I think we need a different process to get to the \npoint of determining what our nuclear waste classification system \nshould be.\n  It is certainly a very difficult issue. I respect the Presiding \nOfficer's concern about the cost. I share that concern. These are \nincredibly expensive undertakings that go on for decades. But, in \neffect, we are cleaning up the mess we made. We made it for military \npurposes. We made it for commercial purposes. We owe it to ourselves \nand future generations to do it as well as it can be done. I, for one, \nhope we can take this issue off the floor of the Senate by passing the \nCantwell amendment. Then let's have the hearings in the Energy \nCommittee and the EPW Committee. If there is a role for the Armed \nServices Committee, let's do it there, also, because, for me, this is \nsetting a precedent that is very troubling, to have a matter this \nimportant decided in such a quick consideration in a closed markup of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I hope we will support the Cantwell \namendment, and then put our heads together to determine if there are \ndifferences between Savannah River, Hanford, and West Valley that merit \ndifferent classifications. If there are new advances in dealing with \nhow we would grout over the high-level nuclear waste--we know that has \nnot worked in the past; maybe it can work now--then we can proceed in a \nmore sensible manner that protects the health and safety of our people \nand preserves the environment in the areas where this waste is stored \nand dispose of it appropriately.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for being such a leader on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \ncoming to the floor and speaking on this issue, and for her leadership \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Before my colleague from Washington and I got a whiff of this plan, \nbecause the Senate Armed Services Committee met behind closed doors on \nthis issue and the language was considered behind closed doors--I \nappreciate the fact that the Senator from New York was there fighting, \nat the very beginning, this language being put into the DOD bill. I \nappreciate her comments about the fact that basically we are taking a \nbill that is about defense authorization and now changing waste policy, \nand weighing down the process.\n  Why would we want to weigh down the process of moving something that \nis about supporting our troops and supporting our efforts with a change \nin nuclear waste policy? The House dealt with this responsibly. They \nsaid: If you want to look at this policy, let's study it and get \ninformation. So that is what the House has done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Washington 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cantwell \namendment. I thank my colleague from Washington State for her tireless \neffort on this issue and her commitment to assuring the Federal \nGovernment meets its responsibility to the people of our State by fully \ncleaning up the Hanford site.\n  Today, on the Senate floor, there is an unprecedented attack on my \nState's ability to ensure that we clean up the nuclear waste that \nthreatens the families I represent. I am here to fight it. I am here to \nsend a clear message to the administration: You should be back at the \ntable working with all the States and all of Congress instead of trying \nto get the Senate to bail you out of a court case that you lost.\n  The handwriting is on the wall. The White House wants Washington \nfamilies to accept a lower cleanup standard. They are holding our \nfunding hostage. They are fighting us in court. They are pushing \nmisguided legislation right here on the Senate floor.\n  If the White House wins this attempt to leave more nuclear waste \nuntreated, then Washington State families will lose. That is why I am \non the Senate floor with my colleague from the State, Senator Cantwell, \nfighting the bill's nuclear waste provisions and standing up for my \nState.\n  I know my colleague from Washington agrees that the fastest, most \neffective way to clean up America's contaminated nuclear sites is for \nthe DOE to work as a partner with the States. But sadly, we are here \ntoday seeing a new attempt by the White House to overreach its \nauthority, to circumvent a court case it lost and blackmail my State \ninto accepting a lower cleanup standard. That threatens the families I \nrepresent, and I am not going to stand for it.\n  What is at stake is the cleanup of the Hanford nuclear reservation in \nthe tri-cities in Washington where we developed the plutonium that \nhelped our country win World War II and the cold war. My grandfather \nsettled in the tri-cities in 1916. My dad grew up there. My dad saw how \nmuch those communities sacrificed to help our Nation\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nhave a strong military. Our country has an obligation to make those \ncommunities whole, not leave them with high nuclear waste that has \nleaked from underground tanks.\n  Any time someone has threatened our cleanup efforts, I have taken \nthem on, and it doesn't matter if they are Democrats or Republicans. In \nthe 1990s, when the Clinton administration proposed inadequate budgets \nfor the Hanford cleanup, I took them on, and I used my position in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor to get my State the funding we \nneeded. Every time the Bush administration has tried to cut Hanford \nfunding, it had a fight on its hands from this Senator. It is one of \nthe reasons I joined with my colleagues in 2001 to create the Senate \nNuclear Cleanup Caucus so that all communities across the country that \nare dealing with nuclear waste will have a strong bipartisan voice in \nthe Senate.\n  Time and again I have taken on this White House when it tried to hurt \nthe families I represent, and I have the scars to prove it. In fiscal \nyear 2002, the Bush administration tried to cut Hanford funding by $57 \nmillion. I worked in committee and on the floor to deliver $145 million \nmore for Hanford than the President's budget. Then in fiscal year 2003, \nthe Bush administration tried to cut Hanford funding by $300 million. \nThey also tried to hold our cleanup dollars hostage unless we would \njump through the hoops they set out for us. With my support, the Senate \nrejected the White House's misguided attempts. And through my work on \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, instead of a $300 \nmillion cut, we added $433 million to the President's budget for \nHanford.\n  Time and again I have used my position on the Budget Committee and \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee to protect my State, \nand I have gone toe to toe with this administration over nuclear \ncleanup. In February of 2002, I sharply questioned the President's \nbudget director on their plans to shortchange Hanford. In April of \n2002, I chaired a hearing of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee to review the Bush administration's work at Hanford and \nother sites. So don't think for a minute that we in Washington State \nare going to accept these attacks on our ability to get a fast and \nthorough cleanup of the nuclear waste that is at Hanford.\n  For more than a year, the Department of Energy has been trying to \nchange the ground rules so it can leave more waste untreated, declare \nvictory, and walk away from our Nation's most contaminated nuclear \nsites. They tried to do it in the courts, and they lost. Today they are \ntrying to do it on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  As my colleagues know, I have been raising warning flags about this \neffort by the administration for many months. I warned about it in \nAugust of last year. In September, upon passage of the energy and water \nbill, I once again raised concerns about this matter. But this attempt \nis part of a much longer and disturbing effort.\n  I want to take a few minutes to review the history because it shows \nan administration that is venturing far outside the standard practice \nin ways that threaten my State and many others.\n  Let me first offer some background on the Department of Defense bill \nthat is before the Senate. The underlying bill contains two provisions \ndealing with high-level nuclear waste and the Department of Energy's \nauthority for cleaning up nuclear waste sites in our country. One \nprovision seeks to withhold funding from States that don't agree to \ngive up their regulatory oversight of certain high-level waste. The \nsecond provision deals directly with the cleanup of the Savannah River \nsite in South Carolina. But in reality, it has serious implications for \nevery nuclear waste site in the country.\n  The Department of Energy is making a great deal of noise about a \ncourt case it lost. The DOE is claiming it cannot proceed with cleanup \nsites in Idaho, South Carolina, and Washington State until legislation \nis passed that essentially overturns that court's decision.\n  I believe it is important to look at how we came to this position \ntoday, because it clearly illustrates how DOE has refused good-faith \noffers to resolve this issue between the original litigants, six \nStates, and the Department. So let me give you all a short history of \nhow the issue developed.\n  In 1999, the Department of Energy issued regulations giving itself \nbroad authority to reclassify nuclear waste. Essentially, the \nDepartment wanted to make unilateral decisions about what it needed to \ntreat and remove from leaking underground storage tanks and what waste \nit could leave in the ground forever. This would be a dramatic \ndeparture from our current system where DOE must work with State and \nFederal regulators on such matters.\n  To prevent that type of game playing, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil brought a lawsuit against the Department of Energy in Idaho \ndistrict court. Before that case went to trial, the NRDC and the States \noffered to settle the issue. Unfortunately, the Department of Energy \ndid not appear to take that effort seriously, and they rejected that \ncooperative approach. This is an important point. When the NRDC and the \nStates offered to work out these issues outside of the court system, \nDOE rejected their offer. So the case went forward and DOE lost. They \nlost in July of 2003.\n  One would expect at this point that DOE would go back to the \nplaintiff and the States to settle the issues. But that is not what \nhappened. Instead, the Department appealed to the ninth circuit and \nimmediately came running here to Congress asking for legislation to do \nwhat the Idaho court had rejected.\n  Shortly after that decision, the Idaho district court sent out an \norder asking parties to consider mediation. The NRDC and the States \nquickly agreed to the court's request. Amazingly, DOE rejected the \ncourt's request. I believe this is an absolutely critical point because \nit demonstrates the Department has never approached this issue with a \nmindset open to considering the States' concerns or those of the \nwinning plaintiff. This is the second time DOE rejected offers by other \ninterested parties to cooperatively address this issue. This was a \ntremendous opportunity to try and reach broad consensus, and DOE passed \nit up. The court's mediation offer would have had a neutral court-\nappointed mediator and a very good forum for resolving differences. In \nfact, this could still happen, and it should.\n  My point in walking through the history of the issue is to highlight \nthe fact that the Department of Energy has had many opportunities to \nresolve this issue with the States and with the original litigants. It \nrejected State offers to resolve issues before litigation went forward. \nAnd more amazingly, it rejected the Idaho district court's request for \nparties to use mediation after it lost the case. The States and \nlitigants accepted the court's offer. DOE rejected it, and that is \ninexcusable. Bluntly, to me, it appears that DOE has allowed this issue \nto be taken over by its legal people.\n  Recently environmental management Assistant Secretary Jesse Roberson \ntestified to us that DOE and Washington State have agreed upon a plan \nfor cleaning up the tanks, and that is largely correct. My State is \nvery eager to work through this and for this work to proceed. The fact \nis DOE seems to be the only one that feels new legislation is needed. \nIt is not. The original litigants and States want to proceed with \ncleanup and don't believe the Idaho district court ruling presents any \nobstacles.\n  Unfortunately, this tactic of fighting the states and trying to do an \n``end run'' around the other partners in the cleanup is not new for \nthis administration. The truth is that the fastest, most effective way \nto clean up these sites is for the DOE to work in partnership with the \nstates and Federal regulators. Time and time again, however, this \nadministration has tried to go it alone to the detriment of the \nresidents who live near these contaminated sites.\n  The Department of Energy needs to get back to working in partnership \nwith the states and federal regulators. A unilateral approach will \nsimply cost more money and will only create further delays.\n  Governor Kempthorn of Idaho and Governor Locke of Washington are both \nopposed to the legislative language currently in the underlying bill. \nIn fact, I have a letter last month from Governor Locke of Washington \nstate outlining his concerns.\n  For years, Senators and Congressmen with these waste sites located in \ntheir states and districts have had to fight\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\ntooth and nail to get adequate funding to ensure cleanup of these \nsites. Further, as a group we have had to fight back simplistic notions \nof erecting fences and calling the sites clean and safe. This constant \nstruggle on behalf of our States and districts brought together bi-\npartisan groups of Members in both the House and Senate to fight on \nthese issues.\n  The House and Senate Nuclear Waste Cleanup caucuses have made a \ntremendous difference in how the administration and our fellow \ncongressional members view the cleanup program. I believe the strength \nof these caucuses have been our unity and commitment to protect our \nstate and citizens interests in cleanup. We have worked together to \nmake sure the federal government lives up to its responsibility to \nclean up these sites. But the language in this bill is a license for \nthe federal government to walk away from those very responsibilities. \nLeaving more waste permanently in the ground is not a real cleanup.\n  What should be of equal concern to every member of this body is the \nattempt to make such a dramatic legislative end run around the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act without any hearing. This is a real, substantive \nweakening of a carefully crafted law.\n  Yet, we are weakening it without any broad consensus in this body, \nany hearing before a Senate committee, or any mark-up before the \ncommittee of jurisdiction--the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I propose to my colleagues that we--remove the offensive language in \nthe underlying bill, allow cleanup to proceed at all three sites, and \nthen set about carefully considering any new legislation.\n  We need more time to address this issue in a more thoughtful manner. \nThere is plenty of time for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nto hold a hearing on this issue and move consensus legislation if \nnecessary. We should not give in to DOE's efforts to leverage out of \nCongress bad policy that gives away the legal protections our states \nand citizens have currently.\n  The blatant attempt by DOE to withhold funding and stop work should \nnot be accepted by this Congress. Six States have filed an amicus brief \nopposing DOE's efforts. The Governors of Idaho and Washington object to \nDOE's efforts. The House has not accepted DOE's language.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our States and citizens, uphold the \nFederal Government's responsibility to full and real cleanup, and not \nreward DOE's unilateral approach to cleanup. This isn't just about \ncourt orders and bureaucratic agreements. This is an obligation that we \nhave to communities in my state that produced the plutonium that helped \nour country win World War II and the cold war.\n  And there is no way that I am going to let the Bush administration or \nthe Department of Energy or Senators from other States do things that \nthreaten the families I represent.\n  I have got a message for anyone who tries to threaten my State and \nforce us to accept a lower standard for cleanup. Don't you dare try to \ntie our hands as we work to protect our communities. The only way we \nare going to clean it up--quickly and thoroughly is through a real \npartnership with all of the players. I urge the Department of Energy to \nget back to its job of cleaning up the waste, rather than wasting \nvaluable time seeking help from Congress over a court case that it \nlost.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the administration's approach and \nsupport this amendment. Don't tie the hands of communities who are \nworking hard to clean up nuclear waste. Don't reward the Department of \nEnergy's heavy-handed tactics. Don't leave the families I represent \nwith untreated waste that threatens their health and safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to weigh in on this issue and try to \nbring clarity to what it comes down to. As has been said by virtually \nevery speaker today, this issue was caused as a result of the outcome \nof a lawsuit in Idaho with regard to the authority and jurisdiction and \nprerogatives of the Department of Energy in managing high-level waste \nas a result of reprocessing.\n  When the court case came down the way it did, it threw into question \nthe manner in which the Department of Energy would proceed with its \ncleanup operations in three States--Washington, Idaho, and South \nCarolina. There are people on all sides of that issue. Some say it is \nclear what they have to do. There are those who say it is unclear. \nThere are those who say we can find clarity if we take some time to \nwork it through between the States and the DOE.\n  The bottom line is there was an issue. As a result of this issue, the \nquestion of funding availability for the ongoing cleanup became \nparamount. It was the DOE's position, as taken by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, that if we didn't have a clear path forward on \nthese cleanups, approximately $350 million that would have been \navailable and was authorized and appropriated for cleanup in these \nthree States would not be available in the next year. So the first \nurgent hurdle that came up was we had to make clear that the cleanup \nhad to go on while we are trying to resolve these issues.\n  The second issue that came up is, how do we resolve them? In that \ncontext, the Senator from South Carolina is exactly correct. Each of \nthe three involved States--Idaho, my State; his State, South Carolina; \nand the State of Washington--got involved in negotiating with the \nDepartment of Energy. In fact, in the beginning, there was some concern \nfrom the States, as to whether they were going to be allowed to be \nengaged in these negotiations, and Senator Craig and I, from Idaho, and \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Senator Graham, made it clear we would \ntake no steps that our States did not authorize and approve. We \nactually provided the incentive for these negotiations to take place.\n  As we began moving forward, a dynamic developed where it became \nevident that the State of South Carolina, because of differences in the \nState of South Carolina's issues, was going to make it through to and \nreach an agreement with the Department of Energy. This agreement, as \nhas already been indicated, is one supported by the Governor of South \nCarolina, the attorney general, the applicable environmental regulator, \nand many others in the State whose input the Senator from South \nCarolina has brought forth as part of the record.\n  The States of Washington and Idaho, however, were not able to reach \nan agreement. Then we came forward and this bill came to the floor, and \nwe have now found ourselves here with the State of South Carolina \nhaving an agreement, and the States of Idaho and Washington not having \nan agreement, and the question as to the money.\n  A very important issue that seems to have immediately passed in the \ndebate today is what happened in the beginning of the debate. Today, my \namendment and the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, joined \nin by Senator Craig, were passed with a voice vote. Those amendments \ndid a very critical and important thing. They made it clear the \nauthorized cleanup dollars, the $350 million, were going to largely be \nable to be made available for continuing operations while we continue \nto try to work out these negotiations. I think that is a big part of \nthe story today that needs to be made clear, because a big success for \nthe country has been achieved already through those amendments.\n  Secondly, we are now dealing with the question of the South Carolina \nlanguage. When you boil down the debate today, it comes down to a \nquestion we have been focusing on in Idaho. And that is, does the South \nCarolina language create a precedent or some kind of a pressure which \nwould cause us to have to deal with this issue in the State of Idaho or \nthe State of Washington any differently?\n\n  The answer to that is simply no. In fact, I think if there is any \nprecedent in what is happening in this dynamic today, it is the \nopposite, because the State of Idaho, Senator Craig, and I made it very \nclear to the committee, to the Department of Energy, and to everyone--\nand Senator Graham of South Carolina joined us in making it clear--\nthere would be no language in this bill relating to the State of Idaho \nunless and until the State of Idaho agreed to such language and Idaho's \nSenators brought that language forward. That is why we have very clear \nlanguage in the bill that says the language that deals\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nwith South Carolina deals with South Carolina only.\n  Having said that, there still has been a debate promulgated around \nthe country, and it is raging in Idaho with regard to this very issue. \nIs there any precedential value in the South Carolina language that \nwould cause a threat to any other State, particularly Idaho or \nWashington?\n  Senator Craig and I strongly believe the answer to that is no, but \nthere is a question about it. Idaho's Governor, Governor Kempthorne, \nhas been quoted on this floor as raising the question. So Senator Craig \nand I, working with the Senator from South Carolina and other Senators, \ndecided we would make it ironclad clear, if it was not so clear \nalready.\n  This morning, before this whole debate began, I asked unanimous \nconsent to bring a further amendment that would have made it crystal \nclear, if it is not already crystal clear, that there is no \nprecedential value here. Let me say before I go through what this \namendment is, we believe it was crystal clear already in the statutory \nlanguage, and Senator Graham, Senator Craig, and I and others have made \nit clear in the record developed in the debate on this bill that there \nis no precedential impact of this language because each State is \ndealing with its own circumstances and working out its own solutions \nwith the Department of Energy.\n  Having said that, here is the language, frankly, we were not given \nunanimous consent to put into the bill this morning. The language would \nhave said:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall alter or jeopardize the full \n     implementation of the settlement agreement entered into by \n     the United States with the State of Idaho. . . .\n\n  And then there is a description of that agreement.\n\n       Or the Hanford Federal facility agreement and consent \n     order, or the Federal facility agreement with the State of \n     Idaho.\n       Furthermore, nothing in this section establishes any \n     precedent or is binding on the States of Idaho, Washington, \n     or any other State for the management, storage, treatment, \n     and disposition of radioactive and hazardous materials.\n\n  We were stopped this morning from getting unanimous consent--I still \ndo not understand why--we were stopped this morning from getting \nunanimous consent to put this amendment into the amendment we adopted \nearlier dealing with the funding stream. That is not going to stop us \nfrom moving this language in an amendment and putting it on the bill to \nmake it very clear to anybody who still has any doubt that there is no \nintention here of creating any kind of precedent or pressure with \nregard to any other State.\n\n  I want to make it very clear we have now provided this language to \nthe desk in the form of an amendment. That amendment will immediately \nfollow the action on this vote with regard to the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington. Presuming that we still have an opportunity \nbecause of the vote, we will proceed with this amendment to make it \nvery clear to anybody who has any lingering doubts that this Congress \nhas no intention and this statutory language is not intended to create \nany precedential pressure or value, whether it be in court or in \nlegislative negotiations, with regard to how Idaho, Washington, or, \nfrankly, any other State will negotiate with the Department of Energy.\n  It should be absolutely ironclad clear already, but Senator Craig and \nI worked with our Governor, and he is supportive of this effort to \nresolve this issue, and we are going to make it very clear to the \nNation that this debate over whether there is some precedential value \nhere is simply a debate that is contrived to object to allowing South \nCarolina to reach its own solution.\n  It seems to me as we approach this issue, we must recognize that \nnothing will happen with regard to the management of radioactive \nmaterial in the States of Idaho or Washington or, frankly, South \nCarolina, for that matter, unless and until those States agree. That is \nwhy Senator Craig and I have been on this floor advocating States \nrights and why we will continue to do so.\n  Senator Craig and I have made a very strong, a very clear position to \nthe administration and to this Congress, which is that our Idaho \nagreement--which, by the way, was entered into in 1995 and ratified by \nthis Congress--will not be weakened or altered or modified, and that no \nagreement will be reached on these management issues regarding \nradioactive materials and hazardous waste unless and until the State of \nIdaho agrees to that solution. Those two principles are hard rock, base \npositions Senator Craig and I have made very clear.\n  Like I say, if there is any question about what the precedent of \nthese proceedings means, the precedent is that Senator Craig and I will \nnot allow--we will not allow--this Congress to move forward with these \nkinds of issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator for this time. I encourage us to \nsupport the efforts to make certain these things will move forward and \nparticularly when we bring this amendment that we were not allowed to \nbring this morning, we encourage the entire Senate to support it to \nhelp make this issue crystal clear to anyone who has lingering doubts.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur in relation to the Cantwell amendment at 2:10 p.m. today, with \nthe remaining time until then divided so Senator Cantwell controls her \nremaining time and the remaining time under the control of Senator \nAllard or his designee.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, if I can ask the Chair, how \nmuch time does the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 33 minutes, \nand the Senator from Colorado has 75\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished manager of the bill, you are \nprobably going to have about 10 minutes on your side.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We have one speaker remaining.\n  Mr. REID. No objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield me 10 minutes?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the Senator from Michigan 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Department of Energy has over 100 \nmillion gallons of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 \nunderground storage tanks, many of which are leaking. The Department of \nEnergy and its predecessors have been generating and storing this high-\nlevel radioactive waste for 50 years.\n  The high-level radioactive waste is stored basically at three sites--\nIdaho, South Carolina, and Washington. It was generated by years of \nreprocessing nuclear reactor fuels to recover plutonium and highly \nenriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons and other defense purposes.\n  The DOE has a small amount of highly radioactive waste stored in two \ntanks in New York that was generated as a result of a failed effort to \nprocess spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors.\n  At the time the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was debated, the Department \nof Energy wanted the ability to reclassify high-level radioactive \nwaste, including sludge, to low-level or waste incidental to \nreprocessing, for example. Congress denied this authority to the \nDepartment of Energy when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was adopted.\n  The high-level radioactive waste that is stored in the Department of \nEnergy tanks is highly radioactive. According to the State of South \nCarolina Department of Health and Environmental Quality, the 37 million \ngallons of high-level radioactive waste at the Savannah River site \ncontain 426 million curies of radioactivity.\n  The Department of Energy was required under its obligation to clean \nup the nuclear weapons complex to pump the liquid waste out of those \ntanks. The layer of sludge, semihard material that was generated over \nthe years as solids in the waste that sank to the bottom of the tanks, \nwas included. It is to be left if the DOE has its way. They would like \nto leave that sludge in the tanks forever. They want to cover the \nsolids with grout and declare the tanks are cleaned up. But by law, by \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act, that sludge is high-level radioactive \nwaste and, as such, must be disposed of as high-level radioactive \nwaste.\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n  This sludge accounts for only 8 percent of the volume of material in \nthe tanks, but it accounts for over half of the radioactivity. So under \nthe DOE plan, over half of the radioactivity in the tanks at Savannah \nRiver would remain in the ground, covered by grout, presumably forever.\n\n  Again, this sludge is high-level radioactive waste as defined in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act. So for the Department of Energy to succeed in \nleaving the sludge at the bottom of the tanks, the waste has to somehow \nor another be redefined. So they issued an order to DOE under which it \ngave itself the authority to reclassify high-level radioactive waste. \nThat way it could leave the sludge in the tanks.\n  Under that order, the Department of Energy would have reclassified \nthe high-level radioactive waste in the tank--the sludge--either as \nlow-level radioactive waste or as waste incidental to reprocessing \nactivities. By issuing that order, the Department of Energy sought to \ngive itself what Congress had previously denied it, which was the \nauthority to reclassify high-level radioactive waste.\n  So the lawsuit began with the Natural Resources Defense Council suing \nthe Department of Energy in Federal district court in Idaho, claiming \nthat the Department of Energy did not have the authority to reclassify \nhigh-level radioactive waste and that the sludge, as high-level \nradioactive waste, had to be disposed of in an NRC licensed geologic \ndepository. The States of South Carolina, New York, Washington, and \nIdaho, the States where the waste is stored, and other States, filed \nfriend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil. The Federal district court in Idaho ruled in favor of the \nStates and against the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy \nhas appealed that decision.\n  The Department of Energy, in an effort to force States to accept the \nnotion that it should be allowed to reclassify waste, has determined in \nits budget request to hold hostage the funds that were to be used to \npump the liquid waste from the tanks until the States resolved the \nlawsuit in the DOE's favor or that there would be legislation giving \nthe DOE the authority to reclassify the high-level radioactive waste.\n  Senator Cantwell's amendment would strike the section in the bill \nthat would allow the Department of Energy to ignore the law. The law \nsays it is high-level radioactive waste.\n  Section 3116 in the bill has many important provisions, but there are \nnot six more important words in this section than the words \n``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' What that means is that \nnotwithstanding the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or perhaps a number of \nother environmental laws, the Department of Energy is allowed to enter \ninto contracts and agreements such as they have with the State of South \nCarolina.\n  Now, one can quibble as to whether that is an amendment of the law. I \nbelieve it has been argued on the floor of the Senate today that this \nlanguage in 3116 does not amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. One can \nperhaps argue that, but it is a quibble because the law or the section \nwe are talking about by its very words allows the Department of Energy \nto ignore the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Whether that constitutes an \namendment is not the point. It is an effective amendment of the law for \nanother law to come along and say one can ignore the first law. That is \nwhat this language does. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to \n     material stored at a Department of Energy site at which \n     activities are regulated by the State pursuant to approved \n     closure plans or permits issued by the State, high-level \n     radioactive waste does not include radioactive material \n     resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel that \n     the Secretary of Energy determines . . .\n\n  Then they go 1, 2, 3, 4, which obviously the Secretary of Energy has \nalready determined. That is what the issue is all about. It is whether \nwe are going to maintain language in the bill which says that the law \nwhich exists as to what constitutes high-level nuclear waste can be \nignored and that the Department of Energy is authorized to spend all \nthe money in this bill--$350 million--in carrying out activities which \nwould be in violation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, except for the \nfact that section 3116 says, ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw.''\n  The heart of this matter is that this language in the bill, unless it \nis stricken, authorizes the Department of Energy to spend all of the \nmoney we provide on activities which are inconsistent with the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. We should not be authorizing the Department of Energy \nto ignore the Nuclear Waste Policy Act by spending money pursuant to an \nagreement with South Carolina which is inconsistent with the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, activities which are not allowed by the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act.\n  So those words, which sound awfully legalistic--and I guess they \nare--``notwithstanding any other provision of law,'' tell the \nDepartment of Energy they are hereby authorized to ignore the law that \nCongress wrote.\n  The Department of Energy and its predecessor tried to get the very \nauthority that it now would have by contract if we approve that \ncontract, notwithstanding the provision of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nwhich this Congress adopted and adopted very consciously to make sure \nthat the waste--sludge--was included in high-level nuclear waste.\n  Finally, this language was debated quite heatedly in our markup at \ncommittee. There were a couple of close votes that were cast. In my \njudgment, the Senate Armed Services Committee is not the place where we \neither should be amending the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or authorizing \nthe Department of Energy to ignore the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I, \ntherefore, support the Cantwell amendment and hope that this Senate \nadopts the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on May 20, 2004, there was some question \nwhether the Senate Armed Services Committee was the correct committee \nof jurisdiction to consider the matter of cleaning up and closing tanks \nfilled with defense nuclear waste.\n  During the discussion on May 20, 2004, there were to have been \nprinted in the Record materials including the President's budget \nrequest, appropriations acts, and authorization acts, which prove, \nirrefutably, that the funds for the cleanup and closure of the nuclear \nwaste tanks at the Hanford Site in Washington, Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, and the Savannah River Site \nin South Carolina, are appropriately within the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  I will ask that this material be printed in the Record, today.\n  Additionally, I am including the pertinent portions of the Standing \nRules of the Senate regarding committee jurisdiction. Listed under the \nsection on the Committee on Armed Services it expressly includes ``the \nnational security aspects of nuclear energy;'' under the section on the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources it expressly includes \n``nonmilitary development of nuclear energy;'' and under the Committee \non Environment and Public Works it expressly includes ``nonmilitary \nenvironmental regulation and control of nuclear energy.'' I believe \nthese Rules show clearly and unambiguously that the Senate Armed \nServices Committee is the proper committee to consider defense nuclear \nwaste cleanup issues.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that, in 1982, the portion of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act dealing with defense nuclear waste was sent to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for consideration.\n  For all of these reasons, I assert that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is the correct committee to consider cleanup and closure \nactivities concerning defense nuclear waste.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n       (c)(1) Committee on Armed Services, to which committee \n     shall be referred all proposed legislation, messages, \n     petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the \n     following subjects:\n       1.

This \n     waste is stored in 49 underground storage tanks \n     (approximately 33.1 million gallons of radioactive salt waste \n     and 3.9 million gallons of radioactive sludge waste). In \n     addition, the Savannah River Site will: reduce the volume of \n     high-level waste by evaporation to ensure that storage tank \n     space is available to receive additional legacy waste volume \n     from on-going nuclear material stabilization and waste \n     processing activities; pretreat the high-level waste by \n     segregating the waste into sludge, low curie salt, low curie \n     salt with higher actinide content, and high curie salt with \n     higher actinide content allowing less costly treatment \n     methods to be used on the waste containing lower curie levels \n     (radioactivity) and shorter lived radionuclides; vitrify \n     sludge and high curie/high actinide high-level waste into \n     canisters and then store and ship the canisters to the \n     Federal Repository for final disposal; treat and dispose the \n     low-level waste fraction resulting from high-level waste \n     pretreatment as Saltstone grout; treat and discharge \n     evaporator overheads through the effluent treat facility; \n     empty and permanently close in place using grout all high-\n     level waste tanks and support systems; and ensure that risks \n     to the environment and human health and safety from high-\n     level waste operations are eliminated or reduced to \n     acceptable levels.\n       The end-state of this project will result in the permanent \n     disposal of all the liquid high-level waste currently stored \n     at the Savannah River Site as well as all legacy high-level \n     waste from planned nuclear materials stabilization activities \n     by FY 2019. It will also result in the permanent closure of \n     the remaining 49 underground storage tanks by FY 2020 (two of \n     the original 51 tanks have already been closed in place in FY \n     1997 using grout).\n       Because of uncertainties associated with a recent court \n     ruling that finds the Department's plans to reclassify some \n     high-level waste (Waste Incidental to Reprocessing) in \n     violation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Department \n     believes it is inadvisable to proceed with certain planned FY \n     2005 activities at this time. Therefore, those activities \n     that are impacted by the court decision are presented in the \n     High-Level Waste Proposal under the Defense Site Acceleration \n     Completion appropriation including both the design and \n     initial construction of the Salt Waste Processing Facility. \n     Funding for this project will be requested only at such time \n     as the legal issue is resolved.\n       In FY 2003 and FY 2004 this PBS included appropriations of \n     $4,842,000 and $51,196,000, respectively, for design of the \n     Salt Waste Processing Facility under line-item 03-D-414, \n     Project Engineering and Design.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The long and short of this is that all three States--South Carolina, \nIdaho, and Washington--have been negotiating to define waste \nclassification standards in their States for a long time.\n  On January 26, 2004, Congressman Hastings, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Cantwell sent a letter to Governor Locke and Secretary Abraham \nthat asked them to work together to resolve the ongoing dispute over \nwaste classification. Please listen to what I\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\njust said. There has been a process in place in Washington since \nJanuary 26 to try to find a way to reach an agreement with the \nDepartment of Energy to classify waste in that State so cleanup can \nmove forward.\n  The letter did not say, call Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and \nsee if you can get his permission. It did not say, call Larry Craig and \nMike Crapo. It said, call Spence Abraham and see if you all can work \ntogether.\n  The Governor wrote back to the Deputy Secretary of Energy and said \nthat the Governor's chief of staff would be the point of contact for \nnegotiations February 12, 2004. From mid-February to April 13, they \nhave been sending drafts back and forth about how to define cleanup and \nwhat is clean in Hanford. They have been doing the same thing in \nIdaho. We have been doing the same thing in South Carolina. All of us \nhave one thing in common: We oppose the Department of Energy's efforts \nto unilaterally determine what ``clean'' is and walk away.\n\n  That is why we had the lawsuit. That is why South Carolina joined as \na friend of the court. The letters my friend from Washington read, \nabout South Carolina objecting to DOE's moving forward, was an \nobjection to a unilateral process where DOE would have the final say \nabout how to clean up the tanks and remove waste.\n  All of us in all three States believe we should be involved. But it \nhas never been the policy or the process where all three States have to \nagree to the same standard because, Members of the Senate, that is \nimpossible to achieve because the waste scenario and the waste stream \nproblems in Idaho are completely different.\n  The film we are trying to leave behind in South Carolina, that inch \nand a quarter of film that will be left in South Carolina and not sent \nto Yucca Mountain, doesn't exist in the tanks in Idaho, and the tanks \nin Washington have a totally different design.\n  Three States have been working in the defense arena to find a common \nground with DOE to make sure the States don't get left holding the bag, \nand we also made sure no State can take over defining ``high-level \nradioactive waste.'' That stays with the Federal Government. But the \nagreement we have achieved said the State of South Carolina has the \nfinal permitting authority and you cannot leave those tanks in a \ncondition that will hurt South Carolina.\n  They are trying to do the same thing in Washington and Idaho. I hope \nthey get there. But if they do get there, they are going to have to do \nthe same thing I am doing today. They are going to need legislative \nlanguage blessing that agreement. There will be an amendment of the \nWaste Policy Act. That is going to have to happen. In 1995, legislative \nlanguage was brought to the Senate to bless an agreement Idaho achieved \nregarding another waste stream. That is going to have to happen. I hope \nI will be man enough, Senator enough, not to stand in the way. If the \nGovernor of Idaho, the Governor of Washington, the attorney general, \nthe environmental regulators, the chamber of commerce, the mayor of the \nHanford community, the communities involved in Idaho--if they say we \nhave a deal that doesn't affect or prejudice my State or change nuclear \npolicy in any significant way, I hope I will say: Go forward; God bless \nyou; I am glad you were able to reach an agreement to clean up your \nStates because you fought very hard to win the cold war.\n  For those who are worried about the safety issue in my State, I \nappreciate the concern. I did not make up this scenario. I am reacting \nto input from my State. I have been involved in the negotiations. They \ncalled me. They drafted the language and they have told me, and sent \nletters--the Governor and the environmental regulators: We have a deal, \nLindsey, that we can live with. We have already closed up two tanks of \nthe 51. So we know in South Carolina, unlike the other two sites, we \ncan extract the liquid waste, grout the tank, and have it not affect \nthe ground water because we have done it twice and we are trying to \nmove forward at a faster rate.\n  They are telling me: Lindsey, we have a deal that will allow us to \nclean up the tanks and get the liquid waste out 23 years ahead of \nschedule and save $16 billion.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, I cannot make that happen unless you allow it \nto happen. If it does happen in Idaho and it does happen in Washington, \nand I believe it will one day, you are going to have to do the same \nthing for those States.\n  To my friends in New York, the waste stream you are discussing and \nthat you talked about on the floor is not remotely similar to the waste \nstream we are talking about here. This is defense waste.\n  To my friends in Maine who have spent nuclear fuel, it is covered \nunder a whole different section. Here is what you have to understand. \nIf you have spent fuel rods in your State, defense waste has priority \nin Yucca Mountain. If we are going to insist the cleanup standards be \nbeyond what good science says and we are going to take that extra 23 \nyears and spend that extra $23 billion, you are going to run out of \nspace in Yucca Mountain to send your spent fuel.\n  I say to my friend Senator Enzi, thank you. Every State has an \nobligation to help where it can. South Carolina can retain the film on \nthe bottom of these tanks in a safe and sound manner, and it is not \nnecessary to extract it, take 23 years, and spend $16 billion to send \nit to Nevada. We can safely take care of it in South Carolina. We have \ndone it twice and we want to do it more so we can get this waste out of \nthe tanks, because the biggest threat to my State and to all the States \nis seepage and leakage of the waste.\n  Washington has a problem. Of all the States, Washington needs to \nreach agreement to make these tanks dry. I don't want to be a \nWashington. I don't want to look back 10 years from now and have this \nprocess slowed down to a crawl and my ground water get contaminated.\n  The NRC has said this is safe and that what is left in the tank is no \nlonger high-level waste; it meets the definition of low-level waste. \nAbout hearings, Senators Allard, Inhofe, Domenici, have been talking \nabout the plans to clean up the tanks in three States for well over 4 \nyears. The Department of Energy has been working with each State with a \nseparate cleanup plan for a long time. They have been negotiating with \nWashington since January. We have discussed how you would treat South \nCarolina, Idaho, and Washington through hearings in an exhaustive \nmanner.\n  If you make us have more hearings, I am going to be right back here \nasking you to bless this agreement because the agreement has been a \ncollaborative process that has been going on for 2 years and all you \nare going to do is throw us in chaos because if we can veto each other, \nthen we will never clean up. If you are insisting on a standard that \nfits all of these sites, it will never be reached.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the transcripts from the \nArmed Services hearing of February 25, 2004--what we talked about, the \nwaste cleanup process; Senator Domenici's Energy and Water Subcommittee \nhearing of March 31, 2004, same topics discussed; and pages 1 through \n47 of the EPW committee hearing of July 25, 2000.\n  My colleagues, I need your help. I want to make sure the tanks don't \nleak. We have a sound plan that will not affect your States. It will \nonly help mine. I want to help you. Please help me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do both sides have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents control 22\\1/2\\ minutes. The \nopponents of the amendment control 1 minute. Who yields time? The \nSenator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's \ncharacterization of this issue. I think we have had somewhat of a \ndebate this morning. I think probably for most people, including my \ncolleagues, what we have done is shown that this is a very complex \nissue, a very complicated issue, and that it needs more discussion than \na few hours on the Senate floor, because what is at stake here is the \nlives of individuals who are living in these communities, whose ground \nwater may be contaminated, whose safe drinking water in the future may \nbe contaminated at levels that are not sustainable in these areas.\n  Let's recap for a second where we have been in this debate, because I \nwill\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nhave printed in the Record, for my colleagues to understand, the 1989 \nagreement between Washington State and DOE, and the 1995 agreement \nbetween the State of Idaho and DOE on cleanup.\n  Let me point out, we have agreements. We have agreements with the \nDepartment of Energy on cleanup. They are agreements that basically \nsay: DOE, keep making progress on cleanup and please continue to follow \nthe Federal statute. The issue at hand is that somehow my colleague \nfrom South Carolina has been persuaded by the Department of Energy--an \nargument the State of Washington refused to buy, I might add, an \nargument the State of Idaho refused to buy--that somehow cleanup means \nwe have to reclassify waste.\n  So, yes, States in this country have continued to push DOE on \nagreement. We had agreements on the books. It is unfortunate that DOE \nhas not been able to be trusted to get cleanup done in a timely \nfashion. That is why States have continued to push them.\n  Agreements are in place. And our State continues, as Idaho and South \nCarolina admit in a court filing that they do not trust DOE and that \nDOE should move forward and it doesn't need the sledge hammer of this \nlegislation. That is South Carolina's own testimony in court and its \nown testimony to the Department of Energy in a letter.\n  Why are we having this discussion then? We are having this discussion \nbecause, even though agreements are already in place and DOE is failing \nto live up to cleanup, DOE would like to now change the rules of the \ngame and change the definition of high-level waste.\n  If you think about it, the point of the Senator from South Carolina \nis that his State should have the right to agree with DOE to clean \nthings up, and that he is not changing current law.\n  If that were the case, why are we here arguing today? The Senator \nfrom South Carolina and DOE should just go and proceed. The reason they \ndo not is because the Senator from South Carolina knows all too well \nthat his language is changing current law and that he needs that change \nif DOE wants to leave high-level waste in the ground.\n  The point is for all Americans to understand that nuclear waste in \nStates such as Washington, Idaho, and South Carolina only have the \nauthority to argue these issues about cleanup within the framework of a \nFederal statute. That Federal statute is the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina is doing in the underlying bill \nis threatening the rights of States, including his own State, to \nprotect itself from DOE as DOE reclassifies waste. It leaves our States \nat jeopardy. It leaves all States where there are nuclear facilities in \njeopardy because of DOE's insistence that the nuclear waste policy \ndefinition of spent nuclear fuel does not have to meet the standard of \nhigh-level waste. It leaves all of these States with a debate with DOE \nthat DOE can say this waste is no longer high level. We can transport \nit. We can do whatever we want with it. We can fill tanks with grout. \nIt is a very dangerous precedent.\n  The Senator is getting rid of the Federal framework. No State has the \nability to negotiate on its own a Federal cleanup standard. Imagine if \nthe State of Michigan discussed with EPA this is what the clean air \nstandard should be for the State of Michigan? What if Florida and the \nEPA decided what safe drinking water standards are for the State of \nFlorida? We have never operated that way.\n  The Senator from South Carolina refuses to address that his State can \nonly deal with leaving tank waste in the ground, which he is proposing \nwe do, by changing the Federal standard. The Department of Defense \nauthorization bill changes the definition of high-level waste. It is \nchanging the Federal standard. It is then leaving those States subject \nto DOE's whim on how much ground waste and water pollution will be \nthere in those tanks at Hanford, at Savannah River, and in Idaho.\n  The Senator talks about contaminated ground water. His ground water \nin Savannah River is already contaminated. The ground water in \nWashington State at Hanford is already contaminated. There are other \nparts of the country with high-level contaminated waste.\n  The question is, What are we going to do to hold DOE's feet to the \nfire to make sure they get this waste cleaned up? This body, for the \nlast 3 years, has seen various changes at this administration level try \nto undermine current environmental standards and environmental law. The \ncurrent environmental law of the day regarding nuclear waste is the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act. The Senator's language in the underlying bill \nthreatens that language.\n  Washington State agreements, which have been fighting DOE to live up \nto the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, will no longer be able to argue that \neffectively, nor will Idaho, unless we pass my amendment.\n  My amendment specifically says we are not changing the definition of \nhigh-level waste but the Department of Energy needs to have dollars \nappropriated, which this bill authorizes, for $350 million of cleanup, \nand the DOE must spend that money on cleanup. We actually crafted that \nlanguage with Senator Levin with the help and support of Governor \nKempthorne of Idaho. We put the Kempthorne language in our amendment. \nWhy did we do that? Because we wanted to be clear with the Kempthorne \nlanguage that we were not going to be held hostage; Idaho, Washington, \nand even Savannah River were not going to be blackmailed by DOE to \nsaying, they only get the cleanup dollars if, in fact, they agree to a \nlesser standard which allows us to leave more pollution in the ground \nwater in your State. We refused to agree to this policy and be held \nhostage by DOE.\n\n  The Senators from Idaho do not need any other language. They want \ntheir State protected on this issue. They want their dollars for \ncleanup protected. The Cantwell amendment protects the State of Idaho. \nI am sure that is what the response will be from the State of Idaho and \nthe State of Washington and others as they look at this policy. It \ncorrects onerous activities that happened when the Defense \nauthorization bill moved through the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand marked up policy changes to environmental policy of which that \ncommittee does not have oversight.\n  My colleagues can say we have had lots of debate about cleanup and \nlots of budget discussions. I don't think anyone can seriously stand in \nthe Senate and say the change in definition of hazardous nuclear waste \nis the jurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is not. \nThe Parliamentarian has already ruled on that. That is the jurisdiction \nof the Energy Committee.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are ignoring the hard \nfacts. This is not about individual States having agreement; it is \nabout changing the Federal standard for nuclear waste cleanup.\n  This administration and DOE ought to be embarrassed. They are trying \nthis sneaky process behind closed doors and putting language in that \nnow we all have to come to the Senate and fight to take out.\n  What Member wants to vote against the Defense authorization bill that \nhas this language in it? What does this language have to do with troops \nin Afghanistan or troops in Iraq? What does it have to do with giving \nmen and women the support they deserve to fight for our country? It is \ncreating a controversy around change to a Federal policy that has not \nbeen debated.\n  There is no Lindsey Graham bill or bill by any of my other colleagues \nthat has the Graham language in it that was brought before the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and debated. My colleagues are wrong on \nthis.\n  Let's see what the rest of America is saying about this because I \nguarantee this debate will not end today. It is very important the \nthird parties that have looked at this issue have validated exactly \nwhat my colleagues on this side of the aisle are saying about this \nissue.\n  In fact, the Savannah Morning News says:\n\n       It's good for the government to save billions of dollars \n     and to clean up nuclear waste. But a money-saving plan that \n     does a poor job of tidying up is no bargain.\n\n  The Minneapolis Star Tribune said:\n\n       Quicker and cheaper can be valid considerations . . . but \n     only after the highest level of safety has been guaranteed. \n     And those guarantees must satisfy national standards, not the \n     terms of a side deal.\n\n  That is exactly what this is, a side deal between a State and an \nagency\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nthat has neglected its cleanup responsibilities for years. The court \nsaid they needed to move forward but not by changing the definition of \nhigh-level waste that they did not have, but move forward on the plans \nthey have in place. This is a side deal.\n  The Boston Globe said:\n\n       If the Senate isn't careful, it could vote this week to \n     allow the Department of Energy to cover some of the nation's \n     most hazardous nuclear waste with grout instead of treating \n     it properly. . . . The Senate should strip the defense \n     spending bill of this toxic measure.\n\n  The Oregonian, from another part of the country that is greatly \nimpacted by this issue because of the Columbia River and the huge \nimpact that river has, already with that plutonium leaked into the \nriver, said:\n\n       It's remotely possible that [this] policy is worth \n     debating, but this sneaky approach suggests the Department of \n     Energy isn't interested in a public discussion of the issue.\n\n  What did the Seattle Times say? In our State, we have been battling \nDOE for years because they always want to take a shortcut. They always \nwant to take a shortcut and say we can do it quicker. What are the \nWashington agreements about? The Washington agreements are about \nforcing DOE to live up to Federal cleanup standards. That is what the \nagreements are. In fact, they always try to get out of it. The Seattle \nTimes wrote:\n\n       The Senate should slap down a sneaky ploy . . . that would \n     give the Department of Energy the right to single-handedly \n     change the rules about how it handles highly radioactive \n     waste.\n\n  The Washington Post took a look at this situation and said:\n\n     . . . a situation in which states compete to reach private \n     agreements with the Energy Department and then rush to put \n     them into legislation is untenable.\n\n  What did the Atlanta Journal Constitution say? It is a State that is \naffected by the Savannah River which flows into their State. The \nSavannah River already has pollution problems with radionuclides \naffecting fish and affecting safe drinking water conditions. It said:\n\n     . . . words do matter, and some semantic contortions can be \n     dangerous. Recent efforts by the U.S. Department of Energy to \n     circumvent the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act by slipping \n     through a linguistic wormhole are an outrageous case in \n     point.\n\n  What about the Omaha-World Herald? They know a little bit about this \nissue. They have debated the nuclear waste issue. They said:\n\n       We hope Congress will listen to common-sense views . . . \n     and yank this terrible idea back out of the bill. It's not \n     merely wrongheaded; it would result in a hazard to the public \n     well-being.\n\n  And there are newspapers in my State weighing in on this issue. The \nTri-City Herald, which is in the heart of this cleanup effort at \nHanford, the largest tank waste cleanup in the country, where we \nalready have 1 million gallons of tank waste leaking in a plume that is \nan 80-square-mile area that is going to the Columbia River, said:\n\n       Senators considering [this issue] should ask themselves \n     this: If reclassification really is such a great and worthy \n     idea, why isn't the Energy Department making the argument in \n     the light of day?\n\n  If they really thought reclassifying waste was such a great idea, why \ndon't they put a bill before this legislative body saying so, driving \nit through the normal channels and the normal process of legislation? \nThey know they do not have this authority. They tried by their own \nexecutive administrative order to do it, and the courts told them they \ndid not have the ability to do it. But instead of coming through the \nproper channels with a bill and legislation, they have chosen, instead, \nto sneak language into the Defense authorization bill--probably one of \nthe most unpatriotic things I can think to do.\n  These men and women gave a serious amount of their lives to fighting \nin World War II and the cold war by producing plutonium and giving us a \ntool to win in those areas. They did that in record time. Now they \nexpect this country, just like businesses all across America, to clean \nup their waste. We expect the Federal Government to clean up their \nwaste. We do not expect a short-end process where they say you can \nsimply grout over nuclear radioactive waste and put sand and gravel on \ntop of it and somehow stabilize the situation.\n  So the Tri-City Herald said Senators should ask themselves this: If \nreclassification is such a great idea, why don't they make the argument \nin the light of day?\n  What did the Idaho Statesman say? The Idaho Statesman said:\n\n       The Energy Department's shameful record on this issue--\n\n  Why would a paper like the Idaho Statesman say it is a ``shameful \nrecord''? Because it is true. DOE fails to live up, time and time \nagain, to the process of moving forward, and so States have had to \nenter into agreements that comply with Federal law--not circumvent \nFederal law, but comply with Federal law--and hold DOE's feet to the \nfire and say: DOE, you must meet the Federal standard and move forward. \nSo the Idaho Statesman said:\n\n       The Energy Department's shameful record on this issue is \n     even more troubling. Remember recent history . . . Suggesting \n     there's no precedent--and no potential effect on Idaho--is \n     politically naive.\n\n  That is from the Idaho Statesman.\n  What did the Bangor Daily News say? Well, the Bangor Daily News said:\n\n       The long-term implications of such an important change in \n     waste-storage policy are too serious to give the issue a free \n     ride in a spending bill.\n\n  So we have heard from over 20 newspapers across America. My colleague \nfrom New York submitted editorials from both the New York Times and the \nBuffalo News. I talked about the Minneapolis Star earlier and their \ncomments on this issue.\n  Show me a newspaper in America that is saying this is a good policy. \nIn the limited amount of time we have had to get this debate in front \nof the public, the public has basically, in these editorials and \nletters to the editors, raised serious questions about this policy, \nserious questions about why the Senate would be moving forward on this \nissue.\n\n  As my colleague, the senior Senator from Washington, mentioned \nearlier, the House of Representatives, when posed with this question, \nfigured it out and said: Listen, if this is such a good idea, let's \nhave a study. Let's have a study and analysis of this issue and see \nexactly what people can come up with as far as science. Well, that is \nwhat is in the House version of this legislation--a study--because my \ncolleagues over there understood that this was a change to Federal \npolicy.\n  So what about the underlying effects of this legislation if the \nCantwell amendment is not adopted? The Cantwell amendment says two \nthings: We are not changing the definition of what is high-level waste \nand the definition of spent nuclear fuel. We are leaving that the same. \nBut we are giving the authorization and requiring that DOE spend $350 \nmillion on cleanup in Washington, in Savannah River, and in Idaho. So \nwe are pushing them ahead. So there is no holdup on cleanup, no issue. \nDOE, get back to your job of taking the waste out of the tanks and \nputting it into a glassification and storage process. Why are we \nspending billions of dollars on a glassification process--that is, the \nprocess of taking this spent fuel and turning it into glass logs and \nmoving it into storage--if we are going to leave so much of it in the \nground in these tanks? Why would we be spending so much money on it?\n  As my colleagues are trying to paint a picture that somehow our \nlanguage does not take care of the blackmail clause, we are simply \nnot--in Washington or in Idaho--going to be blackmailed by DOE into \nsneaking in language or having our funds held up. As my colleague from \nWashington said, we have successfully, as a caucus, fought these \nefforts in the past and have not been peeled off by DOE, that likes to \nplay a switch-and-run game, just because OMB or somebody says we don't \nhave the money in the budget to do the cleanup.\n  Well, nuclear waste cleanup costs money. The plume in our State \nalready has 1 million gallons of ground water leakage; I will point out \nto my colleagues, these tanks started leaking years ago. This is not a \nrecent phenomenon. So the fact that these tanks were built, and that \nDOE knew they were leaking. We all became aware of this; I know this \nbody changes, you have turnover in membership, but my colleagues knew \nthese tanks were leaking. The thing we should have done is continued to \npush DOE, just as Washington has, just as Idaho has, and just as \nSavannah River has in legal documents.\n  I have, again, great respect for the junior Senator of South \nCarolina, but\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nhe is wrong as it relates to his State's history. His State has said, \non numerous occasions, that DOE is wrong on this issue. Now, I get that \nthey have an advocate in the Senate today to make a different point for \nthem, but why do they spend the taxpayers' money in South Carolina \narguing in a Federal court case that DOE was wrong to try to change \nthis policy and send letters to Spencer Abraham, the Secretary of \nEnergy, saying he was dead wrong on this policy? Why did they spend the \nmoney of the taxpayers in South Carolina fighting this battle, along \nwith Washington and along with Idaho, if they did not believe in it?\n  I know. Because the State of South Carolina does believe that Federal \ncleanup policy should be preserved, that the States can only be \nprotected by having a Federal statute, that negotiating cleanup policy \nstandards is not the prerogative of individual States. It is something \nthat is designated under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. If that law is \nto be changed, then it ought to be done in the broad daylight of this \nbody and this organization.\n  So what are we left with today? I think some people at home, who may \nhave been watching this debate, are asking themselves this question. I \nhope the Cantwell amendment is adopted because it will remove this \ndebate from this bill that we need to move forward with to protect our \ntroops, to continue to give them the resources they need, and move the \nnuclear waste debate off of something that is so important for us to \nget done.\n  But if the Cantwell amendment is not adopted, what we will leave the \npeople with is legislation that basically says the Department of Energy \ncan grout these tanks and can leave this waste in the ground. I do not \nwant safe drinking water affected. I do not want ground water \ncontamination. I want the Senate to do its job and uphold the Federal \nstandard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 10 seconds to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record an editorial from the Augusta Chronicle, \nwhich is the major newspaper at the Savannah River site, supporting my \nefforts with this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Augusta Chronicle, May 15, 2004]\n\n                          Rescuing SRS Cleanup\n\n       A way apparently has been found that will get the \n     accelerated cleanup project at Savannah River Site back on \n     track.\n       The project was dealt a severe setback last summer, when a \n     federal judge ruled that the Department of Energy's plan to \n     reclassify residual sludge in tanks at SRS and other nuclear \n     weapons sites from high-level radioactive nuclear waste to \n     low-level waste violated the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n       That act requires nuclear facilities to route all their \n     high-level N-waste to the permanent storage facility \n     approved, but not yet built, at Yucca Mountain, Nev. The \n     energy agency is charged with removing strontium-90, \n     plutonium, uranium and other highly radioactive wastes from \n     tanks that have held the nuclear bomb making substances for \n     nearly five decades during the Cold War.\n       That highly radioactive waste is extremely expensive and \n     difficult to remove. Reclassifying it and treating it on site \n     would save $16 billion in cleanup costs and shorten SRS \n     cleanup time by 23 years, according to the energy agency that \n     sought the reclassification.\n       But the federal court said no, the agency cannot \n     arbitrarily reclassify nuclear waste to suit its convenience.\n       The ruling made sense, but it wreaked havoc with the \n     accelerated cleanup plan. DOE is trying, so far \n     unsuccessfully, to get Congress to change the law to allow \n     the agency to reclassify the contaminated waste.\n       More successful is U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposal, \n     which he got included in the defense bill approved last week \n     by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Although the measure \n     applies only to the Savannah River Site, it could serve as \n     model legislation for other states concerned about residual \n     liquid radioactive waste left in DOE facilities.\n       The South Carolina senator's plan would allow DOE to leave \n     in place the highly radioactive sludge that lines the tank's \n     sides and bottom, but it would have to be diluted with grout, \n     thus turning it into ``low level'' nuclear waste in \n     accordance with the state's Department of Health and \n     Environmental Control.\n       The provision, said Graham, still ``allows South Carolina \n     and DOE to define high-level waste in a very reasonable \n     manner. There's nothing going to be left behind . . . that \n     will not be secured through environmental remediating to \n     protect South Carolina.''\n       The next move is to make sure the Graham plan stays in the \n     defense bill as it works its way through the rest of \n     Congress. The stakes are high. DOE was planning to withhold \n     cleanup funds if it couldn't move ahead on its accelerated \n     cleanup project. The Graham plan would put the agency back in \n     business.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of our time.\n  I happen to believe that the sooner you clean up a nuclear waste site \nthe better. And you do it within the guidelines of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. That is what we are trying to do with the WIR \nproject. That is what the Department of Energy is trying to do. I think \nquicker is better because it means less seepage throughout the ground, \nless pollution.\n  And there is a cost. If we stay with the original plan that was drawn \nout, we do not get cleaned up until 2065. It is going to cost well over \n$138 billion. With rapid cleanup, we save $86 billion and we help clean \nup the environment quicker, which means less pollution. I think it is \nbetter for the citizens of these States.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Warner, myself, the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Crapo, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, in \nvoting no on the Cantwell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The assistant Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, do we have 1 minute on each side between \nvotes on the judges?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order has not been entered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that prior to the judges, there be \n1 minute to speak in relation to those judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord a letter from the National Congress of American Indians. And I \ncommend to my colleagues the 1995 Idaho settlement agreement and the \nWashington Tri-Party Agreement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2004.\n     To: Members of the United States Senate.\n     Re Tribal Support of Cantwell-Hollings Amendment to Defense \n         Authorization.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the over 250 member tribes of \n     the National Congress of American Indians--the oldest and \n     largest intertribal organization in the US--I write this \n     letter to urge you to support the Cantwell-Hollings amendment \n     to the Defense Authorization Act that will prevent the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) from leaving hazardous and harmful \n     nuclear waste in underground tanks to contaminate our soil \n     and water. The health and environmental hazards of this \n     practice notwithstanding, many tribes believe that the Earth \n     is our Mother, and that these leaking tanks are a wound to \n     her that must be healed.\n       DOE's high-level waste (HLW) remains dangerous for hundreds \n     or thousands of years. For this reason, they must be disposed \n     in a geological repository along with nuclear power spent \n     fuel. Under the NWPA, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulate \n     the geologic disposal of HLW--and decide what is (and what is \n     not) HLW. The Graham amendment eliminates NRC and EPA legal \n     protections and gives DOE sole authority to transform these \n     lethal materials into ``waste incidental to reprocessing.''\n       These provisions establish a dangerous precedent for the \n     country. They would allow DOE to redefine about 70 percent of \n     the total radioactivity of all the nation's defense high \n     level wastes stored at the Savannah River site, while \n     preventing access to necessary funds for other states that \n     support the existing, more protective legal framework as \n     Washington and Oregon do for the Hanford site--which is very \n     important to our member tribes in the Northwest.\n       We urge you to support efforts by Senators Cantwell and \n     Hollings to strike these provisions. The costs of cleaning up \n     DOE sites are expensive. However, the costs of allowing DOE \n     to regulate itself in terms of our nation's natural resources \n     are incalculable. The Indian people of the United States--\n     because we are so dependent on the Earth--will suffer \n     mightily if DOE is able to shirk its responsibilities \n     relative to cleaning up nuclear waste sites.\n       Please consider NCAI's resolute support for the Cantwell-\n     Hollings amendment as you determine how you will vote on the \n     amendment. If you have any questions, please contact NCAI at \n     202.466.7767.\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\n       Thank you for your work for Indian Country, and thank you \n     for your support on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Tex Hall,\n                                                  President, NCAI.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the staff indicates we have 10 minutes prior \nto the vote on the judges. That should be more than enough to talk \nabout the three judges. I ask unanimous consent that the 1 minute \nbetween the judges, which is unnecessary, be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

She made history again in 1999, when she became the first African \nAmerican to be elected locally to the New York State Supreme Court. Two \nyears later, Gov. George Pataki appointed her to associate justice of \nthe Appellate Division of that court, where she now sits.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Justice Townes and am \nconfident that she will continue her outstanding record of public \nservice on the Federal bench in the Eastern District of New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is proceeding to confirm \nSandra Lynn Townes to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York. Justice Townes is currently an associate justice of the \nNew York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, where she has served \nfor several years. She previously served as a judge in the Fifth \nJudicial District of the New York State Supreme Court. According to \npress reports, Justice Townes is the first African-American woman to \nserve on the appellate bench in New York and the first African-American \nJudge elected to the New York Supreme Court in the Fifth District. She \nwas also a judge of the City Court of Syracuse from 1988 to 1999.\n  Her extensive record of judicial experience commends her for this \nlifetime appointment, and I am pleased to join her home-State Senators \nin support of her nomination.\n  Today's confirmation will make the 178th judicial nominee to be \nconfirmed for this President. With 78 judicial confirmations in just \nthe past year and a half alone, the Senate has confirmed more Federal \njudges than were confirmed during all of 1995 and 1996, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the \nWhite House. It also exceeds the 2-year total for the last Congress of \nthe Clinton administration, when Republicans were in the Senate \nmajority. We have already exceeded the totals for the last two \nCongresses leading up to presidential elections.\n  When Democrats controlled the Senate for 17 months in 2001 and 2002, \nwe worked diligently to confirm 100 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. We are now confirming the 78th in the other 24 months that \nhave transpired during this most divisive presidency. With 178 total \njudicial confirmations in 3\\1/2\\ years, the Senate has confirmed more \nlifetime judicial appointees of this President than were allowed to be \nconfirmed in President Clinton's entire term from 1997 through 2000. We \nhave already surpassed the number of judicial confirmations during \nPresident Reagan's entire term from 1981 through 1984, and he is \nacknowledged to have appointed more Federal judges than any other \npresident in our history.\n  The Republican Senate leadership has again chosen to avoid debate of \nthe nomination of J. Leon Holmes and Judge Dora Irizarry. Just so that \nthere is no confusion, it is the choice of the Republican Senate \nleadership to skip those nominations.\n  The Holmes nomination will take some significant debate. The \nnomination was sent by the Judiciary Committee to the floor without \nrecommendation, a highly unusual circumstance. That means that there \nwas not a majority vote in committee to report the nomination \nfavorably. The committee disserved the Senate by not doing its job of \nfully vetting the nomination and reaching a consensus or even a vote on \nthe merits.\n  It is also the decision of the Republican leadership to skip the \nnomination\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nof Judge Irizarry, which has been pending on the Senate floor since \nlast October. She is one of many Bush nominees with a ``not qualified'' \nor partial ``not qualified'' rating from the ABA. With the support of \nSenator Schumer, her nomination was considered and favorably reported \nby the committee. For months Democrats have been ready to vote on that \ndistrict court nomination. The delay in considering her nomination \nsince last October, a delay of 7 months, is attributable to the \nreluctance of the Republican Senate leadership to consider her \nnomination.\n  It is reminiscent of the way the Republican leadership treated the \nnomination of other Hispanics. For example, President Clinton's \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the 2nd Circuit was delayed for \n16 months and was likewise stalled by Republicans on the Senate \ncalendar for 7 months. Judge Richard Paez's nomination to the 9th \nCircuit was delayed for more than 4 years and was stalled by \nRepublicans on the Senate calendar for more than 18 months alone. More \nrecently, Republican Senate leadership even delayed Senate \nconsideration of President Bush's nomination of Judge Edward Prado of \nTexas to the 5th Circuit for a month on the calendar, until we called \nthem on it. Considering Judge Prado's nomination in a timely fashion \nwould not have fit with the partisan political characterizations that \nRepublicans wanted to draw of Democrats so they just left him on the \nshelf for a time.\n  The Republican leadership must be accountable for its scheduling \npriorities and the delays that it is causing in the consideration of \nthe President's judicial nominations.\n  I congratulate Justice Townes and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nhave worked with me and others in the past few weeks to get through \nthis logjam on judges.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Sandra Townes, of New York, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of New York.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL, I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

KARAS TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                   THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Kenneth M. \nKaras, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Kenneth M. Karas\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nKenneth Karas, who has been nominated to the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York.\n  Mr. Karas, a graduate of Columbia University School of Law, is a \ndistinguished veteran of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, where he is co-chief of that office's unit \nspecializing in terrorism cases. He is known among his peers as an \n``al-Qaida expert,'' for his assistance in successfully prosecuting \nfour of Osama bin Laden's followers for the 1998 embassy bombings in \nEast Africa. He is currently the lead prosecutor in the case against \nalleged al-Qaida terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui.\n  Mr. Karas is, by all accounts, a gifted prosecutor whose familiarity \nwith Federal trial procedure will benefit him immensely on the Federal \nbench.\n  I applaud President Bush for his nomination of Mr. Karas and am \nconfident that he will serve on the bench with compassion, integrity \nand fairness.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this evening the Senate considers the \nnomination of Kenneth Karas to be a United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York. For the past 11 years, Mr. Karas has \nserved as an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District \nof New York. He received a favorable rating from the American Bar \nAssociation and he has the support of both Senators from his home \nState.\n  In sharp contrast to so many judicial nominees of this President, \napparently selected for their political viewpoint, Mr. Karas appears to \nbe a well-qualified, moderate nominee. He has advocated for civil \nrights and the rights of the indigent and has served the public as an \nassistant U.S. attorney for 11 years.\n  Mr. Karas's testimony and answers to my questions have made me \nconfident that he will treat all who appear before him with respect. \nThe nomination of Mr. Karas is an example of how effectively Democrats \nand Republicans can work together when we have qualified, moderate \nnominees.\n  Mr. Karas will be the ninth of President Bush's nominees confirmed to \nFederal court vacancies in New York, leaving only one vacancy on the \nFederal judiciary in the State. The nominee to that vacancy was \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate 7 months \nago. It has been the decision of the Republican leadership not to move \nthe nomination of Judge Dora Irizarry, a Latina nominee. Democrats have \nbeen ready to vote on Judge Irizarry's nomination.\n  With 79 judicial confirmations in just the past year and a half, the \nSenate has confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during \neither Congress leading to a presidential election with a Democratic \nPresident and Republican Senate majority in 1996 and 2000.\n  This marks the 179th judicial confirmation since President Bush took \noffice. That is more than President Reagan, the acknowledged all-time \nchampion, achieved in his entire 4-year presidential term from 1981 \nthrough 1984 working hand in hand with a Republican Senate majority. It \nis more than President Clinton was able to achieve in his entire 4-year \npresidential term from 1993 through 1996, having to work with a \nRepublican Senate majority during 1995 and 1996.\n  I congratulate Mr. Karas and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HERRERA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Judith C. Herrera, of \nNew Mexico, to be United States District Judge for the District of New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of a New Mexican named \nJudith Herrera to be United States District Judge for the District of \nNew Mexico. I believe everyone knows that the administration of justice \nis one of the most significant pillars of good government. I think in \nthis instance the President has sent us an extraordinary person to be a \njudge in the District of New Mexico.\n  We have a vacancy there because of a justice who took senior status. \nWe have a tremendous overload, and I am very pleased that we finally \ngot to the point where we could have another judge. Maybe we can begin \nto take care of this enormous overload. I thank everyone who worked on \nthis nomination. Her credentials are impeccable. Every group that \nneeded to recommended her.\n  Judith Herrera is a resident of Santa Fe, NM. She attended the \nUniversity of New Mexico.\n  She then attended the Georgetown University Law Center where she \nearned her law degree.\n  We, in New Mexico, are fortunate that Judy decided to return to New \nMexico upon completion of her law degree.\n  She began her career in public service shortly after returning to New \nMexico, serving on the Santa Fe City Council from 1981 to 1986.\n  She continued her service by sitting on the boards of St. Vincent \nHospital in Santa Fe, St. Michael's High School Foundation, also in \nSanta Fe, and the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.\n  She has practiced law for more than 20 years in New Mexico, amassing \nin impressive resume and reputation in the legal community.\n  I am confident she will be an outstanding member of the federal \njudiciary.\n  I look forward to Judy Herrera's tenure on the bench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nin urging the Senate to support this nomination. Judith Herrera is very \nqualified. I compliment the President for nominating her for this \nposition. I compliment my colleague for recommending that nomination. \nShe will serve us well on the district court in New Mexico.\n  Ms. Herrera began her career as a prosecutor, and has spent many \nyears in private practice. Currently, she is a partner at Herrera, \nLong, Pound & Komer in Santa Fe, NM. She has also served on the Santa \nFe City Council and on the University of New Mexico's Board of Regents. \nMrs. Herrera has served with distinction in all of these positions.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support her nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Judith Herrera, who has been nominated to the \nUnited States District Court for the District of New Mexico.\n  Ms. Herrera is an exceptional nominee and has a distinguished record \nof service in both the private and public sectors. After graduating \nfrom Georgetown Law School, Ms. Herrera worked as an Assistant District \nAttorney in Santa Fe, New Mexico where she prosecuted a variety of \nmisdemeanor and felony offenses. She later entered the private sector \nand practiced in the areas of education and employment law.\n  Ms. Herrera distinguished herself as one of the most effective \nadvocates in New Mexico for employers defending wrongful discharge and \ndiscrimination cases. She later founded her own law firm, and currently \nserves as shareholder and president of that firm. Ms. Herrera has also \nserved the local community of Santa Fe in a variety of ways. She was a \nmember of the Santa Fe City Council, the Board of Trustees for St. \nVincent Hospital, and the Board of Regents for the University of New \nMexico. Ms. Herrera's broad experience as a trial attorney and her many \nhours of community service have prepared her for the challenges she \nwill face as a Federal judge. I am confident that she will make a fine \naddition to the federal bench in the District of New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today the Senate is proceeding to confirm Judith Herrera \nto the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. Ms. Herrera \nis a partner with the Santa Fe firm of Herrera, Long, Pound & Komer, \nwhich she co-founded in 1987. She appears in court frequently on behalf \nof employers, and their insurance companies, serving as defense counsel \nin employment discrimination and wrongful discharge cases. Before \nstarting this practice, she handled education cases and also served \nbriefly as a local prosecutor. She also previously served on the Sante \nFe City Council. She has the support of both of her home-state \nSenators.\n  Democratic support for the confirmation of Ms. Herrera, an active \nRepublican, is yet another example of our extraordinary cooperation in \nthis Presidential election year. Today's confirmation will make the \n180th judicial nominee to be confirmed since this President took \noffice. With 80 lifetime judicial appointments confirmed in just the \npast year and a half alone, the Senate has confirmed more Federal \njudges than were confirmed during the all of 1995 and 1996, when \nRepublicans first controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in \nthe White House. It also exceeds the 2-year total for the last Congress \nof the Clinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate. This \nSenate has now confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during \neither Congress leading to a presidential election with a Democratic \nPresident and Republican Senate majority in 1996 and 2000.\n  This marks the 180th judicial confirmation since President Bush took \noffice. That is more than President Reagan, the acknowledged all-time \nchampion, achieved in his entire 4-year Presidential term from 1981 \nthrough 1984 working hand in hand with a Republican Senate majority. It \nis more than President Clinton was able to achieve in his entire 4-year \nPresidential term from 1993 through 1996, having to work with a \nRepublican Senate majority during 1995 and 1996.\n  I have already noted that at the Republican Senate leadership has \nagain chosen to avoid debate of the nomination of J. Leon Holmes and \nJudge Dora\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nIrizarry. These two district court nominees have been pending on the \nSenate floor longer than any of the other pending district court \nnominees. Just so that there is no confusion, that is the choice of the \nRepublican Senate leadership to skip those nominations.\n  The Holmes nomination will require significant debate. It was sent by \nthe Judiciary Committee to the floor without recommendation, a highly \nunusual circumstance. That means that there was not a majority vote in \ncommittee to report the nomination favorably. The committee disserved \nthe Senate by not doing its job of fully vetting the nomination and \nreaching a consensus or even a vote on the merits.\n  With regard to Mr. Holmes, to excuse widely shared misgivings about \nthis nomination partisan Republicans are falsely claiming that the \nopposition to him is based on his religion. That is a slander. \nNonetheless, right wing groups like the Committee for Justice have run \noutrageous and false ads and propaganda against Democrats and have \nposted assertions that Democrats are anti-Catholic.\n  Ms. Herrera is, of course, another among the scores of judicial \nnominees we have confirmed who are active in their faith. Ms. Herrera \nhas stated in her Senate questionnaire that she is on the Board of \nDirectors of the St. Michael's High School Foundation, a local Catholic \nhigh school, and she is a parishioner at St. Francis Cathedral. It is \nwrong for Republican partisans to seek political benefit by falsely \nclaiming that Democrats are anti-Catholic and insulting for them to \nclaim that Catholic Democrats are somehow not Catholic enough. Senator \nDurbin just released a study this week that shows that Democrats \nactually vote more often in agreement with the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops on domestic and international issues than their \ncounterparts across the aisle. Yet the destructive Republican politics \nof division persist. These are unfortunate and dangerous schemes that \nwill only further divide our people and our Nation. Anna Quindlen's \nrecent column in Newsweek, Casting the First Stone, captures the heart \nof this current tendency to mix religion and politics into a concoction \nthat some Republican strategists hope will help them at the ballot box. \nI ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, May 31, 2004]\n\n                        Casting the First Stone\n\n                           (By Anna Quindlen)\n\n       It was nearly 25 years ago that Robert Drinan, a member of \n     Congress and an outspoken Jesuit (a redundancy if there ever \n     was one), so enraged the Vatican with his defense of abortion \n     rights that an order came down from Rome demanding priests \n     withdraw from politics.\n       It appears that someone has had a change of heart.\n       Or at least that's how it seems now that certain segments \n     of the Roman Catholic hierarchy are behaving like wholly \n     owned subsidiaries of the Republican Party, hellbent on a \n     course that will weaken the church's moral authority and \n     eventually deplete its membership. And all because of \n     abortion, the issue the celibate male leadership is least \n     equipped to personally understand.\n       To paraphrase a Gospel passage, my Father's house is a \n     house of prayer, but they have made it a den of partisanship. \n     The archbishop of St. Louis announced that if John Kerry, the \n     Democratic candidate, showed up for mass he would be denied \n     communion. After threats from clerics in New Jersey, the pro-\n     choice Democratic governor saved himself the embarrassment of \n     being turned away by saying he would no longer present \n     himself for the sacrament; the Democratic majority leader of \n     the state Senate responded by quitting the church and saying \n     he will likely join the Episcopalians. And in Colorado a \n     bishop went a step further, saying that any Catholic who \n     supports politicians who favor abortion rights, same-sex \n     marriage or stem-cell research should not take communion.\n       Surely the next step is to put ushers at the door each \n     Sunday with a purity checklist. Adulterer? Out. Gay? Out. Tax \n     cheat? Gossip? Condom in your pocket? Out. Out. Out. My, how \n     empty those pews have grown. And the altar, too, where we \n     learned that too many priests had a secret life of sexual \n     abuse. Why were known pedophiles permitted to give communion \n     for years, while people of conscience at odds with Vatican \n     teaching (not church dogma) are prohibited from receiving it? \n     It brings to mind the always topical injunction that it's he \n     who is without sin who gets to cast the first stone.\n       Too many bishops seem to have missed key seminary lessons: \n     the ones on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas that civil \n     and moral law are often two different things, or those on the \n     tradition in Catholic thought that a good law must be \n     enforceable, not a law like one prohibiting abortion that \n     will be so often broken that it leads to disregard for all \n     laws. Too many bishops seem to have forgotten the notion of \n     the individual examination of conscience. Instead they have \n     decided to examine conscience for us, particularly if we are \n     liberal Democrats.\n       Leaders of the church began a schism between pew and pulpit \n     in 1968 with the publication of the encyclical Humanae Vitae. \n     The majority of the members of a papal commission on \n     contraception recommended that the church change its \n     opposition; the minority members won out, mainly because they \n     based their argument on the primacy of the pope. Even then, \n     power politics overrode the well-being of the people.\n       But over time there was an unforeseen result of the \n     encyclical. The use of contraception became the church \n     prohibition millions of Catholics ignored, in part because \n     the directive was so out of step with modern life (as the \n     majority report suggested), in part because the issue was so \n     private. Little by little Catholics made their peace with \n     consulting their conscience instead of Father, especially on \n     intimate issues. The intermediaries became increasingly \n     irrelevant, especially when, in recent years, the full extent \n     of priestly sexual predation became known.\n       These member of the church were derided by conservatives as \n     ``cafeteria Catholics,'' picking and choosing their beliefs. \n     Now we have cafeteria clergy, picking and choosing which \n     prohibitions they emphasize and which politicians they damn. \n     What of the pro-life policies of a living wage or decent \n     housing? The church is opposed to the death penalty, yet no \n     bishop has yet suggested he will deny the sacrament to those \n     who support capital punishment. And sanctions for Democratic \n     candidates have far outnumbered those for Republicans, even \n     Republicans who favor legal abortion. The timing of all this \n     is curious as well. It coincides with that new Catholic holy \n     day, the feast of the first Tuesday in November, known to \n     secularists as Election Day.\n       It is one thing to preach the teachings of the church, \n     quite another to use the centerpiece of the faith selectively \n     as a tool to influence the ballot box, that confessional of \n     democracy. Even a member of Congress opposed to abortion \n     complained that church leaders were ``politicizing the \n     eucharist.'' If citizens who are Methodist, Muslim or Jewish \n     begin to suspect that Catholic politicians are beholden first \n     and foremost to Rome, a notion we thought was laughable and \n     bigoted when John F. Kennedy ran for president, who could \n     blame them? Next month American Catholic bishops meet for a \n     retreat in Colorado. There they should speak out against \n     grievous sin, the sin of using communion to punish by those \n     who have not the moral authority to persuade.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also want to focus briefly on how Republicans continue \nto delay consideration of some Hispanic judicial nominees. For some \ntime the only Hispanic nomination of this President to the first 42 \ncircuit court vacancies was the ill-fated nomination of a young man \nwhose record was kept from the Senate by the Bush administration and \nwho was opposed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, prominent Latino \nleaders of the civil rights community and by many others. This single \nnomination was in sharp contrast to the many Hispanic nominees sent to \nthe Senate by President Clinton. In fact, eight of the Hispanic jurists \nserving on our circuit courts today were named by President Clinton, \nand at least three other Clinton Hispanic circuit nominees would be \nsitting on the bench now if they had not been denied consideration by a \nRepublican-controlled Senate.\n  When Democratic Senators supported the confirmation of Judge Edward \nPrado, President Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit, the Senate Republican leadership delayed consideration \nof that nomination for a month on the floor for no good reason, other \nthan to allow us to vote on this Hispanic nominee would undercut their \nfalse charges that Democrats were anti-Hispanic. Judge Prado had a fair \nrecord, years of experience as a Federal District Court judge, and \nbroad support from both sides of the aisle. Nonetheless, in order to \nget Judge Prado a vote, I had to come before the Senate on a number of \noccasions to urge his consideration because the Republican leadership \nwas delaying final Senate consideration of his nomination.\n  Now the Republican leadership seems to be returning to its earlier \nways and is again passing over Hispanic nominees without explanation. \nLast October, 7 months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably \nreported the nomination of Judge Dora Irizarry of New York to be a \nUnited States District Court Judge for the Eastern District of New \nYork. This was not a nomination without some controversy. The\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\nAmerican Bar Association accorded her a majority rating of ``not \nqualified,'' as it has several of this President's judicial nominees. \nNonetheless, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination. \nThe Members of the Committee examined the nomination on the merits and \nreached their own judgment. With the support of Senator Schumer of New \nYork, the nomination was favorably reported. While Senate consideration \nwill include some brief debate, there is no reason this matter has not \nbeen scheduled and considered in the last seven months. It could easily \nhave been considered during the course of an extended quorum call \nduring any one of the many days when there is no significant business \ntaking place on the Senate floor. As I have reiterated for months, \nthere is no Democratic hold on this nomination. It merits a brief \ndiscussion, but we are prepared to vote on it. Republican delay has \nprevented action on this nomination.\n  I do not recall this lengthy a delay in scheduling debate on a Latina \nnominee since the untoward Republican obstruction of Senate \nconsideration of President Clinton's nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1999. \nThat nomination of an outstanding judge, who had been appointed to the \nfederal bench by President George H.W. Bush, was delayed for more than \n400 days in all and waited 7 months on the Senate floor, before we were \nable to force action and a vote on her confirmation. According to some \naccounts, she was delayed over Republican concerns that she would be \nchosen by President Clinton for the Supreme Court if a vacancy arose.\n  Likewise, the Senate's Republican leadership has not yet scheduled a \nvote on the nomination of Ricardo S. Martinez to be a United States \nDistrict Court Judge for the Western District of Washington or Juan R. \nSanchez to be a United States District Court Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Despite Republican delays in the consideration of President Bush's \nHispanic nominees, the Senate has already confirmed, unanimously, three \nof his Hispanic nominees to the circuit courts and 11 to the district \ncourts. Ms. Herrera will be the 12th Latino district court nominee and \n15th overall confirmed by the Senate.\n  Unfortunately this White House's commitment to diversity seems \nshallow when compared to its devotion to ideological purity. The \nPresident has nominated many more members of the Federalist Society \nthan members of the nation's fastest growing ethnic group. The White \nHouse has sent over the nominations of more than 45 individuals active \nin the Federalist Society, which is more than twice as many Latinos as \nhe has nominated. In fact, the President has chosen more individuals \ninvolved in the Federalist Society than Latinos, African Americans, and \nAsian Americans combined.\n  We have made significant progress over the last three years in \nreducing Federal judicial vacancies. As of today, there are only 43 \ntotal vacancies in the Federal court system. That stands in sharp \ncontrast to the treatment Republicans accorded President Clinton's \nnominees. Indeed, under Republican leadership, from 1995 to the summer \nof 2001 the number of vacancies in the federal courts rose from 63 to \n110. We have now made up that 67 percent increase in vacancies the \nRepublican Senate leadership had engineered between 1995 and 2001, and \nwe have reduced vacancies from the 1995 level by one third, to the \nlowest vacancy level in 14 years. In spite of the way more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees were defeated by Republicans' objections, \nSenate Democrats have cooperated in the consideration and confirmation \nof 180 of this President's judicial nominations.\n  We now have 16 vacancies in the circuit courts. That is the number of \nvacancies that existed when Republicans took majority control of the \nSenate in 1995. Unfortunately, through Republican obstruction of \nmoderate nominations by President Clinton, those circuit vacancies more \nthan doubled, rising to 33 by the time Democrats resumed Senate \nleadership in the summer of 2001. We steadily reduced circuit vacancies \nover the 17 months that Senate Democrats were in charge. Even though \nsince 2001 an additional 15 circuit vacancies have arisen, we have done \nwhat Republicans refused to do when President Clinton was in the White \nHouse by not only keeping up with attrition but actually working to \nreduce vacancies. We have now reduced circuit vacancies to the lowest \nlevel since before Republican Senate leadership irresponsibly doubled \nthose vacancies in the years 1995 through 2001.\n  We should recognize the progress we have made. I certainly recognize \nthe entirely different approach to judicial nominations Republicans \nhave taken with a Republican President's nominations in contrast to \ntheir systematic obstruction of Senate action on President Clinton's \njudicial nominations. I would hope that we will be able to find ways to \nwork together without too much more delay to consider the Hispanic \nnominees to the federal bench who Democrats are supporting.\n  I congratulate Ms. Herrera and her family on her confirmation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Judith C. Herrera, of New Mexico, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of New Mexico?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the support of new nuclear \n  weapons development under the Stockpile Services Advanced Concepts \n     Initiative or for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP))\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3122. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR NEW NUCLEAR \n                   WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT UNDER STOCKPILE SERVICES \n                   ADVANCED CONCEPTS INITIATIVE OR FOR ROBUST \n                   NUCLEAR EARTH PENETRATOR.\n\n       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by section \n     3101(a)(1) for the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     for weapons activities may be obligated or expended for the \n     following:\n       (1) The Stockpile Services Advanced Concepts Initiative for \n     the support of new nuclear weapons development.\n       (2) The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, who \noffered this amendment on a previous occasion, in the Chamber. We have \nworked closely together. Because of the necessities of time, I hope the \nChair will recognize her to make remarks, and then I will try to gain \nrecognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I particularly thank him for being the main sponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment is something about which I feel passion, and the \nreason I do is because the country, of which I am a part, in this bill \nauthorizes the opening of a nuclear door to the development of new \nnuclear weapons.\n  One of the things I realized is Americans forget what a nuclear \nweapon does. Both Senator Kennedy and I were very young teenagers when \nthe first nuclear bomb was dropped. The first nuclear bomb that was \ndropped was 15 kilotons, and it was dropped on Hiroshima. This is what \nHiroshima looked like when that bomb was dropped.\n  Let me show you what a 21-kiloton nuclear bomb did, because that was \nthe second bomb that was dropped, and that was on Nagasaki. In the \ncourse of a year, between the two cities, 200,000 people died--\n200,000--many of them in the most horrible of ways from radiation \nsickness.\n  Radiation is a major problem whenever you look at a new nuclear \nweapon--where it can be contained, how it can be contained, and where \nit cannot be contained.\n  In this bill, there is authorization for a 100-kiloton nuclear bunker \nbuster. In this bill, there is a request for authorization of $9 \nmillion for advanced nuclear weapons concepts which translates into \nstrategic battlefield nuclear weapons under 5 kilotons--battlefield \nnuclear weapons.\n  Let me show you the depth to which a bomb has to penetrate to prevent \nnuclear fallout. If it is two-tenths of a kiloton, it has to go down 70 \nfeet, to 120 feet, and then it throws off 25,000 tons of radioactive \nfallout.\n  If it is 1 kiloton, at 80 feet, it throws up 60,000 tons of \nradioactive fallout and would have to go down to 220 feet not to throw \nout any radioactive fallout. Five kilotons, if it goes down 320 feet, \nit will not throw off radioactive fallout, but at 130 feet, it throws \nout 220,000 tons of radioactive fallout. At 100 kilotons, it would have \nto go down to 800 to 1,000 feet not to throw off any radioactive \nfallout.\n  That is what we are talking about. That is what is authorized in this \nbill: a nuclear bunker buster of 100 kilotons, and there is no known \nway to drive a bomb 800 to 1,000 feet into the earth because there is \nno known casing strong enough to drive that bomb down to that depth.\n  So I ask the question: Why are we doing this? Why are we spending \nwhat over 5 years will be $500 million on this program? And why are we \ndoing it when it is going to encourage the very proliferation \neverything about us wants to prevent?\n  We now know through newspaper articles that India may be looking at \nwhat is called a boutique nuclear weapon, a battlefield nuclear weapon. \nWe lead the way. We do not want other nations to go ahead and develop \nthis, and this country has the most sophisticated conventional military \nin the world.\n  I support this amendment which essentially would eliminate the \nauthorization for the robust nuclear earth penetrator and the advanced \nnuclear weapon concept.\n  I want to point out when this administration came into office, they \nput out a document called the Nuclear Posture Review in 2002. This \nNuclear Posture Review, according to press reports, actually stated the \nUnited States would countenance a first use of nuclear weapons in \ncertain circumstances.\n  This document named seven countries against whom we would consider \nlaunching a nuclear first strike. Those seven countries as listed in \n2002 were North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, China, and Russia. It \nalso proposed a new triad in which nuclear and conventional weapons \ncoexist along the same continuum. This effectively blurs the \ndistinction between nuclear and conventional weapons and suggests that \nthey could be used as an offensive weapon.\n  In addition, the Nuclear Posture Review said we need to develop new \ntypes of weapons so we can use them in a wider variety of circumstances \nand against a wider range of targets, such as hard and deeply buried \ntargets, or to defeat chemical or biological agents.\n  I have now asked Secretary Rumsfeld, as a member of the Defense \nAppropriations Committee 2 years running, about this. The first year he \nsaid this is just a study; that is all. This year a week ago when I \nasked him, he said clearly, with the amount of underground activity \nthat exists in the world, and it is pervasive in country after country \nthat people have tunneled underground--North Korea is a perfect \nexample; certainly Iran is--we have found this in country after \ncountry, and the question is, If that is a problem, what might be done \nabout it. Your first choice would be to find some obviously \nconventional way to do it. They have looked and looked and looked, and \nthis additional way is at least, in my view, worth studying.\n  In addition, the Congressional Research Service says the fiscal year \n2005 budget request seems to cast serious doubt on the assertions that \nthe Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator is only a study because budget \nprojections over the next 5 years is nearly $500 million for this \nprogram. So it is more than a study. It is a real program that is \nunderway. I think it is a huge mistake.\n  I indicated that there is no way today to sink a nuclear weapon \ndeeply enough into the earth to prevent radioactive fallout. Let me \nshow what that fallout would do. This is the predicted radioactive \nfallout from a 300-kiloton explosion in west Pyongyang, North Korea, \nusing historical weather data for the month of May. We see what the \nfallout would be. This makes no sense. We are not going to use a weapon \neither on a battlefield or as a bunker buster that spews out \nradioactive nuclear fallout. Why reopen the nuclear door? Why have \nother nations look at America and say, America is going to do this; \nmaybe we should do it? India, Pakistan, historic enemies, both nuclear \ncapable countries, rumors are that one now is going to develop a \ntactical battlefield nuclear weapon. They see us doing it; therefore, \nit is all right for them to do it.\n  According to press reports, in a Nuclear Posture Review, one of the \ncountries we might consider a first use, North Korea. We then find \nNorth Korea breaks the agreed formula. North Korea is producing a \nnuclear capability. It makes no sense for the strongest military on \nEarth, the most sophisticated conventional military on Earth, to say, \nonce again, we must reopen the nuclear door, and we must begin a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons.\n  The people of California do not want this. I do not think the people \nof any State want that. So I believe very strongly in this amendment. I \nhope to discuss it more on Tuesday. I will do everything in my power to \nfight every way I can the reopening of this nuclear door.\n  The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, and Advanced Concepts Initiative \nare only part of a movement to expand the development of new nuclear\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nweapons. There are also plans to develop a modern pit facility, and \nthat modern pit facility would provide the capacity to create up to 450 \nmore plutonium pits per year. The plutonium pit is the shell which is \neffectively the trigger of a nuclear device which compresses and \ntherefore detonates. That is not necessary to maintain the current \nnuclear numbers that we have. It is only necessary if you are going to \nbuild new nuclear. In addition, last year the Administration urged \nCongress to eliminate the Spratt-Furse provision which for the past 10 \nyears provided that there could be no research, no development, no \nstudy of low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  So the evidence is there that this administration is proceeding along \nthe lines to reopen the nuclear door to develop a new generation of \nnuclear weapons while at the same time preaching to the world, thou \nshalt not; we are opposed to nuclear proliferation. Yet we are willing \nto open that door and proliferate ourselves.\n  In my view, this is hypocrisy. In my view, this is not good public \npolicy. In my view, this is immoral and unethical.\n  I represent a constituency that does not think we need a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons. So this amendment would remove that \nauthorization from the Defense authorization bill, and I stand in \nsupport of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and \nwould like to first reflect on some remarks that would have been \npresented by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nWarner, were he able to be here. Then I will make a couple of comments \non my own as well.\n  He points out that for the past 2 years, the Department of Energy has \nrequested funding or legislation for several nuclear-weapons-related \nactivities, including a feasibility study on the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator and the advanced concepts initiative.\n  These requests generated significant debate in the Congress, both \nlast year and in the previous year. Last year, Congress decided to \nauthorize research and the feasibility studies on advanced concepts and \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator, while ensuring that the Congress \nhas the final say on whether more advanced development activities may \nproceed in the future.\n  So it is strictly up to Congress as to whether we would authorize \nanything in the future, and that has nothing to do with the bill that \nis before us today.\n  Specifically, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2004 prohibits the Department of Energy from proceeding to the \nengineering/development, production or deployment phases of the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator, or a low-yield nuclear weapon, unless \nspecifically authorized by Congress.\n  This is a prudent way to handle a very sensitive issue, which is \ndeserving of the Congress's most careful oversight. I believe we struck \na proper balance which will allow our weapons scientists, engineers, \nand technicians to conduct necessary research and studies to ensure \nthat they maintain the ability to respond to any future military \nrequirements from the Department of Defense.\n  We know rogue nations are increasingly developing hardened and deeply \nburied targets where they can conduct command, control, and \ncommunications operations, operate laboratories to produce and store \nweapons of mass destruction, and engage in other activities.\n  Pursuant to military requirements from the Department of Defense to \naddress hardened and deeply buried targets, the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration is doing a feasibility study to determine \nwhether an existing nuclear weapon can be modified so that it can \ndestroy these hardened targets--I repeat, an existing nuclear weapon, \nnot a new nuclear weapon. The feasibility study is also trying to \ndetermine what collateral damage would result in such an event.\n  The need for validating this capability is well documented over \nseveral preceding administrations. Increased urgency to develop a \ncapability to destroy hardened and deeply buried targets, both \nconventional and nuclear, was identified in the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, also in the Nuclear Posture Review, and the Hard and Deeply \nBuried Target Capstone Report and the HDBT report to the Congress. \nAdvanced penetrators armed with conventional warheads have a very \nlimited capability. They can only address relatively shallow targets \nwhose location is known precisely.\n\n  I would parenthetically note that we also have photographs at the \nvery beginning of the gulf war where we thought we had identified the \nlocation of Saddam Hussein. Very precise weaponry was deployed to try \nto penetrate the bunkers and facilities in which we thought the command \nand control was located. You remember the photographs of the concrete, \nlayer upon layer upon layer, and hardened steel intermeshed with that \nconcrete, none of which, of course, was penetrated enough to destroy \nthe target we wanted to destroy. Only nuclear weapons can address the \ndeeply buried targets that are protected by manmade or even hard \ngeology. Our current nuclear penetrator, the B6-111, is only capable of \npenetrating a few feet of frozen soil and is incapable of attacking \nsuccessfully a growing number of these hardened targets.\n  The feasibility study on the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator is \nfocused on technical issues related to adapting an existing nuclear \nweapon to meet a spectrum of nuclear requirements for hardened and \ndeeply buried targets, including survival through impact and \npenetration of hard geology. While the feasibility study on the Robust \nNuclear Earth Penetrator will allow the Department of Energy to \ndetermine if the capability of destroying the HDBTs is possible, the \ncurrent authorization will not result in a new or modified nuclear \nweapon.\n  Again I want to emphasize that the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor the fiscal year 2004 included a provision requiring a specific \nauthorization from the Congress before the Secretary of Energy can \nproceed to the engineering/development phase or subsequent phase of a \nRobust Nuclear Earth Penetrator or a low-yield nuclear weapon.\n  I support the National Nuclear Security Administration's ability to \ncontinue the feasibility study and the Advanced Concepts Initiative, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, which is, if \nanything, premature because of the points I have just made.\n  I will note in closing that it is possible to show photographs of a \nflattened Tokyo during World War II that was not bombed with a nuclear \nweapon or a burned-out Dresden, Germany. It is possible to show a lot \nof destruction in war caused by either nuclear or conventional weapons. \nBut that is not what we are talking about nor are we talking about \nopening the nuclear door, as was mentioned. No new nuclear weapon is \nenvisioned here. What we are talking about, again, is a feasibility \nstudy to use something we already have to destroy a target.\n  I would answer the question, Why would we want to do this? There are \na lot of intelligence reports we cannot get into on the Senate floor \nthat discuss the propensity for potential enemies of the United States \nto deeply bury what they don't want us to be able to destroy--whether \nit be weapons of mass destruction, production or storage or launch \ncapability facilities or command and control or other kinds of targets \nwe may need to deal with in a time of war. Why would we want to deny \nourselves the ability to destroy those kinds of targets?\n\n  The point was mentioned that Secretary Rumsfeld testified. What did \nhe testify to? That this was worth studying. He never said we were \nproceeding, because the law would prohibit that. That is all he said, \nthat this is worth studying. Indeed it is.\n  Why does the 5-year budget requirement carry out a larger sum of \nmoney? Simply because that is what we require. We say to the DOE: Even \nthough you have a 1-year number here, what would it look like if you \nproceeded 5 years out? And they have to tell us. But that is a \nhypothetical number because we have not authorized anything beyond the \nnumber we are talking about here.\n  The final point. Once we start talking about nuclear weaponry, a lot \nof very extraneous arguments get brought into the picture. I suggest we \nnot go down that road because it is not necessary. It has nothing to do \nwith this debate.\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n  One of the arguments is, why would we want to begin testing nuclear \nweapons when we are trying to convince these other countries such as \nPakistan and India, and so on, not to do so? I remind my colleagues \nthat long after the United States imposed a moratorium on all nuclear \ntesting, it was not just India or Pakistan but the North Koreans who \nwere trying to develop a weapon. The French and the Chinese tested \nweapons after our moratorium was declared. So it is fallacious to say \nif only we would forego any testing of any kind, then the other \ncountries would forego it as well. History shows that is a fallacious \nargument.\n  My point is let's not get into the scary discussion of reopening the \nnuclear window with an amendment that would prohibit us from continuing \nto study something that all of our defense people say we need to \ncontinue to study, and that is whether an existing weapon could be used \nto destroy a target we may need to destroy at some time in the future. \nAs long as Congress has the ultimate say as to whether we would proceed \nwith the development or deployment of the weapon--and we have not done \nthat--it is absolutely not necessary for us to adopt an amendment such \nas this that would cripple us from even looking into the subject. That \nwould be a Luddite position for a country like the United States with \nall of the responsibilities we have to take.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment when we have the \nopportunity to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to join with my \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from California, offering this \namendment with my other colleagues.\n  Just to summarize very briefly, the development of these nuclear \nweapons signals a dangerous direction in our nuclear policy. It weakens \nour ability to ask other countries to give up their nuclear programs. \nIf we build these nuclear weapons, the costs are clear. No one will \nbelieve we are serious about nuclear nonproliferation. Developing new \nnuclear weapons sends a mixed message that undermines all of our calls \nfor nonproliferation. When we criticize Iran and North Korea for their \nnuclear weapons development, they point back to ours.\n  There is little doubt that we would be starting a new arms race. \nAlthough it is too soon to tell who will follow suit, few developments \nin the quantity or quality of nuclear weapons have gone unmatched by \nother powers. To start a costly new arms race for these weapons of \nlittle utility is, I believe, a mistake.\n  At the same time, the benefits are not clear. Opponents will just \nbuild deeper bunkers, out of the range of new weapons. We will build \nweapons with deeper range and our enemies will again build deeper \nbunkers.\n  But even more compelling is the fact that conventional weapons will \ndo the job against deeply buried targets. All bunkers must have air \nintakes, energy sources, and entries; and secure those through \nconventional means and you have essentially secured the bunker, making \nthese new nuclear weapons programs effectively useless.\n  In the end, the Department of Energy would like us to buy something \nthat we do not need, that we will never use, that endangers us by its \nmere existence, and that makes our important diplomatic goals much more \ndifficult to achieve.\n  I hope we will have the acceptance of our amendment.\n  Mr. President, having outlined what I believe to be the principal \nreasons for the amendment, I am going to take a few moments to go into \nsome detail now about what is at risk.\n  As I mentioned, we are on the threshold of a new nuclear arms race. \nInstead of curbing the spread and the development of nuclear arms, the \nBush administration wants us to build a new generation of nuclear \nweapons. I believe this is a dangerous and reckless policy that will \nput Americans at even greater risk in an increasingly dangerous world.\n  The nuclear weapons the administration is developing go by such terms \nas ``mini-nukes'' and ``bunker busters.'' They may not possess the \nyield of the nuclear warheads of the cold war era, but a mushroom cloud \nis still a mushroom cloud. They can still cause monumental destruction, \nmassive casualties, and long-term environmental damage to entire \nregions of the world. They will encourage other countries to follow our \nexample and produce a new generation of nuclear weapons of their own. \nTheir existence makes it even more likely that nuclear weapons could \nfall into the hands of terrorists.\n  On issue after issue, the Bush administration has arrogantly \nabandoned cooperation of the allies in favor of ``my way or the \nhighway'' policies that alienate us from the world, from its rejection \nof the Kyoto Treaty against global warming to misguided occupation of \nIraq. This administration's policies have made the world more dangerous \nfor Americans, and the development of a new generation of nuclear arms \nis another such policy. These nuclear weapons programs must be stopped.\n  The administration requested a total of $34.2 million for the \ndevelopment of these new nuclear weapons. Our amendment would stop this \nmoney from going toward these new nuclear weapons and would direct the \nmoney toward other priorities such as increasing the safety of our \nexisting stockpile, or environmental cleanup of nuclear materials.\n  The administration's funding request for these programs is a \ncontinuation of the dangerous new direction this administration is \ntaking in our nuclear weapons policy.\n  The administration's Nuclear Posture Review acknowledged this, \nstating it ``puts in motion a major change in our approach to the role \nof nuclear''--this is in the Nuclear Posture Review, 8 January 2002. \nBuilding on the QDR--the overall review of our defense capability--the \nNuclear Posture Review ``puts in motion a major change in our approach \nto the role of nuclear offensive forces in our deterrent strategy and \npresents the blueprint for transforming our strategic posture.''\n  Why? Because the administration intends to go ahead not only in the \nresearch but in the development of these weapons systems. We will hear \nfrom the other side: ``Oh, no, we aren't, Senator.'' All you have to do \nis look in the legislation itself. There it is on page 378--the \nlimitation of availability of funds for advanced nuclear weapons \nconcept limitation. Under the funds authorized to be appropriated this \nyear, they may be obligated or expended for the purpose of additional \nor exploratory studies under an advanced nuclear weapons concept \ninitiative until 30 days after the date on which the Administrator for \nNuclear Security submits to the congressional defense committees a \ndetailed report on the activities for such studies on the initiatives \nthat are planned for 2005.\n  There it is. Is that what the administration and is that what the \nSenate is relying on to say they are going to have to come back here \nfor another action in terms of the development and the testing of \nnuclear weapons?\n  Look at what the language says--until 30 days after the date on which \na report goes to the committee. They can go ahead.\n  Let us see what they are intending. This is a pass. Those who rely on \nthat language said, ``Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, we have \neffectively addressed your needs.'' They cannot go ahead in terms of \ndevelopment or testing because we have language in there to prohibit \nit.\n\n  That is not accurate. That is not accurate. I have read the operative \nlanguage in the Defense authorization bill for this year's funding. \nThey can do anything they want after they give notification. That isn't \nany prohibition for this year.\n  We can ask, What do they mean? What do they intend?\n  Let us look at what Linton Brooks, Administrator of the National \nNuclear Security Administration, says. He is the top person on nuclear \nweapons. He says on December 5, 2003: ``On behalf of the \nadministration, I would like to thank you''--\n  This was a memoranda to the directors of some of the laboratories. I \nwill include the page in the Record.\n  ``On behalf of the administration, I would like to thank you and your \nstaff for helping us to support this important effort. We are now free \nto explore a range of technical options.''\n  This is after Congress repealed the amendment which prohibited mini-\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\nnukes. That was in the law. And the last Congress repealed that action. \nHere is the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration:\n  ``We are now free to explore a range of technical options. We should \nnot fail to take advantage of this opportunity.''\n  Look what else Linton Brooks said:\n  ``I have a bias in favor of things that might be usable. I think \nthat's just an inherent part of deterrence. If it is usable, they can \nbe developed, and we ought to use it.''\n  You can ask, How do we know the administration is serious in pursuing \nthe bunker buster? How do we know that? All we have to do is look at \nthe 5-year budget the administration has submitted.\n  As it moves on through in the development of the bunker buster, you \nwill find as it increases--it has a total appropriations for this whole \nproject of some $484 million over the next 5 years. For studies? For \ntechnical research? That is for the robust nuclear penetrator. Research \nis $484 million and $82 million for the small nuke. If you look in \ntheir budget, that is what it has.\n  Look in the details of what they expect each year. And when you come \nto 2007, you will find it is planning development in 2007. It has the \ntechnical language.\n  If I am wrong, I hope those on the other side will correct me. If \nthis language does not mean development, correct me. If applicable, \nRNEP will move to level 6.3 authority, given the appropriate \nauthorization--that means effectively the development in 2007 and the \ntesting in 2009. It is in the 5-year program. This is what they are \nintending to do. That is why this amendment is so important.\n  It is very clear what the intention of the budget proposal is from \nthe statement of the key administration officials who are dealing with \nthe development of nuclear weapons and by the statement of the Nuclear \nPosture Review in and of itself. That is the direction we are going.\n  We believe we should say we are not going to go in this direction. We \ndo not want to have another nuclear arms race.\n  One of the great successes of Democratic and Republican Presidents \nover the period since the end of World War II was being able to contain \nthe nuclear arms race. We came dangerously close during the Cuban \nmissile crisis of a nuclear exchange. But we have been able to avoid \nit, and we have seen progress made with the different arms control \nagreements which have been signed and supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  Why in the world, when we are trying to contain the nuclear \ncapability of North Korea and Iran, are we going out and beginning to \nhave another nuclear arms race when we have the most feared military in \nthe world right now? That is the argument that must be addressed on the \nother side to those who want to support this particular program.\n  Development of these nuclear weapons is part of that ill-advised \ntransformation. It returns us to the dangerous dynamics of the world \nwhen our nuclear scientists competed with our rivals to develop the \nlatest technology, our arsenals were on highest alert, and we were only \nminutes away from nuclear attack.\n  The administration's nuclear posture review directs the Department of \nDefense to look into the possible modification to existing weapons to \nprovide additional yield flexibility in the stockpile and improve the \nearth-penetrating weapons to counter the increased use of potential \nadversaries of hardened and deeply buried facilities, referring to the \nbunker buster. In addition, the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories \nwere to look into the weapons that reduce collateral damage, the so-\ncalled mini-nukes.\n  Last year, the House Energy and Water Subcommittee raised serious \nconcerns about our Nation's nuclear weapons program. They had extensive \nhearings on this. The Department of Energy is proposing, and this is \ntheir conclusion of the House committee report:\n\n       The Department [of Energy] is proposing to rebuild, \n     restart, and redo and otherwise exercise every capability \n     that was used over the last forty years of the Cold War and \n     at the same time prepare for a future with an expanded \n     mission for nuclear weapons.\n\n  That is what the Republican House committee concluded, after \nextensive hearings on this particular issue. The House Energy and Water \nSubcommittee thought the pursuit of a broad range of new initiatives \nwas premature until the Department of Energy could demonstrate that it \ncould adequately care for the nuclear weapons we already have, which \nmakes sense.\n  The committee cut the funding for the mini-nukes program, refusing to \n``support redirecting the management resources and attention to a \nseries of new initiatives.''\n  Chairman Hobson's criticisms ring just as true today. Our amendment \nwould similarly cut the funding for new nuclear weapons programs.\n  The President's budget for fiscal year 2005 contains $9 million for \nthe Advanced Concepts Initiative, which funds research into the \nprograms. This is an increase of 50 percent from last year's level of \n$6 million.\n  The low-yield nuclear weapons are nuclear weapons with a yield up to \n5 kilotons. But these mininukes are very deadly. A 5-kiloton bomb is \nhalf the size of the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima, capable of killing \nhundreds of thousands of people and making the target radioactive for \ndecades to come.\n  Based on questions about their battlefield utility, Congress banned \nthe research and development of these weapons for over 10 years. As \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the first gulf war, Colin \nPowell asked for a review of options for using tactical nuclear weapons \non the battlefield. He rejected all of them. Colin Powell rejected all \nof them because he concluded they have no usefulness on the \nbattlefield.\n  Unfortunately, last year, at the administration's request, Congress \nrepealed the ban and allowed research into these weapons to go forward. \nI disagreed with that action and joined with my colleague from \nCalifornia in an amendment to retain the ban. Many supported repealing \nthe ban because they believed the administration would not field these \nnew weapons. This is simply not true.\n  The administrator's nuclear weapons chief, Linton Brooks, says, as I \nmentioned: ``I have a bias in favor of the lowest useable yield because \nI have a bias in favor of . . . things that might be useable.''\n\n  That is a clear intention of what a leading person for the \nadministration believes and feels about the usability of small nuclear \nweapons.\n  The administration wants these weapons because it believes our \nexisting nuclear weapons are too large to be used. It wants to develop \na generation of more useable nuclear weapons. In creating a more \nuseable nuclear weapon, the administration is making it more likely \nthat the United States would use such a weapon, increasing the risks of \nescalation and nuclear war.\n  This chart shows a detonation outside of Damascus. This would be a 5-\nkiloton bomb that was detonated in a hypothetical bunker in the Middle \nEast, in Damascus, on a typical day. Over half a million people would \nbe wounded or killed from such explosion, and the fallout pattern would \nextend from Damascus into the Mediterranean Sea. The detonation of even \na 1-kiloton nuclear weapon at a depth of less than 50 feet will create \na crater larger than the World Trade Center and spew a million cubic \nfeet of radioactive dust into the atmosphere.\n  According to Michael May, the former Director of Lawrence Livermore \nNuclear Laboratory, one of our premier research labs, ``Scientists say \neven a low-yield nuclear strike on a bio-warfare storage bunker will \ndig a large, hot crater and blast a witches's brew of weaponized germs \nand radioactive fallout into the air.''\n  This next chart gives some idea about what that might look like. We \ncan realize the size of the hole only if we can see the observation \npost that allegedly can hold 20 people. They are right on the edge of \nthat very substantial crater for the 1-kiloton bomb, with the thousands \nof tons of radioactive material which comes from that.\n  For those who argue that the advanced weapons concepts program is \nnecessary to preserve the intellectual base of nuclear weapons \nscientists, one\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nof the prime reasons being recommended before our committee is because \nwe want to keep occupied our nuclear scientists so they will be \nenergized in their work.\n  This amendment would not stifle their ability to study nuclear \nweapons. There is plenty of work to be done on stockpile security, on \nthe nuclear weapons capability of other nations. This amendment would \nleave the money available for research in the nuclear weapons field but \nwould prevent it from being spent on nuclear weapons research.\n  The robust nuclear earth-penetrator, the so-called bunker buster, is \na nuclear weapon that will burrow into the ground 10 to 50 feet before \ndetonating. The administration is currently studying the feasibility of \nputting existing nuclear weapons with yields up to 300 kilotons into an \nearth-penetrating casing. The bunker buster is designed to strike \ndeeply buried, hardened bunkers, which could be fortified below 100 to \n300 feet of concrete.\n  Earth-penetrating weapons would spray millions of tons of radioactive \nwaste into the atmosphere, creating a plume of deadly fallout, \naccording to nuclear physicists.\n  Robert Peurifoy, the retired vice president of Sandia National \nLaboratories, another premier nuclear weapons laboratory, had this to \nsay:\n  ``If you can find somebody in a uniform in the Defense Department who \ncan talk about the need for nuclear bunker busters without laughing, \nI'll buy him a cup of coffee. It's outlandish. It's stupid. It is an \neffort to maintain a payroll at the weapons labs.''\n  Opponents will argue that we are simply funding a study, that there \nis no intent to go any further. But last year Fred Celec, former Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters in the Bush \nadministration, was asked about these bunker busters and he stated that \nif a hydrogen bomb can be successfully designed to survive a crash \nthrough hard rock or concrete and still explode, ``it will ultimately \nget fielded.''\n  In May 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld said the bunker buster ``is a study. \nIt is nothing more and nothing less.'' This study was planned to cost \n$15 million for fiscal years 2003 to 2005. In fiscal year 2004, based \non concerns about the program, Congress cut the appropriations to $7.5 \nmillion. But this year, the President's fiscal year 2005 budget request \nchallenged that and the administration requested $27.6 million for the \nstudy and revealed that it planned to spend $485 million over the next \n5 years.\n  Surely an investment of that magnitude is not just a study but a \nquantum leap towards deployment of this dangerous weapon. In fact, in \nthat plan the administration stated its intent to move in a development \nstage.\n  Whatever their size, current deployed nuclear weapons must be \ndetonated close to the ground in order to kill chemical or biological \nagents, creating a great deal of nuclear fallout. If the detonation is \nunderground, all the debris becomes radioactive and disperses through \nthe air. Fallout can be reduced by detonating the weapons at a higher \naltitude, but that reduces their effectiveness against chemical or \nbiological weapons.\n  Bunker busters require pinpoint accuracy to hit deeply buried, \nhardened bunkers that may contain chemical or biological weapons. They \nrequire precise intelligence on the location of the target because even \nan enhanced radiation weapon has a very short range of effectiveness to \nneutralize a biological agent. If the bomb is even slightly off target, \nthe detonation may cause the spread of chemical bioagents in addition \nto the radioactive fallout instead of vaporizing the agent.\n  In fact, the administration's own Nuclear Posture Review acknowledges \nthat ``significant capability shortfalls currently exist in: finding \nand tracking mobile relocatable targets and WMD sites'' as well as \n``locating, identifying, and characterizing hard and deeply buried \ntargets.''\n  Given our current failure to locate WMD in Iraq, do we have \nsufficient confidence to drop a nuclear bomb on a suspected hardened, \ndeeply buried bunker? According to noted Stanford physicist Sidney \nDrell, the blast effects of such a weapon ``extend beyond the area of \nvery high temperatures and radiation they create for destroying such \nagents.'' The consequences of using such a weapon extend far beyond the \nlimited area of a suspected bunker.\n  In the months leading up to the war in Iraq, the administration \nrefused to rule out--isn't this interesting--in the months leading up \nto the war in Iraq, the administration refused to rule out the use of \nnuclear weapons. If we had mininukes last spring, would we have used \nthem against suspected chemical or biological bunkers, bunkers which \nturned out not to have existed?\n  Using a low-yield nuclear weapon against a suspected bunker around \nBaghdad could have killed a half a million people or more. Imagine the \ngeometric increase in the resentment of the Iraqi people to our \noccupation, what it would have been had we done so.\n  Couple the administration's interest in these weapons with its newly \ndeclared preventive war doctrine and we face the potential of a nuclear \nfirst strike against a nonnuclear nation. This would violate our \nobligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Use of a nuclear \nweapon against a country preemptively would instantly transform America \nfrom the great beacon of hope in the world to a pariah.\n  So, as I mentioned, the development of these new weapons signals a \ndangerous direction in our nuclear policy. It weakens our ability to \nask other countries to give up their nuclear programs. And the costs \nare clear. No one will believe we are serious about nuclear \nnonproliferation. Developing the new nuclear weapon sends a mixed \nmessage that undermines all of our calls for nonproliferation. When we \ncriticize Iran and North Korea for their nuclear weapons development, \nthey point back to ours. There is little doubt that we would be \nstarting a new arms race. Though it is too soon to tell who will follow \nsuit, few developments in the quantity or quality of nuclear weapons \nhave gone unmatched by other powers. To start an arms race with these \nweapons of little utility is a mistake.\n  Opponents, as mentioned, will just build deeper bunkers, but even \nmore compelling is the fact that conventional weapons will do the job \nagainst deeply buried targets. We have not heard on the Armed Services \nCommittee testimony that we do not have the capacity or capability to \ndeal with the deep bunkers with conventional weapons today. I will wait \nfor those who are opposed to this amendment to justify that position.\n  So this is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. The \nmaterials I mentioned are here on my desk. It is quite clear the \ndirection this administration is intending to go. It is clear not only \nfrom the statements of those who have the prime responsibility for the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, it is clear in their statement for \ntheir 5-year proposal. You cannot read that proposal and not see where \nthey are looking for development and testing. It is all out there for \neveryone to see.\n  For those to suggest on the floor of the Senate that under the \nexisting Defense authorization bill we have effectively prohibited that \nkind of conduct in terms of the testing and the development defies the \nlanguage I have read previously. The only hindrance would be the fact \nthat the Department of Defense is required to send studies here to the \nappropriate Defense committees and then, after 30 days, is free this \nyear to take whatever action they want. That is not the way for us to \nmove into another nuclear arms race. That is what this amendment is \nmeant to address. That is why I hope it will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me compliment the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I fully intend to support this amendment. I have spoken \nabout this issue on the Senate floor previously. It is in my judgment \nthat job one for this country is to attempt to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons around the rest of the world, to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, to make certain the nuclear weapons \nthat do exist are protected and safeguarded, and then for this country \nto lead in this world to try to reduce the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons.\n  But for this country to be talking about building new nuclear \nweapons,\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nearth-penetrating, bunker-buster nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear \nweapons, and have people in this administration talk about nuclear \nweapons as if they are just another weapon to be used in a war--drop a \nnuke on a cave someplace; just another weapon, that is what they are \ntalking about--that this country should be wanting to build more, it is \nabsurd.\n  There are roughly 30,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth. The stealing \nof one of those weapons or the acquisition of one by terrorist groups \nwould cause an apoplectic seizure for people who live in the major \ncities of this country that would be targeted by the detonation of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Our job is not to be talking about building new nuclear weapons. \nThere are plenty of nuclear weapons on this Earth--far too many, in \nfact. Our job is to be a world leader in stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons and to find ways to reduce the stockpile of existing nuclear \nweapons. That is the way we create a safer world, not talking about \nbuilding more, not talking about resuming testing, not talking about \nbunker buster, earth penetrators, low-yield, usable nuclear weapons. \nThat is, in my judgment, reckless talk. I intend to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be offering an amendment to this Defense \nauthorization bill dealing with the White House plan to use a military \naircraft to broadcast Television Marti to the Cuban people. I want to \ntalk about that just for a moment.\n  It is almost unbelievable. When someone listens to the logic of all \nof this, they would say: Are you nuts? Is no one thinking at all about \nthis?\n  Cuba, as we know, is a Communist government, run by Fidel Castro. He, \nI think, has lived now through 10 American Presidencies, with an \nembargo on the country of Cuba through 40-some years.\n  So we want to convince the Cubans that Fidel Castro is a bad deal for \nthem. Well, I have been to Cuba. I do not think they need much \nconvincing. They understand. They do not live in a free country. They \nunderstand that they live under the yoke of a Communist government. \nThey would love to come to this country. If we had no immigration laws \nand Castro let them go, we would have an exodus to this country. So \nthey do not need a great deal of convincing. But, nonetheless, we spend \na lot of money on Television and Radio Marti.\n  So Radio Marti actually gets into Cuba, and people listen to it. I \nhave been to Cuba. The dissidents and others in Cuba indicated that \nRadio Marti is effective, although they can also pick up the radio \nstations from Miami easily. All those commercial stations are available \nto be listened to by the folks in Cuba.\n\n  I support Radio Marti. It is fine with me. It gets into the Cuban \nbroadcast range, the Cuban people listen to it, and I have been told by \nthe Cubans in Cuba that it is effective. But TV Marti, broadcasting \ntelevision signals into Cuba, let me talk about that for a moment.\n  All those television signals are blocked so the Cuban people can't \nsee it. We broadcast it. I want to show you what we have been doing \nwith the taxpayers' money. This is a picture of something called Fat \nAlbert. It is a tethered dirigible or balloon that goes up, and using \nFat Albert we send television signals at Cuba. Traditionally, we have \ndone it from 3 until 7 in the morning. We broadcast 4 hours a day \nthrough Fat Albert. The Cuban Government blocks the signal. So we spend \nthe money for nothing. We have a balloon-enhanced signal to Cuba and \nnobody can see the image.\n  In fact, here is how the television screen in Cuba looks. As you see, \nit is a scrambled screen. There is no TV picture.\n  The President announced recently that he is going to get much more \naggressive on TV Marti. One would think if what we are doing is a \ncolossal, tragic, complete, thorough waste of taxpayers' funds, you \nwould stop it. No, not us, not now, not with Cuba. We want to spend \nmore money. The President says it doesn't matter that they can't see \nit. It doesn't matter that it doesn't work. What we want to do is phase \nout these balloons because they are old. What we want to do is take an \nEC-130 special operations aircraft, under the control of the Department \nof Defense, and use it to transmit TV Marti broadcasts to Cuba. The \nbroadcasts may well still be jammed, and the Cuban people still won't \nbe able to see them. But the President and the White House are talking \nabout $18 million to be able to send these television messages into \nCuba that the Cubans can't see.\n  We have spent $180 million on TV Marti since 1989, $180 million on \nbroadcast signals the Cubans haven't seen. One wonders if there is any \ndepth to which foolishness will move in this Chamber, if we continue to \ndo this. Is there anything that is beyond the pale? We just want to \nkeep doing this? In fact, we want to get rid of the balloon, and we can \nput this aircraft up, run by a military special operations unit.\n  There are only six of these aircraft in the world. They are \nextraordinarily valuable in the Middle East. We have used these \nairplanes to great value in the Middle East. They broadcast important \nmessages to support U.S. military operations in places like Afghanistan \nand Iraq. But they will not be used to great value in Cuba.\n  So if something doesn't work, the President and the White House \nannounce we want to do more of it, and do it with more sophisticated \nequipment.\n  We want to divert this aircraft from missions in war theaters--\nAfghanistan, Iraq--and see if it can replace Fat Albert; put it up in \nthe air and push television signals out the carcass of this airplane \nthat the Cuban people probably cannot see or receive.\n  It is unbelievable to me that the White House is pushing this \nnonsense. I am going to offer an amendment that will say we will \nprohibit the use of EC-130 special operations aircraft and other \naircraft for transmission of TV Marti broadcasts to Cuba or radio \nbroadcasts to Cuba. We already get the radio broadcasts in. We don't \nneed to do it with special operations aircraft. Having a special \noperations aircraft available probably will not get TV signals in \neffectively.\n  My point is, why waste the money? We were told yesterday that we are \nshort of money for DOD. We were told we should have a $25 billion \nreserve fund. This Congress voted for it without a dissenting vote. \nWhy? Because we are short of money. We need it, so the Congress \nprovided it. Do we want to use scarce resources for flying a special \nops airplane, of which there are only six in the entire world, so that \nwe can send signals that will be jammed by Fidel Castro?\n\n  I don't have any use for Fidel Castro. I want the Cuban people to be \nfree. But I want the American people to be free from this nonsense. \nThese are taxpayers' moneys that come from the pocketbooks of the \nAmerican people, and they ought not be wasted. This is a tragic waste \nof the taxpayers' money.\n  While I am at it, let me make one more point. We have folks who are \nin the Treasury Department in an organization called OFAC, Office of \nForeign Assets Control. Their job is to track terrorist funds, the \nfunds that support terrorists groups. Down at the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, they have 21 people tracking American tourists who \ntravel to Cuba. And they have fewer than four who are tracking assets \nthat are supporting Osama bin Laden. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Recently I brought a picture of a woman named Joanie Scott to the \nSenate floor, a wonderful young woman who came to see me. She went to \nCuba to distribute free Bibles. But she found out those fearless \nwarriors in OFAC were not tracking Osama bin Laden. They were tracking \nJoanie Scott who was distributing free Bibles to the people of Cuba and \nslapping her with a $10,000 civil fine.\n  And it is not just Joanie Scott. It is a whole series of others, such \nas a man whose father died, and his last wish was that his ashes be \nburied at the church in which he ministered in Cuba. His son takes them \nthere, and OFAC, instead of tracking Osama bin Laden's funding, is \ngoing after this guy with a civil fine for taking his dead father's \nashes to bury them in Cuba. That is the kind of nonsense that is going \non. It has nothing to do with sound public policy. It has everything to \ndo with politics in Florida. This administration is playing it like a \nviolin.\n  The fact is, this ought to stop. I will support the Defense \nauthorization bill, but I hope my colleagues will agree\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nwith me that diverting money from the Defense Department to put up a \nspecial operations EC-130 to broadcast television signals to the Cuban \npeople who probably won't be able to see it is a waste of taxpayers' \nmoney, and it ought to stop.\n\n\n                          Regulatory Agencies\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I read in the paper a story that reminded \nme that we have some real problems with respect to regulatory agencies \nthese days. I happen to think there is a significant role for effective \nregulation in government, especially in areas where you have monopolies \nor the potential of abuse of consumers and citizens. That is why you \nhave regulatory authorities, and there is a requirement for them to \nregulate effectively.\n  I noticed in the paper that ``SEC Seeks Psychologist to Boost \nMorale.'' It says:\n\n       Some former SEC officials find the idea of an SEC \n     psychologist laughable.\n\n  This is a full-time position that will pay $147,000 a year, and they \nwant to improve employee attitudes and job satisfaction, reduce \nburnout, conflict, and stress by hiring a psychologist.\n  I don't doubt there is plenty of need for psychologists in \nWashington, DC.\n  This came on the heels of a report in the newspaper about the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs sending a number of employees to Tony Robbins' \nmotivational course in Chicago, IL, at a cost of tens of thousands of \ndollars. At a time when we don't have enough money to fund health care \nneeds for Indian children, to fund Indian tribal colleges, to deal with \nthe social service needs of most of these children on Indian \nreservations, we are sending people off to the Tony Robbins \nmotivational course in Chicago, spending a small fortune.\n  As I was thinking about these things, which seemed to me to be a \nwaste of the taxpayers' money, I was thinking about the issue of \nregulation.\n  Last evening, I saw the CBS report about what had happened in \nCalifornia with electricity prices. I held hearings and I chaired the \nsubcommittee in Commerce holding hearings on the issue of the fleecing \nof west coast consumers who were paying prices for electricity that \nwere outrageous a couple of years ago. We subpoenaed Kenneth Lay, \nformer head of Enron. He came in and took the fifth amendment in front \nof our committee. We had Jeffrey Skilling. He actually testified. He is \nnow under indictment. I was thinking about this issue of regulation, \nwhen I read last evening the transcript of Enron employees talking \nabout going ahead and shutting down the electric plant.\n  That way, you have less supply of electricity out there. You inflate \nthe price and we can maximize profits, manipulate the supply in order \nto maximize profits. They say: Well, all the money you guys stole from \nthose poor grandmothers. The other guy says: Yes, Grandma Millie, \nthat's Grandma Millie.\n  They laughed about stealing money from people by manipulating and \nshutting down electric plants. This all happened while we had the FERC, \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission--people who are paid by the \ntaxpayers who are supposed to regulate--sat on their hands; they did \ntheir imitation of a potted plant and did absolutely nothing.\n  One might ask consumers on the west coast about the $5 billion to $10 \nbillion that was stolen from them by manipulating supply and demand and \nthe inflating of prices by cartels, by traders who created schemes \nnamed ``get shorty,'' ``fat boy,'' ``death star,'' and ``load shift.''\n  These are organizations--and there is more than one--that, in my \njudgment, stole billions of dollars. Yes, there are some indictments, \nbut some are still living in their gated communities and counting that \nmoney.\n  The Federal regulatory agency here, called FERC, did the American \npublic an enormous disservice by deciding their job wasn't to regulate, \nit was to observe. If a regulatory agency is not going to regulate in \ncases where you have the stealing of billions of dollars, then we don't \nneed that agency at all. We ought to dissolve it and create one that \nwill work.\n  Here is another regulatory agency, the Federal Communications \nCommission. They are not regulating, either. They are content to just \nobserve. They just came up with new rules on broadcast ownership. They \nsaid, oh, by the way, it will be all right with us if, in one major \ncity in this country, the same company owns eight radio stations, three \ntelevision stations, the cable company, and the major newspaper. That \nwill be fine. That is what the FCC said.\n  You talk about abridging the rights of people in this country. This \nis a decision that means a handful of people--fewer and fewer people--\nwill decide what the American people see, hear, and read in the future. \nHundreds and hundreds of thousands of people wrote to the FCC \ncomplaining about the proposed rule. It didn't matter a bit. They went \nahead and adopted it anyway. This is not a regulatory agency. At least \nthey are not representing the interests of the American people. It is \nwhat the big interests want; let us move in that direction. It is what \nthe big and powerful interests want--that is what we will do. That is \ntrue with FERC, with the FCC, the Surface Transportation Board, STB, \nand the SEC.\n  The Surface Transportation Board took the place of the Interstate \nCommerce Commission, the ICC, which I always thought was dead from the \nneck up. We replaced it with something called the STB. It doesn't \nmatter. They are supposed to look after the railroads and make sure \nconsumers are not cheated.\n  In North Dakota, we are overpaying rail rates by $100 million. Does \nthe STB care about that? They don't give a whip. They are supposed to \nregulate and they are content to sit on their hands and observe. I met \nwith them yesterday; same old story.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission wants to hire a psychologist \nbecause of employee stress. It is interesting to me that the investment \nbanking firms were investigated in this country and reached a \nsettlement because they internally, some of them, were trying to sell \nstocks to the public that internally they called dogs. They said, we \nhave these stocks that are real dogs, not worth anything, but let's \nmarket them to the public. They had sales people trying to sell the \nstocks that they described as dogs. Do you know who uncovered all that \ndouble dealing going on, the basic conflicts of interest? Was it the \nSEC, the ones that have hundreds of lawyers who are supposed to be \ndoing this? No, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which wants to \nhire a psychologist because they have such stress on their jobs, didn't \ndo a thing. It was the attorney general of New York State.\n\n  How about the scandal with the mutual funds? Was that the SEC, the \norganization that is so stressed out they want to hire a psychologist \nfor employees? Unfortunately not. They were busy observing. The first \nChairman under this administration said it would be a kinder and \ngentler SEC, we are probusiness. That is the message he wanted to send.\n  Well, that is certainly true. They have done nothing. It was Elliot \nSpitzer, the attorney general of New York, who unearthed both of those \nscandals. So much for the SEC, and so much for job stress for people \nwho don't do anything.\n  The FDA is supposed to regulate as well. They seem content to \nrepresent the pharmaceutical industry. They have spent their time in \nrecent months trying to prevent the Congress from providing for the \nreimportation of FDA-approved drugs from Canada. Why? Beats me. When \nthe question is asked, whose side are you on, they come down on the \nside of the pharmaceutical industry, not the consumer.\n  We are trying to put downward pressure on prescription drug prices. \nThey are in the wrong corner. I don't need to mention much about the \nFTC. When gas prices are $2.10 or $2.20 a gallon, you would hope to \nhave an agency like the FTC that would be aggressive and active, and \nthat you would see a cloud of dust from an investigating agency trying \nto find out what is happening. We know some of what is happening. There \nis a lot of trading and speculation going on, and a great deal of \nconcern that consumers are being taken advantage of. Do we see much \nactivity out of the Federal Trade Commission? Not much going on there, \neither. It is a great place to nap, apparently.\n  There is a good reason, it seems to me, for us to start asking: Is \nthere not a requirement for a regulatory authority that regulates? I \nknow this notion\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\nof deregulation is wonderful. But if you deregulate in the face of \nmonopolies, the American people, in my judgment, are going to be \ninjured severely. Ask people in California, Oregon, and Washington, who \npaid sky-high rates for electricity, about the need for effective \nregulation. Why did they pay those rates? Because a company such as \nEnron, and others, I might add, got involved and found ways to cheat. \nThey created schemes, such as ``get shorty,'' ``fat boy,'' ``death \nstar,'' and others, by which they could cheat the ratepayers, the \nconsumers. I think there is a time when you need effective regulation.\n  Going back to one more point, I mentioned all of these agencies--the \nSEC, FDA, Federal Communications Commission, Surface Transportation \nBoard, and others. They are all there for a purpose. If they are not \nserving that purpose, maybe we don't need them at all. It is a purpose, \nhowever, that I embrace.\n  I believe the American people deserve someone who fights for them. \nWhen the railroad overcharges somebody, in my judgment, they ought to \nbe able to file a complaint and find due process in a regulatory body \nthat is not on the railroad's side, or that automatically decides for \nthe railroads, but in a way that fairly and effectively deals with \nthose complaints.\n  When the FCC is looking at what the impact is of the concentration of \nbroadcast properties, I hope they will not come up with the conclusion \nthat it is not a problem for the consumers if one company owns eight \nradio stations, three television stations, the newspaper, and the cable \ncompany in the same town.\n  I do not know what school you go to learn that sort of nonsense, but \nthat is not the right thing for this country.\n  Incidentally, on that subject, the Senate agrees with the position I \nhave articulated. We voted on this issue and by a wide margin the \nSenate voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's rules \non broadcast ownership, but it is not going anyplace because the \nleaders in the House of Representatives are blocking that resolution.\n  My hope is as we proceed through this year and work on appropriations \nissues we might be able to address some of these issues with regulatory \nagencies. If we are going to have regulatory agencies--and I think we \nshould in a good many areas; I do not think they need psychologists, \nthey need leadership--they need an administration that says: Your job \nat the FCC, FDA, FERC, and others is to effectively represent the \ninterests of the American people, and when you have big interests \nconfronting small interests, you need to be the fair referee here, the \none that evens the score a bit.\n  I mentioned many times the refrain in Bob Wills and the Texas \nPlayboys song from the 1930s, but it applies pretty well:\n\n       Little bee sucks the blossom and the big bee gets the \n     honey.\n       The little guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets the \n     money.\n\n  With respect to Government, there ought to be a mechanism that \nprovides protection for the smaller interests when confronted by the \nlarger interests that want to take advantage of it. What happened on \nthe west coast should never have happened with respect to electric \ngrids because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have \nstepped in immediately, but they would not; they did not. The \nPresident, in fact, when he took office bragged: There will be no price \ncaps; we won't put any caps on prices because we want the market to \nwork.\n  The market was not working. There was massive stealing and cheating \ngoing on of west coast consumers by some folks who got rich in the \nEnron Corporation, and others. That is not speculation on my part. We \nnow know this as a function of criminal filings that have been made in \nthese cases. We now know it as a result of tape recordings that were \nmade available only under duress by the U.S. Justice Department in the \nlast couple of days. ``Enron Traders Caught on Tape,'' ``Enron Tapes \nAnger Lawmakers.''\n  The American people deserve better. The American people deserve much \nbetter than they are getting with these regulatory agencies that decide \nthey do not want to regulate.\n  I wanted to visit about these regulatory agencies. Some will not like \nwhat I have to say. Frankly, I do not like their inattention to the \nissues facing the American people in a manner that is not fair to many \npeople.\n  I come back to where I started, the amendment I discussed earlier \nabout prohibiting the use of special operations aircraft to broadcast \nTV Marti signals into Cuba. My amendment is a prohibition on the use of \nmoney for that purpose.\n  Radio Marti is effective. I have been to Cuba. They hear those \nsignals. It is effective. We have spent nearly $180 million on TV \nMarti. It has been a tragic waste of the taxpayers' money. Those \nsignals are not able to be seen in Cuba. They are blocked. To \nappropriate military aircraft for the use of sending signals that will \nlikely still be blocked and not seen by the Cuban people seems folly to \nme.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we lay the current amendment aside so I \nmay formally offer the amendment I have described.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator from Nevada the status of the \nlegislation in the Senate. It is my intention to offer the amendment. \nOf course, I will have the opportunity. Is it the intention of the \nfloor managers not to allow amendments the rest of the day?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes, there may come a time when there are six or seven \namendments the managers cleared. As far as setting the Kennedy \namendment aside, we are not able to do that this afternoon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me also say--I know the managers of the bill are not \nhere--as an observation, it would make a lot of sense to move \namendments. There is always the case of people coming to the floor of \nthe Senate saying: Boy, we don't want any delays; this is taking too \nlong. And yet on a fair number of occasions, when I have come to the \nfloor, there is someone--in this case it is not the Senator from Nevada \nhimself. Well, I guess it is the Senator from Nevada at this point \nsaying someone objects.\n  I would prefer we offer amendments, get them to the desk, and \nconsider them with votes in due course. If there is a decision or an \nobjection at this point to setting aside the current amendment, which \nis the course that must be taken, then I will come back, I guess, on--\non Monday or Tuesday, will we be open for amendments?\n  Mr. REID. Monday.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Then I will come back on Monday and offer the amendment I \ndescribed and hope it may be seen by the Senate as something that \nrepresents an enhancement to this underlying Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina wishes to speak for 20 minutes; is that \nright?\n  Mrs. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is that in morning business or on this amendment?\n  Mrs. DOLE. Morning business.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North \nCarolina be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following the Senator from North Carolina recognized in \nmorning business, that Senator Lautenberg be recognized for 20 minutes \nto speak as in morning business. It is my understanding we have cleared \namendments now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n  Amendment Nos. 3274, 3275, 3236, 3276, 3233, 3277, and 3278, En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I have a set of amendments to the Defense \nbill that have been cleared by both managers. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendments be considered and agreed to, and \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. These have been cleared by Senator Levin. There is no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3274, 3275, 3236, 3276, 3233, 3277, and 3278) \nwere agreed to, en bloc, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3274\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the conveyance of land at the Sunflower Army \n                       Ammunition Plant, Kansas)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XXVIII, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 2830.

Mr. President, today, I rise to speak to an amendment to \nSection 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2005 revising the authority for the Commission on the Future of the \nNational Technology and Industrial Base.\n  This amendment is intended to ensure that small business interests \nare represented in the membership of the commission and are considered \nin its studies.\n  I applaud Chairman Warner and the Armed Services Committee for \ncreating this Commission in Section 841 of this Act. This esteemed \ncommission will be composed from persons with backgrounds in defense \nindustry, foreign policy, trade, labor, economics, and other relevant \nfields. Further, this commission is charged with studying and reporting \non various important issues affecting the future of the national \ntechnology and industrial base.\n  However, as chair of the Small Business Committee, I was surprised to \nfind that Section 841 contains no requirement to appoint small business \npersons to the commission. I was also disappointed to see that the \ncommission is not currently required to study small business issues.\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n  There is no reasonable basis for retaining these omissions in the \nact. Persuasive studies from the Office of Advocacy of the Small \nBusiness Administration have shown that small businesses are crucial to \njob creation, economic development, and technological innovation. \nFurther, the Small Business Act sets forth the goal of directing 23 \npercent of defense procurement dollars to small business prime \ncontracts. Clearly, the commission's studies will be incomplete without \ntaking into account small business contributions to our Nation's \ndefense.\n  My amendment provides for appointment to the commission of persons \nwith background in small business contracting. It also gives this \ncommission the mandate to study the ways to strengthen the role of the \nsmall business sector as a vital component of our national technology \nand industrial base.\n\n\n                     National Hunger Awareness Day\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, 1 year ago, I shared my thoughts on the \nSenate floor on a matter that weighs heavily on my mind. I reserved my \nmaiden speech for a topic I chose to make one of my top priorities as a \nSenator. Hunger is the silent enemy lurking within too many American \nhomes and a tragedy I have seen firsthand far too many times throughout \nmy life in public service.\n  Today, on National Hunger Awareness Day, I call once again for a \nhunger-free America. The battle to end hunger in our country is a \ncampaign that cannot be won in months or even a few years, but it is a \nvictory within reach. What we need is to help our fellow Americans \nunderstand the terrible reality of hunger and how to put a stop to it.\n  As Washington Post columnist David Broder said:\n\n       America has some problems that defy solution. This one does \n     not. It just needs caring people and a caring government \n     working together.\n\n  We are fortunate, indeed, to have a President who strives to lead our \nGovernment and our Nation in a compassionate direction. President Bush \nhas said poverty runs deep in this country, and we need to take the war \non poverty a step further by recognizing the power and promise of \nfaith-based and community-based groups that exist not because of \nGovernment, but because they have heard the universal call to love \nsomebody in need.\n  I am curious if the majority of the American public knows how many of \ntheir fellow citizens go hungry each and every day. The number is \nastounding. The Census Bureau reports that in the year 2002, 34.6 \nmillion Americans were living in poverty. Within that figure, over 7 \nmillion families, families with children, young little ones fall asleep \nwith an empty stomach. It is hard to believe that here in America, \nwhere we are desperately trying to get a handle on obesity, there are \nliterally millions of children who do not have enough to eat.\n  Families in my home State of North Carolina are especially \nstruggling. According to the most recent studies from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, we are one of the few States that has an \nincreasing rate of food insecurity. From 1996 to 2002, food insecurity \namong North Carolina households rose from 9.6 percent to 12.3 percent. \nThat means tens of thousands of families have difficulty affording food \nat some point each year.\n  A great deal of this can be attributed to the significant economic \nhardship we have faced over the last few years. Once-thriving towns \nhave been decimated by the closing of furniture and textile mills. In \nthe summer of 2003, less than 1 year ago, North Carolina experienced \nthe largest layoff in State history when textile giant Pillowtex closed \nits doors forever. That day alone, 4,400 people lost their jobs, and \neventually nearly 5,000 were laid off.\n  In eastern North Carolina, plant closures have resulted in more than \n2,200 layoffs since last summer, and in the last few months, the \nwestern region of North Carolina has lost more than 1,500 jobs.\n  Now there are signs that the situation is improving, but even as our \nemployment numbers rise, there are families struggling to put a \nbalanced meal on their table. Sadly, their story is not unlike so many \nothers across the country. There are many Americans who, after being \nlaid off, were fortunate enough to find new employment. But in the \nchanging climate of today's workforce, simply being able to hold down a \njob will not necessarily guarantee your family three square meals a \nday.\n  A recent report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that many of \nthe jobs lost between the years 2001 and 2003 will be replaced by jobs \npaying at least 20-percent less. The face of the hungry has changed \nover the last 10 years. While many associate those who struggle with \nhunger as being unemployed Americans, the sad truth is that the number \nof the working poor has escalated in the last decade.\n  There are 43 million people in low-income families. That means \nmillions of those lining up at soup kitchens, low-priced pantries, and \nother charitable organizations are men and women working anywhere from \none to three jobs, raising children, and under daily pressure to make \nends meet. They have been called the new poor in the editorial sections \nof our newspapers.\n  I think of families such as Danny and Shirley Palmer of rural Ohio, a \nState such as North Carolina that has been devastated by thousands of \njob losses. Danny worked for a quarter of a century at a local power \ncompany until he was let go in November 2002. After over a year of job \nsearches, he obtained a union card as a pipefitter. He pays union dues \nbut has yet to be tapped for a job. He works now as a Wal-Mart \nemployee, but with bills, including a $343-a-month mortgage, their \nsavings account is almost empty. Their frustration is not being able to \nfind suitable employment, and that frustration is growing rapidly.\n  Our food banks are having a hard time finding food to feed these \nfamilies. As America struggles in today's economic hardships, financial \ndonations have dropped off or corporations have scaled back on food \ndonations. As recent numbers have shown, many times there are just too \nmany people and not enough food.\n  In the year 2003, at least 23 million Americans stood in food lines. \nIn any given week, it is estimated that 7 million people are served at \nemergency feeding sites around the country. The numbers in specific \nparts of our country are just as disheartening.\n  In western North Carolina, the Manna Food Bank says over 68,000 \npeople seek food assistance throughout the year, with over 20,000 \nseeking assistance each week. This means many of the same people are \ncoming back again and again.\n  Since I came to Congress, I have visited homeless and hunger \nshelters, food distribution sites and soup kitchens. I went through the \nprocess of applying for Government assistance through the WIC Program, \nhelping women, infants and children. As I learned more about the \nefforts to combat hunger, I gained a great respect for groups such as \nthe Society of St. Andrew.\n  For the last 25 years, this organization has been doing yeoman's work \nin the area of gleaning. That is when excess crops that would otherwise \nbe thrown out or taken from farms, packing houses, and warehouses are \ndistributed to the needy. Gleaning also helps the farmer because he \ndoes not have to haul off or plow under crops that do not meet exact \nspecifications of grocery chains, and certainly it helps the hungry by \ngiving them not just any food but food that is both nutritious and \nfresh.\n\n  Last year, the Society of St. Andrew told me $100,000 would provide \nat least 10 million servings of food for hungry North Carolinians. Just \nbefore last year's National Hunger Awareness Day, I set out to raise \nthat amount for the society. Thanks to the compassionate hearts of \nseveral individuals, companies, and organizations, we surpassed the \noriginal goal and raised $187,000 in 2 weeks. That money was enough for \nat least 18 million servings of food.\n  The Society of St. Andrew is the only comprehensive program in North \nCarolina that gleans available produce and then sorts, packages, \nprocesses, transports, and delivers excess food to feed the hungry. In \nthe first few months of this year, the society hosted over 168 events, \ngleaning 4.2 million pounds of food. Between January and March, they \ngleaned 12.8 million servings.\n  Incredibly, it only cost one penny a serving to glean and deliver \nthis food to those in need. All of this work is done by the hands of \nthe 9,200 volunteers and a minimal staff.\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n  Like any humanitarian effort, the gleaning system works because of \ncooperative efforts. Clearly, private organizations and individuals are \ndoing a great job, but they are doing so with limited resources. It is \nup to us to make some changes on the public side and help leverage \nscarce dollars to feed the hungry.\n  Transportation is the single biggest concern for gleaners. As the \nnumbers tell us, the food is there. The issue is simply how to \ntransport such a large volume. I am proud to say that with the help of \norganizations such as the American Trucking Association and America's \nSecond Harvest we are making progress at easing that transportation \nconcern.\n  I have introduced a bill with cosponsor Senators Chris Dodd, Richard \nLugar, and Lamar Alexander that will change the Tax Code to give \ntransportation companies tax incentives for volunteering trucks to \ntransfer gleaned food. Such tax incentives would be especially helpful \nto organizations such as Relief Fleet. This food distribution system is \nrun through transportation companies who donate empty trailer space to \nmove food donations to the proper sites.\n  Last fiscal year, Relief Fleet moved 16.7 million pounds of food free \nof charge. More than 555 truckloads traveled to 130 food banks, \ngenerating a savings of $382,000 in shipping costs.\n  Gleaning and transportation efforts are just some of the possible \ninitiatives to help end hunger. There is so much more that can be done. \nTake, for example, child nutrition programs. There is no question that \nfar too many of our children are going hungry each and every day. Of \nthe 23 million Americans being fed at soup kitchens, 9 million of those \nare hungry children under the age of 18. This is why the School Lunch \nProgram is so important.\n  In fact, recent research at Tufts University indicates that even mild \nundernutrition experienced by young children during critical periods of \ngrowth may affect brain development and lead to reductions in physical \ngrowth. Under the current School Lunch Program, children from families \nwith incomes at or below 130 percent of poverty are eligible for free \nmeals.\n\n  Additionally, children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 \npercent of poverty are eligible for reduced price meals, no more than \n40 cents per meal. This may seem like a nominal amount, but for \nstruggling families with several children, the costs add up. School \nadministrators in my State tell me they hear from parents who just do \nnot know how they will be able to pay for their child's school meals. \nThese income eligibility guidelines are not consistent with the WIC \nProgram and other Federal assistance.\n  For example, families whose incomes are at or below 185 percent of \npoverty are eligible for free benefits through WIC. It makes sense to \nharmonize these income eligibility guidelines, allowing us to clarify \nthis bureaucratic situation. Doing so would enable us to immediately \ncertify children from WIC families for the national school lunch and \nbreakfast programs.\n  Difficulty paying the reduced price fee is an issue that is real \nacross America. More than 500 State and local school boards have passed \nresolutions urging the Congress to eliminate the reduced price \ncategory, thereby expanding free lunches and breakfasts to all of those \nchildren whose families' incomes are at or below 185 percent of \npoverty.\n  In addition, the American School Food Service Association, the \nAssociation of School Business Officials, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, and the American Public Health \nAssociation have endorsed this idea. Why? Because it is the right thing \nto do.\n  I was pleased when the Senate agriculture panel went on record in the \nchild nutrition reauthorization bill in favor of eliminating the \nreduced price meal program. This initiative will begin through a pilot \nprogram in five States. I thank Chairman Cochran, Ranking Member \nHarkin, and my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee for their \nsupport and assistance. Since introducing this legislation, colleagues \non both sides of the aisle have joined me and two bills have been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives. Of course, this is only the \nfirst step. There is far more to be done.\n\n  Our work to end hunger stretches outside of our own country, of \ncourse. There are more than 300 million chronically hungry children in \nthe world. More than half of these children go to school on an empty \nstomach and almost as many do not attend school at all but might if \nfood were available. I believe the distribution of food in schools is \none of the most effective strategies to fight hunger and malnutrition \namong children. Studies have shown this encourages better school \nattendance which in turn improves literacy rates and helps fight \npoverty. This increased school attendance for students in poor \ncountries may very well protect some children who would otherwise be \nsusceptible to recruitment by groups that would offer them food in \nreturn for attending extremist schools or participating in terrorist \ntraining camps.\n  I was proud to introduce a joint resolution with Congressman Jim \nMcGovern of Massachusetts that recognizes the worldwide problem of \nhunger and acknowledges the vital significance of food distribution to \nmillions of starving children. This resolution recognizes the benefits \nof increased school attendance due to food availability for needy \nchildren, benefits ranging from improved literacy rates and job \nopportunities to protection from root causes of terrorism. In short, \nchildren who attend school on a regular basis have a much brighter \nfuture. Let us build on this foundation.\n  On this third annual Hunger Awareness Day, I urge Americans to join \nme in the campaign to end hunger. As I have said before, hunger does \nnot differentiate between Democrats and Republicans, and just as it \nstretches across so many ethnicities, so many areas, so must we.\n  Bill Shore, director of Share Our Strength, an antihunger \norganization, said it best.\n\n       There are two kinds of poverty in America. There are those \n     who don't have and there are those who don't know. The \n     majority of Americans are fortunate not to be in the category \n     of those who don't have. Too many have been willing to remain \n     in the category of those who don't know. Men and women of \n     conscience must do more than accept or reject allegations \n     about the conditions of the society in which they live. They \n     must find out for themselves. Those who do will learn that \n     hunger is a serious but solvable problem. It is only as \n     invisible as Americans allow it to be.\n\n  It is a privilege to work with colleagues from both sides of the \naisle toward the goal of ending hunger.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nSenator Fritz Hollings--a Career of Supporting Israel and American Jews\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to talk for a little while \nabout a matter that has come up regarding one of my distinguished \ncolleagues who, like me, served in Europe during World War II, who was \na very brave and proud soldier, and who was decorated for his service \nthere. That is Senator Hollings.\n  Senator Hollings has served for some years in this body as a junior \nSenator, even when he was well into 70 years of age. That was one of \nthe more unusual circumstances, although I think I, too, bring a junior \nstatus at a fairly advanced age to my being here as a freshman.\n  But in the delegation that is going to go to Normandy tonight, I am \none of several who served in World War II. The other names are among \nthe bravest of all: Senator Daniel Inouye, who lost his arm in Italy \nafter being struck three times by enemy fire. And, as he described it \nto me, in one of those incidents he had not felt any part of the wound \nfrom the bullet which apparently passed through his body--a rifle shot \nthrough his body, or a machine gun shot through his body. He was \nknocked down. He got up to continue to lead his platoon into a \nmurderous battle in Italy.\n  Although it took some 50 years for Senator Daniel Inouye to get his \nmedal, it finally arrived. Those of us who were privileged to be here \nwere so proud of Senator Inouye's service as\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nthe medal was bestowed on him for the service he so bravely gave to his \ncountry.\n  It was noted also that even though Daniel Inouye, now Senator Inouye, \nwas volunteering for service in the U.S. Army which at first was \ndenied, he continued to be as loyal as he could to his country, brave \nand courageous. We are proud of the opportunity to serve with him and \nto know him as a friend.\n  In addition to Senator Inouye, Senator Hollings, Senator Warner--and \nSenator Stevens had an illustrious military record flying in China, \nBurma, India--and Senator Akaka and Senator Warner--all of us join \ntogether in the bond we received as a result of serving in World War II \nand being given then the privilege to serve in this distinguished body.\n  I want to talk about Fritz Hollings, a good friend of mine for more \nthan 20 years, now the senior Senator from South Carolina, a good \nfriend to all of us, an outstanding public servant, someone who has \ngiven more years to public service than some of the people who are \nserving here have. He was accused of being anti-Semitic because of an \nop-ed piece he wrote that appeared recently in the Charleston Post and \nCourier.\n  The charge has been made on the Senate floor by the junior Senator \nfrom Virginia who apparently heads up the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee and serves as the chief fundraiser for Republican \nincumbents and candidates for the Senate.\n  It is very unusual. Frankly, I don't remember in almost 20 years of \nservice that one Senator issues a press release criticizing another for \nsomething the person did in a public press release. That tells us where \nit was going. It was going to politics.\n  I also heard the junior Senator from Virginia repeat the charge again \nearlier this week while he was a guest on the Don Imus radio show. The \ncharge he leveled is outrageous. I encourage the junior Senator from \nVirginia to cease and desist.\n\n  I am a Jewish American and fully support the American-Israeli \nrelationship, not because I am a Jewish American but because it is good \nfor America. It is good for us to have an ally that is as strong as she \nis, an ally that is the only democratic society in the entire Middle \nEast with over 100 million of those who would declare they are the \nenemy of Israel and the United States. Israel is a very valuable part \nof our support for freedom and liberty in this world.\n  I have known the senior Senator from South Carolina for almost a \nquarter of a century. I am proud of his longstanding service to the \npeople of this country. I treasure our friendship. Although he will be \nleaving this Senate in January of next year, he will be missed. I \ncertainly will be one of those who will miss him.\n  He is one of the strongest Senate supporters of the State of Israel \nand the American Jewish community we have. He doesn't just ``talk the \ntalk.'' As an appropriator, he has ``walked the walk.''\n  Israel is safer and more secure as a result of the votes Senator \nHollings has cast in the Appropriations Committee and on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  The senior Senator from South Carolina has a well-deserved reputation \nfor candor. And, frankly, we could use a little bit more of that around \nhere.\n  The op-ed in question is his candid assessment of why President Bush \ntook us to war with Iraq despite the fact Iraq did not have weapons of \nmass destruction or links to al-Qaida.\n  I want to make it positively clear I don't necessarily agree with \neverything the senior Senator from South Carolina said in the op-ed, \nbut I reserve the right to disagree with the best of friends on an \nissue. But to construe the op-ed piece or its author as representing \nanti-Semitism is patently unfair.\n  Senator Hollings was critical of Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, and \nthe journalist Charles Krauthammer for being three of the architects of \na dubious policy to forcibly democratize the Middle East, starting with \nIraq. They believe that such policy will make Israel more secure. That \nis something all of us want and need.\n\n  The problem with that policy is that it is not quite working the way \nthe architects envisioned. This may have something to do with the fact \nthat none of them, to my knowledge, have any combat experience. People \nwho do have experience in combat, such as former President Bush, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, are a little more circumspect about \nwhat we can achieve and how we can achieve it.\n  I, too, have been critical of this policy which the administration \nswallowed hook, line, and sinker. I called for Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Wolfowitz and Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith to \nresign, along with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. Does that make me an \nanti-Semite? I would say not.\n  We are all kind of holding our breath right now as we wait to see the \nfallout from the resignation of Mr. Tenet, the head of the CIA, so \nabruptly, so quickly. We want to know what it is that caused that \nsudden change. He was a loyal, faithful servant. Perhaps mistakes were \nmade. We will find out more about that very soon.\n  The bottom line is that these high-ranking civilian officials to whom \nI just referred in the Pentagon have misled America and they have let \nour troops down. Senator Hollings' contention that Israel is less \nsecure as a result of this misguided policy certainly cannot be \ndismissed.\n  It is time for that cadre of people who run the Pentagon to go. It \nhas nothing to do with anti-Semitism. It has everything to do with the \nfact that Iraq is becoming a quagmire and has already claimed over 800 \nbrave young American men and women.\n  When I heard the junior Senator from Virginia attack Senator \nHollings, I asked my staff to research his voting record with regard to \nIsrael and other matters of concern to the American Jewish community.\n  The memo my staff prepared is 10 pages long. I could not find a \nsingle vote that could be construed as opposition to Israel or American \nJews.\n  I will cite a few examples. In 1978, he voted against S. Con. Res. \n86, a measure to disapprove the sale of jet fighters to Israel. He \nvoted against the disapproval of the sale. The resolution was defeated \n44 to 54.\n  In 1980, he voted to table an amendment to S. 2714, the foreign aid \nauthorization bill, that would have withheld $150 million in aid to \nIsrael because of the settlements being erected in the West Bank.\n  In 1981, he opposed President Reagan's decision to sell AWACs and \nother military equipment to Saudi Arabia.\n  In 1986, Senator Hollings supported Senator Byrd's amendment to H.J. \nRes. 738, the continuing resolution for fiscal year 1987 to ensure that \nfunds appropriated for aid to the Philippines did not come at the \nexpense of aid to Israel or Egypt.\n  Senator Hollings also supported recognizing Jerusalem as the \nundivided capital of Israel. As the ranking member and former chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary, he has insisted that the annual appropriations bill under \nhis jurisdiction contain the following three provisions: One, that \npeople born in Jerusalem be allowed to list Israel as their country of \norigin; two, that all relevant official U.S. Government documents list \nJerusalem as the capital of Jerusalem; and three, that U.S. policies \ntreat Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\n  I note that these provisions have been eliminated in conference at \nthe insistence of House Republicans and the administration.\n  Does that make them anti-Semites? Absolutely not. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina is eloquent and certainly able to defend himself and his \nrecord.\n  But when I hear his reputation repeatedly besmirched, the reputation \nand integrity of a man that I know to be one of the staunchest \nsupporters of Israel and the American Jewish community, a man who \nfought hard, almost gave his life to defend his country, I will not sit \nby and be quiet.\n  To paraphrase our former colleague, Lloyd Bentsen: I know Fritz \nHollings. Fritz Hollings is a friend of mine. Fritz Hollings is no \nanti-Semite.\n  To state otherwise goes beyond the pale of partisan rhetoric, even by \nthe standards of a heated election campaign.\n  Frankly, I think the senior Senator from South Carolina is owed an \napology, not just by the junior Senator from Virginia but from Senators \nwho believe it was an inappropriate besmirching of character and \nreputation\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\ndutifully earned by years and years of service to this country and \ncertainly to this body. Silence on the other side, in my view, is \nimplicit approval of what was said.\n  I hope we hear something different in the not-too-distant future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  FTAA Negotiations and Florida Citrus\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nbring to the Senate's attention to some recent news about the ongoing \nnegotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or the FTAA. These \nnegotiations have been going on for some period of time. I look at \nthese with significant interest, as they dramatically affect my State \nof Florida.\n  There are many mutual benefits that will accrue to the nations of the \nWestern Hemisphere from a Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement. I \nam someone who has consistently supported free and fair trade. That is \nwhy I am hopeful these negotiations are going to yield an agreement \nthat ultimately can be supported here.\n  However, there is a critical issue with respect to the negotiations \nof the FTAA that is absolutely crucial to my State. It involves the \nFlorida citrus industry. It involves tens of thousands of jobs, and it \ninvolves basically the production of frozen concentrate that supplies \nthe fresh orange juice on the breakfast tables of so many Americans \nevery morning.\n  Here is the news. Last week, Reuters reported that ``the United \nStates signaled for the first time that some agriculture products would \nbe excluded altogether from the [Free Trade Area of the Americas \nagreement] FTAA.\n  There was another publication called ``Inside U.S. Trade,'' which \nreported that this new proposal from the United States would ``allow \nfor some market access negotiations to yield results other than total \nelimination of tariffs.''\n  Well, that is a significant change from what we have been told. It \nis, from my standpoint and my State's standpoint, clearly a step in the \nright direction. But while this would appear to be welcome news to \nFlorida's citrus industry, we need some more information.\n  I am going to continue to fight to preserve the tariff on imported \nfrozen concentrated orange juice and ask for a commitment from the \nPresident. I believe the President must state publicly, in clear \nlanguage, that we will not negotiate any reduction of the tariff on \nimported orange juice. It is not only important to Florida, it is \nimportant to the consumers of orange juice all over this country.\n  Now, why is this so important? Let me tell you. Because if the FTAA \nnegotiated out an elimination of the tariff, it would not be free and \nfair trade because Brazil would become a monopoly. Here is what \nhappens. Right now, basically, of the world's production of frozen \nconcentrated orange juice, you have Brazil basically producing about 60 \npercent and the remainder--around 40 percent--is produced by the \nFlorida citrus industry.\n  Of the world's production, the Florida citrus industry basically \nproduces the supply for the domestic orange juice market; that is, the \nU.S. market. Brazil supplies some of that domestic United States \nmarket, and basically the markets in the rest of the world. There are \nother producers, but I am simplifying it. The two big producers are the \nUnited States--mainly Florida--and Brazil.\n  Now, what happens? If you eliminate the tariff protecting the Florida \ncitrus growers, and therefore the 40 percent that is produced in \nFlorida, since Brazil has cheaper land and cheaper labor, Brazil then \ntakes over 100 percent of the world's market for frozen concentrated \norange juice. That is not free trade. That would be a monopoly. And \nwhat happens in a monopoly? In a monopoly, then, the producers can \ndetermine whatever price they want because they are the sole suppliers. \nAnd what happens to the consumer? The consumer gets it in the neck, and \nthe price goes up.\n  Well, you will hear those people who say: Oh, don't worry. There is \ncompetition among the growers in Brazil. The truth is, there are about \nfive major producers in Brazil and, in effect, they operate as a cartel \nwith collusion among themselves. So if they took over the entire \nworld's market, ran the Florida citrus industry out of business, they \nwould start to set the price, and that is not free and fair trade.\n  I can tell you, this Senator, who is someone who is for free and fair \ntrade, and has voted that way--is not going to stand for that because \nthat is not in the best interests of consumers.\n  I might also tell you when I went to Brazil last December, I had \nseveral very pleasant meetings with members of the Brazilian \nGovernment, including the chief negotiator for the FTAA, and a number \nof other ministers in the Government. I visited with the Acting \nPresident, who is the Vice President of Brazil, and he becomes Acting \nPresident when the President is out of the country, as the President \nwas in South America in a Mercosur meeting at the time.\n  When I told the Brazilian Vice President about this problem for \nFlorida, his response was--half in jest, but half seriously--well, why \ndon't you just have the Florida citrus growers move to Brazil where our \nland is cheaper and our labor is cheaper? That is exactly what we do \nnot want to happen. We want to keep a vital industry alive in the \nUnited States.\n  Florida has 12,000 growers, many of whom operate small family-owned \noperations. Unlike almost all agricultural commodities, the citrus \nindustry receives no U.S. production subsidies. The tariff on Brazilian \norange juice is the only offset the industry receives. Any reduction in \nthat tariff would simply devastate Florida's citrus industry.\n  This citrus industry is Florida's second largest. It is responsible \nfor generating over $9 billion for the economy and providing nearly \n90,000 jobs. It accounts for $1 billion in revenue for the State and \nlocal governments, which, of course, funds our public hospitals and our \nschools and our fire and our police services.\n\n  So back on Brazil, I am disappointed that Brazil reportedly does not \nview a proposal to exclude certain agricultural products from ``total \ntariff elimination'' as a constructive step. I do not think we are \ngoing to see them take that position.\n  Excluding the tariff on imported orange juice from the negotiations \nwould actually represent an important step toward completing, not \nretarding, an FTAA agreement that will benefit all of the Western \nHemisphere. And regardless of the progress of the FTAA negotiations, \nour industries should focus on expanding global markets for orange \njuice and not waste our efforts on fighting over the tariff. Greater \ncooperation is needed between Brazil and the United States.\n  On a tangential matter, I want to encourage the administration to \nselect Miami as the U.S. candidate city to serve as the home of the \nFTAA secretariat. Miami's special and close relationship with our Latin \nAmerican neighbors makes the city a natural choice as the city to play \nthis important role. The administration should announce this decision \nsoon so we can put the full efforts of the U.S. Government behind one \nU.S. city; and that is logically Miami.\n  As a matter of fact, from different destinations in Latin America, it \nis a lot easier to get to Miami from those locations in Latin America, \nin many cases, than it is to get from one location in Latin America to \nanother.\n  Miami is the logical choice. It is a place of significant Hispanic \nculture and population. La lingua is spoken there every day on la \ncalle, on the street. It is a place that is a logical location for the \neveryday transaction of business for trade in the Americas.\n  Miami is the gateway to Latin America. It should be the gateway for \nthe FTAA. I believe the administration should act right now in going \nahead and determining that so as they negotiate between different \ncities in the hemisphere, the United States will be unified behind one \ncity it is putting forth, which should be Miami, FL.\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to say farewell to a \nwonderful group of young men and women who have served as Senate pages \nover the last 5 months and thank them for the contributions they make \nto the day-to-day operations of the Senate.\n  This particular group of pages has served with distinction and has \ndone a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their \nstudies and to this body. Their final day as Senate pages is tomorrow, \nbut I hope we will see some--or all--of them back in the Senate \nsomeday, as staffers or Senators.\n  I suspect few people understand how hard Senate pages work. On a \ntypical day, pages are in school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours of \nclasses each morning, pages then report to the Capitol to prepare the \nSenate Chamber for the day's session. Throughout the day--and sometimes \ninto the night--pages are called upon to perform a wide array of \ntasks--from obtaining copies of documents and reports for Senators to \nuse during debate, to running errands between the Capitol and the \nSenate office buildings, to lending a hand at our weekly conference \nluncheons.\n  Once we finish our business here for the day--no matter what time--\nthe pages return to the dorm and prepare for the next day's classes and \nSenate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep.\n  Despite this rigorous schedule, these young people continually \ndischarge their tasks efficiently and cheerfully. In fact, as one page \nput it, ``We like working hard. When things get hectic, that's when we \nlike it best.''\n  This page class had the good fortune to witness some historic \nmoments.\n  They saw President Bush present the Congressional Gold Medal to \nDorothy Height, one of the giants of the modern civil rights movement \nin America.\n  They were present for important debates in this Chamber over such \ncritical issues as the budget and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  They've seen--and had their photos taken--with celebrities, including \nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n  Just yesterday, they saw another famous visitor, the actor Mike \nMyers--better known to some as ``Austin Powers, International Man of \nMystery.''\n  I hope the close-up view that these exceptional young people have had \nof the Senate at work these last few months has made this institution a \nlittle bit less of a mystery. Our government ``of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people'' requires the active involvement of \ninformed citizens to work.\n  I understand that many, if not most, of this semester's pages have \ndecided to volunteer on political campaigns--both Republican and \nDemocractic--when they return home. I'm told the campaigns run the \ngamut from local school board candidates to United States Senate \ncandidates.\n  I am sure I speak for all Senators when I say, we applaud your \ncontinued involvement in the democratic process. We are very grateful \nfor your outstanding service to the Senate this semester. And we wish \nyou well in all that you choose to do in your future.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the names and \nhometowns of each of the Senate pages to whom we are saying goodbye \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Senate Pages--Spring Semester 2004\n\n       Andrew Blais, Rhode Island; Katherine Buck, New Hampshire; \n     Sam Cannon, Utah; Erin Chase, South Dakota; Eric Coykendall, \n     Arizona; Julie Cyr, Vermont; Joe Galli, Maine; Watson \n     Hemrick, Tennessee; Jennifer Hirsch, Arkansas; Garrett \n     Jackson, Mississippi; Kara Johnson, Illinois; Ben Kappelman, \n     Montana; Andrew Knox, Vermont; Adam Lathan, Alabama; Betsy \n     Lefholz, South Dakota; Brittney Moraski, Michigan; Alex \n     Ogden, North Carolina; Jaclyn Pfaehler, Montana; Aaron \n     Porter, Tennessee; Ingrid Price, Utah; Laura Pritchard, \n     Virginia; Laura Refsland, Wisconsin; Ryan Smith, Kentucky; \n     Kyra Waitley, Idaho; Nathanael Whipple, California; and \n     Elizabeth Wright, Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6440-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6440-S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today in Palmyra, PA, volunteers at the \nLebanon Valley Brethren Home will collect food and sell baked goods for \nthe ``Great American Bake Sale'' to support their local food bank. In \nhundreds of small towns, suburban communities, and cities from New York \nto California, thousands of volunteers will help collect food, glean \nfields, prepare meals, and raise awareness as a part of National Hunger \nAwareness Day.\n  These dedicated volunteers and their compassionate acts represent a \ngrassroots citizens' movement motivated to reduce hunger in America. \nThese volunteers are the people who prepare the dinners and stock the \nshelves of the local charities that serve more than 9 million kids who \nlack basic food supplies. They are motivated by appalling statistics \nthat show that more than 13 million children live in what the Federal \nGovernment deems ``food insecure'' households. And, of course, they are \nmotivated by knowing the needs and faces of the vulnerable people in \ntheir communities.\n  Last year, an estimated 23 million low-income people--many of whom \nare from working families with children, are elderly, or have \ndisabilities--received a meal or an emergency food box from one of the \nestimated 50,000 local hunger relief charities that dot the Nation's \nlandscape. These charities, of which three-quarters are faith-based \norganizations, play an important and complementary role to State, local \nand Federal Government efforts to help low-income families achieve \nself-sufficiency. But for the family whose benefits have been \nexhausted, or the single mother who is waiting for the benefits to \nbegin, or for those who simply don't want government help, these \ncharities are the last line of defense against hunger.\n  Despite the selfless extraordinary work of these charities and their \nestimated one million volunteers, the need in many communities too \noften exceeds the available resources. At the same time, the United \nStates throws away nearly 96 billion pounds of food each year.\n  Legislation I have sponsored, the Charity Aid, Recovery and \nEmpowerment Act, or the CARE Act, would help close the gap between the \nneed and available resources. The CARE Act provides farmers and \nranchers, small businesses, and franchisees with a tax incentive that \nwould allow these smaller business entities to enjoy the same tax \nincentives that large corporations receive when they donate food to \ncharity. The CARE Act's food donation tax incentives will enable \nfarmers with surplus crops to donate the food to a food bank or \nemergency shelter, recouping some of the cost of production and \ntransportation--and preventing them from having to plow the crops back \ninto the ground. The CARE Act gives a restaurant owner the incentive to \ndonate surplus meals to a soup kitchen rather than throwing good food \ninto a dumpster. America's Second Harvest, the Nation's food bank \nnetwork, estimates that the CARE Act will help generate more than 878 \nmillion new meals for hungry people over the next 10 years.\n  This legislation, despite broad, bipartisan support for the food \ndonation tax incentives and the other provisions in the act, is now \nstalled in the Senate, not being allowed to go to conference. The CARE \nAct is in jeopardy, and with its fortunes go the hopes of tens of \nthousands of people that serve America's most vulnerable families. We \ncannot allow partisan differences, unrelated to this legislation, to \nundo the promise that the CARE Act offers to millions of Americans. The \nCARE Act\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nshould be allowed to go to a bipartisan conference and thereby ensure \nthat no food bank, pantry or soup kitchen will have to turn away a \nhungry family, senior, or child because the cupboard is bare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today is National Hunger Awareness Day, \nand it is an opportunity for all of us in Congress to pledge a greater \neffort to deal effectively with this festering problem that shames our \nNation and has grown even more serious in recent years.\n  The number of Americans living in hunger, or on the brink of hunger \nhas increased every year during the current administration. It now \nincludes 13 million children--400,000 more than when President Bush \ntook office.\n  These Americans deserve higher priority by all in Congress. Day in \nand day out, the needs of millions of Americans living in poverty have \nbeen overlooked, and too often their voices have been silenced.\n  These are real people, struggling every day to get by. They are \nsingle mothers serving coffee at the local diner at 5 a.m. and cleaning \nhouses in the afternoon, yet are still unable to afford both shelter \nand food. They are low-wage workers holding down two jobs, yet still \nforced to make impossible choices between feeding their family, paying \nthe rent, and obtaining decent medical care. They are children who go \nto bed hungry every night whose parents can't afford to give them more \nthan a single slim meal a day.\n  The World Food Summit in 1996 called global attention to this crisis \nand in response the Clinton administration pledged to begin an effort \nto cut hunger and food insecurity in half in the United States by 2010. \nIn the boom of the Clinton years, we made progress toward that goal--\nhunger decreased steadily through 2000. We now have 6 years left to \nfulfill our commitment, and we must not fail.\n  The answer is a renewed commitment to reaching that goal. The \nfastest, most direct way to reduce hunger in the Nation is to improve \nand expand the current Federal nutrition programs. Sadly, it is \ndifficult to persuade the current administration and the current \nCongress to fund important child nutrition programs such as the school \nbreakfast and school lunch programs and the summer food program, but \nnumerous groups throughout the Nation are doing their best to make a \ndifference.\n  Project Bread in Massachusetts helps fund nearly 400 food pantries, \nsoup kitchens, food banks and food salvage programs across the State, \nand also coordinates local efforts to develop effective solutions to \nreduce hunger.\n  Congress can also do better. The Senate Agriculture Committee \napproved a bipartisan child nutrition bill last month to strengthen and \nexpand nutrition programs, and it deserves to be enacted into law as \nsoon as possible.\n  A strong job market will also significantly reduce hunger. A major \nchallenge in today's troubled economy is that it has been creating just \none job for every three out-of-work Americans. We need an economy that \nworks for everyone, and a job creation plan that enables every American \nto afford a decent quality of life.\n  That means jobs that pay a living wage. Right now, we are sending the \nwrong message to low-income workers. We are telling them that hard work \ndoes not pay. We are saying that workers who play by the rules deserve \nlittle or even nothing in return. Why can't we all agree that no one \nwho works for a living should have to live in poverty, constantly \nwondering where the next meal is coming from?\n  For too many adults of all ages, the fight against hunger is a \nconstant ongoing struggle. It undermines their productivity, their \nearning power, and even their health. It keeps their children from \nconcentrating and learning in school.\n  It makes no sense to allow the gap between rich and poor to grow \nwider. We can not ignore the poorest in our Nation, and all those who \nneed our help the most. National Hunger Awareness Day is our chance to \nrededicate ourselves in Congress to this cause, and we can't afford to \nmiss it.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President. I rise today to speak about a problem \nimpacting communities across the United States and throughout the \nworld. As many of my colleagues know, today is National Hunger \nAwareness Day. It is a day meant to focus our attention on our friends, \ncoworkers, classmates, and neighbors for whom putting food on the table \ncontinues to be a daily struggle. Sadly, for the nearly 35 million \nAmericans who are ``hungry'' or ``food insecure,'' hunger is more than \na statistic, it is an insomnia within the American dream. This is a \nreality that the people of my home State of Oregon know far too well.\n  For the last several years, Oregon has been at or near the top of \nrepeated nationwide studies of hunger and food insecurity in the United \nStates. And I can tell you that as a member of this chamber and an \nOregonian, the statistics on hunger and food insecurity continue to \nconfound me. Despite all of our advances in agriculture technology and \nfood distribution, children and families in my State and around the \ncountry will go to bed hungry tonight. The sad irony is that many of \nthe communities most affected by hunger are the very ones that grow the \nfood upon which the rest of us rely.\n  On the horizon, Oregon's economy appears to be brightening. While \nthere are no quick fixes, I believe that solving hunger is within our \ngrasp. Later today, Senator Lincoln and I will be announcing the \ncreation of the Senate Hunger Caucus. This caucus will serve as a forum \nto raise awareness and foster cooperation among business interests, \ncommunity leaders, and local, State, and national non-profits to work \nwith Congress to address hunger.\n  As policymakers, our job is to take the pieces of this puzzle and put \nthem together in a way that leaves our communities whole and healthy. \nGovernment cannot act alone to solve the problem but must work in \nconcert with those who are best able to help. I believe the creation of \nthe Senate caucus is an important step in focusing on this problem. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and groups back \nin Oregon to address these issues.\n  In Oregon, we have been blessed with a number of organizations and \nindividuals who have taken it upon themselves to help in this effort \nand assist their neighbors in need. Groups such as Birch Community \nServices and the Oregon Food Bank have shown themselves to be true \nassets to their communities. As an Oregonian, I can tell you that I am \nespecially proud of how they have responded to what has been a \ndifficult last couple of years in our State, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them in the fight against hunger.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nfact that it is National Hunger Awareness Day and to raise the \nvisibility of issues of hunger in America.\n  What is the face of hunger in America? A child. A mother. A father. A \nsingle working parent. A homeless person. A grandmother raising \ngrandchildren. A grandfather. A senior citizen living off of social \nsecurity. An unemployed person. A disabled worker. A military veteran. \nPeople of all races and ethnicities.\n  These are the faces of the almost 35 million Americans that live in \nhouseholds that are food insecure. Food insecurity is not isolated to \none region. These 35 million Americans live in the small towns of New \nEngland, in the large cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and Atlanta. \nThey live in the deltas of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi and the \nplains of the Dakotas down to Kansas. There is food insecurity and \nhunger in the timber regions of Washington and Oregon and on the \nbeaches of California. Food insecurity affects the States of the four \ncorners down into Texas and Oklahoma. No region of this country is \nwithout hunger.\n  Today is National Hunger Awareness Day. I have come to the Senate \nfloor to talk about hunger in America and to raise awareness about the \ncomplex issues surrounding hunger.\n  When many Americans think of hunger they often think of starving \npeople in developing countries around the world, and the number of \nhungry people living around the world is staggering.\n  Eight hundred million people, including children, are hungry and food \ninsecure in the world today. America must continue to lead in its \ngenerosity to aid the world's food insecure. But hunger is not just a \ndistant problem for developing countries. Hunger exists among our own \ncitizens here in America.\n  Because today is National Hunger Awareness Day, I will focus my \nremarks on the less recognized face of\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\nhunger and that is the face of the Americans, our neighbors, and our \nfellow citizens who are hungry and food insecure.\n  What does food insecurity mean? Food insecurity is limited or \nuncertain access to nutritional food. Food insecurity is not knowing \nfrom where the next meal is coming.\n  Food insecurity is not unique among the homeless and unemployed. On \nthe contrary, many food insecure households in America have at least \none working adult. We need only compare the national unemployment \nnumbers with the food insecurity numbers to see that they don't match \nup. There are far more food insecure individuals than there are \nunemployed people. America's working poor are finding it difficult to \nmake ends meet and at times provide the most basic needs for their \nfamily--nutritious food.\n  Perhaps our most vulnerable food insecure individuals are our \nchildren and seniors. Due to the high costs of healthcare and living \nexpenses, many seniors often find themselves choosing between medicine \nand groceries because they may not be able to afford both. Programs \nsuch as Meals on Wheels and local community senior programs are so \nimportant to the health of our seniors.\n  Children rely on parents to provide for their basic needs. Of the 35 \nmillion people who are food insecure in America, just over 13 million \nare children. This is the same number of children that are receiving \nfree lunches through the National School Lunch Program. This vital \nprogram provides many children with the most nutritious meal they will \nreceive in a given day. We must continue to find opportunities to fill \nin the gaps because the National School Lunch Program only covers \nMonday through Friday during the school year. The traditional three \nmonths of summer vacation from school is a critical time when many \nchildren are missing essential nutrition in their diets.\n  One example of a successful program in my home State of Arkansas is \nhelping feed children outside of school. The Arkansas Rice Depot's Food \nFor Kids program provides hungry children with a quick, high-energy \nsnack during school and then provides a backpack filled with nutritious \nfoods children can prepare for themselves at home. The Food For Kids \nprogram is serving 329 schools and 15,000 students in Arkansas. Founded \nin 1995, this program is the first of its kind in the Nation and now 20 \ncities across the Nation have established similar programs.\n  Throughout my remarks I have mentioned the word nutrition. In the \nfight to end hunger, providing access to nutritious food is key. Many \nAmericans are now waking up to the long-term health complications \ncaused by obesity. It may seem strange to talk about obesity and hunger \nat the same time but the reality is that people with limited access to \nmoney and food typically consume the cheapest food that they can \npurchase in large quantities, and often these foods lack important \nnutrients for a balanced diet. We can fight obesity early on by \neducating children about nutrition and help provide opportunities for \nchildren to access nutritious foods at school and at after school \nprograms. Additionally, through food assistance programs we must \ncontinue to encourage adults to access nutritious foods and help \nprovide opportunities to learn about nutrition.\n  For Americans, hunger does not mean entire towns and villages full of \nstarving people--people literally starving and dying because they \ncannot eat. Fortunately, we are able to provide the citizens most in \nneed with access to some kind of food to meet basic needs through \nFederal and State assistance programs such as Food Stamps, WIC, the \nNational School Lunch Program, and thousands of non-profit \norganizations, churches, faith-based groups, and dedicated individuals.\n\n  The challenges in America are to continue to find ways to provide \nAmericans that are food insecure with access to nutritious meals and \nopportunities to gain skills to improve their economic situation and \nquality of life.\n  To that end, today, along with my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, \nI am pleased to announce the formation of the U.S. Senate Hunger \nCaucus. We are delighted that many of our colleagues are joining us in \nthis bipartisan effort to work on national and international hunger \nissues. The Senate Hunger Caucus will be a vehicle through which \nSenators can work together to promote initiatives to help address the \nroot causes of hunger and to help form partnerships with the many \nvaluable organizations and programs that are committed to ending \nhunger.\n  Just a few hours ago, I was joined by my good friends, Senators Smith \nand Dole, at the D.C. Central Kitchen where we announced the formation \nof the Senate Hunger Caucus and discussed many of the key hunger issues \nin America. The D.C. Central Kitchen is located just a few blocks from \nthe U.S. Capitol and is a nationally known food rescue organization. \nThe D.C. Central Kitchen converts rescued or donated food into 4,000 \nmeals each day, 365 days a year, which feed the hungry in the \nWashington metropolitan area. As a part of the D.C. Central Kitchen \nprogram, unemployed people are trained to gain job skills that enable \nthem to find work in the culinary arts industry. The D.C. Central \nKitchen is a great model for taking wasted food and turning it into \nnutritious meals and economic opportunities for people in need.\n  We were pleased to be joined at today's event by representatives of \nmany of the national anti-hunger groups that we look forward to \npartnering with in this effort: Some of these groups include: America's \nSecond Harvest, American School Food Service Association, Bread for the \nWorld, Congressional Hunger Center, Food Research and Action Center, \nShare Our Strength, the World Food Program and Heifer International.\n  At this time, I want to recognize many of the Arkansas groups working \nto fight hunger and encourage nutritious living, and they include: \nArkansas Hunger Coalition, Arkansas Foodbank Network, Harvest \nTexarkana, Potluck, Inc., Arkansas Rice Depot, Northwest Arkansas \nFoodbank, Northeast Arkansas Foodbank, North Central Arkansas Foodbank, \nSouthwest Arkansas, Food bank, Bradley County Helping Hand, Ozark \nFoodbank, Memphis Foodbank, Winrock, Heifer International, Arkansas \nSchool Food Service Association, Arkansas Advocates for Children and \nFamilies, Arkansas Community Action Agencies, Arkansas Farmers and \nHunters Feeding the Hungry, local food pantries, churches and many \nothers who work to feed Arkansans in need. Many of these groups are \nalso using today as a time to talk about hunger and food insecurity.\n  In closing, it's easy for me to be passionate about the issue of \nhunger. As a farmer's daughter I was raised with an understanding of \nthe value of having access to food--to good, safe and nutritious food. \nAs the daughter of two compassionate, Christian parents I was taught to \nhelp others and to share my blessings with those in need. As a mother \nof two young boys I can empathize with the fear that a parent feels \nwhen they must answer a hungry child when there is no food to be eaten. \nJust the other day, one of my boys ran into the house and said ``Mom, \nI'm starving.'' And I replied, ``what would you like?'' Later on I \nthought about the mothers whose children ask the same question but they \ndon't have food to offer, they can't just reach into the cabinet to \npull out food. It was a devastating thought and my heart goes out to \nthe mothers and fathers who at times are not sure where the next meal \nis coming from.\n  My home State of Arkansas knows hunger. With almost 600,000 Arkansans \nliving below the national poverty line, hunger, food insecurity, \nobesity and limited access to nutritious foods are key issues. With a \nState population of 2.6 million, approximately 380,000 Arkansans live \nin food insecure households.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as well as \nhunger non-profit organizations in my State and across the Nation to \nfind solutions to hunger problems plaguing our nation and world. And to \ndream of the day when globally, working together to harness our vast \nresources, we can end hunger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6442-S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nand I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that \nwould add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal \nthat violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  David Blair, also known as Steve Perry, was found dead by the \nKetchikan, AK, police department on July 26, 2001. Terry Simpson, Jr., \n19, and Joshua Anderson, 20, were arrested in response to a tip in \nwhich the informant said he overhead the two men bragging that they \nwere planning to ``beat up and rob Blair because he is a fag.''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6443-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADVANCING MEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, I rise to address the alarming decision \nhanded down earlier this week by a District Court in California on \npartial birth abortion.\n  The judge's decision was wrong on many fronts. It is wrong on the \nmedical facts, and it is wrong in its blatant disregard of \nCongressional findings. Most importantly, the decision is also wrong on \nthe law. This ruling is unconstitutional, as well as violative of \nfundamental human rights, because it drives a wedge between biological \nhumanity which prenatal human offspring undeniably have, and legal \npersonhood i.e., the right to the equal protection of the law. The \nrepellant notion underlying Roe v. Wade--that there are ``subhuman'' \nmembers of the human species--conflicts directly with the very purposes \nof the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, which undid \nthe great injustice of treating black Americans as slaves and property \ninstead of as human beings entitled at law to full respect. I realize \nthat the Supreme Court has not yet repudiated this holding of Roe, \nwhich it imposed upon the Nation in 1973, but this case decided by one \ndistrict court in California is clearly going in a direction that \ncontradicts everything we value about the Constitution and the \nprinciples under which this Nation and its people operate.\n  First, Judge Phyllis Hamilton dismisses the overwhelming medical \nevidence that it is never medically necessary--to save the life of the \nmother or any other reason--to perform the gruesome partial-birth \nabortion procedure--in which a young human is partially born, so that \nonly the head remains in her mother, and then a sharp object pierces \nthe back of the child's head and sucks the child's brain out, killing \nthe child.\n  Think about that, a baby--a young human baby--is partially born, so \nthat only her head remains in her mother's birth canal. Then an \nabortion-provider punctures the back of the child's head with a \nsurgical instrument. Then the abortion provider suctions the young \nhuman's brains out, leaving the child dead, dead, dead.\n  There is no recourse for the young human. This is a cold-blooded \nmurder. And if this District Court has its way, the young child will \nnever receive justice for her gruesome murder.\n  Before I address Judge Hamilton's disregard of Congressional \nfindings, I want to talk in particular about the issue of fetal pain, \nwhich Judge Hamilton alleges is ``irrelevant.''\n  I would submit that were we to see a puppy have its head punctured \nand brains sucked out, we would not consider it irrelevant. We would be \nmoved to protect the puppy.\n  Yet, we are not talking about a dog; we are talking about a young \nhuman. And the judge in California says that pain is irrelevant when we \nare talking about a young human.\n  We are elected representatives. We have an obligation to defend the \nConstitution. This includes defending the right to life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness. First among these 3 is life. We have an \nobligation to defend the right to life for the most defenseless and \nhelpless among us. Our laws should protect the sanctity and dignity of \nevery innocent human life from the moment of conception.\n  Judge Hamilton notes that there is some debate within the medical \ncommunity on the issue of fetal pain. Then she acknowledges that: ``the \nposition that Congress has taken [on pain experienced by unborn \nchildren] is neither incorrect nor entirely unsupported.''\n  But then she disregards the Congressional finding that partial-birth \nabortion is never medically necessary and writes something incredibly \ncallous: ``[Pain experienced by unborn children] is, however, \nirrelevant to the question of whether the Act requires a health \nexception, as discussed in this court's conclusions of law.''\n  Irrelevant? First, partial-birth abortion is never medically \nnecessary, and since the gruesome partial-birth abortion procedure is \nnever medically necessary, an essential reason for abolishing this \ndreadful form of death is the terrible pain inflicted on the unborn \nchild.\n  Pain experienced by an unborn child is very relevant.\n  Just before the recess, I introduced the Unborn Child Pain Awareness \nAct, S. 2466, with nearly a quarter of the Members of this chamber as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  This legislation would require those who perform abortions on unborn \nchildren 20 weeks after fertilization to inform the woman seeking an \nabortion of the medical evidence that the unborn child feels pain.\n  The bill would also ensure that the woman, if she chooses to continue \nwith the abortion procedure after being given the medical information, \nhas the option of choosing anesthesia for the child, so that the unborn \nchild's pain is less severe.\n  Women should not be kept in the dark; women have the right to know \nwhat their unborn child experiences during an abortion. Unborn children \nshould be spared needless, deliberately-inflicted pain.\n  Many among us are unaware of the scientific, medical fact that unborn \nchildren can feel, but it is true. Not only can they feel, but their \nability to experience pain is heightened. The highest density of pain \nreceptors per square inch of skin in human development occurs in utero \nfrom 20 to 30 weeks gestation.\n  An expert report on fetal development, prepared for the partial birth \nabortion ban trials, notes that while unborn children are obviously \nincapable of verbal expressions, we know that they can experience pain \nbased upon anatomical, functional, physiological and behavioral \nindicators that are correlated with pain in children and adults.\n\n  Unborn children can experience pain. This is why unborn children are \noften\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nadministered anesthesia during in utero surgeries.\n  Think about the pain that unborn children can experience, and then \nthink about the more gruesome abortion procedures. Of course, we have \nheard about partial birth abortion, but also consider the D abortion. \nDuring this procedure, commonly performed after 20 weeks--when there is \nmedical evidence that the child can experience severe pain--the child \nis torn apart limb-from-limb. Think about how that must feel to a young \nhuman.\n  Pain is absolutely relevant to the subject at hand.\n  Oddly, one of Judge Hamilton's reasons for ruling against the \npartial-birth abortion ban is that: ``[Fetal pain] appears to be \nirrelevant to the question of whether [partial-birth abortions] should \nbe banned, because it is undisputed that if a fetus feels pain, the \namount is no less and in fact might be greater in D by \ndisarticulation than with the [partial-birth abortion] method.''\n  Apparently, Judge Hamilton believes that fetal pain is irrelevant to \nthe issue at hand because other abortions might be more painful. \nClearly, Judge Hamilton's logic is flawed.\n  Judge Hamilton's decision crosses the line. What we have seen in this \nweek's District Court decision is judicial bias and judicial activism \nat its extreme. Judge Hamilton egregiously reveals her own bias in \nfavor of abortion when she writes: ``The court found all of the \nplaintiffs' experts not only qualified to testify as experts, but \ncredible witnesses based largely on their vast experience in abortion \npractice. However, of the four government witnesses who were qualified \nas experts in ob/gyn, all revealed a strong objection either to \nabortion in general or, at a minimum, to the D method of abortion. \nThe court finds that their objections to entirely legal and acceptable \nabortion procedures color, to some extent, their opinions on the \ncontested intact D procedure.''\n  By her logic, those with moral objections to abortion are biased--or \n``colored''--in their views against abortion, but those who perform \nabortions for money are not at all biased--or ``colored''--in their \nviews favoring abortions.\n  Sadly, the action of this California District Court is simply the \nlatest instance of arrogant judges riding roughshod over the democratic \nprocess and constitutional law alike in a quest to impose a radical \nsocial agenda on America--in this case abortion on demand for any \nreason or no reason.\n  We are a democracy, not a people ruled by judicial dictate.\n  This district court decision is yet another example of why we need to \nreign in an increasingly reckless judiciary one, by means of stripping \ncourts of authority they have usurped from the people and their \nlegislative representatives, and two, through impeachment, when \nnecessary at both the Federal and State level.\n  Policy-making decisions--particularly those that have such sweeping \nsocial implications--must be made by the representatives of the people \nin a way that is respectful of long-established traditions and \nprinciples of our social order. When activist judges use their \npositions to achieve policy goals, they must be resolutely opposed.\n  As the partial-birth abortion ban litigation continues in Nebraska \nand New York, I remain hopeful that we will see much more restraint and \nreasonable rulings coming forth from the judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TENNESSEE VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I recently received an invitation to an \nannual reunion of Tennessee veterans who served together in the 236th \nCombat Engineers Battalion in Burma, India and China during World War \nII. Veterans of the 236th have been getting together every year for \nnearly 50 years, and the story of the reunions of the 236th is almost \nas interesting as those of the action they saw in northern Burma \nfighting the Japanese.\n  What began as a picnic at Memphis City Park in 1956 has evolved into \nan annual reunion of surviving members of the 236th, and their \nfamilies, on the second Sunday in July in Nashville. Veterans from the \n236th, who spent one of the most significant periods in history \ntogether, now sit around and reminisce about the experience that made \nthem men, rekindle old friendships, and honor the memories of their \nfallen comrades. Meanwhile, their families swim, shop, and attend \nevents together. In recent years however, only a handful of veterans of \nthe 236th are still able to attend, so the group has elected their \nchildren to take over responsibility for holding the reunions, even \nafter the last member of the 236th has passed on.\n  The 236th was created during World War II, an offspring of the 44th \nEngineer Combat Regiment at Camp McCoy, WI. After practicing maneuvers \nin Tennessee in 1943, the 236th was deployed to the China-Burma-India \nTheater, where they started work on the Ledo Road, a necessary allied \nsupply route through harsh jungle terrain at the base of the Himalayan \nMountains, and on the edge of Japanese-occupied territory.\n  Work on the Ledo Road was halted by a Japanese garrison, dug in, in \nthe town of Myitkyina, along the path of the road. General Stillwell, \nChief Commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, had tried to dislodge \nthe Japanese from Myitkyina in mid May, 1944, and had succeeded in \ntaking a nearby airstrip, but was repelled from the town by \nunexpectedly strong Japanese defenses. With these defenses and a front \nline force already weakened from fatigue, disease and wounds, Stillwell \ncalled up the 236th to the front lines. Men who had been used to \ndriving trucks and operating heavy equipment were suddenly picking up a \nrifle and heading into battle.\n  The Japanese had managed to assemble nearly 2,500 soldiers in \nMyitkyina in the final days of May to engage the 236th and another \nbattalion of combat engineers, the 209th. The battle for Myitkyina \nraged for 2 months and the engineers, fighting alongside poorly trained \nChinese soldiers, bore the brunt of the Japanese forces, defending \nagainst infantry attacks as well as artillery and mortar fire. The \nbattle resulted in victory for the allies, but at a heavy price: 56 \nkilled in action and another 142 wounded from the 236th alone. One of \nthese casualties was SGT Fred Coleman, who threw himself on a grenade \nin order to save the lives of his comrades.\n  The members of the 236th distinguished themselves in the battle for \nMyitkyina and earned the praise of their commanders. Stillwell himself \nwas impressed with the performance of the 236th, many of whom had not \npicked up a rifle since basic training: ``hats off to the engineers!'' \nAnd both battalions of combat engineers received the Presidential Unit \nCitation for their valiant efforts in battle.\n  Tennessee is the Volunteer State and the spirit of Tennessee is \nembodied in the 236th. From the battle of King's Mountain in the \nRevolutionary War, through the Mexican War, the Civil War, and our \ngreat World Wars, Tennesseans have answered the call. We have honored \nthose volunteers, and we have honored them as veterans.\n  We should especially honor our Tennessee sons and daughters today \nbecause so many--thousands--are serving in the war against terrorism--\nmen and women in active duty, the National Guard, and the reserves.\n  This summer, as we celebrate Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, the \ndedication of the new World War II Memorial and the 60th anniversary of \nD-Day, we should not only remember the actions and sacrifices of the \ngreat men and women who have come before us, such as those of the \n236th, but what their sacrifices have ensured for us: our freedom.\n  The best thing we can do this summer as we pay tribute to our \nveterans and soldiers is this: to try to show as much respect and honor \nto these great volunteers as they have always shown our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6444-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6444-S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ROBERT A.

Throughout his \nlife, Bob was a hard worker, devoted to public service and a man of \ngreat integrity and character. Bob began his public service career as a \ncongressional page at the young age of 15. Many promotions and two \ndecades later, he continued to help the U.S. Senate run smoothly. \nDuring these years, Bob\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nforged countless friendships with those around him and made \nimmeasurable contributions to the community.\n  Each and every day, Bob went above and beyond the call of duty to \nhelp Members of Congress, staff members and Capitol visitors find their \nway, whether it was through complex parliamentary procedure or to the \nnearest elevator in the Capitol. His vast knowledge of the Senate's \noperations was garnered from decades of public service. Following Bob's \ndays as a page, he served in the Democratic cloakroom, and was later \npromoted to deputy sergeant-at-arms, deputy assistant undersecretary of \nlegislative affairs at the Department of the Treasury, and Democratic \nstaff director for the Committee on House Administration. Bob retired \nfrom the Hill in 2002, having accrued enough years of service to make \nhim eligible for retirement. Too young and active, however, Bob \nreturned to work just months later at the Jefferson Consulting Group, \nwhere he quickly made a name for himself.\n  My dad, former Senator David Pryor, first met Bob during page school \nand saw in him the same quality as everyone else: a passion to help \nothers. Throughout the years, they remained close friends. Bob traveled \nto Arkansas to campaign several times for my dad, and later he joined \nme in Little Rock on the campaign trail. Even with all his \nqualifications and prestige, no job was too small. I remember him \ncanvassing in the Arkansas heat, stuffing envelopes and hammering yard \nsigns into the ground. And no job was too big or difficult. Following \nmy campaign, Bob helped me coordinate inauguration events and setup my \noffice, and he helped orient a number of my staff members who were new \nto Washington and the Senate. His willingness to do anything for \nanybody at anytime is what made Bob loved by so many.\n  Jim English, a former assistant Secretary of the Senate, said Bob was \n``the kind of person who would give you the shirt off his back. He was \na man with loyalty to the Senate and to his friends.''\n  Longtime friend Bill Norton who worked with Bob in the cloakroom and \nearlier as a page added, ``Bob loved Congress as an institution; those \nwere his happiest days.''\n  While he took his work seriously, Bob was also known to enjoy his \nweekends with friends and family on the Margaret B while fishing on the \nChesapeake. It was on such a day when Captain Bob was enjoying the \nafternoon on his boat, having just caught a 36-inch striper, when God \nchose to take Bob home.\n  Bob was also a devoted family man. As good as a friend he was to us, \nBob was an even better son, brother and uncle. I want to express my \ndeepest condolences to the Bean family: his mother Margaret; brothers, \nJohn, Kenneth and Brian; sister-in-law Patti; niece Rachel and nephew \nChristian.\n  Bob's commitment to service provides inspiration to us all. We will \nmiss Bob Bean. We will remember him well. We will celebrate his life, \nand we will try to live up to his dedication and generosity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FRENCHBURG JOB CORPS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the \nextraordinary efforts of one man who exemplifies the spirit which makes \nTennessee the volunteer state.\n  That man is Jim Ayers of Parsons, TN. Parsons sits at the \nintersection of Highway 412 and 69, just west of the banks of the \nTennessee River. It is the largest town in rural Decatur County. At 18, \nJim left home to attend Memphis State University. Working 30 hours a \nweek, he paid his way through college, graduating with a degree in \nbusiness administration. Jim was the first in his family to earn a \ncollege degree. He went on to success in a number of industries--from \nbanking and real estate to manufacturing and health care.\n  Many American success stories would end right there. For Jim, this \nwas just the beginning.\n  In 1999 Decatur's Riverside High School graduated 129 students and \nsent 36 on to post-secondary education. That's 27 percent. This month \n101 of 111, 90 percent, of students graduating from Riverside, will go \non to 2 and 4-year colleges and universities.\n  The difference between 1999 and 2004? Jim Ayers.\n  You see, Jim realized the opportunities he had because his parents \nhad motivated him to further his education. To perpetuate this \nencouragement, Jim created the Ayers Foundation Scholars Program. The \nprogram supplies counselors to assist every student with college \ncounseling and planning and grants renewable scholarships of up to \n$4,000 to any Decatur County student who wants to go on to college.\n  This year Jim's foundation disbursed $578,000 to more than 300 young \nmen and women attending 13 different schools. To meet any remaining \ntuition bills, counselors found an additional $800,000 in Federal and \nState grants and other scholarships. Since its inception, the \nfoundation has also spent in excess of $175,000 to help 68 teachers \nfrom Decatur and Henderson counties to obtain masters degrees or plus \n30 certification.\n  Last week at a dinner in honor of this first class of Ayers' \nfoundation graduates, Jim announced the foundation will begin funding \nscholarships for students at Henderson County's Scotts Hill High \nSchool. In addition, Jim committed to extend funding for advanced \ndegrees for teachers in Perry County.\n  Decatur's favorite son came home to make this a place where the \nAmerican dream thrives.\n  Mr. President, I have spent a lot of time thinking about leadership, \ncharacter, and education. Men like Jim serve as examples to us all of \nthe opportunity education provides and the difference one man can make \nin the fabric of the American character.\n  Thank you for allowing me to honor my friend Jim Ayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6445-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6445-S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LINDA KURZ\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and to \nremember an extraordinarily courageous young lady from New Jersey, Ms. \nMelissa Anne Centrella. It is with great sadness that I inform you that \nMelissa passed away 2 years ago. She was 25 years old when she died. In \nMelissa's short time here on Earth she displayed an uncommon grace and \ndignity which we all should emulate.\n  As a child, Melissa was like every young girl--she was cheerful, she \nloved her parents, and she loved to dance. However, Melissa was \ndiagnosed at an early age with the rare disorder called dystonia. \nDystonia is a neurological disorder characterized by powerful and \npainful involuntary muscle spasms that cause twisting of the body, \nrepetitive muscle movements, and sustained postural deformities. \nMelissa lived with the constant pain of dystonia for 18 years. As the \nyears passed, Melissa's life became more and more constrained. She was \neventually confined to a wheelchair and then bedridden. Melissa passed \naway from complications of this disorder.\n  Melissa endured many painful medical procedures to assess and attempt \nto treat dystonia. She suffered through a series of spinal taps, \nintrathecal pump implantations, and the preparations for deep brain \nstimulation surgery. Melissa, on several occasions, was overdosed with \nher medication leading to seizures and once to a 3-day coma. Through \nall the pain, she accepted her suffering with dignity and never once \ncomplained.\n  Melissa believed she was put on Earth for a reason, that God had a \nplan for her. That reason was to be a part of the mission to find a \ncure for dystonia, so that no one else would have to experience the \ntorture that she experienced in her short life. Many in her position \nwould have given up, but not Melissa. Melissa was relentless in pushing \nClaire, her mother, to establish the New Jersey Chapter of the Dystonia \nMedical Research Foundation, DMRF.\n  The chapter today holds many events to raise funds for dystonia \nresearch and promotes awareness of dystonia. Whenever Claire became \ndepressed or understandably overcome with distress, Melissa would \ngently prod her along and remind her of their mission together as a \nfamily. Melissa was the only child of Claire and August Centrella. I \nwould like to salute Claire Centrella and her family for picking up the \nmantle and running with it in memory of Melissa.\n  Melissa's body lost its battle; however, her soul battles on in her \nmother and the New Jersey Chapter to improve the quality of life for \nothers with dystonia. Melissa Centrella's memory will live on in those \nof us she touched and in those who share her mission. Melissa will \nnever be forgotten, and her mission will continue through her family's \nand friends' hard work and determination.\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nto remember a courageous young lady from New Jersey, Ms. Melissa Anne \nCentrella. Sadly, Melissa passed away 2 years ago, at the age of 25, \nfrom complications due to a disease known as dystonia. Much of \nMelissa's short life was dedicated to battling dystonia, which affects \nmore than 300,000 people in North America.\n  Melissa was diagnosed at an early age with dystonia, which is the \nthird most common movement disorder after Parkinson's disease and \ntremor. This neurological disease is characterized by powerful and \npainful involuntary muscle spasms that cause twisting of the body, \nrepetitive muscle movements and sustained postural deformities. \nAlthough she endured many painful medical procedures to treat her \ndystonia, Melissa never once complained. Instead, she became a part of \nthe effort to find a cure for dystonia, so no one else would have to \nexperience the pain she suffered in her short life.\n  Along with her mother Claire, Melissa worked relentlessly to \nestablish the New Jersey Chapter of the Dystonia Medical Research \nFoundation. The chapter today holds many events to raise funds for \ndystonia research and promotes awareness of dystonia. I would like to \nsalute the Centrella family for the work they have done to found and \nsupport the New Jersey Chapter of the foundation. Today, because of \nMelissa Centrella, her family and others who have fought alongside them \nagainst dystonia, we are closer than ever to a cure.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we recognize the fight against \ndystonia. Although there is not yet a cure for dystonia, we will \ncontinue the work of Melissa Centrella and remember her fight against \nthis disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6446-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6446-S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF HAMPSHIRE COUNTY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on this 3rd day of June, in \nthe year 2004, I am honored to commemorate the 250th birthday of \nHampshire County. This historically and culturally rich county \nshowcases the best of West Virginia, and I am very proud to represent \nthe citizens of this great county.\n  Hampshire County has a vibrant history beginning in the early 1700s, \nwhen tradesmen and hunters eager to begin a new life settled in the \nbeautiful wilderness. Settlers, such as John and Job Pearsall, built \nhouses in the area that would become known as Romney which has served \nas the county seat since 1762--some 200-plus years, which is longer \nthan Washington, DC has served as our capital city.\n  The history of Hampshire County encompasses many of the great \nconflicts in our Nation's early history. It was the turmoil of the \nFrench and Indian War that prevented official organization of the \ncounty in 1757, despite actual creation several years earlier. In 1794, \nmen from Hampshire County serving under GEN Daniel Morgan took part in \novercoming the Whiskey Rebellion. These brave men volunteered to quell \nthe rebellion. The county also endured the Civil War, and was \nfrequently occupied by either Confederate or Union Armies. In fact, \naccording to surviving records, Romney changed hands at least 56 times \nwhich is more frequently than any other city during the Civil War \nexcept for Winchester, VA.\n  Only a few years later, in 1870, Hampshire County became home to the \nState School for the Deaf and Blind through the efforts of Professor \nH.H. Johnson. The Romney Literary Society donated several buildings and \nland for the school, which was crucial to the decision regarding the \nschool's location in Romney. The school now serves over 275 students on \nthe 40-acre campus, and plays an integral role in the community.\n  Today, Hampshire County continues to be a great asset to the State of \nWest Virginia and our country. Hampshire County remains a pristine \nexample of West Virginia's natural beauty. Its many rivers and streams \nflow through the county and provide residents and visitors alike with \nrecreational and\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nfishing opportunities. An area along the South Branch of the Potomac \nRiver, known as the Trough, is visited frequently by those hoping to \nview the bald eagles that occupy the area. Ice Mountain is another \nexcellent location to observe eagles and the beautiful West Virginia \nscenery viewed from its peak. Ice Mountain contains small caves where \nice can be found throughout the hot summer days. Hampshire County is a \nfine example of all West Virginia has to offer--its sense of history \nand culture, its fine citizens, and its natural beauty.\n  Since its beginning, courageous settlers, who returned time and again \nto Hampshire County, laid the foundation that is now a well-known trait \nof all West Virginians--loyalty to the State they love. I am proud to \nrecognize Hampshire County, WV, on its 250th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIE J. BROWN\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to honor an \nextraordinary marine, LTC Willie J. Brown. Lieutenant Colonel Brown has \nserved for 29 years, 4 months and 4 days in service to our Nation. He \nbegan his military service as an ensign in the Navy and later earned a \ncommission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. He has \nserved in times of war and peace, and throughout he has given a full \nmeasure, as marines are renowned for doing. His awards include the \nMeritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the \nJoint Meritorious Unit Award, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, the \nNational Defense Service Medal with two stars, and the Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon.\n  During Lieutenant Colonel Brown's last active duty assignment, he \nserved as a legislative liaison officer in the Marine Corps' Office of \nLegislative Affairs. That office supports Members of Congress and the \ncongressional committees on issues relating to the Marine Corps and the \nsecurity of our Nation. In this position, Colonel Brown played a vital \nrole in ensuring that responses to all inquiries and congressional \nrequests for information and inquiries were provided quickly, \naccurately, and completely; thereby, allowing Members of this body the \nability to readily address issues of national importance.\n  Some of Lieutenant Colonel Brown's many responsibilities included \nexpert preparation of Marine Corps leadership for congressional \ntestimony on high-interest military programs and assisting Members on \ncongressional travel to visit military installations throughout the \ncontinental United States. His attention to detail in all matters was \nunsurpassed, and his complete grasp of the facets of naval warfare \nhelped to ensure a bright future for our Marine Corps.\n  Prior to joining the Office of Legislative Affairs, Lieutenant \nColonel Brown spent the majority of his Marine Corps career in the \naviation field. He started as a second lieutenant with the 2nd Marine \nAircraft Wing and continued to rise through the ranks. He went on to \nbecome the commanding officer of Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 26. \nUnder his superb leadership, that squadron won the wing's ``Squadron of \nthe Year'' award for three consecutive years. The commandant also \nrecognized his squadron with the Marine Corps Quality Improvement Award \nfor Excellence.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Brown is a learned, professional marine, as \nevidenced by his attendance at the School of Advanced Warfare, and the \nMarine Corps Command and Staff College. Further, he is a well-rounded, \nnative Georgian who willingly serves his fellow man. While assigned as \nthe special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for \nManpower and Reserve Affairs, he was awarded the Roy Wilkins \nDistinguished Service Award by the NAACP. This award is granted each \nyear to one marine who has made personal sacrifices resulting in \nsignificant contributions in the areas of civil and human rights.\n  As a leader of marines, Lieutenant Colonel Brown has made a lasting \ncontribution to the Marine Corps and will be sorely missed by those who \nhave had the opportunity to serve with him. I join with his friends and \nfamily as he celebrates this richly deserved retirement. I wish him, \nhis wife Cynthia, and their family my best as he enjoys every day of \nthis new journey. Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6447-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SAMUEL JOHNSON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life \nof Samuel Johnson, an environmental champion, an inspired business \nleader and one of Wisconsin's greatest philanthropists.\n  Sam Johnson, who passed away on May 22, 2004, was known \ninternationally for taking his 118-year-old family business called \nJohnson Wax and turning it into the consumer products giant, SC Johnson \n& Son, Inc. Sam was as generous as he was successful. He was beloved by \nhis home community of Racine as well as the entire State of Wisconsin \nfor his generous donations to the communities where he did business, \nand to the long list of organizations and causes that he served. Sam's \ngenerosity was instrumental in revitalizing his home community of \nRacine.\n  After attending Cornell and Harvard, Sam served as an Air Force \nintelligence officer. When Sam returned to Wisconsin, he joined the \nfamily business, helping make products like Pledge and Glade household \nnames. Sam became the fourth generation to take over the family \nbusiness in 1966 and helped it grow into four global businesses \nemploying over 28,000 people before retiring in 2000 and leaving the \nbusiness to a fifth generation.\n  Sam was widely recognized as a defender of the environment. In 1975, \nhe proactively banned the use of harmful CFCs in aerosol products 3 \nyears before the U.S. banned the ozone-harming substances. He served as \nchairman of the board for the Nature Conservancy, to which he donated \n$1 million in 1994 and later donated 18,000 acres in Brazil. In 1993, \nFortune Magazine called him ``corporate America's leading \nenvironmentalist.''\n  A few years ago, I had the distinct pleasure of participating in a \nproject undertaken by Sam, as well as Fisk and Curt Johnson, two of his \nchildren. Sam and his sons took their piloting skills to Brazil to \nrecreate and document a flight made by Sam's father, Herbert, in 1935, \nwhile searching for carnauba palm wax in Brazil. The documentary that \nresulted from the trip was a moving testimony to Sam's own troubles \nwith alcoholism and distant relationship with his father. The film \nearned national attention and helped people across the country deal \nwith their own problems with alcohol. I was deeply honored when I was \nasked to help host a screening of this incredible film.\n  That documentary was just one of the many achievements for which Sam \nJohnson will be remembered and just one of the many reasons he will be \nso deeply missed. I know that I am grateful for his lasting \ncontributions to the State of Wisconsin, and for his unwavering \ncommitment to the communities and causes he served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6447-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT TO CONGRESS CONCERNING THE EXTENSION OF WAIVER AUTHORITY FOR THE \n                       REPUBLIC OF BELARUS--PM 81\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) of \nthe Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Act''), as amended, with respect to the \ncontinuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of \nsection 402 of the Act to the Republic of Belarus.

A bill to amend the securities laws to provide for enhanced \nmutual fund investor protections, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nwould bring needed changes to our financial markets so that the \ninterests of America's small individual investors are protected and \ndefended.\n  The recent revelations about unethical and illegal practices in the \nmutual fund industry have been deeply disturbing--to me and to ordinary \ninvestors throughout the country. In November 2003, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Management, the Budget, \nand International Security heard testimony from the Director of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) Enforcement Division about \na survey of fund practices that the SEC had just completed. The survey \nfound that half of the largest 88 mutual funds had permitted a practice \ncalled market-timing, which allows some investors to trade quickly in \nand out of the funds, even though many of those funds had explicit \npolicies against such trading because of its detrimental impact on \nother investors in the fund. The survey also found that a full one-\nquarter of the brokerage firms it looked at indicated that they had \nallowed certain customers to engage in late-trading, an illegal \npractice that allows favored investors to execute trades based on that \nday's price after the market had closed, when new information had come \nto light. Perhaps most shocking, the survey found that, in some cases, \nfund company officials profited personally at the expense of their \ncustomers by market-timing their own funds. In a later hearing, we \nlearned about the problem of excessive fees at some funds and the fact \nthat such fees may not be prominently disclosed to investors or, as is \nthe case with some types of fees, not disclosed at all.\n  These concerns are of particular importance because, in a very real \nsense, mutual fund investments are investments in the American dream. \nThey hold the nest eggs, the retirement savings, and the college funds \nfor millions of America's working families. But they also feed capital \ninto today's economy, fueling the engine that creates and maintains \nAmerican jobs. Mutual funds are where so many Americans put their \nmoney: 95 million people, at last count, own shares in these funds. \nIndeed, in the wake of the Enron scandal, when investigators uncovered \nwidespread deceptions and conflicts of Wall Street stock analysts, \nconventional wisdom said average investors would find safe haven in \nmutual funds rather than in individual stocks. It is therefore \nparticularly--and--ironically disheartening to see the scandals and \nbreaches of trust that have now afflicted the mutual fund industry.\n  The recent revelations about mutual funds, however, provides us with \nthe opportunity and the responsibility to accomplish real, structural \nreform in the fund industry. That is why I have joined with Senator \nAkaka and Senator Fitzgerald in introducing S. 1822, the Mutual Fund \nTransparency Act, and why I have also joined Senators Corzine and Dodd \nin introducing S. 1971, the Mutual Fund Investor Confidence Restoration \nAct. Both of these bills take on many of the significant mutual fund \nproblems that have come to light in recent months. Together, they bar \nlate trading and discourage market timing; reform mutual fund \ngovernance rules to require that the chairman and 75 percent of board \nmembers of mutual fund companies be independent and strengthen the \ndefinition of independent; require far more extensive disclosure of \nfund fees and expenses; and work to increase financial literacy.\n  But beyond these important, basic reforms, we need to craft new \napproaches that address the changing nature of this country's investor \nclass. In the last two decades, a near-revolutionary expansion in the \nnumber of people participating in the financial markets has occurred. \nSince 1980, we've seen the share of U.S. households owning mutual funds \nsoar from less than 6 percent to nearly 50 percent in 2002. The number \nof families owning stocks, directly or indirectly through funds, has \nincreased 60 percent in the last fifteen years and, as of 2001, \nexceeded half of all families. Along with this phenomenon, and \ncontributing to it, we've seen individuals increasingly taking \nresponsibility for investing their own retirement money--a \nresponsibility that was once entrusted to professionals . It used to be \nthat employees were typically enrolled in so-called ``defined benefit'' \npension plans that guaranteed them certain income and for which the \nemployer took responsibility for investing the money properly. Now \nindividuals are more frequently given responsibility for investing \ntheir retirement savings themselves through 401(k) plans. In fact, \nsince 1983, the number of defined-benefit plans has declined over 70 \npercent, while participation in 401(k) plans has been increasing. \nForty-eight million Americans now have 401(k) plans.\n  Neither changes in the law, nor changes by federal regulators, \nhowever, have kept pace with the increasing participation and the \nincreasing responsibilities of small investors. When the Investment \nCompany Act was enacted in 1940, it brought sweeping changes, and, for \nthe first time, Federal regulation, to the fund industry, which had \nbeen fraught with fraud and abuse in the 1920's. The 1940 Act and the \nother securities laws passed in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash \nwere instrumental in restoring investor confidence and in establishing \nthe basic disclosure regime that continues to undergird securities \nregulation today. But the 1940 Act remains much as it was when it was \nenacted, and disclosure requirements that once appeared radical now \noften result in forms of technical compliance that little serve average \ninvestors who have neither the time nor guidance to find their way \nthrough the verbiage of fund disclosures. Nor has the SEC, created in \nthe same era and charged with protecting investors, adequately kept up \nwith the shifting makeup and needs of contemporary investors. To its \ncredit, the SEC in recent months has made a number of changes and \nproposals specifically to address the problems uncovered in the mutual \nfund industry, and in the 1990's it undertook a serious effort to \nensure that more securities documents were written in ``plain \nEnglish.'' The Commission, however, has not accomplished the more \nfundamental reorientation that I believe is called for--and that indeed \nI did call for in the aftermath of the Enron scandal--to an agency that \ndoes not merely regulate and punish the securities industry but \naffirmatively and proactively seeks ways to assist and protect ordinary \ninvestors.\n  The Small Investor Protection Act that I am introducing today would \nbring about these needed changes by ensuring that the SEC is more \nroutinely attuned to the needs of average investors. In doing so, this \nbill serves as an important complement to, though surely not a \nreplacement for, the other mutual fund reform legislation I have \ncosponsored. And I am pleased that the bill has the support of the \nConsumer Federation of America, Fund Democracy, Inc., Public Citizen's \nCongress Watch, Consumer Action and Consumers Union.\n  To accomplish the goal of better protecting small investors, the bill \nwould take the following four steps:\n  1. Create a Division of the Investor. Too often in recent years, the \ninterests of ordinary investors have not seemed to be the driving force \nbehind the Commission's regulatory actions. Wall Street's \nrepresentatives regularly meet with Commission staff to comment on each \nnew Commission proposal but the voice of the small investor has been \nharder to hear. To ensure that the voices of small investors are heard, \nmy bill would create a separate division within the Commission--coequal \nwith the other four major divisions at the SEC--to provide for a \npermanent and institutionalized advocate for the interests of ordinary \ninvestors. The Division of the Investor would be responsible for such \nthings as providing the small investor's perspective on new rule and \npolicy proposals, identifying new issues of particular concern to small \ninvestors, and serving as a conduit for the concerns of outside \nadvocates for small investors.\n  2. Establish an Office of Risk Assessment. As part of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's investigation into the Enron scandal, \nformer Senator Thompson and I released a bipartisan staff report \nconcluding, among other things, that the SEC needed to move away from \nsimply reacting to cases of financial fraud to actively rooting out \nfraud. In other words, the SEC needed to ``reconceptualize its role as \na more proactive force in protecting the marketplace against financial \nfraud.'' This conclusion has only been reinforced by\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nthe fact that the recent and widespread problems in the mutual fund \nindustry were apparently not identified by the Commission but were \nuncovered by others. I am therefore very encouraged that Chairman \nDonaldson has announced the creation of an Office of Risk Assessment to \ngather and analyze data on new trends and risks and identify new areas \nof concern for the Commission. This effort, in my view, is critical to \nprotecting small investors because it will increase the likelihood that \npractices detrimental to small investors will be proactively identified \nand addressed before they reach scandalous proportions. To ensure the \nSEC continues to pursue this important function, my bill would provide \nformal legislative recognition to the Office of Risk Assessment and \ninstitutionalize its responsibilities.\n  3. Require Consumer Research to Gauge Whether Disclosures are Easily \nUnderstood by Consumers. The disclosure of information to investors is \nfundamental to securities regulation in the U.S. With respect to mutual \nfunds, for instance, the SEC requires a wide array of disclosures to be \nmade in prospectuses, annual reports to shareholders, advertising, and \nin other media. None of these disclosures, however, is likely to serve \nits intended purpose if ordinary investors can't understand them. There \nis little empirical evidence on whether investors do in fact understand \nthe disclosures being made. Although the SEC has from time-to-time \nengaged in consumer research, such as surveys, focus groups, etc., it \ndoes not routinely or systematically test its proposed disclosures to \ndetermine if they are likely to be understood by ordinary investors. My \nbill would change that by requiring that the Commission consider \nempirical consumer research to determine whether a proposed \ndisclosure--including its wording, format, and the context in which it \nappears--is likely to improve the understanding of ordinary investors.\n  4. Require Investment Companies to Provide Brief, Easy-to-Understand \nDisclosures of Mutual Fund Characteristics. All too often, the \nimportant details of a mutual fund purchase are lost among the pages \nand pages an investor receives from his or her investment company. That \nis why the Small Investor Protection Act would also require investment \ncompanies to provide purchasers with a brief summary that will clearly \nand succinctly outline the relevant characteristics of a mutual fund. \nIdeally, this summary would be on a single page, and it could not \nexceed four pages; it would include information such as expenses and \nrisks associated with the fund, as well as the degree to which the fund \nis diversified. By providing this information in an easy-to-understand \nformat, the Act would help investors make decisions about which funds \nare best suited to their particular needs and financial goals.\n  If enacted, these proposals, taken as a whole, would go a long way \ntowards reorienting the regulation of our financial markets to better \naddress the needs of the small investors who have become such an \nintegral part of our economy and for whom investments in the market \nhave become such a large part of their economic security. These \nproposals would ensure that the concerns of ordinary investors receive \nas much prominence in regulatory decisions as the concerns of Wall \nStreet giants, that average investors receive relevant information in a \nform they can understand, and that they are better protected from \nexisting conflicts of interest.\n  In short, this legislation would help level the playing field for \nsmall investors. That is something that we need to do to restore \nconfidence to our financial markets, which have been damaged by more \nthan two years of scandals, and that we must do because it is the right \nthing for the millions of Americans who are saving and investing to \nprovide a better future for themselves and their children. They deserve \nnothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of this legislation \nfrom Consumer Federation of America, Fund Democracy, Inc., Public \nCitizen's Congress Watch, Consumer Action and Consumers Union be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Consumer Federation of America, Fund Democracy, Inc., \n           Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Consumer Action, \n           Consumers Union,\n                                                     May 18, 2004.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: We are writing on behalf of \n     Consumer Federation of America, Fund Democracy, Public \n     Citizen, Consumer Action, and Consumers Union, to express our \n     strong support for your draft bill to give greater prominence \n     to the concerns of individual investors, particularly small \n     investors, in the policy and rulemaking of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission.\n       The last several decades have seen a dramatic expansion of \n     the investor class. Many of these new investors are middle \n     class workers with little financial sophistication and less \n     experience with the securities markets. The major laws that \n     govern our markets were not written with these investors in \n     mind. Although the laws have been continually updated and \n     revised to address changing market conditions, individual \n     investors often find it difficult to have their voices heard \n     during those policy debates.\n       The recent mutual fund reform efforts offer a number of \n     examples of how policies are often developed with little \n     apparent thought to the needs of average, unsophisticated \n     investors. One such example involves the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission's efforts to improve mutual fund cost \n     disclosure. Among other reforms they advocated, investor \n     advocates argued in favor of individualized cost disclosure \n     on mutual fund account statements on the grounds that this \n     was the place where the disclosures were most likely to be \n     seen by average investors and their impact understood. The \n     SEC quickly rejected that approach, however, echoing industry \n     arguments that the disclosures would be too costly.\n       In reaching its conclusion, the Commission gave little \n     apparent consideration to how the account statement \n     disclosures might be provided. In fact, one mutual fund \n     company, MFS, has since announced that it has found an \n     economical way to do so. This suggests that, had the SEC not \n     been so quick to dismiss the views of investor advocates, it \n     might have been equally successful in finding a cost-\n     effective way to provide account statement cost disclosures. \n     Instead, the Commission opted for new hypothetical \n     disclosures in annual and semi-annual reports. Again, despite \n     serious questions raised by investor advocates, the \n     Commission appears to have made no effort to determine \n     whether their alternative approach would be effective in \n     reaching the unsophisticated investors who are not well \n     served by the current disclosure system.\n       Your legislation would help to rectify this situation \n     through several means. First, it would create an office with \n     a formally recognized role representing the interests of \n     individual investors, and small investors in particular, in \n     identifying areas of concern or where additional protections \n     are needed, analyzing rule proposals, and serving as a \n     liaison between investor organizations and the Commission. In \n     particular, the provision requiring that the views of the \n     Director of the Division of the Investor be included, in \n     summary form, in all rule proposals should help to give real \n     clout to this office as those rule proposals are being \n     developed.\n       We also support the requirement that the Commission \n     consider content, format, and placement when developing new \n     disclosure proposals to ensure that they are likely to be \n     effective. Too often, disclosures investors receive read as \n     though they had been written by lawyers to communicate with \n     other lawyers. Your legislation should help to ensure that \n     new disclosures are written with an eye toward how to convey \n     information effectively to average investors. We would like \n     to see this provision expanded, to require a review over \n     several years of all existing disclosures in light of the \n     same considerations.\n       The bill's specific requirement for pre-sale disclosure \n     covering key information about mutual funds would also \n     benefit investors by giving them the bare minimum information \n     they need to make an informed decision, at a time when it is \n     useful to them in making their purchase decision, and in a \n     form they are able to understand. Investor advocates have \n     long advocated such an approach, and our organizations have \n     recently reiterated our support for simplified pre-sale \n     disclosure as part of a comprehensive mutual fund reform \n     agenda.\n       Finally, our organizations have applauded Chairman \n     Donaldson for his publicly stated commitment to improving the \n     Commission's risk assessment practices. Your legislation \n     supports that goal by codifying it. This will help to ensure \n     that this important initiative does not get left by the \n     wayside once new leadership, with new priorities, takes over \n     the agency.\n       Small investors play a crucial role in our markets. They \n     should be given equally prominent consideration in the \n     policies that govern those markets. Your legislation would \n     help to bring that about. We look forward to working with you \n     to win its passage.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection.\n     Travis Plunkett,\n       Legislative Director Consumer Federation of America.\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\n     Frank Clemente,\n       Director Public Citizen's Congress Watch.\n     Sally Greenberg,\n       Senior Counsel Consumers Union.\n     Mercer Bullard,\n       Founder and President Fund Democracy, Inc.\n     Kenneth McEldowney,\n       Executive Director Consumer Action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2500. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in \ndeveloping countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Assistance for \nOrphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of \n2004.\n  The unprecedented AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has \nprofound implications for political stability, development, and human \nwelfare that extend far beyond the region. Sub-Saharan African nations \nstand to lose generations of educated and trained professionals who can \ncontribute meaningfully to their countries' development. Orphaned \nchildren, many of whom are homeless, are more likely to resort to \nprostitution and other criminal behavior to survive. Most \nfrighteningly, these uneducated, poorly socialized, and stigmatized \nyoung adults are extremely vulnerable to being recruited into criminal \ngangs, rebel groups, or extremist organizations that offer shelter and \nfood and act as ``surrogate'' families. It is imperative that the \ninternational community respond to this crisis that threatens stability \nwithin individual countries, the region, and around the world.\n  An estimated 110 million orphans live in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, \nLatin America, and the Caribbean. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is rapidly \nexpanding the orphan population. Currently an estimated 14 million \nchildren have been orphaned by AIDS, most of whom live in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. This number is projected to soar to more than 25 million by \n2010. The pandemic is orphaning generations of African children and is \ncompromising the overall development prospects of their countries.\n  Most orphans in the developing world live in extremely disadvantaged \ncircumstances. Poor communities in the developing world struggle to \nmeet the basic food, clothing, health care, and educational needs of \norphans. Experts recommend supporting community-based organizations to \nassist these children. Such an approach enables the children to remain \nconnected to their communities, traditions, rituals, and extended \nfamilies.\n  My bill seeks to improve assistance to orphans and other vulnerable \nchildren in developing countries. It would require the United States \nGovernment to develop a comprehensive strategy for providing such \nassistance and would authorize the President to support community-based \norganizations that provide basic care for orphans and vulnerable \nchildren.\n  Orphans are less likely to be in school, and more likely to be \nworking full time. Yet only education can help children acquire the \nknowledge and develop the skills they need to build a better future. \nStudies have shown that school food programs provide an incentive for \nchildren to stay in school. School meals provide basic nutrition to \nchildren who otherwise do not have access to reliable food.\n  For many children, the primary barrier to an education is the expense \nof school fees, uniforms, supplies, and other costs. My bill aims to \nimprove enrollment and access to primary school education by supporting \nprograms that reduce the negative impact of school fees and other \nexpenses. It also would reaffirm our commitment to international school \nlunch programs.\n  Many children who lose one or both parents often face difficulty in \nasserting their inheritance rights. Even when the inheritance rights of \nwomen and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to \nclaim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or \nimpossible for a widow--even if she has small children--to claim \nproperty after the death of her husband. This often leaves the most \nvulnerable children impoverished and homeless. My bill seeks to support \nprograms that protect the inheritance rights of orphans and widows with \nchildren.\n  The AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide. Every 14 \nseconds another child is orphaned by AIDS. Turning the tide on this \ncrisis will require a coordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I \nam hopeful that Senators will join me in backing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assistance for Orphans and \n     Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 110,000,000 orphans live in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. These \n     children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating \n     ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic \n     needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational \n     expenses.\n       (2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do \n     not attend school and that the majority of such children are \n     young girls. According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more \n     likely to be working full time.\n       (3) School food programs, including take-home rations, in \n     developing countries provide strong incentives for children \n     to remain in school and continue their education. School food \n     programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive \n     functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.\n       (4) The lack of financial resources prevents many orphans \n     and other vulnerable children in developing countries from \n     attending school because of the requirement to pay school \n     fees and other costs of education. Providing children with \n     free primary school education, while simultaneously ensuring \n     that adequate resources exist for teacher training and \n     infrastructure, would help more orphans and other vulnerable \n     children obtain a quality education.\n       (5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can \n     trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional \n     withdrawal and negatively affect a child's performance in \n     school and the child's social relations. Children living in \n     families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by \n     AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing \n     culturally appropriate psychological counselling to such \n     children can assist them in successfully accepting and \n     adjusting to their circumstances.\n       (6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing \n     countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter \n     difficulties in claiming the land and other property which \n     they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of \n     women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are \n     difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries \n     it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has \n     young children, to claim property after the death of her \n     husband.\n       (7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on \n     children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and \n     jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children \n     in affected areas.\n       (8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of \n     orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living \n     conditions of the world's poorest and most vulnerable \n     children. AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, \n     especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been \n     hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or \n     both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over \n     250,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.\n       (9) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the \n     needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended \n     families and local communities continue to be the primary \n     providers of support for such children.\n       (10) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on \n     communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. \n     Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-\n     based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the \n     massive number of orphans that has resulted from the \n     pandemic.\n       (11) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has \n     implications for political stability, human welfare, and \n     development that extend far beyond the region, affecting \n     governments and people worldwide, and this crisis requires an \n     accelerated response from the international community.\n       (12) Although, section 403(b) of the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)) establishes the requirement that not \n     less than 10 percent of amounts appropriated\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n     for HIV/AIDS assistance for each of fiscal years 2006 through \n     2008 shall be expended for assistance for orphans and other \n     vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, there is an urgent \n     need to provide assistance to such children prior to 2006.\n       (13) Numerous United States and indigenous private \n     voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, \n     provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children \n     in developing countries. Many of these organizations have \n     submitted applications for grants to the United States Agency \n     for International Development to provide increased levels of \n     assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in \n     developing countries.\n       (14) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided \n     by the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development through United States and \n     indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-\n     based organizations, will provide greater protection for \n     orphans and other vulnerable children in developing \n     countries.\n       (15) It is essential that the United States Government \n     adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of \n     assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in \n     developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure \n     that important services, such as basic care, mental health \n     and related services, school food programs, increased \n     educational opportunities and employment training and related \n     services, and the protection and promotion of inheritance \n     rights for such children, are made more accessible.\n       (16) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children \n     can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the \n     United States Government that--\n       (A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector \n     coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of \n     efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and\n       (B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-\n     based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable \n     children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of \n     their families and communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR ORPHANS AND OTHER VULNERABLE CHILDREN \n                   IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following section:\n\n     ``SEC. 135.

A bill to allow seniors to file their Federal income tax on \na new Form 1040S; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Simple Tax for \nSeniors Act. This bill would allow seniors age 65 and older with Social \nSecurity and pension income to file a short form similar to the 1040EZ \nInternal Revenue Service form.\n  Under current IRS rules, millions of Americans are prohibited from \nusing the 1040EZ short form simply because they are age 65 or older. \nMany currently file using only the standard deduction.\n  The Simple Tax for Seniors Act would crate the new 1040S form, \nallowing seniors who receive pension income to avoid filing the \nburdensome and complicated itemized deduction forms. As many as 11 \nmillion seniors would be able to file in the first year, in less time, \non a simplified, two-page form. Seniors no longer would be forced \nannually to disclose more information on their retirement savings and \npension plan than necessary.\n  The Simple Tax for Seniors Act makes no change in the tax code \nitself, so taxpayers using the new form would pay the same amount as \nunder Standard Form 1040.\n  This is common sense legislation. It is a win for seniors because it \nwill make life easier and it is a win for taxpayers since it will cost \nless to process the new form. It is also non-controversial. On Tuesday, \nthe House of Representatives passed similar legislation by a vote of \n418-0.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this sensible legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill appear with this statement \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make permanent the reduction in taxes on dividends \nand capital gains; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in celebrating the first \nanniversary of the Jobs and Growth Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003, \nwhich was signed into law by President Bush on May 28, 2003. Also, I \nwant to announce that today I am introducing legislation to make the \ndividends and long-term capital gains tax cuts permanent.\n  It has been one year since Congress and President Bush joined \ntogether to enact pro-growth, supply-side tax cuts. Now, since some in \nthe Senate are proposing that we repeal the tax cuts--this would be one \nof the largest tax increases in history--let's review the impact these \ncuts have had on our economy.\n  The 2003 tax cuts have triggered the fastest growing economy in two \ndecades. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 8.2 \npercent in the third quarter of 2003, 4.1 percent in the fourth \nquarter, and 4.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004. If we sustain \nthis pace, our economy will double in 13 years. When the tax cuts were \nenacted last year, the national unemployment rate was 6.3 percent. \nToday, it has dropped nearly 11 percent to 5.6 percent, which is lower \nthan the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. A \ngrowing economy means good, high-paying jobs and a better quality of \nlife for all Americans.\n  I want to draw my colleagues' attention to research published by the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)--the Nation's leading \nnonprofit economic research organization. This study demonstrates that \nthe 2003 tax cuts corrected a terrible mistake we made in 2001 when we \nphased in the marginal rate cuts. The phase-in of the 2001 tax cuts \nprompted workers and firms to delay work until the tax cuts were fully \nimplemented. Employment, output, and investment actually fell in \nresponse to the phased-in tax cuts.\n  The NBER study found that, ``Just as the phased-in nature of the 2001 \ntax law may have delayed production and employment, the immediate tax \nrelief included in the 2003 law may have contributed towards the \nincreased pace of economic activity in the second half of 2003.'' I am \nconfident that, as more economic data comes in and as the 2003 tax cuts \nare studied further, we will find that the 2003 tax cuts are directly \nresponsible for the economic growth we are seeing today.\n  The NBER study demonstrates that individuals really do delay economic \nactivity in anticipation of lower future tax rates. It also \ncorroborates the theory that high marginal tax rates cause individuals \nto restrict economic activity in order to minimize the tax burden \nimposed on their next dollar earned. Because the tax cuts were \naccelerated in 2003, individuals had an incentive to work harder and \nlonger immediately because their next dollar of income would be taxed \nat a lower rate.\n  Among the taxpayers benefited by the reductions in the individual \nrate are America's small businesses. The top individual rate is often \ncalled the small business rate because most small businesses are \norganized as pass-through entities, which pay at individual rates. \nOwners of pass-through entities, including small business owners and \nentrepreneurs, comprise more than two-thirds, about 500,000, of the \n750,000 tax returns that benefited from speeding up the reduction in \nthe top tax bracket. These small business owners received 79 percent, \nabout $10.4 billion, of the $13.3 billion in tax relief from \naccelerating the reduction in the top tax bracket to 35 percent.\n  The task for us now is to make the individual rate reductions \npermanent. If Congress fails to act, the tax cuts will expire at the \nend of 2010. The bottom rate would increase from 10 percent to 15 \npercent, an increase of 33 percent; the top rate would increase from 35 \npercent to 39.6 percent, an increase of 11 percent. The effect such tax \nincreases would have on our economy would be devastating.\n  Not only did Congress and President Bush work together to bring down \nindividual income tax rates, but we also reduced the tax on dividend \ndistributions and long-term capital gains. Before the 2003 tax cuts, \nour tax code actually discouraged dividend payouts. The 2003 tax cut \nlowered the tax rate imposed on dividends from 38.6 percent to 15 \npercent through 2008. Before 2003, corporate earnings were taxed once \nat the corporate level, 35 percent, and again at the individual rate, \nas high as 38.6 percent, meaning they were double-taxed. It made no \nsense for investors to seek out dividend-paying stocks, from a tax \nperspective.\n  While dividends are still double-taxed, the tax penalty is greatly \nreduced. This has made dividend-paying stocks more attractive to \ninvestors, which has helped companies raise capital to expand and grow \ntheir businesses. Further, because dividends must be paid from cash, \ncompanies that pay dividends must have actual profits, thus making it \nmore difficult for companies to hide financial mismanagement.\n  Some of my colleagues want to repeal the dividend tax cut. This is \nobviously misguided, since we have strong evidence that the dividend \ntax cut has worked. Since the 2003 tax cut was signed into law, 374 \ncompanies on the S 500 pay dividends--an increase of 22 companies. \nCompanies have increased dividend payments to shareholders by 40 \npercent, reversing a two-decade decline. The Dow Jones Industrial index \nhas risen more than 1,400 points since the 2003 tax cuts were signed \ninto law.\n  Similarly the capital gains tax cut has also encouraged economic \ngrowth. It reduced the tax imposed on long-term capital gains from 20 \npercent to 15 percent. This has made it more attractive for individuals \nto risk their hard-earned money by investing it in businesses. The \nresult is that it is easier for businesses to raise needed capital to \nexpand and create new jobs. Stock market gains, the strong GDP we have \nexperienced, and falling unemployment all indicate that the economy has \nrecovered.\n  Now, to help our economy to continue to grow and create new jobs, the \ndividend and capital gains tax cuts must be made permanent. If we allow \nthe dividend rate to return to the individual rate, we will increase \ntaxes on dividends by 62 percent. Allowing the capital gains rate to \nreturn to 20 percent will be a 25 percent tax increase. We must make \nthe 15 percent rate for each permanent, and then we must work to reduce \nboth the dividends and the capital gains rates to zero, so that we \neliminate the double-taxation of corporate earnings. The Senate bill \nactually would have brought the dividend tax rate to zero for three \nyears, but the agreement that we worked out with the House was to tax \ndividends at 15 percent. The dividends and capital gains tax relief \nwill expire in 2009.\n  The most important thing we can do next year is make the 2003 tax \ncuts permanent. Today I am introducing legislation that will make the \ndividends and capital gains tax relief permanent. I will work to make \nthe individual income tax rate cuts permanent as well. To allow the tax \ncuts to expire--or worse, to seek to higher taxes at the very time our \neconomy has pulled out of the recession and is growing strong--would be \nunthinkable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S.J. Res. 38. A joint resolution providing for the appointment of Eli \nBroad as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian \nInstitution; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Senate Joint \nResolution appointing a citizen regent to the Board of Regents of the \nSmithsonian Institution. I am pleased that my fellow Smithsonian \nInstitution Regents, Senators Frist and Leahy, are cosponsors.\n  The Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents recently recommended the \nfollowing distinguished individual for appointment to a 6-year term on \nthe on the Board: Eli Broad of California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his biography and the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\n  There being no objection, the biography and the joint resolution were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                               Eli Broad\n\n       Eli Broad is a renowned business leader who built two \n     Fortune 500 companies from the ground up over a five-decade \n     career in business. He is chairman of AIG Retirement Services \n     Inc. (formerly SunAmerica Inc.) and founder-chairman of KB \n     Home (formerly Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation).\n       Today, he is focused on philanthropy. The Broad family's \n     commitment to philanthropy and community is both deep and \n     wide-ranging. It includes ongoing leadership roles in art, \n     education, science and civic development.\n       Avid supporters of contemporary art, Mr. Broad and his \n     wife, Edythe, have created one of the worlds finest \n     collections. Since 1984, The Broad Art Foundation has \n     operated an active ``lending library'' of its extensive \n     collection to more than 400 museums and university galleries \n     worldwide. In 2001-2003, an exhibition of the Broads' \n     collection was shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, \n     the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, the Museum of \n     Fine Arts in Boston; and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, \n     Spain. Mr. Broad was the founding chairman of the board of \n     trustees of The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, \n     and is currently a trustee and member of the executive \n     committee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where the \n     Broads recently announced a major gift to build The Broad \n     Contemporary Art Museum.\n       In 1999, the Broads founded The Broad Foundation, whose \n     mission is to dramatically improve urban public education \n     through governance, management and labor relations. In its \n     first five years, the Foundation has committed over $400 \n     million to support new ideas and innovative leadership in the \n     nation's largest urban school systems. The Foundation also \n     has launched four national flagship initiatives--The Broad \n     Prize for Urban Education, The Broad Center for \n     Superintendents, The Broad Residency in Urban Education and \n     The Broad Institute for School Boards. Mr. Broad has said, \n     ``I can imagine no more important contribution to our \n     country's future than a long-term commitment to improving \n     urban K-12 public schools.''\n       In 2001, The Eli and Edythe L. Broad Foundation created the \n     Broad Medical Research Program, which seeks to stimulate \n     innovative research that will lead to progress in the \n     prevention, therapy or understanding of inflammatory bowel \n     disease.\n       In June 2003, in an unprecedented partnership with the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and \n     Whitehead Institute, the Broads announced the founding gift \n     to create The Eli and Edythe Broad Institute for biomedical \n     research.

Committed to the belief that all \n     great cities need a vibrant center, Mr. Broad is currently \n     leading the effort to turn Los Angeles' Grand Avenue into a \n     truly ``grand avenue,'' to rival the main boulevards of the \n     world's greatest cities. In 1996, he and Mayor Richard \n     Riordan took on the task of raising sufficient funds to build \n     the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, which \n     opened to worldwide acclaim in October 2003.\n       Strong believers in higher education, the Broad Foundations \n     have made a major contribution to the School of Arts and \n     Architecture at UCLA toward the construction of The Broad Art \n     Center, designed by Richard Meier. Mr. Broad is a member of \n     the board of trustees of CalTech, where the Broads gave the \n     cornerstone gift to create the Broad Center for the \n     Biological Sciences, designed by James Freed. Mr. Broad also \n     served as chairman of the board of trustees of Pitzer College \n     and vice chairman of the board of trustees of the California \n     State University system. In 1991, the Broads endowed The Eli \n     Broad College of Business and The Eli Broad Graduate School \n     of Management at Michigan State University, from which Mr. \n     Broad graduated cum laude in 1954.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S.J.

Con. Res. 114\n\n       Whereas there are more than 300,000,000 chronically hungry \n     and malnourished children in the world;\n       Whereas more than half of these children go to school on an \n     empty stomach, and almost as many do not attend school at \n     all, but might if food were available;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools is one of the \n     simplest and most effective strategies to fight hunger and \n     malnourishment among children;\n       Whereas when school meals are offered to hungry or \n     malnourished children, attendance rates increase \n     significantly, particularly for girls;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools encourages \n     better school attendance, thereby improving literacy rates \n     and fighting poverty;\n       Whereas improvement in the education of girls is one of the \n     most important factors in reducing child malnutrition in \n     developing countries;\n       Whereas girls who attend schools tend to marry later in \n     life and have fewer children, thereby helping them escape a \n     life of poverty;\n       Whereas by improving literacy rates and increasing job \n     opportunities, education addresses several of the root causes \n     of terrorism;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools increases \n     attendance of children who might otherwise be susceptible to \n     recruitment by groups that offer them food in return for \n     their attendance at extremist schools or participation in \n     terrorist training camps;\n       Whereas the Global Food for Education Initiative pilot \n     program, established in 2001, donated surplus United States \n     agricultural commodities to the United Nations World Food \n     Program and other recipients for distribution to nearly \n     7,000,000 hungry and malnourished children in 38 countries;\n       Whereas a recent Department of Agriculture evaluation found \n     that the pilot program created measurable improvements in \n     school attendance (particularly for girls), increased local \n     employment and economic activity, produced greater \n     involvement in local infrastructure and community improvement \n     projects, and increased participation by parents in the \n     schools and in the education of their children;\n       Whereas the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-171, 116 Stat. 134) replaced the pilot \n     program with the McGovern-Dole International Food for \n     Education and Child Nutrition Program, which was named after \n     former Senators George McGovern and Robert Dole for their \n     distinguished work to eradicate hunger and poverty around the \n     world; and\n       Whereas the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education \n     and Child Nutrition Program provides food to nearly 2,000,000 \n     hungry or malnourished children in 21 countries: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses its grave concern about the continuing \n     problem of hunger and the desperate need to feed hungry and \n     malnourished children around the world;\n       (2) recognizes that the global distribution of food in \n     schools to children around the world increases attendance, \n     particularly for girls, improves literacy rates, and \n     increases job opportunities, thereby helping to fight \n     poverty;\n       (3) recognizes that education of children around the world \n     addresses several of the root causes of international \n     terrorism;\n       (4) recognizes that the world will be safer and more \n     promising for children as a result of better school \n     attendance;\n       (5) expresses its gratitude to former Senators George \n     McGovern and Robert Dole for supporting the distribution of \n     food in schools around the world to children and for working \n     to eradicate hunger and poverty around the world;\n       (6) commends the Department of Agriculture, the Agency for \n     International Development, the Department of State, the \n     United Nations World Food Program, private voluntary \n     organizations, non-governmental organizations, and \n     cooperatives for facilitating the distribution of food in \n     schools around the world;\n       (7) expresses its continued support for the distribution of \n     food in schools around the world;\n       (8) supports expansion of the McGovern-Dole International \n     Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program; and\n       (9) requests the President to work with the United Nations \n     and its member states to expand international contributions \n     for the distribution of food in schools around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6458-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6458-S6459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3261.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas there are more than 300,000,000 chronically hungry \n     and malnourished children in the world;\n       Whereas more than half of these children go to school on an \n     empty stomach, and almost as many do not attend school at \n     all, but might if food were available;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools is one of the \n     simplest and most effective strategies to fight hunger and \n     malnourishment among children;\n       Whereas when school meals are offered to hungry or \n     malnourished children, attendance rates increase \n     significantly, particularly for girls;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools encourages \n     better school attendance, thereby improving literacy rates \n     and fighting poverty;\n       Whereas improvement in the education of girls is one of the \n     most important factors in reducing child malnutrition in \n     developing countries;\n       Whereas girls who attend schools tend to marry later in \n     life and have fewer children, thereby helping them escape a \n     life of poverty;\n       Whereas by improving literacy rates and increasing job \n     opportunities, education addresses several of the root causes \n     of terrorism;\n       Whereas the distribution of food in schools increases \n     attendance of children who might otherwise be susceptible to \n     recruitment by groups that offer them food in return for \n     their attendance at extremist schools or participation in \n     terrorist training camps;\n       Whereas the Global Food for Education Initiative pilot \n     program, established in 2001, donated surplus United States \n     agricultural commodities to the United Nations World Food \n     Program and other recipients for distribution to nearly \n     7,000,000 hungry and malnourished children in 38 countries;\n       Whereas a recent Department of Agriculture evaluation found \n     that the pilot program created measurable improvements in \n     school attendance (particularly for girls), increased local \n     employment and economic activity, produced greater \n     involvement in local infrastructure and community improvement \n     projects, and increased participation by parents in the \n     schools and in the education of their children;\n       Whereas the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-171, 116 Stat. 134) replaced the pilot \n     program with the McGovern-Dole International Food for \n     Education and Child Nutrition Program, which was named after \n     former Senators George McGovern and Robert Dole for their \n     distinguished work to eradicate hunger and poverty around the \n     world; and\n       Whereas the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education \n     and Child Nutrition Program provides food to nearly 2,000,000 \n     hungry or malnourished children in 21 countries: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses its grave concern about the continuing \n     problem of hunger and the desperate need to feed hungry and \n     malnourished children around the world;\n       (2) recognizes that the global distribution of food in \n     schools to children around the world increases attendance, \n     particularly for girls, improves literacy rates, and \n     increases job opportunities, thereby helping to fight \n     poverty;\n       (3) recognizes that education of children around the world \n     addresses several of the root causes of international \n     terrorism;\n       (4) recognizes that the world will be safer and more \n     promising for children as a result of better school \n     attendance;\n       (5) expresses its gratitude to former Senators George \n     McGovern and Robert Dole for supporting the distribution of \n     food in schools around the world to children and for working \n     to eradicate hunger and poverty around the world;\n       (6) commends the Department of Agriculture, the Agency for \n     International Development, the Department of State, the \n     United Nations World Food Program, private voluntary \n     organizations, non-governmental organizations, and \n     cooperatives for facilitating the distribution of food in \n     schools around the world;\n       (7) expresses its continued support for the distribution of \n     food in schools around the world;\n       (8) supports expansion of the McGovern-Dole International \n     Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Great Black \n     Americans Commemoration Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Black Americans have served honorably in Congress, in \n     senior executive branch positions, in the law, the judiciary, \n     and other fields, yet their record of service is not well \n     known by the public, is not included in school history \n     lessons, and is not adequately presented in the Nation's \n     museums.\n       (2) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, \n     Maryland, a nonprofit organization, is the Nation's first wax \n     museum presenting the history of great Black Americans, \n     including\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n     those who have served in Congress, in senior executive branch \n     positions, in the law, the judiciary, and other fields, as \n     well as others who have made significant contributions to \n     benefit the Nation.\n       (3) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. plans to expand \n     its existing facilities to establish the National Great \n     Blacks in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center, which is \n     intended to serve as a national museum and center for \n     presentation of wax figures and related interactive \n     educational exhibits portraying the history of great Black \n     Americans.\n       (4) The wax medium has long been recognized as a unique and \n     artistic means to record human history through preservation \n     of the faces and personages of people of prominence, and \n     historically, wax exhibits were used to commemorate noted \n     figures in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, in \n     medieval Europe, and in the art of the Italian renaissance.\n       (5) The Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. was founded in \n     1983 by Drs. Elmer and Joanne Martin, 2 Baltimore educators \n     who used their personal savings to purchase wax figures, \n     which they displayed in schools, churches, shopping malls, \n     and festivals in the mid-Atlantic region.\n       (6) The goal of the Martins was to test public reaction to \n     the idea of a Black history wax museum and so positive was \n     the response over time that the museum has been heralded by \n     the public and the media as a national treasure.\n       (7) The museum has been the subject of feature stories by \n     CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Baltimore Sun, the \n     Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Sun Times, \n     the Dallas Morning News, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, \n     the Afro American Newspaper, Crisis, Essence Magazine, and \n     others.\n       (8) More than 300,000 people from across the Nation visit \n     the museum annually.\n       (9) The new museum will carry on the time honored artistic \n     tradition of the wax medium; in particular, it will recognize \n     the significant value of this medium to commemorate and \n     appreciate great Black Americans whose faces and personages \n     are not widely recognized.\n       (10) The museum will employ the most skilled artisans in \n     the wax medium, use state-of-the-art interactive exhibition \n     technologies, and consult with museum professionals \n     throughout the Nation, and its exhibits will feature the \n     following:\n       (A) Blacks who have served in the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States, including those who \n     represented constituencies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \n     Virginia during the 19th century.\n       (B) Blacks who have served in the judiciary, in the \n     Department of Justice, as prominent attorneys, in law \n     enforcement, and in the struggle for equal rights under the \n     law.\n       (C) Black veterans of various military engagements, \n     including the Buffalo Soldiers and Tuskegee Airmen, and the \n     role of Blacks in the settlement of the western United \n     States.\n       (D) Blacks who have served in senior executive branch \n     positions, including members of Presidents' Cabinets, \n     Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Federal \n     agencies, and Presidential advisers.\n       (E) Other Blacks whose accomplishments and contributions to \n     human history during the last millennium and to the Nation \n     through more than 400 years are exemplary, including Black \n     educators, authors, scientists, inventors, athletes, clergy, \n     and civil rights leaders.\n       (11) The museum plans to develop collaborative programs \n     with other museums, serve as a clearinghouse for training, \n     technical assistance, and other resources involving use of \n     the wax medium, and sponsor traveling exhibits to provide \n     enriching museum experiences for communities throughout the \n     Nation.\n       (12) The museum has been recognized by the State of \n     Maryland and the City of Baltimore as a preeminent facility \n     for presenting and interpreting Black history, using the wax \n     medium in its highest artistic form.\n       (13) The museum is located in the heart of an area \n     designated as an empowerment zone, and is considered to be a \n     catalyst for economic and cultural improvements in this \n     economically disadvantaged area.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL GREAT BLACKS IN WAX MUSEUM \n                   AND JUSTICE LEARNING CENTER.\n\n       (a) Assistance for Museum.--Subject to subsection (b), the \n     Attorney General, acting through the Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice, shall, from amounts \n     made available under subsection (c), make a grant to the \n     Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. in Baltimore, Maryland, to \n     be used only for carrying out programs relating to civil \n     rights and juvenile justice through the National Great Blacks \n     in Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center.\n       (b) Grant Requirements.--To receive a grant under \n     subsection (a), the Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc. shall \n     submit to the Attorney General a proposal for the use of the \n     grant, which shall include detailed plans for the programs \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000, to \n     remain available through the end of fiscal year 2009.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2363, reported out earlier \ntoday by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2363) to revise and extend the Boys and Girls \n     Clubs of America.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nand passing the legislation that Senator Hatch and I introduced \ntogether to reauthorize and expand the Department of Justice grant \nprogram for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. We reported it out of \nthe Judiciary Committee this morning, and I thank the Senate for moving \nour bipartisan legislation so quickly. I also thank our 30 bipartisan \ncosponsors, including the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, the \nassistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid, and Judiciary Committee \nmembers Senators DeWine, Kohl, Biden, Feinstein, Craig, Sessions, \nDurbin, Edwards, Schumer and Chambliss, for supporting our legislation \nto support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n  Too often the public sees Republicans and Democrats disagreeing. From \ntime to time, even Senator Hatch and I disagree on important issues. \nBut when it comes to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, there is no \ndoubt that we see eye-to-eye. This bill shows the unified support of \nRepublicans and Democrats for the good works of Boys & Girls Clubs \nacross the nation.\n  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility \nto make sure they are safe and secure. I know firsthand how well Boys & \nGirls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a \nprosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys & \nGirls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of \nprograms. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was \nsuch a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys & Girls Club in his \ndistrict rather than helping him get a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys & Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and \nsupporting our children. The first club was established in Burlington \n62 years ago. Now we have 22 club sites operating throughout the State: \nseven clubs in Brattleboro, one in Springfield, two clubs in \nBurlington, one in Winooski, two clubs in Montpelier, five clubs in \nRandolph, one club in Rutland, two clubs in Vergennes, and one in \nBristol. There are 10 additional project sites that will be on board \nand serving kids by the end of 2005: one in Bennington, two in \nBurlington, one in Duxbury, one in St. Johnsbury, one in Hardwick, \nthree in Randolph, and one in Ludlow. These clubs will serve well over \n10,000 kids statewide.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys & Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased Federal support for Boys & Girls Clubs from $20 \nmillion to $80 million in this year. Due in large part to this increase \nin funding, there now exist 3,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 States \nserving more than 3.6 million young people. Because of these successes, \nI was both surprised and disappointed to see that the President \nrequested a reduction of $20 million for fiscal year 2005. That request \nwill leave thousands of children and their clubs behind and we cannot \nallow such a thing to happen.\n  In the 107th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass \nthe 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct, which included a provision to reauthorize Justice Department \ngrants to establish new Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. By authorizing \n$80 million in DOJ grants for each of the fiscal years through 2005, we \nsought to establish 1,200 additional Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. \nThis was to bring the number of Boys & Girls Clubs to 4,000, serving no \nless than 5 million young people. This bill will build upon this: we \nauthorize Justice Department grants at $80 million for fiscal year \n2006, $85 million for fiscal year 2007, $90 million for fiscal year \n2008, $95 million for fiscal year 2009 and $100 million for fiscal year \n2010 to Boys & Girls Clubs to help establish 1,500 additional Boys & \nGirls Clubs across the Nation with the goal of having 5,000\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nBoys & Girls Clubs in operation by December 31, 2010.\n  If we had a Boys & Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in our \ncountry would have a lot less work to do because of the values that are \nbeing instilled in children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \nEach time I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, \neducators, teachers, grandparents, and law enforcement officers who \ntell me ``Keep doing this! These clubs give our children the chance to \ngrow up free of drugs, gangs and crime.''\n  You cannot argue that these are just Democratic or Republican ideas, \nor conservative or liberal ideas--they are simply good-sense ideas. We \nneed safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can learn \nand grow up free from the influences of drugs, gangs and crime. That is \nwhy Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.\n  I thank the Senate for taking up and passing our bipartisan bill to \nexpand Federal support for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Our \ncountry's strength and ultimate success lies with our children. Our \ngreatest responsibility is to help them inhabit this century the best \nway possible and we can help do that by supporting the Boys & Girls \nClubs of America.\n  Mr. CRAPO.

It is \nthe leader's hope that we will be able to dispose of any cleared \namendments during tomorrow's session. However, there will be no \nrollcall votes. We would like to debate amendments during Friday's \nsession so that we may stack rollcall votes beginning on Tuesday. We \nalso hope to debate amendments on Monday, but, again, we will stack \nthose votes for Tuesday as well.\n  The leader has stated that it is his intention to complete action on \nthis bill next week. We were just able to lock in a filing deadline for \nall first-degree amendments for Monday at 5 p.m. The next rollcall vote \nwill, therefore, occur on Tuesday prior to the policy luncheon recess.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may continue before we adjourn for the \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We will not get consent tomorrow to set aside the Kennedy \namendment for the offering of other amendments. We would, however, as \nwe were earlier today, if the two managers have cleared amendments, be \nwilling to move those tomorrow. But as far as Senators being allowed to \noffer amendments, that will not be possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/03/senate-section/article/S6467-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
