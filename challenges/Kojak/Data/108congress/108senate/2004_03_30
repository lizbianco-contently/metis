Mr. President, last week I spoke about the White House's \nreaction to Richard Clarke's testimony before the 9/11 Commission. I am \ncompelled today to rise again because the people around the President \nare systematically abusing the powers and the prerogatives of \nGovernment.\n  We all need to reflect seriously on what is going on, not in anger, \nnot in partisanship, but in keeping with our responsibilities as \nSenators, with an abiding respect for the fundamental values of our \ndemocracy.\n  Richard Clarke did something extraordinary when he testified before \nthe 9-11 Commission last week. He didn't try to escape blame, as so \nmany routinely do.\n  Instead, he accepted his share of responsibility and offered his \nperceptions\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nabout what happened in the months and years leading up to September 11.\n  We can and should debate the facts and interpretations Clarke has \noffered. But there can be no doubt that he has risked enormous damage \nto his reputation and professional future to hold both himself and our \nGovernment accountable.\n  The retaliation from those around the President has been fierce. Mr. \nClarke's personal motives have been questioned and his honesty \nchallenged. He has even been accused, right here on the Senate floor, \nof perjury. Not one shred of proof was given, but that wasn't the \npoint. The point was to have the perjury accusation on television and \nin the newspapers. The point was to damage Mr. Clarke in any way \npossible. This is wrong--and it is not the first time it has happened.\n  When Senator McCain ran for President, the Bush campaign smeared him \nand his family with vicious, false attacks.\n  When Max Cleland ran for reelection to this Senate, his patriotism \nwas attacked. He was accused of not caring about protecting our \nNation--a man who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam, accused of \nbeing indifferent to America's national security. That was such an ugly \nlie, it's still hard to fathom almost 2 years later.\n  There are some things that simply ought not be done--even in \npolitics. Too many people around the President seem not to understand \nthat, and that line has been crossed.\n  When Ambassador Joe Wilson told the truth about the administration's \nmisleading claims about Iraq, Niger, and uranium, the people around the \nPresident didn't respond with facts. Instead, they publicly disclosed \nthat Ambassador Wilson's wife was a deep-cover CIA agent. In doing so, \nthey undermined America's national security and put politics first. \nThey also may well have put the lives of Ambassador Wilson's wife, and \nher sources, in danger.\n  When former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil revealed that the White \nHouse was thinking about an Iraq War in its first weeks in office, his \nformer colleagues in the Bush administration ridiculed him from morning \nto night, and even subjected him to a fruitless Federal investigation.\n  When Larry Lindsay, one of President Bush's former top economic \nadvisors, and General Eric Shinseki, the former Army Chief of Staff, \nspoke honestly about the amount of money and the number of troops the \nwar would demand, they learned the hard way that the White House \ndoesn't tolerate candor.\n  This is not ``politics as usual.'' In nearly all of these cases, it's \nnot Democrats who are being attacked. Senator McCain and Secretary \nO'Neill are prominent Republicans, and Richard Clarke, Larry Lindsay, \nJoe Wilson, Eric Shinseki, and Larry Lindsay all worked for Republican \nadministrations. The common denominator is that these Government \nofficials said things the White House didn't want said.\n  The response from those around the President was retribution and \ncharacter assassination--a 21st century twist to the strategy of \n``shooting the messenger.''\n  If it takes intimidation to keep inconvenient facts from the American \npeople, the people around the President don't hesitate. Richard Foster, \nthe chief actuary for Medicare, found that out. He was told he'd be \nfired if he told the truth about the cost of the administration's \nprescription drug plan.\n  This is no way to run a government. The White House and its \nsupporters should not be using the power of Government to try to \nconceal facts from the American people or to reshape history in an \neffort to portray themselves in the best light. They should not be \nthreatening the reputations and livelihoods of people simply for \nasking--or answering--questions. They should seek to put all \ninformation about past decisions on the table for evaluation so that \nthe best possible decisions can be made for the Nation's future.\n  In Mr. Clarke's case, clear and troubling double standards are being \napplied.\n  Last year, when the administration was being criticized for the \nPresident's misleading statement about Niger and uranium, the White \nHouse unexpectedly declassified portions of the National Intelligence \nEstimate.\n  When the administration wants to bolster its public case, there is \nlittle that appears too sensitive to be declassified.\n  Now, people around the President want to release parts of Mr. \nClarke's earlier testimony in 2002. According to news reports, the CIA \nis already working on declassifying that testimony--at the \nadministration's request.\n  And last week several documents were declassified literally \novernight, not in an effort to provide information on a pressing policy \nmatter to the American people, but in an apparent effort to discredit a \npublic servant who gave 30 years of service to the American Government.\n  I'll support declassifying Mr. Clarke's testimony before the Joint \nInquiry, but the administration shouldn't be selective.\n  Consistent with our need to protect sources and methods, we should \ndeclassify his entire testimony. And to make sure that the American \npeople have access to the full record as they consider this question, \nwe should also declassify his January 25 memo to Dr. Rice, the \nSeptember 4, 2001 National Security Directive dealing with terrorism, \nDr. Rice's testimony to the 9-11 Commission, the still-classified 28 \npages from the House-Senate inquiry relating to Saudi Arabia, and a \nlist of the dates and topics of all National Security Council meetings \nbefore September 4, 2001.\n  I hope this new interest in openness will also include the Vice \nPresident's Energy and Terrorism Task Forces. While much, if not all, \nof what these task forces discussed was unclassified, their proceedings \nhave not been shared with the public to date.\n  There also seems to be a double standard when it comes to \ninvestigations. In recent days leading congressional Republicans are \nnow calling for an investigation into Mr. Clarke.\n   As I mentioned earlier, Secretary O'Neill was also subjected to an \ninvestigation.\n   Clarke and O'Neill sought legal and classification review of any \ninformation in their books before they were published.\n   Nonetheless, our colleagues tell us these two should be \ninvestigated, at the same time that there has been no Senate \ninvestigation into the leaking of Valerie Plame's identity as a deep \ncover CIA agent, no thorough investigation into whether leading \nadministration officials misrepresented the intelligence regarding \nthreats posed by Iraq, no Senate hearings into the threat the chief \nMedicare Actuary faced for trying to do his job, and no Senate \ninvestigation into the reports of continued overcharging by Halliburton \nfor its work in Iraq.\n   There is a clear double standard when it comes to investigating or \nreleasing information, and that's just not right. The American people \ndeserve more from their leaders.\n   We're seeing it again now in the shifting reasons the White House \nhas given for Dr. Rice's refusal to testify under oath and publicly \nbefore the 9-11 Commission.\n   The people around the President first said it would be unprecedented \nfor Dr. Rice to testify. But thanks to the Congressional Research \nService, we now know that previous sitting National Security Advisors \nhave testified before Congress.\n   Now the people around the President are saying that Dr. Rice can't \ntestify because it would violate an important constitutional principle: \nthe separation of powers.\n   We will soon face this debate again when it comes time for President \nBush and Vice President Cheney to meet with the 9-11 Commission. I \nbelieve they should lift the limitations they have placed on their \ncooperation with the Commission and be willing to appear before the \nentire Commission for as much time as the Commission deems productive.\n   The all-out assault on Richard Clarke has gone on for more than a \nweek now. Mr. Clarke has been accused of ``profiteering'' and possible \nperjury. It is time for this to stop.\n   The commission should declassify Mr. Clarke's earlier testimony. All \nof it. Not just the parts the White House wants. And Dr. Rice should \ntestify before the 9-11 Commission, and she should be under oath and in \npublic.\n   The American people deserve to know the truth--the full truth--about \nwhat happened in the years and months leading up to September 11.\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n   Senator McCain, Senator Cleland, Secretary O'Neill, Ambassador \nWilson, General Shinseki, Richard Foster, Richard Clarke, Larry \nLindsay--when will the character assassination, retribution, and \nintimidation end?\n   When will we say enough is enough?\n   The September 11 families--and our entire country--deserve better. \nOur democracy depends on it. And our Nation's future security depends \non it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is time for the Bush administration to \nend its campaign of inaction on gasoline price hikes. Tomorrow, OPEC \nwill vote on whether there should be additional production cuts, and \nthis very morning, the Saudi oil minister said OPEC should go ahead \nwith its scheduled production cut in the month of April.\n  If they do, that is going to take 1 million barrels of oil off the \nmarket per day, when U.S. private oil supplies are already millions of \nbarrels low and when U.S. gasoline prices are at record highs.\n  Folks on the west coast of the United States are getting clobbered by \nthese gasoline price hikes. People in California pay considerably more \nthan $2 a gallon. Folks in my home State of Oregon are close behind, \npaying an average of more than $1.80 in some of our towns.\n  There is a perfect storm coming with respect to these gasoline price \nhikes. The combination of the Bush administration filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve at the wrong time, the fact we have these refinery \ncutbacks on the west coast that seem as much to boost profit as \nanything else, the Federal Trade Commission turning a blind eye to \nanticompetitive profits, and the shenanigans of OPEC are the factors \nthat are coming together to create what I think could be a perfect \nstorm with gasoline prices of $3 a gallon.\n  On the OPEC issue, less than a month ago the head of the Energy \nInformation Agency told me OPEC would make up the difference for the \noil the U.S. Energy Department is putting in the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. I have to tell you, Mr. President, if you think OPEC is going \nto be looking out for the American gasoline consumer, you have to think \nColonel Sanders is looking out for the chickens. It simply does not add \nup.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand the administration's \ninsistence on continuing to swipe oil out of the private U.S. market \nand squirrel it away in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when \nthe American consumer is getting clobbered each week at the gasoline \nstation. The Bush administration needs to stop filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. The administration is spending American tax dollars \nto buy oil at record high prices and put it in the reserve, and \napparently they are saying they will not stop it. But, in fact, they \ndid stop filling the reserve when it helped the oil companies. They \nstopped filling the reserve in December 2002 when the oil companies \nneeded more supply for refineries.\n  It seems to me the message today is what the administration is \nwilling to do for the big oil companies they ought to do for the \nAmerican consumer, and particularly the ones I represent on the west \ncoast of the United States.\n  There is no substitute for leadership when American families are \nhurting financially and getting shellacked by these gasoline price \nhikes. It is interesting to note that when the President was a \ncandidate in 2000, he said the President ought to be using his bully \npulpit to jawbone OPEC. This administration is not doing that.\n  Last week, they took credit for oil coming down about $1 a barrel. \nThe fact was, that was a day late and $7 a barrel short because the \nprice is still way above the OPEC price target level.\n  We come to the floor today to say when the American people are \nhurting, there needs to be Presidential leadership. These gas prices \nare hurting my constituents. They are devastating to businesses and to \nconsumers on the west coast, and they are driving up prices for goods \nand transportation in this country.\n  We have a proposal. It is to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, No. 1. No. 2, it is for the Federal Trade Commission to get \noff the dime and look at these anticompetitive practices. I have \nintroduced legislation, S. 1737. If the Bush administration does not \nlike that bill, I would like to hear their proposal. Let's hear what \nthey are going to do to stand up for the west coast consumer.\n  It seems the administration is busy filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve with no regard for rising gas prices. They are busy with their \ncampaign of inaction that seems to help nobody but the oil companies \nand will not direct the Federal Trade Commission to take steps now to \nprotect the consumer. I think the American people deserve better.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Under the previous agreement, \nthe Senator from New York is recognized for 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3317-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3317-S3318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RICE TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, honestly, I had come to the floor to \nsubmit a resolution on behalf of myself and 14 of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Kennedy, Byrd, Lieberman, Clinton, Corzine, Dodd, \nJohnson, Hollings, Reid from Nevada, Lautenberg, Dorgan, Durbin, \nDaschle, and Nelson to ask the President to allow Condoleezza Rice to \ntestify under oath and in public. I heard NBC News has announced she \nwill do just that. So the resolution is moot. I will make a couple of \npoints, though.\n  One is I suppose all of the protestation that this would violate \nseparation of powers has gone by the wayside. We all knew that was just \na smokescreen because this commission is not congressional, and the \nwhole theory of separation of powers is congressional.\n  The bottom line is the real reason the administration did not want \nCondoleezza Rice to testify, that they did not want her out there \nspeaking about this, is quite apparent and had nothing to do with \nseparation of powers.\n  The second point I make is to compliment the Commission. The \nCommission has done an incredible job. I think when Tom Kean, the \nformer Governor of New Jersey, a Republican, one known for integrity, \nsaid the only way she would testify was under oath--she has been on \nevery talk show. She is on television 24/7. So she has plenty of time \nto go public and say what she wants, but not what the Commission will \nask her under oath.\n\n  Her statements, her public statements contradicted some of Dick \nClarke's. Dick Clarke's were given under oath. Dick Clarke's were given \nafter considerable criticism and vituperation directed from the White \nHouse and the attack machine that we know about here in Washington, the \nRepublican attack machine. He stood by his story. So we now all wait \nwith bated breath to hear what Condoleezza Rice will say under oath.\n  Mr. President, people as diverse as Colin Powell, John McCain, Chuck \nHagel--Republicans--have talked about Dick Clarke's character. I have \nknown Dick Clarke for a long time. He is a principled man. He has been \na registered Republican. Whenever he met me--and I met him under the \nClinton administration--he said he was a Republican. His one passion \nwas to make America safe.\n  When all the information he had and all the work he and his staff had \ndone were ignored, he became more and more frustrated. Dick Clarke's \nbook is not aimed at political retribution. Dick Clarke's book is aimed \nat the truth. Like everywhere else, the Scriptures are right: The truth \nwill set us free.\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\n  I hope Condoleezza Rice fully testifies, testifies truthfully. The \nCommission's goal is not to point fingers or blame; the Commission's \ngoal is to find out what went wrong so we don't do it again. No one \nfeels that more keenly than the families in my State who have lost \nloved ones and who yearn for the truth; not so much because it will \never bring their loved ones back but because they, in a charitable, an \neleemosynary gesture, want to prevent it from happening again.\n  This is a good step. We ought to trust this Commission. It is \nbipartisan. It has many people of integrity on it. Let it go forward \nwithout stonewalling. The truth, the truth will set us free.\n\n\n                                  OPEC\n\n  I would like to bring one other issue forward now that something has \nbeen announced, and that is the issue of OPEC. Tomorrow the OPEC \nnations meet. I have a letter that has been signed by 19 of my \ncolleagues as well urging the President, today, to speak out strongly \nand publicly to get OPEC to back off their counterproductive policy to \nrestrict the amount of oil that flows into the market and raise the \nprices. It is counterproductive because it is going to cause our \neconomy to slow down and hurt everybody.\n  But where is the voice of our President? He went out of his way to \ncreate a $400 tax cut, to put money into the hands of average families \nto stimulate the economy. I was all for that part of his tax proposal. \nBut now that tax cut is going to OPEC. By the end of the summer, the \naverage American family with 2 cars will pay $400 more than they paid \nfor gasoline because of this recent price rise in OPEC. It is taking \nthe wind out of our economy.\n  OPEC is a monopoly--an oligopoly. It is killing America. We have a \nsolution, which is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which President \nClinton did dip into after, frankly, I pressured him for 6 months. That \nbrought oil prices down and they stayed down. Where is President Bush? \nWhat is his policy to deal with oil prices now?\n  He talks about the energy bill, he talks about ANWR. At best, whether \nyou agree with it or not, that is not going to put more oil on the \nmarket for 5 years. What are we doing now, as OPEC drains dollars from \nthe American family's pockets? There is no extra money to take the \nvacation, build the extra room on the house, or buy the new car. The \nPresident fiddles, frankly, while Rome burns, while oil prices go \nthrough the roof, not because of a free market but because there is a \nmonopoly here that is manipulating price.\n\n  OPEC always said they would keep the price no greater than $28 a \nbarrel. It is now about $10 more than that. Now, with the Saudi \nannouncement this morning that they are going to constrict oil \nproduction further, it should go above $40 a barrel. That is a very bad \nsign for this economy and for the American taxpayer, the American \nfamily.\n  The President is silent. He has to tell his Saudi friends they have \nto come clean. He has a weapon, an ace in the hole at his disposal, and \nthat is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In this letter, 19 of us urge \nhim to speak out today before the OPEC meeting tomorrow and shake up \nthe Saudis and shake up OPEC and tell them that, if they don't start \nproducing more oil, we will use our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I, too, commend those who were encouraging \nCondoleezza Rice to come before the 9/11 Commission publicly under oath \nto tell what she knows about the events leading up to 9/11 and those \nthat followed. The fact she would argue it violated a precedent \ncertainly didn't stand up once we looked at what happened in the past \nwhen we had others in her same position testifying before congressional \ncommittees.\n  Now that she has made this decision, along with the White House, to \ntestify, I think it is a positive and good thing. This bipartisan \nCommission can now ask the hard questions that need to be asked.\n  I really come to the floor because, frankly, I think it is time for \nmany of us who believe that a great injustice is being committed to \nspeak out. The injustice I speak of is the reaction of this \nadministration to the publication of the book ``Against All Enemies: \nInside America's War on Terror'' by Richard Clarke.\n  To my knowledge, I have never met Mr. Clark nor worked with him. I \nknow nothing about him personally. But I do know for 30 years Richard \nClarke has been trusted by Presidents, Republican and Democrats alike, \nwith some of the most important responsibilities in America.\n  If you read his book, and I have--at least the beginning of his \nbook--you will find in the first chapter that Richard Clarke was the \nperson America turned to on September 11 when we faced the greatest \ndanger and chaos of modern time. He was the one at the controls in the \nWhite House, in the situation room, trying to bring some sense to the \nconfusion that was hitting America. He was the one who was involved in \nworking with the Secretary of Defense, the President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of State, and all of the agencies of \nGovernment, to try to make sure America was safe at one of the most \ndangerous moments in our history. It is hard to believe this is the \nsame man who has been so roundly discredited now by those in the White \nHouse. Those who trusted him on 9/11, who said to him, Use your \njudgment, your skill, and your experience to keep America safe at our \nmost dangerous moment, are now saying, Richard Clarke cannot be trusted \nwhen he speaks out from the heart, from his conscience, about the \nfailures of this administration to prepare for the war on terrorism and \nto wage that war since 9/11.\n\n  Some of the statements that have been made on the floor of the \nSenate, particularly by the majority leader last week, I couldn't \nbelieve as I read the transcript today. I will quote from those \nstatements. In the statement the majority leader said that he is:\n\n       . . . equally troubled someone who would sell a book that \n     trades on their former service as a Government insider with \n     access to classified information, our Nation's most valuable \n     intelligence, in order to profit from the suffering \n     surrounding what this Nation endured on September 11, 2001.\n\n  What is missing from this statement and other references by the \nmajority leader is the fact that before Mr. Clarke published this book, \nit was submitted to the White House. They saw it in advance. If there \nwere any suspicion of the leak of classified information by any agency, \nthere was ample opportunity for them to weigh in before the publication \nof the book, and they did not do it. It is a false issue to raise \ntoday, that Richard Clarke has somehow violated this Nation's trust and \ndisclosed classified information. That is not a fact that can be proven \nbased on the fact that the White House itself had the ability to review \nthat book in advance and determine whether anything crossed the line. \nTo suggest Mr. Clarke is just doing this for the money is, frankly, to \ndiscredit him and to discredit a 30-year career in service to this \ncountry.\n  If we look at what is happening to Richard Clarke by this attack \nmachine out of the White House, we see it is nothing new. The same \nthing happened to Larry Lindsey, an economic adviser to the President \nwho misspoke by saying the war in Iraq was going to cost far more than \nthe Bush administration ever acknowledged. It turned out Larry Lindsey \nwas right, but because he spoke the truth he is gone.\n  General Shinseki, who misspoke in the eyes of the administration by \ntelling us about the necessary commitment in American troops in a war \nin Iraq, was roundly criticized. He was the target of their attack.\n  In addition, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill stepped forward with his \nbook, after serving in this administration, talking about some personal \nexperiences he had with this administration and was immediately \nridiculed by the people around the President.\n  Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who has served this country, who has \ncontributed to both Democratic and Republican candidates, had the \nidentity of his wife, who was working for the Central Intelligence \nAgency, disclosed by Robert Novak, columnist, on a tip from the White \nHouse in order to discredit Ambassador Joe Wilson.\n  In addition, Richard Foster, an actuary for the Department of Health \nand\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nHuman Services who had the nerve to step forward and say the \nPresident's prescription drug program was being sold on false premises \nand in fact it would cost far more than what the administration was \nprepared to acknowledge, when he started making that public, they came \nback at him and said he could lose his job if he spoke the truth.\n  Then, of course, the Vice President. The Vice President, who wrote an \nenergy bill--and submitted it to Congress--by meeting with special \ninterest groups and basically kowtowing to their interests instead of \nthe interests of America, when put on the spot and asked who were those \nspecial interest groups, refused to make that public.\n  We see not only this effort to attack all critics and debase them and \nquestion their motives and their patriotism, but we also find ourselves \nin a position where this administration has thrown a shroud of secrecy \nover the most important issues that face their Government. Thank \ngoodness a corner of that shroud has been lifted this morning. Looking \nunder that shroud, we will find Condoleezza Rice coming before this \nbipartisan commission answering questions, as she should.\n  What is at stake here is not the reputation of the White House or \nanyone in the White House. What is at stake here is the security and \nsafety of the United States of America.\n  Richard Clarke, whether you agree with him or not, stepped forward on \na critical issue and was prepared to accept his responsibility for not \ndoing as much as possible. But those who should be joining him in \naccepting responsibility have instead turned on him and attacked him \npersonally. That is not new in Washington, but it has reached a new \ndepth in this particular instance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for \n7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I first want to thank my friend from Illinois for his usual \neloquence, and our leader and others who have spoken about what has \nbeen happening under an administration that chooses to fight those who \nstate their opinions, face the facts, and give us information rather \nthan working with us to make sure we have the best information; working \nwith us to make sure the decisions we make are the right ones.\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak about Medicare today, \nand the fact that one of those who stood up and was prepared to give us \ninformation is the Medicare actuary Richard Foster.\n  We now know he was told if he gave up information about the cost of \nthe Medicare bill that passed last year before we voted on it, he would \nface being fired. We have heard this repeated over and over in \ndifferent ways about people who had the courage to stand up and \ndisagree--or in this case a career public servant who was trying to do \nhis job.\n  We find now on this Medicare bill that as we look more closely, over \nand over we are deeply disturbed by what has unfolded relating to the \nMedicare bill.\n  As I indicated over and over on the floor before we passed the final \nversion, this is clearly about what is in the interest of the \npharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry in this country--not \nin the best interests of seniors, not in the best interests of \nconsumers or taxpayers. Piece by piece, we are seeing major flaws in \nthis law; in fact, so much so that we are seeing comments from \ncolleagues. Our colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, has indicated \nnow if it were to be done over he would in fact change his vote. I \nwonder how many others would be doing the same thing given what we have \nfound.\n  This law does nothing to lower prices for Medicare recipients and \nfamilies, which should be one of the primary goals. That should have \nbeen at the top of the list for us to do. Despite the passage, in fact, \nof something that would lower prices--what we call the reimportation of \nprescription drugs or the ability to allow the local pharmacist, say, \nin Michigan or across the country to do business with pharmacists in \nother countries such as Canada to bring back prescription drugs at half \nthe price; most of them are made in the United States, and American \ntaxpayers helped subsidize the research to make them. But instead of \nallowing that to happen--to lower prices, in fact, up to 70 percent in \nsome cases--we saw nothing in the final bill.\n  The law prohibits the Medicare program from using its purchasing \npower to lower prices, which is stunning. What organization doesn't \nwant to purchase in bulk in order to lower prices? Yet the Medicare \nlegislation that passed specifically prohibits that from happening. \nThere is only one group that benefits from that.\n  The law, as we know, would also lead to about one in four retirees \nlosing their private coverage, if they have retiree coverage, given the \nway it is designed. My latest concern relates to what is happening with \nthe discount cards in the legislation.\n  One thing we thought at least would be helpful--not as much as \nallowing us to bring back lower cost prescription drugs from Canada and \nfrom other countries, but something we had hoped would help a little \nbit--would be the discount card that was put in place which was \nsupposed to provide from a 10 percent up to a 25-percent discount on \nprescription drugs.\n  But just as Health and Human Services announced which companies would \nbe providing the discount cards, we also learned the meager savings \nthese cards might offer is being eaten up by the continued explosion in \nprescription price increases.\n\n  As reported in the Wall Street Journal, the prescription drug \nprovision for our seniors and the disabled increased nearly 3\\1/2\\ \ntimes faster than the overall inflation rate in 2002. Because there are \nno checks or controls or accountability on these prices, the discount \ncards are very vulnerable to gaming by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  What do I mean by that? For example, the wholesale price for Lipitor \nor Zoloft went up 19 percent in the last 2 years. The pain reliever \nCelebrex went up 23 percent. Their producer has said these increases \nare among the most moderate pricing in the industry.\n  We are seeing great increases so that any kind of a discount now will \nbe based on an inflated price, not providing relief for seniors.\n  I am very concerned. We are hearing from Families USA, which we know \nis a consumer health care advocacy group. They have now laid out four \nconcerns they have which I will share regarding discount cards.\n  Their first concern is they say neither the new law nor the \nlegislation specifies the base price on which the discounts will apply. \nGains in the base price are going up dramatically, and we are going to \ngive a 10 or 15-percent discount, or even a 30-percent discount. But \nthe price has gone up 40 percent. You are not getting much of a deal.\n  Second, under the Discount Card Program, sponsors are required to \npass on to cardholders only an undefined share of the rebates they get \nfrom drug manufacturers, and they can keep the remaining savings as \nprofits. They are not required to pass on the entire amount of savings \nfrom the manufacturers to our seniors.\n  I know our leader Senator Daschle has a bill that would correct that, \nof which I am cosponsor, and I hope very strongly we will be able to \npass it.\n  The regulations foster, in fact, also what is called bait-and-switch \nschemes so that people go into a particular card, and then things are \nswitched. What is amazing is while the senior is locked into a specific \ncard for 7 days, the size of a discount can change. Seniors are locked \nin but the provider is not.\n  Finally, there is a $600 credit, which is positive for low-income \nseniors, that is applied to these cards. However, with the low-income \nasset tax and new, very cumbersome paperwork involved, we are not sure \nhow many low-income seniors will actually receive the discount.\n  We can do better than that. If we were simply to do what the House of \nRepresentatives did in a strong bipartisan vote a number of months ago, \nwe would be able to immediately drop prices at least in half with \nreimportation.\n  I urge my colleagues to get serious and pass that bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, have we used all of our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve that. But I note when we get to \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nthat a number of Members on this side indicate they would object to \nextending the vote past 12:45. Everyone should understand that. The \nmanagers of the bill--and I have spoken to our manager, Senator \nBaucus--understand that. If anyone tries to extend the time past 12:15, \nthere will be an objection. We will vote at 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Is there any objection to \nreserving of the minority's time? Hearing none, the time is reserved.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3320-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issue \nbefore the Senate. The previous comments this morning sounded like a \npolitical rally. We ought to talk about the issues before the Senate \ninstead of spending all our time criticizing the President.\n  We have before the Senate welfare reform, to extend what we have done \nin the past. Welfare reform has been a remarkable success story for \nmillions of people. Welfare reform is working because former recipients \nare working. Families once dependent on welfare checks are now looking \nforward to the independence of a paycheck. That, of course, has been \nthe purpose of the program. Through the years it has been very \nsuccessful.\n  This bill deals with the effort to provide meaningful work and more \nopportunity for welfare recipients to move off welfare, to promote \nhealthy families, to provide opportunity for health and marriage \nprograms, to give States the flexibility to continue to work on the \nprograms they have had.\n  We are very pleased this is now before the Senate. As a Finance \nCommittee member who has worked on this for a very long time, it is \nsomething that we need to pass and make available to people in this \ncountry.\n  The legislation before the Senate, H.R. 4, the Personal \nResponsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act, makes the \nnecessary changes in existing law to make it even more of a success. \nAmerica began a war on poverty more than three decades ago. However, \nthe good intentions of that policy produced conflicting results. \nSeniors were lifted out of poverty, poor families received basic health \ncare, and disadvantaged children were given a head start in life.\n  Many Americans were injured by that helping hand. The welfare system \nactually became an enemy of individual efforts and responsibility. As \ndependence passed from one generation to the next, the vicious welfare \ncycle began for some families.\n  Between 1965 and 1995, Federal and State welfare spending increased \nfrom $40 billion to more than $350 billion per year. However, all this \nmoney produced virtually no progress in reducing child poverty.\n  In August 1996, Congress passed a progressive welfare reform law that \ntransferred welfare benefits into temporary help, not into a permanent \nway of life. The new system honors work by requiring all able-bodied \nrecipients to work or go back to school to further their education.\n  The goal of the 1996 welfare reform law was to give participants a \nstrong, time-limited support system as they developed long-life skills \nthat encourage independence.\n  That is the purpose of this entire program. It has been successful. \nIt provides childcare funding to help families meet the work \nrequirements while limiting the benefits to 5 years. States must \npromote self-sufficiency. They are given the flexibility to reach that \ngoal.\n  The following results of the 1996 landmark welfare reform bill speak \nfor themselves. From August 1996 to June 2003, the number of families \non welfare fell from 4.4 million to 2 million, a 54-percent decline. In \nthe same time period, the number of individuals fell from 12.2 million \nto less than 5 million, a decline of 60 percent. From 1996 to 2002, \nchild poverty went from 20.5 percent to 16.7 percent. This represents a \nreduction of over 2.3 million poor children.\n\n  Child poverty rates among African Americans and Hispanics were at or \nnear record low levels. The percentage of never married working mothers \nincreased from 49.3 in 1996 to 65 percent in 2002. Childcare funding \nhas continued at record levels. Let me say that again: Childcare \nfunding has continued at record levels. We are going to be faced with a \nresolution shortly to increase that. The fact is, we have had ample \ndollars in the past. We have fewer people now and all different kinds \nof programs going into that. I hope we do not add $6 billion to the \ncost of the program.\n  State and Federal funding for childcare from the childcare \ndevelopment block grant, TANF, and social services block grant \nincreased from $3.2 billion in 1996 to $11.8 billion in 2003. In 2003, \nan estimated 2.5 million children will receive subsidized childcare \nfrom these funding sources. From 1996 to 2003, child support \ncollections increased from $12 billion to $21 billion. This \ndemonstrates a pattern of success, moving people in the direction this \nwas designed to move them.\n  Wyoming, my home State, has had particularly good luck. In the wake \nof these changes, welfare reform has been phenomenal. In fact, the \nnumber of individuals receiving assistance has dropped approximately 90 \npercent since 1994. This was accomplished with total weekly hour \nrequirements of work of 40 hours, which is above and beyond the current \nlaw. That is what is in the reauthorization bill before the Senate.\n  Last year, Wyoming received a $19.9 million bonus for reducing the \nout-of-wedlock birth rate.\n  Wyoming also has over $30 million in reserve funds they are able to \nuse when this bill is passed. This increased flexibility will not only \nhelp my State keep folks off the welfare rolls, but provide assistance \nto childcare and other expenses while continuing on their path of self-\nsufficiency.\n  I am very proud of my State's success. Our experience proves welfare \nreform is a strong and comprehensive policy to uplift and empower \npeople to be able to earn for themselves. I am encouraged by the \ninitial results of welfare reform, but there is still a lot of work to \ndo.\n  I support the chairman's bill because it does the following: It \nincreases work hours to 34. This is better to prepare recipients for \nfull-time employment. I would like to see that number of work hours be \nincreased to 40. Wyoming has made that work well.\n  This creates a partial credit system for States doing everything they \ncan to make this even better. We have increased childcare spending by \n$1 billion over 5 years. It allows the States to use Federal money no \nlonger used on cash assistance. Increased flexibility allows for more \nactivities.\n  I hope we move this out of committee. We have been deferring it by \nextending the old bill. We need to put the new bill into place. We need \nto stop the uncertainty for the States as to what we are doing.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership. I hope we can move this \nweek to conference and keep our commitments to equip TANF recipients \nwith the skills they need to take care of themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about jobs in the United \nStates and something that is happening to our country. We have very \ncomplex international tax laws. To go into them, people's eyes would \nglaze over in complete boredom. Suffice it to say, because of the \ncomplexities, we have tried over the years to get U.S. companies on a \nmore level playing field.\n  In the past year, the international bodies that have jurisdiction \nhave ruled against the United States versus the European Union \nregarding the way we treat U.S. companies doing business outside of the \nUnited States. Therefore, because we have not fixed our laws, they have \ndecided to put a 5-percent tariff on many of our manufactured goods. \nStarting this month and for every month thereafter, that 5-percent \ntariff will be raised by 1 percent. As a matter of fact, by this time \nnext year it will be up to 17 percent, which puts American \nmanufacturers at a tremendous global disadvantage when compared to the \nEuropean Union.\n  If Members care about manufacturing jobs in this country, it is \nimportant this body bring back the JOBS bill that we had before us in \nthe Senate last week that was filibustered and get it passed.\n  The other side keeps talking about, manufacturing jobs and exporting \njobs and outsourcing. If people really care about manufacturing jobs in \nthis country, we will bring the JOBS bill back up to the floor and get \nit voted on and get it worked out between the House and the Senate and \nget it down to the President so he can sign it into law so we can start \ngiving more help and more relief to manufacturing jobs in this country.\n  Let me read a quote from the Washington Post of last week, quoting a \nDemocrat tax aide saying:\n\n       There's not a lot of incentive for us to figure out this \n     [FSC-ETI] problem.\n\n  That is the problem I just talked about with the international tax \nlaws with our country and the tariffs.\n  The Democrat aide went on to say that ``allowing the ETI problem to \nfester would yield increased sanctions that could benefit the Democrats \nin November.''\n  Well, if this is true, this is an appalling statement. This debate \nshould be about policy, not petty politics.\n  So let's look at what is inside of this JOBS bill.\n  Not only would it end the $4 billion a year of tariffs against U.S. \nexports--and, by the way, those exports include grain, timber, paper, \nand manufactured goods. I realize, for some, this may be too \npolitically tempting to let pass by--but this bill, by ending those \ntariffs, would put us on a more level playing field with European Union \ncompanies.\n  The CBO says we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in the United \nStates since the year 2000. We have been losing gradually, since the \nlate 1970s, manufacturing jobs in the United States. That is part of \nthe entire global economy, but it is important that we at least allow \nU.S. jobs to be on a level playing field.\n  The JOBS bill to which I referred, that was being filibustered, \nprovides $75 billion of tax relief to our manufacturing sector to \npromote rehiring in U.S.-based manufacturing firms.\n  This JOBS bill gives a 3-percentage-point tax rate cut on all income \nderived from manufacturing in the United States--it is not for \nmanufacturing offshore--and we start those cuts in this year. This \nmanufacturing rate cut applies to sole proprietors, partnerships, \nfarmers, individuals, family businesses, multinational corporations, \nand even foreign companies that decide to set up operations within the \nUnited States and provide jobs in the United States.\n  The bill also extends the R tax credit through the end of the year \n2005. Now, the R tax credit is absolutely a jobs producer in the \nUnited States. It is for doing research and development, which betters \nour companies, which betters our economies, and creates high-paying \njobs in the United States.\n  The bill also extends, for 2 years, the tax provisions that expired \nin 2003 and in 2004, such as the work opportunity tax credit and the \nwelfare-to-work tax credits--obviously, important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  The bill also provides incentives for newly constructed rural \ninvestment buildings, for starting or expanding a rural business in \nrural high-outmigration counties.\n  The JOBS bill includes brownfields revitalization. Those are inner-\ncity areas. Because of environmental concerns, frankly, many inner \ncities have dying areas because companies cannot go in. Because of the \nenvironmental liability of what somebody dumped there before, they \ncannot go in and create jobs in the inner cities. That is why it is \nimportant we get this part of the bill done.\n\n  I also want to now talk about what I think is probably the most \nimportant part of the tax bill, and it is called the Invest in the USA \nAct, a bill that I have sponsored with Senator Barbara Boxer of \nCalifornia.\n  This bill would allow U.S. companies that have invested abroad--they \nhave a little over $600 billion invested that they have made money on \nand they have sitting in their bank accounts overseas. If they bring \nthat money back to the United States, they will pay up to a 35-percent \ntax on it. There is not a lot of incentive for them to bring the money \nback. Other countries do not treat their companies that way, so they \nare able to actually bring the money back to their countries to create \njobs in their countries.\n  This past weekend, Senator Kerry talked about that issue. He now \nsupports the idea of giving a tax break for the money coming back into \nthis country. Last year, we had a vote on our bill, and all 50 \nRepublican Senators and 25 Democratic Senators agreed it was time to \nbring this money home at a very low tax rate--a 5.25-percent tax rate.\n  Senator Kerry has now embraced the idea of bringing it home, but he \nwants it taxed at 10 percent. The problem with taxing it at 10 percent \nis, because of the low cost of borrowing money today, it would actually \nbe cheaper for the companies to borrow money in the United States than \nto pay the 10-percent tax and bring these funds home. So Senator Kerry \nrecognizes it is a good thing to bring the money home. Unfortunately, \nthe fix that he has will not bring the money home.\n  The bill that Senator Boxer and I have proposed, that received 75 \nvotes on the Senate floor, and now is part of the big JOBS tax bill, \ndoes bring the money home. Estimates are that it will bring at least \n$400 billion to the United States. That is a lot of money. As a matter \nof fact, that is more money than was raised in all of the initial \npublic stock offerings from 1996 to 2002. That is a huge stimulus to \nour economy. That will produce a lot of good-paying U.S. jobs that we \nso desperately need right now.\n  The economy is growing. GDP is up. There are increases in \nproductivity. We are obviously doing well with home sales. Where we are \nnot doing as well as we would like is in the area of new job creation. \nThere are a lot of new self-employed jobs that are being created, but \non the payroll survey many of those jobs are not being reported.\n  This bill--for those who want to increase and extend the temporary \nunemployment insurance benefits, for those who want to do all kinds of \nGovernment programs--will make those types of provisions unnecessary.\n  So if the Democrats in the Senate want to do something about jobs for \nthis country, they will quit trying to put all kinds of extraneous \nprovisions onto the bill, and we will get a jobs bill done this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague. \nI thank my colleague from Nevada, particularly, for talking about the \nimportance of the FSC/ETI bill because today jobs are a critical need \nin our country.\n  Yes, we see signs that the economy is recovering, but we are not \nseeing the growth in jobs. Now the unemployment rate is down to 5.6 \npercent. Obviously, we all would like to see it lower. There are a \nnumber of steps that we can take, and I think passing a good highway \nbill is one such step.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n  There are a number of steps that would be very harmful if we took \nthem. I think, as we talk about jobs and the very volatile subject of \ninsourcing and outsourcing, we need to understand what this is all \nabout.\n  I was interested this weekend when I read an old story that \napparently had been in the papers in Missouri for some time, but it was \nrerun in my hometown paper. When Missourians call a toll-free number \nabout their food stamps or welfare benefits, the response comes from \nIndia. The State of Missouri has contracted with a call center \noperator. It is about a $6 million annual contract, which I guess was \nthe best contract at the time that Missouri could get. They signed the \ncontract, and now those jobs have been outsourced to India.\n  This is something we hear a lot about. People are complaining about \noutsourcing. A very interesting figure was in the Wall Street Journal \nmaybe 10 days or so ago which talked about both sides: jobs going \noverseas and jobs coming back. And they came up with the startling \nfigure that--I think it was for 2003--there was $74 billion worth of \noutsourcing.\n  The United States spent $74 billion outsourcing to other countries, \nbut at the same time insourcing came to $131 billion, so that is a $54 \nbillion net increase in investment in jobs in this country.\n  We have done a little work and found out there are about 105,000 \nMissourians who have jobs with foreign companies in the State. I met \nwith the officials from the fine Webster University in St. Louis. They \nhave done some outsourcing. They have three campuses in China that \nprovide long-distance learning to people throughout Southeast Asia. I \ncan't tell you how many people, as I have made trips overseas to \npromote export of Missouri products and services, have told me they are \ngetting their degree from Webster University.\n  The question of outsourcing and insourcing has two sides. It is \nabsolutely important to not do any harm to jobs that are coming into \nthis country. But most importantly, we must make sure we don't do \nanything in Government that forces jobs out of this country. The FSC/\nETI bill is vitally needed. We need to pass it. We need to get \nconferees appointed on the Workforce Investment Act. We need to train \npeople so they will have the jobs.\n  I also focused this week on a battle we had on the energy bill. Carl \nLevin and I were successful in getting bipartisan support for the Bond-\nLevin amendment which imposed reasonable standards for increasing fuel \neconomy in autos, vans, and light trucks. We were fighting against \nsomething that, as you look at it, would possibly have led to a \nsignificant decline in U.S. jobs. The Kerry-McCain amendment would have \nsignificantly increased CAFE standards, and this could have penalized \nfull-line manufacturers. Those manufacturers--Ford, Daimler-Chrysler, \nGeneral Motors--have plants in Claycomo, Hazelwood, Fenton, Wentzville, \nMO, where working families have good jobs in the auto industry that \nwere put at risk.\n  I was very interested to go back to my files and find some letters \nfrom the UAW. In one, dated February 26, 2002, President Steve Yokich \nwrote urging support for the Bond-Levin proposal, saying the Hollings-\nKerry proposal discriminates against the big three auto companies. On \nthe second page, it says:\n\n       The UAW continues to support improvements in CAFE that are \n     economically and technologically feasible, and are structured \n     in a manner that is fair and even-handed towards all \n     companies. But we strongly oppose changes such as the \n     Hollings-Kerry proposal that call for increases that are \n     excessive and are structured in a manner that would \n     discriminate against the Big Three automakers or facilitate \n     the outsourcing of small car production to other countries. \n     Such proposals would result in serious job losses for \n     thousands of UAW members and other automotive workers.\n\n  We have to be careful as we look at regulatory efforts that might \ndrive jobs out of the country.\n  Alan Reuther wrote on March 13, 2002, saying the Kerry-McCain \namendment would mandate an excessive discriminatory increase in fuel \nstandards that would directly threaten thousands of jobs for UAW \nmembers and other automotive workers in the country and would enable \nthe big three auto companies to outsource their small car production to \nother countries, resulting in the loss of additional jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                          UAW,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2002.\n       Dear Senators: This week the Senate is expected to take up \n     energy legislation covering a wide range of issues. The UAW \n     strongly opposes the proposed changes in the Corporate \n     Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program which have been put forth \n     by Senators Hollings and Kerry. We urge you to oppose this \n     proposal, and to support the substitute CAFE proposal that \n     will be offered by Senators Levin and Bond.\n        The Hollings-Kerry CAFE proposal would raise fuel economy \n     standards for both cars and light trucks to 35 miles per \n     gallon by model year 2013. The UAW opposes Hollings-Kerry \n     CAFE proposal for three reasons:\n        (1) The Hollings-Kerry proposal increases CAFE standards \n     much too high and too quickly. The magnitude of the proposed \n     increase exceeds even the most optimistic scenarios projected \n     by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), and the proposed \n     timeframe for vehicles to meet that increase is substantially \n     less than the NAS projection. Under the Hollings-Kerry \n     proposal, light truck fuel economy would have to jump almost \n     70 percent to meet a 35 mph standard--one-and-a-half times \n     higher than even the most ``optimistic'' NAS projections. \n     Significantly, the cautious NAS projections only indicate an \n     average fuel economy increase of about 25 percent for light \n     trucks and 10 percent for cars by model years 2014 to 2019, \n     far below and later than what would be required under the \n     excessive Hollings-Kerry proposal. In addition, the increase \n     proposed by Hollings-Kerry would be made even more extreme by \n     their other proposals that would tighten testing requirements \n     and change the definition of light trucks to include vehicles \n     up to 10,000 lbs.\n        (2) The Hollings-Kerry proposal discriminates against the \n     Big Three auto companies. The Hollings-Kerry proposal applies \n     a flat miles per gallon increase to current CAFE standards \n     and also requires the standard for light trucks to be \n     harmonized upward to the substantially higher level \n     established for passenger cars. This approach would impose a \n     much heavier burden on the Big Three auto companies compared \n     to other automakers because the Big Three's product mix is \n     much more oriented towards larger cars and light trucks. \n     Under the Hollings-Kerry proposal, the Big Three would have \n     to increase their fuel economy by 40-50 percent compared to \n     less than a 15 percent increase for Honda. The net result is \n     the Big Three could be forced to curtail production of larger \n     vehicles, resulting in serious job loss for UAW members and \n     other workers.\n       (3) The Hollings-Kerry proposal would undermine continued \n     full-line domestic vehicle production by making it easier to \n     outsource small car production to other countries. The \n     Hollings-Kerry proposal gives the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration (NHTSA) discretion to eliminate the \n     distinction in the current CAFE program between domestic and \n     foreign car fleets. If this distinction were eliminated, the \n     Big Three auto companies would be able to outsource their \n     small car production to other countries. This is because they \n     would no longer be required to average the fuel economy of \n     more efficient, domestically built small cars with less \n     efficient larger cars produced here. In addition, by \n     establishing a CAFE credit-trading program, the Hollings-\n     Kerry proposal would also give the Big Three automakers the \n     ``flexibility'' to outsource their small car production to \n     other countries. Taken together, these provisions could \n     result in the loss of thousands of additional automotive jobs \n     in this country.\n       The UAW continues to support improvements in CAFE that are \n     economically and technologically feasible, and are structured \n     in a manner that is fair and even-handed towards all \n     companies. But we strongly oppose changes such as the \n     Hollings-Kerry proposal that call for increases that are \n     excessive and are structured in a manner that would \n     discriminate against the Big Three automakers or facilitate \n     the outsourcing of small car production to other countries. \n     Such proposals would result in serious job loss for thousands \n     of UAW members and other automotive workers.\n       We understand that Senators Levin and Bond will offer a \n     substitute CAFE proposal that would require the Department of \n     Transportation to complete a rulemaking within 15 months to \n     increase fuel economy standards for both cars and light \n     trucks. This substitute directs DOT to consider a wide range \n     of factors, including technological and economic feasibility, \n     the costs and lead time required for the introduction of new \n     technologies, the disparate impacts on manufacturers due to \n     differences in product mix, and safety considerations. In \n     addition, this substitute would require DOT to continue the \n     existing distinction between foreign and domestic fleets. The \n     UAW believes the Levin-Bond proposal represents a more \n     balanced approach that would lead to significant improvements \n     in fuel economy without jeopardizing thousands of good paying \n     automotive jobs in this country. Accordingly, we strongly \n     urge you to vote for the Levin-Bond substitute and against \n     the Hollings-Kerry proposal.\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\n       The auto industry is already experiencing significant \n     economic difficulties, and the Big Three automakers have \n     announced widespread layoffs. In light of this background, \n     the UAW submits that this is not the time to impose onerous, \n     discriminatory fuel economy standards on the auto companies \n     that will only lead to further jobs loss, with potentially \n     adverse impacts on the overall economy.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this priority issue \n     that directly affects the jobs of thousands of UAW members \n     and other workers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                              UAW,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2002.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Today the Senate is scheduled to vote on \n     amendments dealing with the CAFE issue. The UAW strongly \n     urges you to vote for the Levin-Bond substitute and against \n     the Kerry-McCain amendment.\n       The Levin-Bond substitute would require the Dept. of \n     Transportation to issue new fuel economy standards on an \n     expedited basis, after taking into consideration a wide range \n     of factors, including employment, safety, technology, \n     economic practicability and the relative competitive impacts \n     on companies. The UAW supports this substitute because we \n     believe it will lead to a significant improvement in fuel \n     economy, without jeopardizing the jobs of American workers.\n       In contrast, the Kerry-McCain amendment would mandate an \n     excessive, discrimatory increase in fuel economy standard \n     that would directly threaten thousands of jobs for UAW \n     members and other automotive workers in this country. The 36 \n     mpg fuel economy standard that would be required by Kerry-\n     McCain for both cars and trucks goes far beyond even the most \n     optimistic projections by the National Academy of Sciences. \n     In addition, the structure of the proposed fuel economy \n     increases--a flat mpg requirement for both cars and trucks--\n     would impose a much heavier burden on the Big Three \n     automakers and jeopardize production and jobs associated with \n     their large car and truck plants. Furthermore, by eliminating \n     the distinction between foreign and domestic car fleets, the \n     proposal would enable the Big Three auto companies to \n     outsource their small car production to other countries, \n     resulting in the loss of additional jobs.\n       The UAW believes it is critically important that any \n     increases in fuel economy standards be economically and \n     technologically feasible, and that they be structured in a \n     manner that does not jeopardize jobs in this country. To \n     accomplish this objective, we believe the Senate must approve \n     the Levin-Bond substitute, and reject the Kerry-McCain \n     amendment.\n       Thank you for considering our views on these two priority \n     votes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. The last time I spoke on this, I pointed out there were a \nnumber of other things we have done that really do endanger jobs. I \nmentioned the small engine proposal where, fortunately, we were able to \nstop the California Air Resources Board from mandating the use of \ncatalytic converters on small engines for lawn mowers, leaf blowers, \nand chainsaws that would have forced the closure of plants in the \nUnited States that make those small engines and in all likelihood \noutsourced 22,000 American jobs to China.\n  I also talked about asbestos litigation which has driven much of the \nrefractories business out of the United States because of the excessive \nburden of the asbestos claims. We need to move on a good asbestos \nreform bill to pay those who are truly sick and stop the jackpot \njustice for plaintiffs' attorneys who seek to sue anybody who has had \nanything to do with asbestos, whether plaintiffs are sick or not.\n  Finally, natural gas is a major source of outsourcing right now. Not \nonly does it hit homes that heat with natural gas with high bills; it \nputs heavy costs on farmers who use fertilizer coming from natural gas. \nThe artificially inflated demand Congress has mandated and the \nartificially constrained supply Congress has mandated have pushed the \ncost of natural gas so high that many natural gas producing industries \nhave had to move their operations to other countries where the demand \nis not artificially inflated and the supply is not curtailed.\n  We are outsourcing jobs because of our policy on natural gas. We have \nforced natural gas use in electric generating boilers which is not an \neffective use of that valuable commodity. We need a good energy bill. \nWe need to stop the filibusters and get an energy bill done. We need to \nmove forward on the asbestos litigation reform bill. We need to move \nforward on the FSC/ETI bill. All of these are being filibustered or \nstopped or delayed, and we need to get about it.\n  We need to get the Workforce Investment Act. We need to appoint \nconferees so we can train these people. One of the great needs is for \nmore workers with scientific engineering and technological backgrounds \nbecause those are the jobs of the future. We need to train them. \nSenator Mikulski and I need money in the VA-HUD bill to increase the \nNational Science Foundation so they can develop more student interest \nin basic science and get more minorities and women involved. We have a \nlot of challenges to meet the changing needs of the job force in the \n21st century. Rather than bloviating about one part of the problem, we \nneed to fix the entire problem.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Snowe-Dodd \namendment to add $6 billion more in child care funding to the welfare \nbill that is before the Senate.\n  There is no issue more important than child care assistance in the \ncontext of this reauthorization. I commend Senators Snowe and Dodd for \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  Child care assistance is critical for a number of reasons.\n  First, there is a strong connection between access to child care and \nthe ability of parents to join and stay in the workforce.\n  Second, quality child care is critical to building the foundations \nfor school readiness and later academic success.\n  Third, states are facing tough economic times and they are cutting \nback on support for child care. Our children need additional help from \nthe Federal Government.\n  Child care is the No. 1 issue facing families today. Seventy-five \npercent of American children under the age of five spend at least part \nof their day in child care.\n  In Vermont, over 80 percent of women with children under the age of \nsix are in the workforce.\n  Without access to child care, these families are often forced to \nleave their employment and seek public assistance.\n  We must support additional child care funding in order to support \nlow-income parents and help them remain in the workforce.\n  Quality child care helps lay the groundwork for school readiness and \nsuccess later in life. We know that the most crucial time for a child's \nbrain development is from birth to 5 years old.\n  Elementary and secondary education are extremely important.\n  But without a positive, high-quality experience in the earliest \nstages of development, too many children are set up for failure in \nelementary, middle and high school.\n  By adopting the Snowe-Dodd amendment, we will give more parents the \npower to choose high-quality child care for their children and give \nthose children the opportunity to get the most out of their early \nyears.\n  If we are truly serious about closing the achievement gap among our \nstudents, and between the United States and our international \ncompetitors, then funding for high-quality early childhood care is the \nplace to begin.\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\n  The States are facing tough financial situations. The General \nAccounting Office found that since January 2001, twenty-three States \nhave made changes that would decrease the availability of child care \nassistance; while only nine States made changes that could increase \nchild care availability.\n  I want to underscore this point.\n  According to the GAO, nearly half of the States are decreasing the \navailability of child care for working families. And this report may \njust be the tip of the iceberg. Federal funding is critical to reverse \nthis trend.\n  My colleagues must understand the importance of this issue. By \nadopting this amendment, we can help families move off of welfare \npermanently. Or we can prevent them from needing welfare assistance in \nthe first place.\n  I see this amendment not as a choice, but as a necessity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Snowe-Dodd amendment, to support our working \nfamilies and to support our youngest children.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the \nPersonal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act, \ncalled the PRIDE Act.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, we have seen wonderful examples of \nindividuals, with a little drive and ambition, seizing one of the \nabundant opportunities this great Nation has to offer, and move, \nliterally, from nothing in their pockets to a lifetime of incredible \nsuccess.\n  That being said, up until 1996, this notion of America being ``the \nland of opportunity'' was nearly unknown to millions of welfare \nrecipients who were bogged down by the stifling, cash assistance \nwelfare system our Nation had embraced for over 100 years.\n  With the enactment of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nlegislation--we call it TANF--in 1996, that all changed. We offered \nindividuals who had previously been shut out of the American dream the \nopportunity to eliminate poverty and move their families toward the \nempowering goal of self-sufficiency.\n  Welfare reform has been one of the most successful social policy \nreforms in U.S. history. We have seen millions of people focus their \nenergies and efforts on their responsibilities and acquiring an \nattitude of providing for themselves. They have learned it by daily \npractice.\n  Nearly 3 million families have been lifted out of poverty. Employment \nby mothers most at risk to go on welfare has risen by 40 percent since \n1995. Each of us in this body is encouraged to see the profound, \npositive effects TANF has had on the lives of those who require \ntemporary assistance.\n  Caseloads are down 58 percent, and assistance recipients are working \nmore than ever before. Thus, these hard-working people are leading \nthemselves back to self-sufficiency.\n  As the Department of Health and Human Services has reported, welfare \ncaseload reductions are primarily a result of implementing the welfare \nreforms contained in the original TANF legislation--and not merely due \nto the robust economy of the late 1990s.\n  I think we also need to recognize that the States themselves have \nheld the key to the success of these programs by taking advantage of \nthe flexibility built into the original TANF legislation.\n  Many States throughout the Nation have offered welfare plans \nand created specific, effective programs that are working well with \ntheir constituencies. The States' work has been well documented, as \nmany States have reported caseload declines of over 70 percent since \n1996.\n\n  TANF funds transferred by the States and used for childcare funding \nhave also been an enormously positive development, and States are \nmatching Federal spending in the area of childcare.\n  This is creating a good foundation where working parents can go back \nto work knowing that their children are being well cared for. I need \nonly look to my home State of Utah to see the successes of the 1996 \nTANF law.\n  Since August of 1996, TANF rolls have decreased over 45 percent, \nwhile the quality and professional attention given to recipients has \nbeen steadily going up.\n  Utah has been a pioneer State in the development of personal, value-\nadded attention and planning for those who are receiving assistance. \nUniversal engagement of every assistance recipient is a necessity, and \nI applaud my home State of Utah for leading the way in this area. I \nalso thank Chairman Grassley for putting the provision in the bill.\n  My home State has also pioneered work in the promotion of marriage \nand family formation. Under then-Governor Michael Leavitt, Utah was the \nfirst State in the Nation to form a commission on marriage, which was \ncharged with the overreaching goal of strengthening marriages in Utah. \nI am pleased to see this bill includes $200 million in matching grants \nfor States to provide marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood \nprograms.\n  The marriage unit is the most fundamental in society. If the bond of \nmarriage weakens, so does our society, including the rising generation. \nIt is widely recognized that a healthy, loving marriage between a man \nand a woman not only provides great personal happiness, it also creates \nthe safest place for children to thrive and benefit from the full \nemotional, moral, and educational benefits that two married parents can \nprovide.\n  I also commend President Bush for his commitment and efforts to \nstrengthen healthy marriages.\n  Let me turn to another important component of the bill, the family \nself-sufficiency plan. Under current law, States are under no \nobligation to understand and assess the circumstances of each recipient \nreceiving assistance. However, under the universal engagement \nprovisions of this bill, it will be incumbent upon each State to meet \nwith each recipient and create a plan, using all the support tools \navailable to the State, to help the recipient achieve self-sufficiency.\n  This is a very important measure because it seeks to give each and \nevery recipient a roadmap toward independence and success--a light at \nthe end of the tunnel. It also signals to States that all TANF families \ndeserve a chance to become self-sufficient and no one can be left to \nfall through the cracks in the system.\n  In Utah, I have seen that many of these parents, hard-working people, \nyoung and old, end up finding great self satisfaction in giving their \ngift of skill at work, at giving themselves to a task at hand so \nthoroughly that they have a meaningful relationship with their work. I \nthink we will all agree that sometimes it is not easy to dive into your \nwork with enthusiasm, but sometimes it is necessary and appropriate.\n  That is why it is so important that the work requirements are \nincreased in this bill. The core work requirement is increased from 20 \nhours per week to 24 hours per week. Total hours required for a State \nto receive full credit increases from 30 hours per week to 34 hours per \nweek for single-parent families. These are sensible, reasonable \nrequirements.\n  Two-parent families will be required to work 39 hours per week, or 55 \nhours per week if they receive subsidized childcare. States will \nreceive partial credit if individuals work 20 hours per\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\nweek, and extra credit if they work more than 34 hours per week. \nCurrent law provides full credit only at 30 hours.\n  Again, these changes in the current law will help us make real \nprogress.\n  It seems obvious that the more a person sets goals and takes \nresponsibility for the career they want, the more they will be able to \ndecide if a particular job fits into the scheme of their life. The \nharder they work--that is, the more hours they work--the more they \nunderstand why they are working at a particular job and how their hard \nwork will benefit their individual families.\n  I believe the most important new provision in this bill is the \nestablishment of a meaningful State participation rate. For years now, \nStates have had no reason to actively recruit adults into industrious \nwork and work-related activities. Under this bill, States would be \nrequired to have 70 percent of their caseload involved in approved work \nactivities by the year 2008. This would require States to significantly \nramp up their efforts to engage a much greater number of families in \nactivities that count toward the work participation rate.\n  Right now, the majority of adults receiving assistance are reporting \nzero hours of activity. It is time we recognize that with an effective \nparticipation rate, and by the elimination of the caseload reduction \ncredit in the 1996 welfare law, we will encourage people to commit to \ncareers, to goals, to real recovery.\n  Another striking result I would like to note has been the effect of \nwelfare reform on African-American children. For the 25 years before \nwelfare reform, before the TANF bill in 1996, the percentage of \nAfrican-American children living in poverty remained virtually \nunchanged. But since welfare reform, the poverty rate among those \nchildren has dropped from 41.5 percent in 1995 to 32.1 percent in \n2002--still way too high, but it has been a definite, dramatic drop, \nand TANF deserves most of the credit for that situation. About 1 \nmillion African-American children--roughly the entire population of \nDallas, Detroit, or San Diego--are no longer in poverty because of \nwelfare reform.\n  There is still much to be done. Currently, 58 percent of those on \nwelfare are not working or training to work, and 2 million families \nremain completely dependent on welfare for their survival. The full \npotential of this legislation has not been realized because of lax \nenforcement and efforts to undermine the principles and goals of \nreform. Let's look at this.\n  Among poor families with children, one-quarter to one-third do not \nwork at all. The rest work sometimes, but not full time or year-round.\n  Only a fourth of poor families have full-time employment, and by that \nI mean 40 hours a week throughout the year. Because of this low rate, \nmany remain poor.\n  Overall, among all poor families with children, most adults work only \n16 hours a week whether the economy is good or bad. If all poor \nfamilies with children had just one full-time adult employed year-round \n40 hours a week, America's child poverty rate would drop dramatically. \nMany poor families would immediately be lifted out of poverty.\n  Last September, with my support, the Finance Committee reported this \nbill to reauthorize TANF and other programs for the next 5 years and to \nstrengthen welfare reform further. This would greatly increase work \nrequirements for working families so that 70 percent are participating \nin work or job preparation activities by fiscal year 2008.\n  All recipients should work full time either in a job or in programs \ndesigned to help them achieve independence. A 4-week cushion is \nincluded for vacation and sick leave, simulating a typical work \nschedule in the United States. And the plan makes special \naccommodations for parents with infants and individuals who need \nsubstance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, or special training.\n  One area of concern for me, and the citizens of Utah, is the \ndifficulty many recipients will have in meeting the work requirement \nwhen they are unable to defeat an addictive drug habit or suffer from a \ndevastating disability. I suspect many of those individuals who remain \non welfare are those with drug dependencies or other ailments that are \ndifficult to treat.\n\n  Under the current bill, only 3 months of rehabilitation services may \nbe counted as an acceptable activity. In the Finance Committee, I \noffered an amendment that was adopted that extends this credit an \nadditional 3 months as long as the State deems it necessary and the \nrecipient is engaged in increasing amounts of work or job-readiness \nactivity. I hope my colleagues agree with me that this is the right way \nto help these individuals get free of dependency and find meaningful \nemployment.\n  Another amendment of mine that was included in the committee bill \nestablished a pre-sanction review. Families in Utah who are in need of \nservices, such as substance abuse treatment, must receive the \nassistance they need to overcome barriers to employment. This is why I \nbelieve States must conduct a pre-sanction review before taking action \nagainst parents who are considered noncompliant. It does not seem fair \nthat a parent is subjected to sanctions and case closures because of \ntheir State's limited substance abuse treatment capacity. If substance \nabuse treatment services are not available to the parent, States should \nrefrain from sanctions or case closures.\n  The review established by my amendment requires States to review a \nrecipient's self-sufficiency plan and consult with the recipient before \nenforcing any sanctions or taking away the recipient's cash assistance \nor welfare services. This provision is necessary to give recipients \nwith significant barriers to work, such as a disability or a drug \ndependency, a real chance to meet the State's requirements prior to \nhaving their assistance taken away.\n  Another important area I would like to discuss is childcare. We all \nnow agree that childcare is an essential part of encouraging people to \nwork. I am pleased to see that this bill includes an additional $1 \nbillion in funding for childcare. Even so, I think we need to go a step \nfurther. And I compliment, in particular, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Snowe, and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Dodd, with whom years ago I worked to pass the first childcare bill \nin history. He has kept at it and kept on it, and I personally respect \nand appreciate it. Of course, I am a cosponsor of this amendment as \nwell. There are countless examples of how our country benefits from \nprograms that allow hard-working parents to stay employed, and we need \nto support the efforts of working families by finding ways to help with \nchildcare assistance. Parents need to know they have access to quality \nchildcare.\n  I would like to make it clear that with the current budget situation, \nI am not advocating for large increases in Federal discretionary \nspending. I am very concerned about the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is running a deficit and that our Federal debt is \naccumulating. High deficits and a mountain of Federal debt represent \nreal obligations that hurt our economic security, both now and in the \nfuture, and hurt every person we are trying to help here.\n  That being said, I recognize the very real and pressing need for \nimproved childcare services. The 1990 childcare law Senator Dodd and I \nhelped get passed was one of our most important initiatives, and \ncertainly I think each of us claims and feels it was each of our \nimportant initiatives. I was pleased to join Senator Dodd in that \neffort.\n  It is clear to me after much study that the funding contained in the \nfinance bill is simply not adequate. I am supportive of increasing that \nfunding even more, provided they are accompanied by responsible offsets \nto hold down the costs and, in this case, this amendment will.\n  We should recognize that many assistance recipients across our \ncountry will struggle to meet the requirement for increased work hours \nif they are not able to find and use quality childcare services. While \nwe are trying to get people to work, we ought to try to help their \nchildren in the process. Funding for childcare should go hand in hand \nwith an increase in the work requirement. I and others--Senator Snowe \nin particular--have fought very hard for that in the Finance Committee. \nWe cannot expect these mothers and fathers to feel comfortable\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nleaving children alone or in the care of someone who is not competent \nin order to meet a higher work requirement standard.\n  A question we often ask ourselves is, ``Is this a perfect bill?'' I \nwould have to say my answer to that question would be ``no.'' But I am \nsure there are many on both sides who would like to change it one way \nor the other. Most people have to admit this represents a compromise of \nmany competing interests. If I had written the bill, I surely would \nhave done some things differently. But I think Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus have done a terrific job on this bill under the \ncircumstances. These types of bills are always hard fought. This is a \ngood one with sensible, reasonable compromises.\n  In closing, I want to again personally recognize the substantial work \nof Chairman Grassley, the Democratic leader on the committee, Senator \nBaucus, and the Senate leadership for bringing this very important bill \nto the floor.\n  Over the last 2 years, it has been my pleasure to work with many of \nmy esteemed colleagues on the Finance Committee from both parties to \ncreate an effective welfare reauthorization bill. I also thank Becky \nShipp, who now serves on the Finance Committee, for her tireless work \nover the past 18 months and prior to that to help craft a welfare bill \nthat will improve the lives of many Americans.\n  My own staff, headed by Jace Johnson and Jenny George, has done a \nterrific job.\n  These people did superior work for me and the people of Utah for \nalmost 10 years and I was very fortunate to have Becky and now Jace, as \nmembers of my staff.\n  In closing, let there be no misunderstanding as to what this bill \ndoes. It strengthens and improves the current welfare laws and gives \npoor families a realistic chance at achieving self-fulfillment.\n  The most generous behavior Americans could choose is taking \nresponsibility for ourselves, our thoughts, our actions, and our needs. \nThe most beneficial act we in Congress can perform is to allow those \nless fortunate to succeed and to help them meet their responsibilities \nfor themselves, their families, and their communities. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation because I am confident this \nbill, when passed, will benefit the entire country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final 4 minutes prior \nto the 12:15 p.m. vote be equally divided between Senators Dodd and \nSnowe, with Senator Dodd in control of the first 2 minutes and Senator \nSnowe in control of the final 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object. I request, if I could, of \nthe Senator from Utah--I understand under a previous unanimous consent \nagreement yesterday I would have 10 minutes to speak. Is that right? I \nwant to make sure I still have my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may be allowed to \nspeak for up to 12 minutes under the time under the control of the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \ngraciously allowing me to take a few minutes here to speak on the \namendment I am offering along with my colleague from Maine, Senator \nSnowe. I thank her at the outset for her eloquent comments yesterday \nabout the importance of this amendment and her kind comments about the \nSenator from Connecticut as well.\n  Let me also very quickly, while he is still here with us on the \nfloor, commend my good friend from Utah. I remember with fondness, \ngoing back almost 15 or 16 years ago, when we offered the very first \neffort to include as part of our efforts on behalf of working families \nof this country a childcare proposal. That never would have happened \nwithout the tremendous leadership of the Senator from Utah, who was \npretty much alone, I might say, in those days, in advocating this \nimportant initiative on the part of the Federal Government to try to do \nsomething to help these families who were trying to stay on the work \nrolls.\n  I would be remiss in any discussion about a childcare proposal not to \nreference the incredible work of the Senator from Utah. Again, I thank \nhim for his leadership and I thank him as well for his cosponsorship of \nthis amendment we are offering today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks and mention that \nbill would never have occurred without the strength and character he \ndemonstrated, helping to bring it forth. It was a tough time. We had to \nbattle many forces. But in the end, this childcare bill has done an \nawful lot of good for people in this country. I want to express my \nrespect for my colleague and thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  The whole goal, of course, of the underlying bill before us is to \nmove families from welfare to work. That has been the goal of those who \ninitiated this proposal some time ago. Of course, many of us ask the \nquestion how in good conscience we could do that, turn our backs on \nthose who are doing what we asked them to do, and that is to leave the \ndependency of welfare and to enter the workforce. Yet without the \nadoption of the Snowe-Dodd amendment, it is quite clear some 450,000 to \n500,000 children who are presently receiving childcare assistance would \nhave to be dropped from receiving childcare assistance. I don't think \nany of us want to be a party to that at all.\n  Let me further point this out to my colleagues as a backdrop of why \nthe Snowe-Dodd amendment is so critically important. Between 1994 up to \n2001, we have seen employment by families headed by single mothers soar \nfrom 61 percent to now about 75 percent of single parents with children \nwho are in the workforce. Among low-income mothers with children under \nthe age 6, who have the greatest childcare costs and needs, employment \nhas risen from 44 percent in 1996 to about 60 percent in the year 2000.\n  Let me further point out there are 7 million children every day who \ngo home from school alone, without any kind of afterschool or childcare \nassistance. These are children aged, some of them, between 6 and 7 \nyears of age.\n  I don't have to say much more to make the case about the importance \nof doing what we can here to see to it we have the necessary childcare \nassistance that working families, poor working families are going to \nneed.\n  What is presently occurring across the country is States cannot pick \nup the slack in the current bill. In the year 2003 alone, facing the \nworst State economies since World War II, 16 States have reduced \neligibility levels so that fewer children will qualify for assistance. \nAbout 600,000 children in 24 States were put on waiting lists. Nearly \nevery State made other changes in their childcare programs, such as \nreducing subsidies, increasing parent copays, cutting or eliminating \nafterschool programs, or shutting off assistance to families not on \nwelfare--working poor families. States even made cuts in childcare \nquality investments such as reducing safety inspections.\n\n  In my own State of Connecticut, last week the State legislature \nrecommended cutting another $20 million for the States Care4Kids \nchildcare program. I say another $20 million because this is the most \nrecent cut enacted in my State. The program will have gone from $121.5 \nmillion in fiscal year 2002 down to $70 million for next year.\n  In the meantime, of course, costs for childcare have continued to \nrise. Although the economy seems to be improving, not just Connecticut, \nbut many States continue to face very tough budget decisions.\n  On this chart, every one of these little figures represents 2,000 \nchildren on a wait list across the country. I will not go through the \nentire list, but just to get some idea of what I am talking about, in \nAlabama, 16,700; Arizona, 8,000; California, 280,000; Florida 48,800; \nhere in the District of Columbia, 1,400. In my State of Connecticut, \n15,000 children are on wait lists; in Georgia, 30,000. It goes on. \nThese are 24 States that keep lists. Other States don't keep waiting \nlists at all because frankly they don't want to know the numbers, and I \ndon't blame them, because they are struggling across the country with \nthe numbers of children who are qualified and would be eligible for \nchildcare assistance but can't get it. These are\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nthe children on the wait list who presently need it.\n  Imagine, if you are not a parent of a young child yourself, \ncolleagues, you may have children who are parents. Ask them, ask people \nin your office, what it is like today if you are going to work, you \nhave a young child, and you are asked to pay $4,000 to $6,000 to $8,000 \nto $10,000 a year for childcare assistance.\n  Our staffs are pretty well taken care of. We have childcare centers \nfor Senate employees. We have childcare centers around Capitol Hill and \nother places. But if you are a working parent holding down a job and \nyou don't have those kinds of incomes and revenues, you have some idea \nof what it must be. Data from the Child Care Bureau shows 21 percent of \nchildcare recipients receive TANF funds. This means nearly 80 percent \nof childcare funds are used to help working poor families. If childcare \nfunds are not increased, the working poor will be cast aside so States \nhave sufficient funds to help the welfare poor.\n  We ought not rob Peter to pay Paul. Both need our help--those on \nwelfare moving to work and those who have moved from welfare to work \nbut are just barely hanging on. If we deprive them of this additional \nassistance they fall right back. What good is that, in the welfare \nreform bill, where our underlying goal is to move people from welfare \nto work, not only temporarily but permanently, if we can?\n  The level of funding in the Finance Committee bill which provides an \nincrease of $200 million a year, in our view--Senator Snowe and myself \nand others who are cosponsoring this amendment--is woefully \ninsufficient. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost \nabout $1.5 billion in additional childcare money to meet the work \nrequirements under the Senate welfare bill. But that is not the full \nstory.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also estimates even if there were no \nincrease in the work requirements in this bill--of course, there are \nadditional work requirements--it would cost an additional $4.5 billion \nover the next 5 years to maintain assistance for the 2 million children \nwho currently receive help for childcare. A subsidy provided for the \nfamily today would simply not cover the cost 5 years from now. Again, \nyou don't have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand that.\n  To do otherwise is to shift costs to States or the parents, neither \nof whom are in a position to pick up the slack for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Let me put this chart up as well. It will give you some sense of what \nI am talking about. You may not be able to see this very clearly. Every \nsingle one of the X's in every one of these States all across the \ncountry indicates the State has cut back in one way or another in terms \nof childcare assistance.\n  As I mentioned earlier, 24 States have a waiting list for childcare. \nOther States do not have a waiting list--not because they do not need \nassistance, but because they do not want to keep those waiting lists.\n  It is good news that welfare caseloads are down, although I \nunderstand the caseloads in a number of States have actually gone up. A \nreduced caseload does not mean a reduction in the need for childcare \nfor low-income working families. What we know from studies about \nfamilies leaving welfare is they are leaving welfare for low-wage jobs. \nThey have left the ranks of the welfare poor to join the ranks of the \nworking poor. Their need for childcare assistance has not changed. In \nfact, it may have gone up. Many State administrators believe the \navailability of childcare is one of the chief reasons welfare caseloads \nhave declined.\n  Nevertheless, the purpose of childcare funding is to assist low-\nincome families regardless of whether they receive welfare. Childcare \ncan easily cost between $4,000 and $10,000 a year for one child, more \nthan the cost of public college tuition in nearly every State. \nTherefore, the fact that welfare rolls have been declining is \nirrelevant to whether families need childcare assistance.\n  Nearly one-quarter of the TANF funds used to support childcare \nassistance is either transferred from TANF to childcare or spent \ndirectly on childcare. But estimates show that States are expected to \nspend a declining percentage of TANF funds on childcare as work \nrequirements increase and TANF reserve funds from early years of the \nprogram are exhausted. In fact, most States, including my own of \nConnecticut, have exhausted their TANF reserve funds, or have nearly \nexhausted them.\n  States simply are not awash in TANF money. If they were, they would \nnot be slashing childcare funding. Yet nearly every State has made cuts \nin childcare assistance. Let us be very clear. The promise made in 1996 \nwhen four separate childcare programs were consolidated as part of \nwelfare reform was this would be a simpler program to administer, and \nchildcare assistance would no longer be tied to welfare. Childcare \nassistance would be available for low-wage families regardless of \nwelfare receipt. Now it appears that lacking sufficient funds, States \nsuch as my own are shutting off assistance to the working poor.\n  My colleagues are telling these families: Work your way off welfare, \nbut once you are off, that is it. They are among the working poor. They \nare no longer a concern to many of my colleagues here. I disagree.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, the chair and ranking \nDemocrat of this committee, along with Senator Hatch and others for \nunderstanding this basic concept. Working poor families need this help \nor they will fall back into a dependency role.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, as I mentioned, some 450,000 kids \nof the 2 million presently being served could lose childcare \nassistance.\n  I mentioned as well how single working mothers and their employment \nforce has actually gone up to 75 percent and the poorest families \nactually have gone up almost 20 percent in the last 4 or 5 years. These \nmothers need childcare assistance. They don't have alternatives. They \nare single parents. They do not live necessarily in the old \nneighborhoods where there was someone next door or down the block or on \nthe neighboring farm who would take care of them. They need this kind \nof help.\n  I know my time has expired. Let me say this is not only my view. \nThere is a list of organizations which I ask unanimous consent to be \nprinted in the Record, beginning with the National Governors \nAssociation, all of whom, regardless of political persuasion or \nideology, urge support for our amendment. They understand these \nfamilies need our support. I ask unanimous consent that the list be \nprinted in the Record, along with letters of endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Snowe-Dodd Amendment Groups Supporting $6 Billion for Child Care\n\n       National Governors Association, American Public Human \n     Services Association, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, National AfterSchool Association, Big Brothers \n     Big Sisters of America, Easter Seals, National Women's Law \n     Center, Children's Defense Fund, Generations United, National \n     Association for the Education of Young Children, Center for \n     Law and Social Policy, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, National \n     Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, \n     National Collaboration for Youth, I Am Your Child Foundation.\n       Girls Incorporated, National Crime Prevention Council, \n     National Institute for Out-of-School Time, United Way of \n     America, YWCA, Campfires USA, AED Center for Youth \n     Development and Policy, Adapted Physical Activity Council, \n     Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of \n     Hearing, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Association on Mental Retardation, American Dance \n     Therapy Association, American Foundation of the Blind, \n     American Music Therapy Association, American Occupation \n     Therapy Association, Association for Maternal and Child \n     Health Programs, Association of University Centers on \n     Disabilities.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Council of Parent \n     Advocates and Attorneys, Division of Early Childhood of the \n     Council for Exceptional Children, Epilepsy Foundation, \n     Federal of Families for Children's Mental Health, Helen \n     Keller National Center, IDEA Infant and Toddler Coordinators \n     Association, International Dyslexia Association.\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America, National \n     Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems, National \n     Association of School Psychologists, National Association of \n     Social Workers, National Coalition on Deaf-Blindness, \n     National Consortium for Physical Education and Recreation for \n     Individuals with Disabilities, Research Institute for \n     Independent Living.\n       School Social Workers Association of America, Spina Bifida \n     Association of America, TASH, The Arc of the United States,\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n     United Cerebral Palsy, USAction, US Action Education Fund, \n     Volunteers of America, Youth Service America, 4 Counties for \n     Kids (IL), Akron After-School (OH).\n       Arizona School-Age Coalition, Arizona State University, \n     California School Age Coalition, Campfire USA First Texas \n     Council, Circle ``C'' Ranch Academy (Tampa, FL), Columbia \n     Heights Youth Club, Connecticut After-School Alliance, \n     Connecticut School-Age Care Alliance, Flood Brook Community \n     Collaborative (S.

Mr. President, Senator Snowe, cosponsors of this amendment, \nand myself, believe the amendment deserves support. We urge adoption of \nit.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I am going to vote yes on the amendment of the Senator from Maine. \nThere are several reasons.\n  I have already stated yesterday in remarks that I believe the next \nphase of welfare reform must focus on strengthening work and \nopportunities for people to move from welfare to work. Of course, work \nis the key to self-sufficiency. Hence, this bill; this bill strengthens \nwork. It would increase the participation rate requirement for States \nas well as increase the standard hours for individuals.\n  The typical welfare adult case is usually a single mother with a \nyoung child, many of whom lack even a high school degree. These are \nwomen who work more often than not. These women more often than not \nhave families in crisis. They can't find a way to make their lives \nwork. They need help.\n  If we are asking these women to go to work and to move from part-time \nto full-time work, if that is the case for some, childcare is an \nintegral part of ensuring they can successfully meet the challenge \nrequired by law--a challenge that is good for society. Moving people \nout of welfare into the world of work is the only way they can move up \nthe economic ladder. A life of welfare is a life of poverty.\n  Lack of good, affordable childcare is often a barrier to succeeding \nin the workplace. I am committed to doing everything I can to help \nthese families succeed in work. That is good for the taxpayer as well \nas for the families. I have come to the conclusion that increasing \nfunding for childcare is a key to accomplishing that goal.\n  As we know, States are facing budget deficits and childcare funding \nin those States has been frozen. Certainly in the context of a debate \nover welfare reform and progress, we should be mindful that States have \nspent resources to provide childcare to families attempting a \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  I believe in the context of the debate over welfare reform we should \nconsider whether it is important that we provide a level of funding \nsufficient so States can maintain the childcare supporting services \nthey have been providing to welfare recipients and low-income families. \nI have concluded it is important to continue those services. I \nrecognize in order to do that, we need to provide additional resources \nin the specific area of childcare.\n  If we were merely to increase childcare funding at a rate to keep up \nwith inflation on the current level of spending, we would increase it \nby about $1.5 billion. If we include the $1 billion already in the bill \nbefore the Senate as it was reported out of committee and adjust that \nfor inflation as well as including what the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates are the childcare costs associated with increasing the work \nrequirement, we are close to $3.3 billion in additional childcare \ncosts. This is what we know. We know we need at least $3.3 billion to \nmeet the challenge of childcare. Now we have heard we need anywhere \nfrom $4 billion to $5 billion for States to continue providing services \nrelated to childcare.\n  I don't think we know for sure the exact increase of childcare \nfunding we need to maintain the current level of services. However, I \ndo think we need to assume there is a need, and an increasing need.\n\n  I do not believe $6 billion over 5 years is an unreasonable increase \nin childcare funding, given the increase in the work requirements, the \ncurrent State budget situation, and the importance of maintaining at \nthe very least the current level of childcare support available to low-\nincome families.\n  Therefore, I will vote for the Snowe amendment. I ask my colleagues \nto do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to say how gratified I am to hear \nSenator Grassley. I was very much encouraged to hear the comments of \nSenator Hatch.\n  As I see, we have been joined on the floor by Senator Snowe of Maine, \nthe author of this amendment, and by Senator Dodd, who spoke just a few \nminutes ago.\n  I want to express to them my heartfelt thanks for their leadership in \nbringing this issue before us, and for working to build consensus \naround this amendment.\n  I strongly support this. In explaining that support, I go a long way \nback in time, back to 1936. In 1936, we did not have a welfare program \nat the Federal level in this country. In 1936, we adopted something \nafter the encouragement of FDR that largely provided cash assistance to \nwidows with children. Over the years, from 1936 through World War II \nand into the 1980s and 1990s, welfare changed.\n  By 1996, when welfare reform was adopted, widows and children were \neligible for cash assistance on AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren. A lot of the people receiving AFDC had children. For the most \npart, they were not widows. For the most part, they had never been \nmarried.\n  Despite the best of intentions, what we created after 1936 was a \nprogram that encouraged many women to have children, oftentimes at a \nyoung age; encouraged men to impregnate them; and encouraged the men to \nwalk away from the children they helped to create as if they had \nnothing to do with it.\n  That is not to say welfare as we knew it did not do a lot of good. It \ndid. But it also caught a lot of people in quicksand from which they \nfound it difficult to escape.\n  Members may recall the debate back in the 1990s. Bill Clinton, when \nhe ran for President, said we need to change welfare as we know it. One \nof the reasons is, in the early 1990s, a lot of people were better off \non welfare than they were working.\n  For the folks who went to work, who got off of welfare, here is what \nthey gained: They gained the right to pay taxes, State income taxes, \nFederal income taxes, Social Security taxes.\n  Here is what they lost: They may lose their health care, their \nMedicaid health care; they may lose food stamp eligibility; they may \nlose assisted housing; they have to figure out how to pay for \ntransportation to get to a job; and they will have to figure out how to \npay for childcare.\n  That all changed effectively in 1996. A lot of Governors were \ninvolved, including some who serve here today: Governors Voinovich, \nAllen, myself, and Evan Bayh of Indiana worked with a whole lot of \nother Governors, including John Engler of Michigan, to provide \nunanimity on the part of the States and the National Governors \nAssociation, who said we have to change this system. People ought to be \nbetter off when they go to work than when they are on welfare.\n  When we created the block grant approach, Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families, we said States have some flexibility in using that \nmoney that is allocated to them. They can use it for cash assistance, \nthey can use it for childcare, they can use it for transportation \nassistance, they can use it for medical assistance, as well. \nInterestingly enough, as the welfare rolls\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\ndropped--and they are down by half--the amount of money spent out of \nthe Temporary Assistance for Needy Family fund is now less than half of \nthat which is spent. We spend a lot more money collectively on \nchildcare, transportation assistance, and medical assistance. Not \neveryone who is off welfare is better off, but a whole lot of people \nare.\n  Fast forward today to 2004, 8 years after the adoption of the welfare \nreform. We heard Senator Dodd go through the numbers and explain why we \nneed to provide this additional money. Let me reiterate a couple of \npoints. Almost half the States have a waiting list today for families \nwho are eligible under the criteria of those States. They are eligible \nfor childcare assistance. But the States cannot provide it.\n\n  California has over a quarter of a million people on the waiting \nlist. In Virginia, there are 7,000. Again, they are eligible under the \nState's definition, the State's requirement for childcare, but the \nStates cannot make good on it.\n  Last year, the States had a collective shortfall in their budgets of \nabout $80 billion. It is not a whole lot better this year. It will not \nbe a whole lot better next year.\n  Along the way, the States have been changing their criteria for \neligibility. A couple of examples include Ohio, Nebraska, and Kentucky. \nNow if you make more than $23,000 and you have a family of three \npeople, you are not eligible for childcare anymore. If you make more \nthan $19,100 in Indiana, you are not eligible for childcare assistance \nif you have a family of three. In Nebraska, if you make more than \n$18,800 and you are a family of three, you are no longer eligible for \nchildcare.\n  From my own experience as Governor of my State, there are four things \nneeded in order to help people move off of welfare, and to stay off of \nwelfare. One is a job. Second is a way to get to the job. Third is help \nwith health care, children's care and their own. Last is help with \nchildcare. If you do not have those four things--a job, a way to get to \nthe job, help with health care, and childcare--people will not make a \ntransition to work and remain working.\n  My friends, there are still some provisions in this bill over which \nwe will probably have differences. This is one over which there should \nbe no difference. This is a point on which Democrats and Republicans \nought to agree. I am encouraged. We have a great opportunity for \nconsensus on this bill. A big part of reaching a consensus enables us \nto pass this legislation, and to agree on this amendment. If we do, my \nhope is we can work out some of the more difficult amendments and get \nto a position where we can vote on final passage today.\n  Remember the old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. On welfare \nreform, a lot of skeptics in 1996 said this will not work; we will \nthrow people to the lions, and we will make things worse. For the most \npart, those fears have been unfounded. For the most part, people are \nbetter off. In million of homes today, someone is waking up and going \nto work. Their children have seen them go to work. If we provide good \nchildcare for their children, we reverse the likelihood their children \nwill end up in a welfare situation.\n  Chris Dodd knows this better than I do. For a child who has good \nreading skills, the parents have read to them. They had quality \nprekindergarten training. When they go into first grade they have a \n15,000-word surplus compared to those kids who have not had those \nthings. Those kids will walk into the first grade with a 15,000-word or \nmore word deficit.\n  We learn, as human beings, about half of what we will learn by the \ntime we are 6. To the extent that we have kids who are in the home of \nsomebody who is trying to hold things together, working minimum-wage \njobs, they are not getting the kind of nurturing, whether at home or \nthrough a quality pre-K program, we raise the likelihood they \nthemselves will end up entering school behind, falling further behind, \nand we raise the prospect, the likelihood they, too, will end up in a \nlife of dependency.\n\n  It does not have to happen. I am very much encouraged if we pass this \nlegislation today a lot of childcare providers will have the money they \nneed to provide quality care. A lot of families ending up on the \nwaiting lists will find the waiting lists reduced, and a lot of \nchildren who do not have a successful time of it when they get to \nkindergarten and first grade will have a better time of it.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my Senator for his statement in support. As a \nformer Governor, of course, he understands these issues from a State \nperspective, as well as cutbacks.\n  I am particularly grateful for the mention of the gap that exists \nbetween the poorest children in this country and those who come from \nthe more affluent families. The slight correction I make--even his \nnumber is startling--but the average middle class child is exposed to \nabout 500,000 words by kindergarten; an economically disadvantaged \nchild is exposed to half as many, at best.\n  To put it in perspective. In a childcare setting where children, in \nthe absence of parents who are working, can actually be in a place \nwhere they can learn, you may not close that gap entirely, but the gap \nof more than 100,000 words between those two children ought to startle \nevery single American.\n  I thank my colleague for raising that issue.\n  Mr. CARPER. Whether the deficit is 100,000 or 15,000 words, it is too \nmuch.\n  The good news is this: We can do something about it. We can do \nsomething about it today. We can do something about it in 25 minutes \nwhen we vote on the Snowe-Dodd amendment. That is what we need to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Alabama wishes to \nproceed, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That will be fine. The Senator from Wisconsin was here \nbefore I was.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by \nSenators Snowe and Dodd to provide an additional $6 billion in \nchildcare funding. The amendment is essential to guaranteeing the \nsafety and health of the children of working families, and if it fails \nI cannot support the underlying bill.\n  I say that as a strong supporter of positive welfare reform. \nWisconsin led the Nation in developing programs to move families off \nwelfare and into employment long before Congress enacted the 1996 \nwelfare reform bill, for which I voted. But the great success Wisconsin \nhas seen would not have been possible without the vital work supports \noffered to welfare families--families that could not have become self-\nsufficient without help with childcare, health care, and food stamps.\n  Across our country, wherever you find stable and safe childcare \navailable and affordable, you see parents moving off the welfare rolls \nand into jobs. Unfortunately, quality childcare is out of reach for too \nmany working families today.\n  According to recent data, the average fee in Wisconsin for full-time \ncare can surpass $7,000 a year--a small fortune to a single parent \nworking at or near minimum wage. The Snowe-Dodd amendment, combined \nwith the funding in the underlying bill, would send an additional $124 \nmillion in childcare funding to Wisconsin to help those working parents \nafford the care their children deserve. That translates into thousands \nmore parents able to work, and thousands more children able to spend \ntheir days in a healthy, safe environment. The story is the same in all \n50 States.\n  With the addition of the Snowe-Dodd amendment, the Senate can be \nproud of a welfare bill that lives up to its name--a bill that truly \nworks for the welfare of struggling parents and, more importantly, \ntheir children. The Snowe-Dodd amendment builds on the childcare \nfunding already in the bill as well as other important provisions to \nmake sure working families receive the support they need and deserve.\n  One such provision, sponsored by Senator Snowe and myself, would free \nchild support payments from State and Federal red tape and send it \nstraight to\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nthe children for whom it is intended. Under current law, Federal and \nState governments can hold onto childcare payments in order to offset \nwelfare expenses. Our provision gives State options and incentives to \ndeliver child support directly to families. Wisconsin has been doing \nthis since 1997, with great results. Fathers are more apt to pay--and \npay more--when they know their children are on the receiving end \ninstead of the Government. And there are no added costs to States, as \nfamilies that receive child support have more of their own income and \nare less likely to need other public assistance.\n  Childcare funding and child support are two simple steps towards \nensuring families a smoother path towards self-sufficiency--and that is \nwhat a reformed, a compassionate, and an effective welfare system is \nsupposed to be about. With the addition of the Snowe-Dodd amendment, \nthe Senate's welfare bill will go a long way toward creating such a \nsystem.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the House welfare bill. The \ndraconian penalties it includes would do little to help families move \noff of welfare and into employment. In addition, the House bill does \naway with protections for mothers with children under 6--a disturbing \npolicy decision with long-run implications for the future of the \ninfants and toddlers it targets.\n  I urge my colleagues who take this bill to conference to reject the \napproach taken by the House. Families struggling to make a decent \nliving for their children need a hand up--not a slap down. There is no \nsense in punishing parents and children for being poor. I also urge the \nSenate to overwhelmingly accept the Snowe-Dodd amendment today--and say \nyes to a healthy future for our Nation's most unfortunate children.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Baucus and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am inclined to want to say: Here we go \nagain. We have a good bill, founded on, and built upon, a welfare \nreform bill that passed a number of years ago that has had \nextraordinary success. We now have about half as many people in America \non welfare as there were before.\n  I guess the average American would think we have saved money, but, of \ncourse, that is not so. The way we give money to the States, \nfundamentally, is they get the same amount of money, no matter how many \npeople are on the rolls, and they get to focus that money more on the \npeople who are on welfare. And we have not saved money.\n  In addition, we have come up with a new welfare reform bill that I \nbelieve does a lot of good things. It will encourage work. It will \nencourage family formation. It will encourage stable family units and \nbe positive in a number of different ways. So I think it is a good \nbill.\n  But even though the number of people on welfare is down, even though \nthat number has continued to drop during the times of economic activity \nthat we have seen in the recent past, we are not saving any money.\n  The bill itself, the fundamental bill, has a $1 billion increase in \nfunding. And now, on top of that, we have a $6 billion childcare \nprogram added on top.\n  Now, having served on the Budget Committee, as I know the Presiding \nOfficer has, we wrestled hard with these numbers. We wrestled hard with \nthese numbers, and we criticized ourselves, and we told ourselves--over \nand over again--we have to start restraining what we do in terms of \nspending.\n  We have had people on the other side complain mightily about budget \ndeficits over and over again. Oh, they are concerned about our budget \ndeficits. But when we have a bill to add a huge new spending program to \na welfare bill that, truthfully, ought to come in flat, at least, if \nnot reducing the amount of welfare--since we have half as many people \non welfare as we used to have--we now tack on to that $1 billion \nfundamental welfare reform a $6 billion childcare reform.\n  To my knowledge--I am on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee--we have not discussed childcare in our committee. I do not \nbelieve there has been any formal or thorough hearings in the Finance \nCommittee. Just boom, right on top of this bill, $6 billion. Sock it to \nthe taxpayer.\n  Oh, they say it is going to be paid for by Customs user fees. Every \nbill that comes through here that is unfunded they say it is going to \nbe paid for by Customs user fees. Surely, we will have some revenue \ncome out of Customs user fees, but it is just revenue, just money that \nis coming into our Government when we are in a time of substantial \ndeficit.\n  So we are going to spend that, not to fund programs we have out there \nnow that need it, but we are going to spend that new money, they tell \nus, in this bill on an entirely new childcare program.\n  Let me show this chart. This chart gives an indication that this \nCongress has not been insensitive to childcare in America. And let me \nsay this, something we do not think about: We have fought in this \nCongress, and we need to reauthorize this year, the child tax credit, \nwhich provides $1,000 per year for every child in America so families \ncan use that money for childcare or anything else they need--$1,000 per \nchild. For a three-child family, $3,000. They have that money they can \nutilize as they choose.\n\n  Not only that, we are reducing the marriage penalty. When people get \nmarried, they pay more taxes. Not only that, we have reduced the 15-\npercent bracket, or expanded the 10-percent bracket, so that more \npeople will be paying income tax rates at 10 percent rather than 15 \npercent. It is a substantial reduction for them, a one-third reduction \nin the amount of income tax lower income working Americans will be \npaying.\n  Those are good things we have done without any bureaucracy or \nanything of that nature.\n  Look at this chart. This shows the various childcare programs we have \nin America. Total childcare spending, Federal and State--about $6 \nbillion of it is State--$23 billion per year. Now, I am telling you, \nthat is a major commitment by this Congress and the American people to \ndeal with childcare.\n  But there is a limit to what we do here. We have reduced people on \nwelfare by 50 percent. Are we saving any money for the taxpayers? No. \nWe are adding a $1 billion increase in this bill to help that remaining \n50 percent to be positive contributors, to have education and training \nand jobs and other assets and childcare.\n  As a matter of fact, this welfare reform bill will unlock $2 billion \nthat is sitting out there right now. This $2 billion, because of the \nregulations, is not being able to be utilized. That $2 billion, when it \nis unlocked, will be available for childcare or whatever the State \nmanagers of these programs deem to use it for.\n  I wish we had the money to fund everybody who wanted to have \nchildcare, to just let them have it. I wish we had the money. I wish we \nhad the money to do a lot of things around here, but we are in a period \nof deficit. We need to maintain integrity in spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  Clearly, to make welfare work, there has to be adequate childcare \nsupport. It is a no-brainer. I appreciate Senator Grassley's efforts to \nhelp improve this bill. I appreciate, therefore, even more the \namendment offered by the Senators from Connecticut and Maine to provide \nfor adequate childcare funding. I further appreciate the support of \nthis amendment by the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley. It \nis another example of his doing what is right. There are a lot of \npolitics around here. Clearly, what is right is to make sure our kids \nget enough childcare support.\n  There are 2 million children today who currently benefit from Federal \nchildcare. Maintaining that current level will take $4.5 billion over \nthe next 5 years. We also need another $1.5 billion just to cover the \ncost of the new work requirements in the Senate bill. In total, we need \n$5 billion more than this bill requires. Therefore, the\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\namendment pending is one that must be passed.\n  In Montana, more than 10,000 children receive childcare assistance, \nbut that is only one-tenth of the number of children who are eligible \nfor childcare assistance. I believe with passage of this amendment, we \nwill be able to raise that one-tenth to a much higher level.\n  I remember when I walked across the State of Montana, I met a lady \nwho must have been 19, 20 years old, near Bozeman. She told me she was \ntrying her level best, emphatically, to stay off welfare. She was a \nsingle mom. She had one child. She had a very low-paying job. She was a \nvery adroit woman. She looked like she had a lot on the ball. But she \nwas determined to stay off welfare. She slept on her parents' sofa so \nshe didn't have to pay for a room, and someone else took care of her \nchild during part of the day. But then she figured out that her \nchildcare cost her 30 to 40 percent of her total wages. She couldn't do \nit. She was so upset that she had to go back on welfare. Why? Because \nthe wages she was receiving were not enough and her childcare was \ncosting way too much.\n  Based upon that one example alone, I personally know how valuable \nthis is. Childcare is critical to help keep people off of welfare, to \nhelp keep people working. It is an investment in our future. Who knows, \nsome of these children might be future Nobel Prize winners, future \ninventors or poets or authors. These are our kids. It is a no-brainer \nfor passage of the amendment. I urge a very large vote.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me the \ntime.\n  I strongly support this amendment and believe it is an essential part \nof any TANF reauthorization. If we were to defeat this amendment, we \nwould probably have to conclude that we are better off under current \nlaw than under the bill that has been reported out of the Finance \nCommittee. Many of my colleagues believe we should have done more for \nchildcare in the legislation we were considering in the Finance \nCommittee, but it was determined at that time that our best opportunity \nto get the support we needed was to follow the lead of the two sponsors \nof this amendment, Senator Snowe, in particular, in the committee and \nSenator Dodd here on the floor, to be sure that this legislation got \nenacted.\n  The truth is, the underlying bill imposes greater work requirements \non low-income mothers and puts them in an impossible situation if we \ndon't continue to provide the childcare assistance they need. It is \nalso clear that if we take the level of funding of childcare that is \nprovided for in the bill without this amendment, we will see childcare \nassistance denied to hundreds of thousands of working poor families.\n  This is essential legislation. I strongly support it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. With this amendment, we can move \nahead with consideration of other amendments and hopefully wind up with \nreauthorized TANF legislation that we can all support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time and ask \nunanimous consent to add the following Senators as cosponsors of the \namendment: Senators Dayton, DeWine, Corzine, and Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments regarding \nthis amendment before the final vote.\n  First, I thank Chairman Grassley for his extraordinary leadership and \nhis commitment to ensuring that this legislation gets completed this \nyear, as should be done given all the temporary extensions, but also \nfor his support of the pending amendment to increase childcare support \nby more than $6 billion.\n  I also thank Senator Dodd, who has provided exemplary advocacy and \nleadership on behalf of families and children. I appreciate his \nreaching across the political aisle to forge and craft this bipartisan \namendment, along with Senator Carper, who approached me some time ago \nas well, because of his leadership previously as Governor and now in \nthe Senate on the importance and value of providing the necessary child \nsupport in order to make sure we improve the well-being and quality of \nlife for families and children as we transition off this entire welfare \nsystem. And I thank other cosponsors such as Senator Bingaman and all \nof the Senators who have chosen to cosponsor this amendment across the \npolitical aisle. I truly appreciate it. It will give breadth and depth \nto the reauthorization of this welfare reauthorization.\n  This amendment is a recognition of reality. If we want the nearly 5 \nmillion people who currently are on the caseload to transition and \nremain off welfare, we clearly have to provide them affordable, quality \nchildcare assistance. In fact, one of the major pillars in the 1996 \nlandmark legislation was to ensure that we create the necessary support \nsystems so that full-time employment would become accessible.\n  We created the childcare development block grant for families who are \non welfare, those transitioning off welfare, low-income families who \nare not on welfare for whom this assistance could make all the \ndifference. Yet today only one in seven children--only 15 percent--in \nAmerica who are eligible for Federal support are actually receiving it.\n  More significantly, in 2003, every State in America has reduced their \nchildcare support because of the tremendous financial constraints they \nare confronting. Not only that, there are 16 States that are reducing \nthe eligibility levels. Therefore, fewer children will be eligible for \nchildcare assistance.\n  There can be no question about the impact of the value of childcare \nin America. According to a 2002 study, 82 percent of former welfare \nrecipients who receive childcare assistance are more likely than those \nwho do not to have employment for 2 years after being off welfare. That \nis critically important because it underscores the value of providing \nthis type of support.\n  Currently there are 2 million children receiving a childcare subsidy, \nwhich is only a fraction of those children who are eligible. CBO \nestimates that it will require $4.5 billion to ensure all 2 million \nchildren receive the current level of support over the next 5 years. \nYet the underlying bill only includes $1 billion that will cover \napproximately the increased cost to childcare as a result of the \nexpanded work requirements. So if we do nothing more than the \nunderlying bill, there is the potential of 400,000 children who will \nlose childcare support if we do not pass this amendment today.\n  Now, some people say, you know, we are doing enough. Well, you ask \nthe 605,000 children in America who are on waiting lists. There are not \nwaiting lists in every State. Some States don't keep waiting lists, and \nthe reason is because they know they cannot fulfill the burgeoning \ndemand for childcare and will create expectations they cannot fulfill.\n  This amendment becomes critically important to the well-being of \nfamilies and children. It is a recognition of reality. The reality is, \nif we want families to leave welfare, stay off welfare, then let's give \nthem the support they need by passing this amendment. The reality is \nthat children need the quality daycare while their parents are working \nto improve themselves and their families. We don't want to create \nuntenable situations that require families to make untenable choices.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very quickly, I thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee for their leadership on this \nissue. Once again, I am deeply pleased to be joining Senator Snowe. She \nhas worked tirelessly on behalf of children and the issue of childcare \nduring our joint service in the Senate. I also thank Senator Hatch and \nothers. I go back a long way with Senator Hatch. It was almost 15 years \nago, in 1990, when we passed the first Childcare and Development Block \nGrant, CCDBG.\n  In 1996, we consolidated 4 separate childcare programs and included \nthem in the welfare reform package. I have a\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\ncouple of quick points to make. Federal funds presently have been \nfrozen for 3 years on childcare. The costs are obviously going up. \nSenator Snowe pointed out we have 400,000 to 450,000 children who will \nbe dropped from child care assistance if this amendment is not \nincluded. At least 600,000 children are on waiting lists in the 24 \nStates that keep them. For the remaining States, obviously, there are \nmany eligible children not receiving child care help.\n  The Governors want this. They have been asking for it. They are \ncutting back themselves. Every State has cut back in one way or another \non childcare assistance programs. Seven million children every day go \nhome from school to an empty house, with no kind of afterschool program \nand care. I don't think any of us want to see that perpetuated.\n  This amendment is paid for by extending Customs user fees which are \nscheduled to expire. We are not asking anyone to add to the deficit at \nall. This is an existing program. There is nothing new about it. It was \ncrafted 15 years ago and part of a consolidation of child care programs \nin 1996, so it is not a new program. The amendment is paid for and it \nis absolutely critical.\n  The underlying bill says, let's get people off of welfare and to \nwork. We have expanded some of the work requirements here. You must \nhave additional childcare support, or working poor families will slip \nback into dependency. No Member wants to be part of a solution that \nwould require that to happen with too many families out there making a \ntremendous effort to stay employed and independent.\n  Senator Snowe and I graciously ask for your continuing support of \nthis very important program. We urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \nto increase the amount of mandatory childcare funding available to \nStates.\n  Many of us understand that child care is an essential part of \nencouraging people to work. I have long believed that parents who are \nconcerned about their children's well-being cannot be effective, \ndependable employees. Unfortunately, the data are clear; the need for \naffordable child care in this country is rapidly increasing and the \nFederal funds available to help poor families have deteriorated \nsignificantly due to flat funding and inflation. Without dramatic \nfunding increases, over 600,000 poor parents will face tough decisions \nabout what to do with their children while they are working to keep the \nfamily out of poverty. I am concerned about this statistic.\n  I sincerely believe it is the right thing to do to require families \nreceiving Federal assistance to work more hours to ensure they can \nbecome self-sufficient. That is one of the many reasons I am supportive \nof this bill, H.R. 4. However, requiring more hours of work from poor \nparents inevitably leads to an even greater demand in childcare funding \nbecause parents must be out of the home for longer periods of time. In \nmany respects this is a healthy development for the family. But the $1 \nbillion increase in childcare funding provided by this bill is simply \nnot adequate to meet this increased work requirement; therefore, I \nthink we need to go a step further. That is why I support this \nimportant amendment to increase child care funding by $6 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  I would like to make it clear that I certainly understand the budget \nshortfalls this country is facing. While I believe much good can be \ndone by increasing child care funding, I would not be supportive of \nthis amendment if it were not 100 percent deficit neutral. I am pleased \nto see this amendment is offset by increases in customs user fees and \ndoes not add to the budget shortfalls we are currently experiencing. \nHigh deficits and the mountain of Federal debt represent real \nobligations that hurt our economic security, both now and in the \nfuture. Therefore, as long as we have a viable offset for childcare \nfunding increases, I am supportive.\n  With that understanding, I encourage my Senate colleagues to support \nthis amendment and provide these necessary childcare funds to families.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I add my strong support for the Snowe/Dodd \namendment to add $6 billion in childcare funding in the TANF bill. This \nwill allow for urgently needed improvements to access and the quality \nof childcare.\n  Back in 1996, Congress passed a tough welfare reform bill that \ndemanded personal responsibility. I supported that bill. It said that \nif you are on welfare and you can work, you must work. Our reform has \nhad some substantial successes, but now is not the time for a victory \nlap. I am particularly concerned that this bill does not provide \nadequate funding to address what we all know is one of the major \nbarriers to employment--childcare.\n  If we are going to demand personal responsibility from every \nAmerican, I believe the Government has a responsibility to every \nAmerican.\n  If we are going to help struggling low-income families and those \ntrying to leave welfare over the long term, we have a responsibility to \nprovide those families with access to affordable, high quality \nchildcare. Nationwide only one in eight kids eligible for childcare \nassistance actually receives it. In Iowa the story is worse, only 1 out \nof 12 actually receives assistance. Parents cannot work if they cannot \nafford decent childcare. But the sad reality is that many are forced, \ntoo often, to leave their kids in substandard care--or no care at all.\n  In Iowa nearly two-thirds of mothers with kids under age six are in \nthe workforce. That is the second highest in the Nation. This means \nthat children in Iowa spend a large percentage of their formative years \nin childcare. Unfortunately the availability of quality daycare has not \nkept pace with the demand of daycare. I have heard countless stories of \nfamilies who tell me they had to leave their kids in substandard care \nbecause they could not find quality care or because they could not \nafford better care. One woman told me that she knew her kids were in \nfront of the TV most of the day, but that was the only option she had. \nShe had to go to work. These stories are just devastating.\n  Even when a family can find childcare, it is often too expensive. \nLow-income working families often spend almost 50 percent of their \npaychecks on childcare. Meanwhile, higher income families spent only 6 \npercent.\n  In my State of Iowa, the average cost of childcare in rural areas is \nalmost $6,000 a year. And that is just for one child. The average wage \nof someone on TANF is only $7.28. So if we do the math, someone making \nslightly more than minimum wage working 40 hours a week is spending \nalmost half of their earnings on childcare. One single mom struggling \nto get off welfare in Iowa told me that she spends 45 percent of her \nincome to meet the childcare costs for her two children--and she has to \nwork a second job at night so they can survive. Her total yearly \nchildcare for two kids is $12,000.\n\n  And regardless of income, parents worry about the quality of \nchildcare. In Iowa the majority of growth has been in nonregistered, \nunregulated care as opposed to registered and accredited centers. \nNationwide there is also a major shortage of quality childcare for \nchildren in rural areas, for children with special needs, and for \ninfants and toddlers. In fact, in a recent Midwest study, Iowa ranked \nthe lowest in providing quality care for infants and toddlers. This is \nalarming, because the years through age three are a critical time for \nbrain development and emotional development. This is when a child lays \nthe foundation--or fails to lay the foundation--for later success in \nschool and life.\n  Data from the National Academy of Sciences shows that the first 3 \nyears of a child's life are the most important--80 percent of brain \ndevelopment occurs before the child's third birthday. Children who do \nnot have rich, enjoyable, emotionally, and intellectually stimulating \nlearning experiences during these important years can be stunted for \nlife.\n  In fact, more than a dozen years ago, in 1991, the Committee for \nEconomic Development, made up of business leaders, found that investing \nin quality childcare and other early interventions was critical to \nsecuring this Nation's economic future. CED urged Federal policy makers \nto view education as a process that begins at birth.\n  We also know that good childcare prevents later crime and violence. I \nrequest unanimous consent that this op-ed, written by the Des Moines \nchief of police, be included in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\n  Chief McCarthy says that ``my law enforcement experience has taught \nme that by giving children the right start in life through programs \nsuch as pre-K and childcare, we can dramatically reduce the chances of \nyou or someone you love becoming the victim of violence.''\n  Yet despite all that we know about how important good quality \nchildcare is, we fail to support our highly skilled childcare \nproviders. In fact, we are paying them less than bus drivers, barbers \nand janitors. I think it is time that changed. The average childcare \nworker's salary in Iowa is $14,100, well below the national average. \nThere is also a 50 percent turnover rate for childcare providers. This \nis particularly harmful as stable, consistent relationships are \nessential to healthy development.\n  Recognizing the inadequacy in quality as chairman of Labor, Health \nand Human Services Subcommittee of Appropriations, I began funding an \nadditional $200 million in CCDBG to improve quality, with targeted \nfunding directed to infant and toddler needs.\n  The Dodd/Snow amendment will bring us a step closer to the day when \nall young children have the opportunities and supports they need to \nembark on a lifetime of learning.\n  We talk a lot in this country about budget deficits, economic \nprosperity and how as a nation we have to prioritize. One of our \npriorities surely must be to strengthen families, encourage work, and \nprovide decent childcare. I understand that many of my colleagues have \nconcerns with the cost of this amendment. Well if we can find trillions \nof dollars for tax cuts, hundreds of billion of dollars for a \nprescription drug give-away to big pharmaceutical companies and HMOs, \nand tens of billions of dollars for a trip to Mars, then surely we can \nmake key investments in programs like CCDBG. I urge my colleagues to \nstrongly support the Snowe/Dodd amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Snowe-Dodd \namendment to increase funding for child care by $6 billion. We know \nthat high-quality child care makes a real difference for children and \ntheir families. It allows parents to work, and at the same time it \ngives children a safe and productive place to learn.\n  Today the need for child care is growing, but government support is \nnot. In fact, because of the slow economy and State budget problems, \nmany States are cutting back on their support of child care. This is \nhaving an especially painful impact on low-income families--the very \nfamilies that are helped the most by child care. These are also the \nsame families that will need more help because of the work requirements \nin the underlying bill. That is why we need to pass this amendment.\n  The Snowe-Dodd amendment will increase funding for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant by $6 billion. Without this amendment, about \n430,000 children will lose their child care assistance over the next 3 \nyears. This amendment will make a real difference for families in every \nstate. In my own home state of Washington, this amendment will mean \nnearly $140 million in increased child care funding for Washington \nfamilies.\n  Over the years, I have fought on this floor to increase child care \nfunding, so I don't need to spend a lot of time reviewing what the \nresearch shows us. We know that safe, quality child care helps children \nstart school ready to learn and keeps children safe while their parents \nwork. Studies show that quality makes a real difference. Children in \npoor-quality child care have been found to lag behind in language and \nreading skills and to display more aggression. On the other hand, \nchildren in high-quality child care have greater math, thinking and \nattention skills. They also have fewer behavior problems than children \nin lower-quality care.\n  The benefits of high quality child care are not in question; the only \nquestion is how many families can afford it? Full-day child care easily \ncosts from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. That is at least as much as \ncollege tuition at a public university, and it's more than many \nfamilies can afford. For example, if both parents work full-time for \nminimum wage, they only make $21,400 a year. Child care would be one-\nquarter to one-half of their income. Clearly, they need help.\n  Today, nearly 16 million children under age 13--who are living in \nlow-income families--are likely to need child care. But out of those 16 \nmillion, only one in seven low-income children receive the federal \nchild care assistance for which they are eligible.\n  Even worse, the need for child care is increasing because of our high \nunemployment rate and because of the increased work requirements in the \nunderlying bill. Many out-of-work parents are looking for jobs, and \nthey need child care to be able to look for a job. If this amendment \nfails and the underlying bill passes, about 430,000 children will lose \ntheir child care assistance by fiscal year 2008. Without this \namendment, fewer and fewer children will get the child care they need. \nBecause of inflation alone, States will need $5 billion over the next 5 \nyears just to keep serving the same number of children. And that \nassumes that TANF funds will be available and that State budgets won't \nbe cut.\n  We already know that States are cutting back on child care funding \nbecause of their budget shortfalls. In 2000, States spent $3.8 billion \nin TANF funds for child care programs. By 2002, State spending had \ndropped to $3.5 billion. Many States have growing numbers of low-income \nfamilies on waiting lists. Some States are turning low-income families \naway unless those families receive TANF, are moving out of TANF, or \nhave other special circumstances. Other States have altered eligibility \nrequirements so that only the very poor receive assistance. And some \nStates have raised copayments. According to the General Accounting \nOffice, 23 States have changed their child care policies since 2001 in \nways that limit access for families, shutting the door on opportunities \nfor parents to work.\n  My own State of Washington has lowered the eligibility standard for \nchild care subsidies from 225 percent to 200 percent of poverty. \nWashington State also increased monthly co-payments for families. In \n2000, 54,000 children in Washington received subsidized child care. By \n2001, the number had dropped to 51,200. As I mentioned earlier, this \namendment will mean nearly $140 million in increased child care funding \nfor Washington families. That help is desperately needed.\n  Today we are considering a welfare reauthorization bill that is \nsupposed to help struggling families become self-sufficient. I do not \nbelieve we can have a meaningful conversation about getting parents \ninto jobs unless families have access to safe, quality child care. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Snowe-Dodd amendment to increase \nchild care funding by $6 billion.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan childcare amendment being offered today. This amendment \nwould provide reasonable and necessary increases in funding to the \nChild Care Development Block Grant.\n  The underlying bill only provides increases of $200 million per year \nfor 5 years for childcare. Unfortunately, this level of funding fails \nto support low-income families who are trying to become independent and \nself-sufficient. First, the underlying bill imposes more rigorous work \nrequirements on TANF mothers without providing enough resources for \nessential childcare support. In addition, the level of funding in the \nunderlying bill is so inadequate that it will result in the loss of \nchildcare funding for hundreds of thousands of working poor families. \nThe cost of quality childcare in this country can exceed $10,000 per \nyear, thus rendering quality childcare out of reach for too many low-\nincome working families.\n  I strongly support this amendment. This amendment would provide the \nnecessary funds to support the work requirements of TANF recipients as \nwell as the efforts of low-income working families--parents trying to \nstay off welfare. It would provide sufficient resources to, at the very \nleast, maintain the number of childcare slots available to working \nfamilies. And, it would provide families with opportunities for quality \nchildcare.\n  The availability of childcare assistance through the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant, CCDBG, played an essential role in the decline \nof welfare caseloads around the country throughout the 1990s. Both the \nFederal Government and the States dramatically increased spending for \nchild care after passage of welfare reform in 1996. The\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nbulk of the increases, however, came from the Federal Government. By \n2002, the Federal Government appropriated approximately $4.8 billion \nfor childcare in both discretionary and mandatory spending. States also \nsaw record declines in TANF caseloads, and thus were able to use the \nflexible TANF dollars for childcare assistance.\n  The number of employed single mothers dramatically increased from 6.4 \nmillion in 1996 to 7.3 million in 2001. And, employment rates among \nlow-income mothers with young children increased from 44 percent in \n1996 to 59 percent in 2000. The number of children receiving childcare \nservices through CCDBG doubled during this period from 1 million to \napproximately 2 million children.\n  Further, research shows that the availability of childcare subsidies \nleads to more work, higher earnings, and a greater likelihood of \nremaining off welfare. A recent study found that single mothers with \nyoung children who receive childcare assistance are 40 percent more \nlikely to still be employed after 2 years than mothers who do not \nreceive such assistance. And, the numbers only increase for mothers who \nwere former welfare recipients. According to the data, former welfare \nrecipients with young children who receive childcare assistance are 82 \npercent more likely to remain employed after 2 years. The evidence \nshows that our childcare policies work; childcare assistance helps low-\nincome working mothers move from welfare to work.\n  Our commitment to childcare, however, has waned. The Federal \ncontribution to childcare has remained frozen since 2002. And as a \nresult of severe budget crises facing our States, the state \ncontribution to childcare has significantly diminished. The use of TANF \ndollars for childcare has declined since 2001. Moreover, states have \nhad to close budget gaps cumulatively totaling $200 billion since FY \n2001, and many States have cut assistance to childcare to close the \nbudget gaps. According to the General Accounting Office, nearly one \nhalf of all States have made policy changes that reduce the \navailability of childcare subsidies, and 11 other States are proposing \nchanges that will reduce current levels of spending on childcare.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will cost \napproximately $4.5 billion in Federal funding just to maintain the \ncurrent number of childcare slots for the next 5 years. If this \namendment fails, it is estimated that more than 400,000 children would \nlose their childcare assistance.\n  Although CCDBG serves approximately 2 million children nationwide, we \nare only providing childcare to 12 percent of the eligible population. \nFurther, due to State cuts, we are already seeing States reducing \neligibility, lowering income limits, increasing waiting lists, lowering \nprovider reimbursement rates, and increasing parent copayments.\n  For example, 15 States and the District of Columbia have reduced \ntheir eligibility limits, either lowering the eligibility cutoff based \non poverty or restricting eligibility to TANF-only families. New Mexico \nhas lowered eligibility for childcare, making the income cutoff lower \nthan it was in 2000. These policy changes, of course, do not mean that \nlow-income families are any less in need of childcare. It just means \nthat without the childcare subsidy, it will be that much harder to \nafford quality childcare.\n  In New Mexico, there are almost 100,000 children in low-income \nfamilies with all parents in the workforce. A family of three earning \nmore than $22,890 a year cannot qualify for childcare assistance in New \nMexico, but at this income level they would be struggling just to cover \ntheir basic expenses. In Albuquerque, for example, annual costs for \ndecent housing, $7,008; food, $4,212; transportation, $1,932; health \ncare, $3,060; and other necessities such as telephone service, \nclothing, and household items, $3,480 alone would total $19,692, \naccording to a study of basic family budgets. Paying for average-priced \ncenter care for an infant and a preschooler, $10,408, would put this \nfamily $7,210 over budget.\n  The cost of quality childcare is simply out of reach for too many \nworking families. The quality of childcare has a significant effect on \nchildren's health and development and their readiness for school. \nStudies show that children who have traditionally been at risk of not \ndoing well in school are affected more by the quality of care than \nother children. These children are more sensitive to the negative \neffects of poor childcare and receive greater benefits from higher \nquality care. Evidence demonstrates that children who attend higher \nquality childcare perform better on measures of cognitive development, \nsuch as math and language skills, as well as on behavioral development, \nsuch as thinking and attention, interactions with peers, and behavior \nskills. Yet, while low-income children are at greater risk, they are \nless likely to be able to access high-quality childcare.\n  Without adequate increases in funding for childcare, we are forcing \nour low-income mothers into impossible situations. This bill requires \nTANF recipients to work, yet fails to provide adequate childcare to \nsupport their efforts. The bill also fails to provide sufficient \nchildcare funding to maintain childcare assistance for hundreds of \nthousands of working poor families. How can we expect low-income \nfamilies to maintain independence and self-sufficiency, if we fail to \nprovide them with the necessary supports--or worse, we take them away. \nFor nearly 30 years, the evidence has been telling us that quality \nearly care and education makes all the difference in the world in a \nchild's readiness for school. Yet by failing to make quality childcare \naccessible to low-income families, we continue to wonder why all of our \nchildren are not academically successful. Without adequate funding for \nchildcare, we continue to leave hundreds of thousands of children \nbehind.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine has the last minute and a half.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank, again, Senator Dodd for his being \na champion over the years on behalf of children and families, and for \nmaking it possible that we are in the position of offering this \namendment. I also thank the cosponsors and Chairman Grassley for \nhonoring his promise that we have a priority position in offering this \namendment.\n  Ultimately, this amendment will determine whether families on welfare \nand their children will be able to achieve self-sufficiency, which was \nthe goal of the Welfare Reform Act in 1996. That was an unprecedented \nsuccess. This amendment will help build upon that success and help \nfamilies to achieve the economic independence they and their families \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment and I yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, we are debating welfare reform. It is \ncritical to our country that we do this and revitalize it. It is a \nmajor piece of legislation that has been very successful over the \nyears, getting people out of welfare into a productive job in our \neconomy.\n  I don't know who the historian was who once said it. He was an \neconomist and a historian. He said, The greatest form of welfare in the \nworld is a good job in the private sector--we know that to be a fact--a \ngood well-paying job.\n  When you cannot find that, welfare in our country is that safety net \nwe have designed and defined for those who truly need it, but \nrecognizing that it is not a place to stay; it is a place to catch you \nif you fall, to help you, and to provide for you and your family, but \nonly in the temporary form so we can get people off of welfare and back \nout into the private sector and into a job.\n  In a few moments, the Senator from Massachusetts is going to talk \nabout jobs and level of pay in those jobs. I thought for just a few \nmoments it would be appropriate as we talk about welfare and as we talk \nabout jobs and how much we pay for jobs as a minimum wage, that we \nought to talk about job creation in this country and how critically \nimportant it is.\n\n  Some have said our recovery out of this recession has been jobless. \nWell, that is not true. A lot of jobs are being created out there, and \na lot of people are now going back to work--not as rapidly as we had \nhoped they would, but certainly they are headed back to work.\n\n\n                         National Energy Policy\n\n  But there is a dark cloud over the horizon, and that dark cloud is \nthere today because the Congress of the United States, and the Senate \nin particular, a year ago denied this country a new national energy \npolicy and the ability to begin to produce energy, once again.\n  We are no longer energy independent. That one driving force we had in \nthe economic matrix that said we could produce something for less--\nbecause we had the great ingenuity of the American workforce and \nbecause the input of energy was less than anywhere else in the world, \nso we could produce it better and we could produce it for less cost--is \nno longer true today.\n  If you went out this morning to refuel your car before you headed to \nwork, you paid at an all-time high level of gas prices. Why? Because \nthe Senate of the United States denied this country a national energy \npolicy.\n  We know it is happening. We have seen it headed in that direction for \nover 7 years. Many of us have pled on this floor to develop that policy \nto get us back into production. But, no, we are not into production, we \nare not producing at a level we could be and we should be. We are not \ncreating all the kinds of alternative fuels we ought to be. Why? \nBecause we have not established a national energy policy in the last 8 \nyears.\n  The world has changed a great deal. We are now over half dependent on \nforeign sources of oil. Of course, there are many who will rush to the \nfloor and point a finger at OPEC or point a finger at the political \nturmoil in Venezuela and say: Well, that is their problem, and it is \ntheir fault we are paying higher energy prices. Or we will have that \nproverbial group that will run out and point their finger at big oil.\n  Why don't we point the finger at the Senate, for once, which has \ndenied this country a national energy policy? The Senator from New \nMexico was on the floor a few moments ago, Mr. Bingaman. He worked 2 \nyears ago to get one. I helped him, and we could not quite get there.\n  Then the other Senator from New Mexico did produce a policy, and we \npassed it in a bipartisan way. It went to the House, and we conferenced \nit, and the House passed the conference. It came back here. It fell \napart. It fell apart for one little reason or another, but the bottom \nline was the politics of it. The Senate of the United States has again \ndenied the consumer and the working man and woman the right to have an \nenergy source and a competitive energy price to go to work on, or to \nwork with when they get to work, or to have for recreation, or to have \nto heat their home, or to have to turn the lights on in their house, \nand to illuminate and energize the computer they use.\n  The driving force of the economy of this country is not the politics \non the street today; it is the politics of energy. It always has been. \nWhen we have competitive, moderate-to-low energy prices, the American \nworker can produce and compete with any workforce in the world. \nBut today we are slowly but surely denying them that.\n\n  Natural gas is at an all-time high. Gas at the pump is at an all-time \nhigh. Electricity prices in many areas around this country are at an \nall-time high. The great tragedy is, many of those prices are \nartificially inflated because of the politics of the issue, because \nthis Senate has denied the American worker and the American consumer a \nnational energy policy.\n  Now, some say, well, the wealthy are going to get wealthy off of \nthis. What about the poor? Has anybody ever calculated that high energy \nprices impact poor people more than any other segment in our society?\n  If you are a household with an average annual income of $50,000, you \nonly spend about 4 percent of your income on energy. But if you are a \nhousehold with an income between $10,000 and $24,000, you spend 13 \npercent; you spend a higher proportion of your total income on energy. \nIf you are a household of $10,000 or less, or at about 130-plus percent \nof poverty, you spend almost 30 percent of everything you make on \nenergy--whether it is the gas you put in your car, or the throwing of a \nswitch to illuminate the light bulb in your ceiling, or the heat for \nyour home.\n  High energy prices impact poor people more, and yet we will still \nhear these great allegations on the floor that somebody is going to get \nrich off of energy.\n  No. Poor people are going to get poorer with higher energy prices. \nThat is the impact and the reality of the problems we face.\n  The United States is making do now with a lot less energy on a per \ncapita basis. Some say: We can just conserve our way out of this \nsituation. We are doing a very good job in conservation today than we \ndid, let's say, 20 years ago.\n  Let me give you a figure or two. In the last three decades, the U.S. \neconomy has grown 126 percent, but energy use has grown only 30 \npercent. In other words, as our economy grows today, as a rate of a \nunit of production, we use less energy. Why? Efficiencies, new \ntechnologies. But as we grow, we are still going to need more energy. \nSo the old argument about conserving your way out--and, oh, my \ngoodness, if I have heard it once on the Senate floor in the last 6 \nyears, I have heard it 2 or 3 times, that automobile fuel consumption \nhas dropped 60 percent in that 20-year period. And we ought to be proud \nof that.\n  That is partly a work of the Senate, but that is also the new \ntechnologies and efficiencies. Per capita oil consumption is down 20 \npercent since 1978.\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nIndustrial energy use is down 20 percent since 1978. So the reality is, \nwe have done well.\n  But if you want to create 800,000 new jobs, then it is going to take \nenergy to produce them. Because it is energy that drives the great \neconomy of our country. And when it is high-priced energy, then the \njobs become high priced. When the jobs become high priced, then we \nworry about those jobs leaving the United States.\n  Why hasn't the Senate of the United States put this relatively simple \nformula together, that high-cost energy creates a less competitive \nenvironment in which we can produce. If we are going to talk welfare--\nand we are and we should; and we are going to reform it--and we are \ngoing to talk minimum wage, and there is no reason why we should not \ntalk minimum wage--then we have to talk about the economy of creating \njobs at the same time.\n\n  The production tax credit we are talking about for the energy field \nalone would create 150,000 new jobs. As I said, the bill we have in \nfront of us--that should pass unanimously in this Senate, but it cannot \nget there--will create literally between 670,000 and 800,000 new jobs \nduring the initial phases of the development of that kind of energy.\n  My message to the consumer today: If you do not like the price of \nyour energy bill this winter, if you do not like the price of gas at \nyour pump, if you are worried about your job because it may be going \noverseas, because your production is less competitive today, pick up \nthe phone and call your Senator. Ask him or her why--ask us why--we did \nnot pass a national energy bill. There is nothing wrong with doing \nthat. Because we should have done that. We should have started down \nthat road of getting ourselves back into the production. But, oh, no, \nwe are bound up in the politics of this business, and somehow we just \ncannot get there. And try as we have for the last 5 years, in a \nbipartisan way, we have worked to do so.\n  We have a bill before us now that ought to receive a nearly \nresounding unanimous vote, but it failed in the Senate. Our failure \nmeans the jobs of America's working men and women are at risk, the \nhousehold automobile is now much more expensive to operate, and you \nwill probably want to turn your thermostat down next winter if gas \nprices continue to go as high as they appear to be going.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2945\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Kennedy and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 2945.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide for \n                an increase in the Federal minimum wage)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FAIR MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Fair \n     Minimum Wage Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Increase in the Minimum Wage.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than--\n       ``(A) $5.85 an hour, beginning on the 60th day after the \n     date of enactment of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2004;\n       ``(B) $6.45 an hour, beginning 12 months after that 60th \n     day; and\n       ``(C) $7.00 an hour, beginning 24 months after that 60th \n     day;''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Applicability of Minimum Wage to the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) shall apply to the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.\n       (2) Transition.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the minimum \n     wage applicable to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be--\n       (A) $3.55 an hour, beginning on the 60th day after the date \n     of enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as \n     may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section \n     6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and every 6 months thereafter until the \n     minimum wage applicable to the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands under this subsection is equal to the minimum \n     wage set forth in such section.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment with \nmy colleague from Massachusetts who is the true leader on the issue of \ntrying to raise the minimum wage so that people who are trying to get \ninto the workforce, get off of welfare and subsidy, will be able to \nactually support their families so that we actually reward work, and it \nis going to make a huge difference.\n  Before I go into my remarks, I do want to, however, respond to my \nfriend who spoke about how important it is to call your Senators and \nask them to pass that Energy bill that we killed. I hope when you call \nus, you will tell us not to pass that one. That one was a travesty of \njustice for consumers. It was a terrible bill if you care about the \nenvironment. And it was a terrible bill if you believe that there is \nalready too much corporate welfare because there were huge subsidies to \nthe nuclear industry.\n  There were huge subsidies by way of giving a liability waiver to \nthose companies that made MTBE, which destroyed drinking water supplies \nall over the country. The Senate was sending this bill over to a \nconference committee, and it comes back with this liability waiver. It \nis a terrible bill.\n  Yes, there are places we could drill in this country, where the folks \nwant it there and the oil is there. Off the Gulf of Mexico, near \nLouisiana, certain places in Alaska, it makes sense. But it does not \nmake sense to pass an Energy bill that is back to the future because it \ndoesn't understand that times have changed and just a couple of extra \nmiles of fuel economy and fuel efficiency in our automobiles can mean \nthat we will have fields and fields of energy in the future.\n  The last point I want to make--and then I want to talk about this \namendment which is important to this bill--is that on April 25 or \nthereabouts, taxpayers are funding a court case where Dick Cheney, the \nVice President, is refusing to reveal who came into his office when he \nput together an energy report and worked on an Energy bill. It is \noutrageous that taxpayers have to go all the way to the Supreme Court, \nessentially, because they are paying for the defense of Dick Cheney, \nand he refuses to reveal who met with him about the Energy bill, what \nthey talked about, and what their interests were. We know Enron was in \nthat meeting. That much we know. But I don't know who else was there.\n  So I just wanted to answer the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig, \nbecause in my view, we did a great service to the people by not passing \nthat particular Energy bill. Let's pass an Energy bill that is a good \nEnergy bill.\n  Now, I want to get to the amendment I sent to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Kennedy and lay the groundwork for why it is so \nimportant to this welfare reform bill.\n  The last time the Federal minimum wage was raised it was $4.25 an \nhour. In 1996, it was raised to $5.15. It was over a 2-year period. So \nthat is 8 years ago; 8 years ago we raised the Federal minimum wage. \nThose people at the bottom of the economic ladder are living on $10,700 \na year.\n  I don't know if my colleagues are aware of what it costs to rent an \napartment, if you have a family, and you are trying to raise a family \non this amount of money. I guess you might be lucky, in my neck of the \nwoods, to try and get some sort of an apartment for $800 a month or \n$850, if you could even find one. You can't find it around here, a \ndecent size place. That would use up the entire salary of someone \nliving on the minimum wage.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, please support this. How can we expect people \nto live on this amount of money, to be able to afford rent, food, the \nminimum requirements for raising a family?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, that 60 percent of the people who \ndraw the minimum wage are women?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And for 40 percent of those women, that is the only money \nthey get for them and their families?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is accurate.\n  Mr. REID. So this is an issue that doesn't relate to kids at \nMcDonald's flipping hamburgers. It relates to people supporting their \nfamilies. I greatly admire the Senator for being the lead person on \nthis amendment dealing with the minimum wage that will affect families \nin Nevada and around the rest of the country. Is that not true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely true. In my State we have a minimum \nwage that is higher than the Federal minimum wage, but there is no \nquestion that the Federal minimum wage is a benchmark number.\n  A poverty rate for a family of three in our country today is $15,607. \nAnd for a family of four, it is $18,850. So, yes, if you are a single \nmom or a single dad and you are working at a minimum-wage job, you are \nmaking less than people who are considered to be in poverty. What a \ntravesty.\n  And even if you have two workers working at the minimum wage, you \nwould barely get out of the poverty range. So we are talking about a \nsevere deficiency in compassion. These days, we hear a lot about \ncompassionate conservatives. I have seen a conservative side. I want to \nsee the compassionate side on this particular vote.\n  How can anyone believe it is fair to keep the minimum wage where it \nhas been for 8 years? It is not fair.\n  We are talking about a bill that seeks to lift people out of the \ndarkest, deepest economic hole. We want to start them on their way to \nbeing able to take care of themselves and their families. You cannot \nlift yourself out of a deep economic hole on a minimum-wage job.\n  As my friend from Nevada points out, we used to think of the minimum \nwage--when I was a kid it was 50 cents an hour, and the kids took the \nminimum-wage jobs. What I used to work at when I was a kid was 50 cents \nan hour.\n  I am showing my age. Maybe I shouldn't do that. But we didn't look at \nfamilies who were surviving on that. Today we are looking at families \nwho are surviving on the minimum wage.\n  We can be sure of one thing: If we don't lift the minimum wage, \npeople may move off of welfare into the workforce, but they will not \nmove out of poverty.\n  Studies have shown that between half and three-quarters of those who \nare leaving welfare remain poor for up to 3 years. The courage that it \ntakes to train yourself for work, to get up every day and not even to \nbe able to afford to pay the rent--this isn't right.\n  Some may say: Senator, these minimum-wage jobs are just starter jobs. \nThey are just a few months.\n  Studies prove that you may be stuck in that job for 3 years, and that \nis just average. You may be stuck in that job for 6 years. With the \neconomic circumstances of the last 3 years, where we have seen a loss \nof 3 million private sector jobs, it isn't as if you have a tremendous \narray of jobs out there.\n  What will our amendment do? Our amendment will increase the Federal \nminimum wage to $7 an hour in three steps over 2 years and 2 months. It \nwould raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour today to $5.85 an hour \nin 2 months, after enactment of this act, then to $6.45 in another \nyear, and then to $7 a year after that. Even at that rate of $7, you \nare barely able to survive. But at least we are moving the minimum wage \ntoward a more livable wage.\n  Let me talk about California. My State stepped out and looked at the \nFederal minimum wage and said: This cannot be. This will not work in \nour State, where the rental costs are so high; where the food costs, \neven though we are the breadbasket of the world, are high; where the \ncost of transit is high. So in my State, the minimum wage today is \n$6.75.\n  The States cannot do it alone. The Federal Government has to set the \nstandard of compassion and fairness and make work an honorable \nendeavor.\n  The best social program is a job. I agree with that. I would much \nprefer that people work than not. But work has to be rewarded. You may \nask: Senator Boxer, why does this bill matter since your State has a \nhigher minimum wage of $6.75? It is very clear. The Federal Government \nsets the floor for workers everywhere, and it is a guide to all States, \nincluding my State. Even a small increase to $7 will help 393,000 \nworkers in California, if California keeps the minimum wage at $6.75.\n  Raising the minimum wage helps many more low-wage workers than just \nthose earning the minimum wage because it does set the standard. You \nhave heard that many cities and counties all over the country are \ncasting what they call ``livable wages,'' because they are looking at a \nminimum wage and realizing that it is really a sub-minimum wage; it \nisn't going to really work. Why not have a minimum wage that we can be \nproud of here? That is what Senator Kennedy and I are trying to do \ntoday.\n  Let's look at what has happened in the area of poverty in our \ncountry. The poverty rate rose to 12.1 percent in America in 2002, from \n11.7 percent in 2001. So this administration's economic policies, which \ncaused the loss of so many private sector jobs, has seen an increase in \npoverty. And 1.7 million people have been added to the ranks of the \npoor, including many women and many children. You can be a \ncompassionate conservative, a compassionate progressive, or a \ncompassionate liberal, or anything you want to call yourself. \nCompassion is the name of the game. It will help our country. I will \ntalk about that in a minute.\n  Let's look at what else has happened. First, you have 12.1 million \nchildren living in poverty today. In 2002, 34.6 million Americans were \nliving in poverty. Think about that. I have 35 million people in my \nState, and 34 million Americans were in poverty in 2002. The whole \nState of California equals the number of people who were in poverty. \nThat is an enormous number. My State, if it were a nation, would be the \nfifth largest in terms of its GDP. Imagine if every person in my State \nwere in poverty. That is what we have. So we have 12 million children \nin poverty.\n  Let's look at something else. For the first time in many years, \nworking Americans' wage growth is almost stagnant, while during the \nlast term of the Clinton administration those wages grew. So what am I \nsaying to you? We have seen an increase in poverty among women and \nchildren and families, we have seen an increase in the poverty rate, \nand we see wage growth that is almost stagnant.\n  From the end of 1996 to the end of 2000, full-time workers saw their \nusual weekly earnings grow faster than inflation, and those gains in \nreal wages were evident for both higher and lower wage workers. In \nfact, the lowest earning 10 percent of the workers saw their wages \nincrease 2 percent greater than inflation. So before the Bush \nadministration, we saw this wonderful real wage growth--wages that were \ngoing up faster than inflation. In contrast, from the end of 2000 until \nthe end of 2003, real weekly earnings for working-class Americans \nstagnated. The lowest 10 percent of American workers have seen their \nwages go up by 0.2 percent; whereas, before, they went up 2.1 percent. \nNow it is 0.2 percent. So people are working harder and they are just \nnot getting ahead at all.\n  Again, whether we call ourselves conservatives, moderates, or \nliberals, that doesn't matter to me. I just think the word \n``compassion'' comes into it. Also, a word that has to come into this--\nor two words--are ``smart policy.'' Why is it smart policy? I will get \ninto that.\n  One of the arguments you hear against raising the minimum wage--and \nyou hear it every time--is don't raise the minimum wage because it is \ngoing to hurt employers. We have heard that since the very first day I \nwas working in a minimum-wage job at 50 cents an hour. What if Congress \nin the past decided to just hold firm at 50 cents an hour? I am sure \nSenator Kennedy heard the same arguments all those years ago, when \npeople came to the floor and said 50 cents an hour is enough, and don't \nraise the minimum wage because it will be a burden to employers.\n  The truth is that we have seen in the history of the greatest country \nin the world, when you raise the minimum wage, everyone does better. \nWorkers perform better. They are more productive. Business does better. \nThey are more productive. Their profit margins go up. So let us not \nhear the same old,\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nsame old, same old words from the past that, oh, it is a burden on \neveryone. No, it has proven to be an economic stimulus.\n  There is another theory I would like to test with my colleagues who \nhave supported tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. If you are a \nmillionaire, you are going to get back $120,000 a year. Think about \nthat, folks. If you are a millionaire, under the Bush tax cut, you will \nget a cut in taxes of $120,000 a year. A minimum-wage earner today, \nworking full time, 8 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week, earns $10,800 a \nyear. So my calculation is that this year's tax cut for millionaires is \n11 times the yearly income of a full-time minimum-wage worker.\n  What are we doing? Why are we here? I admire the folks in the upper \nincome brackets, and I happen to know a lot of them in California. Do \nyou know what they say to me? They say: Senator, you make sure everyone \nis brought along. When everybody is brought along, we do better. First, \nwe feel better about ourselves and our country, but we do better. Why \ndo we do better? Because the people who will get this increase--the $7 \nan hour--are going to spend that money in the economy. It is a no-\nbrainer.\n  My colleagues can make every argument about how giving back $120,000 \na year to the wealthiest among us will stimulate the economy. They call \nit ``trickle down.'' They love trickle down when it applies to the \nwealthy. Oh, give it to the wealthy; they will go out and spend it. The \nfact is, the wealthiest people already have the refrigerator or two; \nthey already have the two homes or three; they already have the yachts. \nThey already have what they need. They are not going to go out and \nspend it. They probably will sock it away.\n  The bottom line is, when a worker gets another couple of bucks in his \npocket and has to support his or her family, they will go to the store \non the corner and spend the money, and it is going to give a boost to \nthis economy. So let us not say that trickle down only works when you \ngive to the rich. Let's also admit that the fact is, when you give to \nthe middle class--and that is what I support, middle-class tax cuts and \ntax cuts to the working poor--you are really going to drive consumer \nspending. We know that low-income workers and moderate-income workers \nput their earnings right back into this economy, and they don't even \nhave time to think about it because they have to buy clothes for the \nkids and food for the table. They will spend 100 percent of that \nincrease; whereas, the wealthier taxpayers are unlikely to put that \nwindfall back into the consumer-driven economy.\n  To just sum up my remarks--and I know the Senator from Massachusetts \nis going to add mightily to these arguments--let me say this. We are \ndoing a welfare bill. Everybody wants to see people get off welfare and \ngo to work. Every one of us should also want to make sure that when \npeople get into the workforce and they work hard, their work is \nrewarded, their work means something, and they won't be stuck in \npoverty forever if they are stuck in a minimum-wage job.\n  Let us show not only our compassion, let us show our respect for \nwork; let us show our understanding of economics.\n  I have a degree in economics. Granted, it was a long time ago. I was \na stockbroker and it was a long time ago.\n  I know when you put money in the hands of people who need to spend \nit, it is going right back into the economy. This particular amendment \nhas all the attributes we should all want to see. It will be a stimulus \nto the economy. It will get people out of poverty. It will set a \nstandard for the rest of the States. It is fair, it is overdue, and the \ntime is now.\n  I commend my colleague from Massachusetts. This is his initiative. He \nknows how much I care about this issue and is willing to share it with \nme. I am so honored to have my name associated with this amendment. I \nam very hopeful we can come together today and adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, there is no doubt we are going to \nhave a vote on minimum wage sometime, maybe on this bill or at least on \nsome other bill. It is one thing to ask for an agreement to vote on a \nnongermane amendment--the majority party has the responsibility of \ngetting work done, although we are cognizant of the fact we do not get \nanything done in this body if it is not bipartisan. We want to move \nthis legislation along because it is so important to moving people out \nof poverty.\n  As I said yesterday, some are on the edge of society, out of sight \nand out of mind, if they are on welfare. They are never going to move \nout of poverty if they are on welfare.\n  As I said yesterday, and the Senator from Massachusetts misunderstood \nme, if you are ever going to move out of poverty, you have to be in the \nworld of work. Being in the world of work does not automatically, even \nwith an increase in the minimum wage, guarantee you are going to be out \nof poverty, but at least you have a chance of moving out of poverty; \nwhereas on welfare you are destined to a lifetime of poverty.\n  We are interested in moving this legislation along, and it would help \na little bit reaching some understanding of voting on these amendments \nif we knew we were going to get this bill done and help the people who \nneed to be helped.\n  The point I want to make in regard to this amendment, and it is also \nin conjunction with the offering of nongermane amendments on other \nbills I have had before this Senate by the other party, is it seems to \nme they are always missing the point. They are always getting the cart \nbefore the horse.\n\n  The bill before the Senate 2 weeks ago was a bipartisan bill that \nSenator Baucus and I worked out. It came out of our committee with all \nthe Democrats supporting it. It encourages the creation of jobs in \nmanufacturing by reducing the tax on manufacturing because that high \ntax on manufacturing is a disincentive to the creation of jobs. And it \nhappens to be an incentive to outsourcing of jobs.\n  Also, because there is a tariff against some of our products going \ninto Europe, this would eliminate that tariff so we could be \ncompetitive. OK, that legislation is a bipartisan approach to creating \njobs in manufacturing. So what does the other party do? They offer an \namendment dealing with overtime regulations.\n  They get the cart before the horse because the first thing we have to \ndo is create jobs for people to get overtime. That legislation stalled \nbecause of nongermane amendments.\n  Now we have what is a legitimate subject of discussion--but somewhere \nelse--increasing the minimum wage. That has been a legitimate point of \ndiscussion since the 1920s, and it has been the law in this country \nsince 1938. Nobody denies that is a worthy subject of discussion. \nAgain, another example of getting the cart before the horse is that we \nare talking about getting people who are on welfare, not working, a \njob. Let's get them in the world of work.\n  We have Members on the other side of the aisle stalling this \nlegislation with nongermane amendments.\n  We have to put the priorities where the priorities ought to be: to \nhelp people get jobs and keep jobs so that all these other issues that \nare coming up will be applicable to more workers.\n  I am going to address for a short time this issue of the situation of \npeople on welfare and our opportunities to move them to work to \nemphasize the success of that program in the legislation we have had on \nthe books since 1996 and to see if we cannot improve that legislation \nin the bill that is before the Senate and move forward with another 8 \nyears of success of moving people from welfare to work, giving them an \nopportunity to move up the economic ladder.\n  The families who go on welfare are, obviously, very vulnerable and \nfragile families. They not only need a job, but they need support in \nmoving from welfare to work. We are not going to dump them out in the \ncold cruel world of work. Legislation that is already on the books and \nis going to be improved by this bill is going to enhance their support. \nWe have already demonstrated that with one overwhelming vote on more \nmoney for childcare. I have heard that a long time from that side of \nthe aisle, as we have heard from a lot of Republicans. One would think \nthey would want to pass this legislation to give people on welfare who \nare moving\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\ninto work the support they need to get there. This legislation does it. \nBut the shenanigans on the other side with nongermane amendments are \nholding that up.\n  The average family on welfare has two children, and that average \nfamily is headed by a young woman. Most of these families are African \nAmerican or Hispanic. Half of these families have a child under the age \nof 6, and we take into consideration in this legislation specific needs \nof families with children under 6.\n  The women who head these families are desperately poor. That is what \nwelfare does for people, it keeps them in poverty. These women who have \nthese families, besides being desperately poor and, contrary to the way \nthe argument over minimum wage was characterized, they are not working. \nThat is why it is so important to get this legislation passed before \nyou worry about minimum wage because we have to give them the support \nso they can get out there in the world of work so they can get the \nminimum wage in the first place.\n  States are reporting to us that the majority of adults on welfare are \nnot doing anything. In other words, they are not working and maybe not \ndoing anything that will lead to work, as we are trying to help them do \nthrough this infrastructure of support, of helping with job training \nand education, with substance abuse and other problems families might \nhave because it is quite obvious in the world of welfare, it is not a \nway to achieve self-sufficiency. Many of these adult recipients are not \nready for full-time work, so discussions about working 40 hours do not \nreally apply to this population. In fact, for a while the argument over \nwelfare reform focused on President Bush's proposal to require adult \nrecipients on welfare to be engaged in work activities for 40 hours a \nweek. That outraged my Democratic colleagues, that the administration \nwould propose raising the hours of activity, including work, to 40 \nhours. Just as if out there in the world of work it isn't assumed, not \nanything less than 40 hours a week, for the most part. So it is \nsomewhat ironic that we are here discussing a 40-hour work week \nscenario because, as I said, most of these adults on welfare are not \nworking at all and if they are working they are surely not working full \ntime.\n\n  These are adults, and again they are mainly women, with multiple and \noften coexisting barriers to work. They may be the victims of domestic \nabuse. They may have substance abuse problems. Add all that together \nand you have people who need services that this legislation provides to \nget them ready to go to work. So you worry about this person. Are they \ngetting a minimum wage at this level or at that level? That is why this \ndiscussion over minimum wage is just a little confusing to me, as \nlegitimate as it is for Congress to discuss the minimum wage, because \nwe have set the minimum wage since 1938. But in connection with these \npeople, they oftentimes are not earning any wage. But they are people \nwho need services if they are ever going to get that job.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to work something out on minimum wage, \nand that we can complete our work on this welfare bill. I think people \non the other side of the aisle, if they could indicate to us finality \non this legislation, there can be some accommodation. Because families \nin need are waiting for us to get this done. It is a very successful \nprogram that started in 1996 and we need to continue it. This \nlegislation fine-tunes it; it improves it; it strengthens it. We spend \nmore money to do a better job of support for people who need to go to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts, who \nwould like to speak on this amendment. I will be very brief.\n  The chairman of the committee is a good friend of mine. We have \nworked very closely together on most legislation. This is one bill \nwhere we are not working together as closely because we have somewhat \ndifferent points of view.\n  I appreciate the chairman's view that this side of the aisle is \nattempting to drag things out a little bit. The fact is, our side is \nwilling to have a vote on this amendment and on other amendments. We \nwill enter time agreements. There is no attempt to delay at all. In \nfact, when I was sitting here yesterday I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts suggested 20 minutes for a time agreement. That is, he \nwould agree to a vote in 20 minutes. I am not going to put words in the \nmouth of the good Senator as to how many minutes he would like in the \ntime agreement now, but the point is we are willing to have votes and \nto vote very quickly on all these amendments. We are not holding up \nanything.\n  It is also interesting to note when this welfare reform bill came up \nfor debate in 1995, there were 40 recorded votes on the floor. I think \nwe have had one thus far in the reauthorization debate. I think better \nlegislation results when amendments are offered, when they are debated, \nand when they are voted on. This way, Senators can decide whether they \nwant to vote for or against a particular amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa and myself work very closely, as I said. But I \nwant to make the record clear that there is nobody on this side holding \nup passage of this bill in any way. We are willing to enter into time \nagreements on any amendments that may be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first I thank my good friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for offering this amendment. It is one I \nfeel strongly about and support strongly. I thank our ranking leader on \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, for his support. I will make a \nbrief comment to my friend, and he is my friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, about his concerns and objections to considering the \nminimum-wage increase on this bill that is an attempt to move people \noff welfare into work.\n  In reviewing the legislation that is before us, I would like to \ndirect the chairman and those Members of the Senate who feel this \namendment is not relevant to the underlying bill, page 4 of the \ncommittee's report where we have the Secretary, Tommy Thompson, talking \nabout:\n\n       The most humane social program is a healthy and independent \n     family that has a capacity and ability to have a good, paying \n     job.\n\n  This is the Secretary of HHS testifying in favor of the overall \nlegislation. He is talking about having a good-paying job.\n  We know a minimum wage job today is not a good-paying job. The Boxer-\nKennedy amendment will make it closer to a good-paying job.\n  Then it continues, on page 12, the reason for change:\n\n       The Committee bill provides for States to continue their \n     successful efforts to move welfare recipients into good \n     jobs.\n\n  What are good jobs? The minimum wage jobs at $5.15 or the jobs at $7 \nan hour? States have directed considerable resources into moving \nwelfare recipients into meaningful employment. That is what we are \ntalking about, meaningful employment. This is what the Secretary of HHS \nsaid. This is the reason for change in the committee bill. That is what \nit is all about.\n  Then continue on to page 21:\n\n       The Committee bill recognizes the success received by TANF \n     and the Work First programs are a result of a sustained \n     emphasis on adult attachment to the workforce.\n\n  ``Attachment to the workforce'' means having a paycheck, a decent \njob.\n  I believe this legislation is directly relevant to the underlying \ntheme of the legislation. But I say to my friend from Iowa, if he wants \nto give me a time agreement on a separate bill and give us the \nassurance we will be able to consider it by the first of May, as an \nindependent bill here on the floor of the Senate, with a time limit, I \nwould be glad to urge my friend and colleague from California to \nwithdraw the amendment and take that, if that is agreeable to the \nSenator. We are not trying to hold the bill down.\n  I will propose a time limit on my amendment. It is now 10 after 3. I \npropose unanimous consent that we vote on this amendment at 3:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is in another 20 minutes. The point has been made \nabout how this legislation is slowing\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nthe bill down. We indicated we are prepared to vote, at least in 20 \nminutes, on this legislation. We were prepared yesterday to vote on it. \nThe problem is, it has been now 7 years, 7 years where we have been \ndenied the right to vote on it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sure the Senator would be happy to agree to a 5-\nminute limit. The Senator from Iowa gets up and says this is a noble \nthing to raise the minimum wage, but you are holding up the welfare \nbill.\n  We will vote on this in 60 seconds from now. The American people are \nfor this. Does my friend agree the American people are fairminded and \nfor this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. The American people understand \nfairness. They believe if you work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear, you should not have to live in poverty in the richest country in \nthe world. The American people understand that is basically what we are \ntalking about, fairness and respect for people who are doing a day's \nwork. The American people are overwhelmingly in favor of an increase in \nthe minimum wage, and for actually a good deal higher wage than the one \nwe are proposing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are charged with giving pay increases to the Federal \nworkforce. We do it every year, do we not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Our colleagues accept it. I do not know of anyone who \ndoes not accept the automatic adjustment in their pay.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator not think it is an outrage? We work hard \nand we make a decent living. We get an automatic cost-of-living \nadjustment unless we stop it. Yet the same people who take a cost-of-\nliving adjustment for themselves won't give a small increase to the \npeople at the bottom of the ladder who are trying so hard to make \nsomething of themselves and rise above problems, illness, and poverty--\nsometimes for generations--and want to be able to get into the \nworkforce.\n  My colleague says Tommy Thompson says it is important that these be \ngood jobs. I wonder if any of our colleagues could live on $10,800 a \nyear. I do not think they could. I do not think so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  I want to point out a few facts on the increase in the minimum wage.\n  This is the second longest period in the history of the minimum wage \nthat Congress has ignored the plight of low-wage earners. The first \ntime President Bush signed a minimum wage increase was in 1989. That \nwas after 12 years of inaction. It has been 7 years since the last \nincrease. It is long past time for Congress to prioritize the lowest \nworkers.\n  Let me give you a chart that makes the point which the Senator from \nCalifornia and I have tried to make over a period of time in this \ndebate. Here we have people who are working hard but losing ground with \nthe real value of the minimum wage. If we were to take effectively the \nyear 2000 and use that as the equivalent, the minimum wage in 1966 \nwould have been $8.50. Even though now at $5.15 an hour, its purchasing \npower using 2000 dollars would be $4.98, which would be one the lowest \nlevels it has been in the history of the minimum wage unless we \nincrease it. Even going up to $7, it will still be lower than it was \nfrom 1968 until 1980, a period of some 12 years. This is a very modest \nincrease without which we will reach the bottom in terms of real \npurchasing power.\n  Let us take another indicator in terms of what the minimum wage is in \nrelationship to a family of three. This is the red line representing \nwhat the poverty line has been, and that is for a family of three \nearning slightly below $16,000. This is the poverty. This represents \nthe value of the minimum wage which we show for a family of three--well \nbelow the poverty line.\n  Let us ask ourselves, What about those people receiving the minimum \nwage? Are they working? If we go from 1979 to the year 2000 and look at \nthe minimum wage--this is the bottom 40 percent of U.S. family income--\nwe find these workers in the bottom 40 percent are working more than \n400 hours. The average worker in this country is working longer than \nany other industrial nation in the world. These are hard-working people \nwho are trying to make do the best they can.\n\n  We find African Americans are working even longer and harder. \nHispanics are working even longer and harder. These are minimum wage \nworkers in the bottom percentile. They are working long and working \nhard trying to make ends meet. And they can't do it.\n  We have seen over the period of the last 3 years the increase in the \nnumber of people who are living in poverty. It was 31 million in the \nyear 2000. In 2002, it is more than 34 million. There is a direct \nresult of this administration's economic policy. Three million more \nAmericans are living in poverty. That represents today more than 34 \nmillion people living in poverty, including 12 million children. More \nthan 400,000 children today are living in poverty compared to the year \n2000. We have had no increase in the minimum wage. We are trying to do \nsomething about it.\n  This bill does nothing in terms of raising the income of some of \nthese families. This proposal will make a difference in terms of \nincome.\n  We will probably have those come on the floor as they usually do and \nsay, Senator, this is very interesting, but we know if we raise the \nminimum wage we are going to see the result of increasing unemployment. \nThere will be two reasons in opposition. I have been debating minimum \nwage increases since I have been in the Senate. These are the two \nstandard ones.\n  First they say if you raise the minimum wage, we will see an increase \nin unemployment. That is not true. We can show it. I will reference the \nfigures.\n  Second, the last issue is inflation. I will address that quickly \nbecause I want to get to the real issue; that is, what is happening to \nthese families who are living in poverty. That is the real issue; \nparticularly what is happening to the children who are living in \npoverty.\n  That is the real issue. What is happening to them in terms of hunger \nis the real issue. Let us get rid of these issues quickly; that is, \nincreasing the minimum wage does not cause unemployment. We increased \nit in September 1996, and we increased it in 1997.\n  This red column is where unemployment was in January of 1998. That is \nobviously almost 2 years after the increase in 1996 and a few months \nafter the increase in 1997. These are fairly significant figures in \nterms of unemployment.\n  Look at the national figure--5.2 percent in 1996, 4.7 percent in \n1997, and 4.7 in 1998. That is exactly the same 4.7 percent. That is \nafter the last increase in the minimum wage.\n  It was true among African Americans.\n  You will hear the argument: That is fine, generally, but the Senator \nand Senator Boxer don't understand this has a particular adverse impact \non African Americans. That is not true. This chart shows, looking back \nto 1996 and the last major increases, unemployment virtually remained \nstable. That is true with regard to the Hispanics and it is true with \nregard to teens. Let us dismiss that argument in terms of unemployment.\n  The other issue they will raise is, Well, this increase in the \nminimum wage is going to be an inflator in terms of our economy.\n  Listen to this: This increase in the minimum wage represents less \nthan one-fifth of 1 percent of wages of all workers in the country. \nInflator? I hope they are going to have a better argument than that. \nThey can't make the argument, although they will try. They will say: \nAdd that increase to minimum wage and you will get inflation; and, \nthink of all the people who will pay with inflation. You will increase \nunemployment among minorities. All of those arguments have been \nanswered in spades. There is no economic argument in opposition to this \nunless you are trying to squeeze these workers even harder in order to \ntry and exploit them even further.\n\n  I will point out the real issue and its impact on the most vulnerable \npopulation. We know today that America's children are more likely to \nlive in poverty than Americans in any other age\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\ngroup. The U.S. child poverty rate is substantially higher, two to \nthree times higher, than that of most other major western industrial \nnations. Isn't that a fine situation?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be happy to yield. After 5 or 6 minutes more of \nmy presentation, I will be glad to yield for questions.\n  The child poverty rate is substantially higher, two to three times \nhigher than most other western industrial nations. Reducing child \npoverty is one of the best investments Americans can make in their \nNation's future.\n  More children will enter school ready to learn; we will have more \nsuccessful schools; there will be fewer school dropouts; we will have \nbetter child health with less strain on the hospitals and public health \nsystems; we will have less stress on the juvenile justice system; we \nwill have less child hunger and malnutrition.\n  The fact is, the number of children living in poverty and the number \nof children going hungry every single day has increased significantly \nover the period of the last 3 years.\n  The bottom line is, 3 million children have parents who would benefit \nfrom a minimum wage increase. We have an opportunity to do something \nabout the 12 million American children living in poverty and the \n400,000 children more living in poverty today than were living in \npoverty 2 years ago. We can make a difference because so many of these \nchildren are living in families with minimum wage earnings. That is the \nissue.\n  We hear the arguments on the other side, and we can answer those in \nterms of inflation and unemployment. Those questions have been \nanswered. I will not take the time unless we are challenged on the \nissues, including historical unemployment figures and all the rest.\n  This is about children. It is about women. As I mentioned, and then I \nwill yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, this issue is about women \nbecause 61 percent of those who earn the minimum wage are women. It is \nabout children. We know that 3 million children live in families whose \nparent is working in a minimum wage job. So it is about women and \nchildren. It is about civil rights because a great number of these \nminimum wage workers are men and women of color. It is about fairness \nbecause Americans understand if you want to work 40 hours a week and \ncan work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, you should not have to live \nin poverty. Americans understand that.\n  The final point I make, these minimum wage workers are men and women \nof dignity and pride. Too often around here we say: Minimum wage \nworkers, we have other things to do. These are some of the hardest \nworking, most decent men and women we have in this country, who take a \nsense of pride in the work they do, which is menial, tough, repetitive \nwork--cleaning out the buildings of American industry, also working as \nassistants to teachers, working in nursing homes, looking after the \nelderly people of this country. This is hard, difficult, challenging \nwork, but they take a sense of pride in it.\n\n  We have refused to increase the minimum wage now for 7 years. As I \nhave pointed out, this chart shows the history of the increases in the \nminimum wage. It is not a partisan matter. Going back to 1938, we have \nthe increases under President Roosevelt and President Truman. President \nEisenhower increased the minimum wage in 1955. President Kennedy did in \n1961; Lyndon Johnson in 1966; President Ford did it in 1974 three \ndifferent times, for 1974, 1975, and 1976. President Ford, a \nRepublican, did it. President Carter, in 1977; President Bush I did it \nin 1989; President Clinton in 1996.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. That is why it is so difficult for \nmany to understand why those on the other side have refused the \nopportunity to even get a vote. I welcome the chance that we will have \nthis time to get a vote.\n  I point out, and then I will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwhat moving up to $7 an hour means to a family earning the minimum \nwage. It is the equivalent of 2 years of childcare. It is more than 2 \nyears of health care for that family. It is full tuition for a \ncommunity college degree. It is a year and a half of heat and \nelectricity. It is more than a year of groceries, and more than 9 \nmonths of rent. It is real money for real people who are working hard, \nplaying by the rules, and are waiting for this body to take some \naction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Massachusetts \nmakes an important point about what we should be doing to reduce \npoverty.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made statements that increasing the \nminimum wage has an impact on child poverty. I have not seen a chart \nthat indicates that. If the Senator could put up the chart when the \nminimum wage increases went into effect, my question is--we are on the \nwelfare reform bill. This welfare reform bill has had a dramatic impact \non child poverty. In fact, if you look at the chart, it shows the \nincreases in the minimum wage--I will have a chart that compares with \nthat; we have dueling charts that work in concert. The Senator shows \nwhere the minimum wage was at very high levels that happened to be in \nabout this area. I am using Black child poverty, but obviously that is \nthe worst case scenario. During the highest level of poverty among \nAfrican Americans, we had a high minimum wage.\n  All throughout this time--in fact, as you suggested, the minimum wage \nactually came down in real value--what else came down? The rate of \nBlack child poverty.\n  Now, I would not suggest that the minimum wage was necessarily tied \nto that. What I would suggest is what happened was a fundamental change \nin welfare policy that started in the mid-1990s and accelerated in 1996 \nby the Federal Government and has resulted in a huge decline in \npoverty, irrespective of what the minimum wage is.\n  I make the argument that if the Senator wants to do something about \nhelping child poverty, we should pass this welfare bill. Maybe there is \na time and place to have the argument with respect to minimum wage, but \nI do not believe the evidence supports that increasing the minimum wage \nhas any discernible impact on the poverty level, certainly among \nAfrican American children and, I argue, across the board among children \nin general.\n\n  Finally, the point I want to make, since----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that a question? I am about to yield the floor \ngenerally, if you could get to the question. What is the question? I \nwould be glad to answer.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. I want to make the point in the \nlast 10 years, the child poverty rate has declined almost 30 percent. \nDuring that time there was one increase in the minimum wage, but there \nwas a dramatic change in welfare.\n  I ask the Senator, does he have any information that shows that the \nminimum wage actually does result in a decrease in child poverty? I \nthink I have very conclusive evidence that changes in welfare policy \nhave a dramatic impact on the reductions in child poverty.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the fact is self-evident and should be to \nall Members. We do not need charts. If you are making $5.50 an hour and \nyou are the principal bread winner in the family with a child, that \nchild will live in poverty. You can have all the charts in the world, \nbut that is self-evident. That ought to be a given.\n  We do not have to dispute that. I hope we would not have to dispute \nthat. Those are the hard, difficult facts.\n  The issues about the variance in terms of child poverty, obviously, \nwhen we have the dramatic expansion as during the period of the 1990s \nunder President Clinton, we saw the creation of 22 million jobs. We saw \nthat spill over into a reduction of child poverty. That is the answer. \nThe fact is we have not seen that.\n\n  In the last 3 years, we have seen a growth in poverty in the total \nnumber of people who are living in poverty, including children, because \nwe have lost 3 million jobs--effectively maybe 2 million overall--but 2 \nmillion jobs. The fact is, the new jobs that are being created are \npaying about 25 percent less than those they are replacing.\n  With all respect to the Senator, the idea that at $5.15 an hour when \nyou have a child or two children they are not going to be living in \npoverty escapes me completely. I do not think we\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nneed any chart to show that. That is fairly self-evident.\n  I do not know what the situation is in Pennsylvania, but I do know in \nthe other States I have visited in recent times, people cannot make it. \nAt $5.15 an hour, how is a parent going to be able to go out and rent \nan apartment and provide food for their children? That does not make \nsense.\n  The fact is, almost half of the new jobs that were being created for \nthose who have moved off welfare now have disappeared. That is a \ndifferent issue, and we could debate that, and I would be glad to. That \nis not what this amendment is about.\n  This amendment is relevant to the underlying issue. As I have raised \nbefore with Secretary Thompson, the purpose of this bill is to try to \nget people into somewhat decent jobs.\n  We raised this over 2\\1/2\\ years, up to $7 an hour, almost a living \nwage. We think in this country, at this time, this is something that is \ncalled for, and we are prepared to move ahead with it.\n  I see the manager on this bill. We can either take some more time or \nwe can try to move toward whatever outcome the floor managers would \nwant. If we want some additional debate on it, we are glad to do so. \nBut if you want to move toward a conclusion of it, we are glad to do so \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nis insincere about moving forward on both this minimum wage increase as \nwell as moving forward on this bill. I will offer a unanimous consent \nrequest to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow morning, at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with \nthe Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to back-to-back votes, first \nin relation to a Republican minimum wage amendment, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to the Boxer amendment, with no second degrees in \norder to either amendment; provided further that the bill then be \nlimited to germane amendments, and at 9:30 a.m., on Thursday, April 1, \nthe substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no \nintervening action or debate. Finally, I ask consent that following \npassage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Before the Senator from Massachusetts comments on this request, I \nwould suggest what this unanimous consent request says is the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts will have a vote on his amendment, the Republicans \nwill have a vote on a side-by-side amendment, we will go to final \npassage on this bill, with germane amendments being offered and voted \non in between that time; and after passage of the bill, this bill will \ngo to conference, and we will have an opportunity for the House and the \nSenate to work their will and to actually get this welfare \nreauthorization passed for another 6-year period.\n  So if the Senator from Massachusetts is sincere about getting the \nminimum wage increase voted on here in the Senate, and not holding up \nthis piece of legislation, I would hope he would be willing to accept \nthis unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for commenting on my \nsincerity because I indicated yesterday I was interested in a 15-minute \ntime limitation on this amendment, and it was objected to by the \nSenator from Iowa. We indicated we were willing to vote at 3:30 today, \nand it was objected to.\n  So now the Senator, if he wants to amend that request--since these \nare directly related to the issues of employment--to include an \namendment with a 1-hour time limitation on the issue of overtime, an \namendment with a 1-hour time limitation in terms of unemployment \ncompensation, and then to have relevant amendments and time limitations \non those amendments of up to an hour, I would not object to that.\n  So, Mr. President, I object, and I offer a unanimous consent request \nalong the lines I mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the modified unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think it goes to state the case that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, in offering these other ideas, is in \nfact not interested in the Senate working its will on welfare reform, \nwhich is the bill before us, but bringing the political motives and \ndebates that are surrounding the Presidential campaigns here on the \nfloor of the Senate, and to have sort of ``message theme'' amendments \non a very serious piece of legislation that needs to be passed to \ncreate opportunities so this line on this chart can continue to go \ndown.\n\n  Because what we have with the welfare reform reauthorization bill is \nsomething that is going to continue to move people out of poverty, to \ncreate better opportunities for work. What the Senator from \nMassachusetts is suggesting is, instead of that, we are going to extend \nunemployment benefits. What we need to do is create better incentives \nand better education, training, and an enormous amount of childcare to \nhelp people go to work, not extend unemployment benefits.\n  Again, we are in this situation where the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid: Well, if we just do this. Now it is: Well, you need to do this, \nand this, and then this. The bottom line is, we have a lot of \nsubstantive debate that can and should occur on this legislation. If \nthere are relevant amendments, we would be happy to debate them. But \nthe amendments the Senator from Massachusetts now wants to bring in are \nnot relevant, and, therefore, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes \ntalking about this bill and the importance of why we need to move to \nthe passage of it.\n  The Senator put up his chart of minimum wage increases. I voted for \nthose minimum wage increases. I would vote for a minimum wage increase \nin the next 10 minutes if we could have gotten that agreement. I would \nhave been happy to vote on a side by side, and I would have supported \nSenator McConnell's amendment, which would have raised the minimum \nwage, and would have raised it by over a dollar over the next couple of \nyears.\n  I think it is important that we talk about this issue. But I think \nthe most important thing we can do for the poor in America--and I found \nit remarkable the Senator from Massachusetts can look at his chart, \nthat shows the minimum wage at very high levels in real dollars, during \na time when child poverty, and particularly African-American poverty, \nhas been at its highest and he says it only makes sense if you have \nhigh minimum wage, you are going to have low poverty rates.\n  Tell the people living during this time who were experiencing high \npoverty rates how much sense it made. Because in reality it made no \nsense because it was not happening. A high minimum wage does not \nguarantee low poverty. What, in many cases, a high minimum wage \nguarantees is unemployment and very high rates of poverty.\n  What we have is a situation where we had higher rates of the minimum \nwage. We also had a welfare system that was debilitating on the poor, \ndesigned by the very same people who think the minimum wage is the \nanswer to poverty.\n  It is the same economic team, folks, which believes Government \nmicromanaging of every person's life and business in America is the way \nto make sure everybody achieves. Guess what. It did not work. It did \nnot work. What worked? Work. Yes, what every American knows. But there \nis a commonsense deficit in this city. What every American knows, as \ncommon sense, that work works to improve people's economic status in \nlife, has been lost here in the Senate, was lost for many years when it \ncame to the issue of poverty in America.\n  And, oh, I remember, sitting in the chair where Senator Grassley sits \ntoday, and sitting in this chair at times in 1995 and 1996, when scores \nof\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nMembers who designed the welfare system in the 1960s and 1970s, who \ndesigned the minimum wage increases in the 1960s and 1970s, who said \nthat was the answer to solving poverty in America, that was the answer \nto solving poverty in America, came to the floor and said: How dare \nyou. How dare you suggest we require people to work. How dare you \nsuggest we put a time limit--a time limit--on people on welfare. Don't \nyou understand? These people are poor. That is a disability greater \nthan any other disability people encounter in life--at least if you \nlisten to the other side, that is what you would think they were \nsaying.\n  President Bush uses the term ``the soft bigotry of low \nexpectations.'' There was no soft bigotry. This was hard bigotry of low \nexpectations. If you were poor, you needed our help, you needed \nGovernment to give you dollars, you needed Government to raise your \nwages. And that was going to solve the poverty problems in America. It \ndid not work. What worked? Work.\n\n  Here we are in the Senate Chamber. I find it absolutely ironic. We \nhave Senator Grassley standing up for the new war on poverty, his bill \nout of committee, increasing the work requirement, yes, increasing \nsupport for women who are trying to get work, including daycare and \nother services. On the other side we have, no, we need the Government \nto fix the economy and raise the minimum wage. It is a classic \ndifference in the perspective of what the role of Government should be. \nWe stand here today and say, you can debate all you want about the \nminimum wage. I am not suggesting it is a bad thing, but it is not a \npanacea. It bears no relationship historically to reductions in \npoverty. Why? Because most of the people who get the minimum wage jobs, \nas the Senator from Iowa said, in the past are not heads of households; \nthey are teenagers, many of whom are in very wealthy homes. That is who \nwe are helping with minimum wage increases primarily. We are helping \nsome others, but if you really want to help those who have not had the \nchances economically, if you really want to lift people out of poverty, \nthen work and developing and nurturing a system that encourages people \nto get their lives together and to get into the workplace to achieve is \nthe answer. That is what this bill does, and more.\n  That is why I am so excited about this bill because we have found out \nthat, yes, work works. This is the lowest rate of African-American \nchild poverty ever recorded in America. By the way, in the last year, \n2002 and 2003, yes, because of the recession, black poverty among \nchildren went up, but very slightly, 1 or 2 percent, during a time of a \nlot of job loss.\n  If you look at the other statistics, for example, one that probably \nmirrors this, as far as high rates of poverty, had to do with single \nmothers never married. What we saw was single mothers never married, \nhistorically the rate of employment among single never-married mothers \nwas around 40 to 42 percent historically. It was an intractable problem \nthat people said could never be fixed. Then we passed the welfare \nreform bill in 1996. Now 63 percent of single, never-married mothers \nare employed.\n  That is remarkable to see those kinds of dynamic shifts. By the way, \nthat number has not changed in the last 2 years. The employment levels \nhave remained the same as they have basically within the welfare \nsystem.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has said things have been terrible the \nlast few years in the job market and people in poverty have been hurt. \nThe bottom line is, the welfare rolls continue to be low. They have not \nshot back up.\n  In fact, I was reading an editorial from a paper I generally don't \nread editorials from, my hometown paper--not necessarily fond of me. \nThey happened to write a lucid editorial, sort of the blind squirrel \nphenomenon. They wrote an editorial in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, \n``Shrinking Welfare, the Statistical Mystery of a Smaller Dole.'' They \ncomment on the fact that here we are, during 3 years where there has \nnot been dramatic job growth, and yet the welfare rolls are not going \nback. They were sort of at a quandary as to why.\n  They say: Although welfare reform still has problems, single mothers \noften have considerable difficulty obtaining childcare--after we passed \nnow $7 billion; we have over doubled the amount of daycare that is \ngoing to be available under this bill--these numbers suggest it is \nworking.\n  The numbers suggest welfare is working. For whatever reason--gosh, I \ncan't imagine; it is again another commonsense deficit--more people are \ntrying to do for themselves instead of asking government to do for \nthem.\n  Go figure. Let me repeat this. For whatever reason, more people are \ntrying to do for themselves instead of asking government to do for \nthem. Even if the experts can't explain it, they conclude that is a \ngood thing.\n  Do you know what. That is a good thing, what we did in 1996, despite \nthe protestations, despite the charts with pictures of people standing \nin bread lines, sleeping on grates, of just absolutely cataclysmic \npredictions of what would happen to rates of poverty, which were around \nthis level at the time, we had projections that black poverty among \nchildren would skyrocket, that women would be thrown off welfare and \nnot be able to raise their children, that we would have dramatic \nchanges and riots in our poorest neighborhoods because of this welfare \nreform proposal that was being put forward. I will read some of my \ncolleagues' predictions of what would happen to poverty.\n  Guess what. They were wrong. Those of us who stood here and said, \nhave faith in the poor in America that they, too, want a better life \nfor themselves and their children, and they are willing to work for it, \nif given the incentives and the opportunity to do so, if given the \ntools to make work work, they, too, will pursue the American dream, we \nhad faith in them. Too many others have faith only in the government to \ntake care of them.\n  Having talked to numerous people who have been on welfare--in fact, \nin my office in my State, I have hired nine people from the welfare \nrolls. They have worked through all the problems, and there are \nproblems in someone transitioning off of welfare. I can tell you that \nevery single one thanked me for having faith in them, thanked me for \npassing a bill that didn't say that we needed the government to be \nthere to protect them and keep them in poverty and dependent upon it, \nbut trusted them that, if given the tools, that they, too, could take \ncare of their family and feel better about it every day, knowing full \nwell it would be a struggle and continues to be a struggle.\n  But there is honor in the struggle to provide for your family. There \nis honor. There is dignity. There is character in struggling to provide \nfor you and your family.\n  Millions of women--predominantly women; welfare is predominantly a \nwoman's program, a single-mother program--have courageously gone out \nand fought for their families because we gave them the tools and \nincentive to do so. They have changed their lives for the better, and \nthey have given their children a hope, a model that they can build a \nlife on, that they can build on the success of their mother who \novercame addiction.\n  A young woman spoke to our Republican conference this morning from \nhere in DC, incarcerated many times, addicted, so bad that she lost her \nthree children to foster care. Then welfare reform came around, made \nher go to work. And today she has her three children back.\n  She not only got a job, she now has a small business where she \nemploys four people in town. She didn't do it with an SBA loan or any \nGovernment help at all; she saved a little money and started her own \nbusiness. In the last 6 months, she got married. You have to believe in \npeople. You have to believe that poverty is not the ultimate disabler.\n  That is why this bill is so important. That is why this bill has to \nbe passed, because we have 28 States right now, where all of the \nrequirements that we have put on the States to have work programs, to \nget people transitioned off of the rolls, to provide the support \nservices to transition people into the economic mainstream in 28 \nStates--that incentive is now gone. So in 28 States in America, we are \nback to the old AFDC days. That will have an impact.\n  Let me tell you what one of the reasons is I am so excited about this \nbill. It is the next step in welfare. We knew--those of us who helped \ndesign\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nthe 1996 act--this was the first step, that work was the most important \nthing. There were other important things, but we understood work was \nthe central focus. But there were other causes and concerns we wanted \nto deal with.\n  Senator Grassley had this chart up. It is a chart by Haskins and \nSawhill. They are from the Brookings Institute. I think even the \nSenator from Massachusetts would admit that the Brookings Institute is \nnot a conservative think tank. It is seen as the left-leaning think \ntank in town--or one of them. Elizabeth Sawhill is a former Clinton \npoverty expert. Ron Haskins happens to be--I don't know how he got in \nthere--he is a fairly conservative guy. We have our differences. \nAnyway, Ron and Elizabeth worked together on this. This is a peer-\nreviewed study that isolates factors of poverty. This is the official \npoverty rate, 13 percent. Remember what we said back in 1996: Work \nworks. You have to get people into work. That is the best cure for \npoverty, the best way to turn your life around. That is the best \nmedicine for children--to see mom get up every day and go to work, \ninstead of receiving a welfare check. Guess what. It works. With full-\ntime work, poverty rates go down to 7.5 percent.\n  The other thing this bill does is understand we have to keep this \nand, in fact, improve upon it. We are going to increase the work \nrequirement by 20 percent. Interestingly enough, we increased the \namount of daycare by 100 percent. So this is, again, Washington logic. \nWe are going to require people to work 20 percent more, so we need 100 \npercent in daycare to pay for that. Nevertheless, there are other \nfactors involved that reduce poverty.\n  Marriage. The President's initiative is, again, common sense. It is \nan understanding that the poverty rates are lower among married couples \nthan they are among single heads of households. So one of the things \nthe President wanted to do with his marriage initiative is to create at \nleast a positive or nurturing atmosphere for couples who enter the \nwelfare system with the intention of getting married to actually get \nmarried and raise a family.\n  There was a study done by a professor at Princeton that asked the \nquestion upon paternity establishment: Are you in a relationship? What \nI mean by paternity establishment is that most States figured out the \nbest time to establish who the father of the child is is in a hospital; \nso most States have adopted that as a way of establishing who the \nfather is, and then using that to get the father to pay child support. \nThat was something that was a very big contentious point in the welfare \nbill of 1996. We required paternity establishment in the States, that \nthey have an active program to find out who these fathers were. This \nwas the whole deadbeat dad issue and the fact that there were enormous \namounts of uncollected child support. So we did a whole lot of things \non child support enforcement and paternity establishment because there \nwas a huge number of women on welfare who either refused to, or don't, \nfor whatever reason, identify the father of the child. From my \nperspective, to try to get the father involved in the child's life, I \nthought paternity establishment was going to be very important.\n\n  The States have a different view. They saw it as a way to get cash--\nestablish paternity so we could get child support and we could get \nmoney. They were not particularly interested in whether dad did \nanything to raise the child other than to send the check so the State \ncould get some of the money. They would then reduce the benefits to the \nmother in proportion to the child support being paid by the father. \nThere is an incentive for the States to find out who the father was and \nattach wages, if necessary, and get the child support flowing into the \nState coffers.\n  That is not exactly the most nurturing conclusion that I thought \nwould occur by finding out who father was. I had this funny idea that \nmaybe if they found out who the father was and the father became \ninvolved in a legal way with his child, he might take some \nresponsibility for that child. That is not, unfortunately, what has \nhappened. There are a lot of factors involved, including a culture in \nmany communities that is not nurturing of fathers taking responsibility \nfor their children--at least in the popular culture. In a segment of \nthe popular culture, it is not reinforced that fathers should take \nresponsibility for their children. It is a misogynist popular culture \nthat abuses women in song, in video, and in many other ways, and \nteaches you not to take responsibility for your actions. So the popular \nculture, matched up with the State that was just interested in money, \nhas resulted in incredibly high rates of absent fathers.\n  What are we going to do about that? What should we do? People say, \nSenator, what is the Government's role in marriage--to encourage people \nto marry? Why doesn't the Government stay out of it? I argue that the \nGovernment is already in it because, prior to welfare's inception--and \nyou can say this is a good or bad thing, but it is a fact--prior to \nwelfare's inception, one of the reasons mothers and fathers stayed \ntogether was because there wasn't any money to support the child at \nall. The Government didn't help raise children at all. There was no \nmoney. That is when sort of a popular joke regarding the shotgun \nwedding came about, because mom had no means to support herself and her \nchildren. So families required fathers to stick it out.\n  Many will say that was not the optimal situation. I agree. But ask \nthe question now, are we better off now? Are the children better off \nnow? As the Senator from Massachusetts said, it is about the children, \nisn't it? Are the children better off now in this culture?\n  I would make the argument that the Federal Government has already \ndone its part in taking sides on the marriage debate, and that is, it \nhas been an enabler of the dissolution of marriage because it is no \nlonger required to support and raise your child.\n  Again, you can argue positives and negatives about it, but that is a \nfact. Economically, it simply was not possible 50 years ago. \nEconomically, it is a viable option--I am not saying the best option. I \nam not saying better or worse. All I am saying is it is an option that \nwas not available before. So the Government has taken sides on the \nissue of marriage.\n  What I am suggesting, and what this bill suggests, is the Government \ntry to shift gears to be somewhat neutral on the issue. What do I mean \nby that? A researcher from Princeton I started talking about did a \nsurvey asking whether mothers and fathers at the time of paternity \nestablishment were in a relationship. Actually, a very high percentage \nsaid yes at the time. I think it was roughly 80 percent said they were \ncurrently in a relationship.\n  They were asked the question: Do you have any intention of getting \nmarried? Again, a very high percentage of these young parents or new \nparents said, yes, they actually were contemplating marriage--over 50 \npercent. What happened?\n  By the way, what did the Government do during this time? The \nGovernment basically said: OK, dad, sign here, make sure you establish \npaternity. Thank you very much. Fold up that paper, put it in the \nbriefcase, and back down to the welfare office. File the paper. Make \nsure we get dad a child support order so we can get our money. That is \nthe Government's role financially.\n  The Government says marriage is not such a bad--no, no, we are not \ngoing to prejudice these folks; let them do whatever they want as long \nas we get our money--as long as we get our money.\n  What happened a year later? The researcher from Princeton--again, not \na conservative researcher--asked the question a year later of these \nsame couples. Guess what. Very few got married. I think 10 percent were \nstill together in one form or another.\n  What happened? I think it is fairly obvious what happened. It is a \ntough situation for an unmarried couple, particularly, again, given the \npopular culture. It is a very tough situation to work through the \ndifficulties of raising a newborn and trying to keep a relationship \ntogether. Even people who are married have a tough time. A newborn is a \nbig change in your life. Having had seven children, I can tell you, \nhaving a newborn in the house is a big change. When you are struggling \neconomically, when you may be living at home or may be living in poor \naccommodations or maybe not living in the same place, this is a very \nstressful and difficult situation. People, in many cases, do not\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\nhave a heck of a lot of role models around to help them get through \nthis difficult time in their life.\n  I do not think anybody here is surprised to hear these numbers--I \nwould not think they would be--that a very small percentage of people \nin this situation end up getting married. Why aren't you surprised? I \nthink we need to think about that. Why were you not surprised when I \nsaid that? That is the expectation, is it not? That is what we expect.\n  If we expect it, what do you think the people involved in the \nsituation expect over time? We are trying to change that dynamic. We \nare not trying to force anything down anybody's throat. All we are \nsuggesting is that at the time of paternity establishment, instead of \nfolding up that little paper that now has the signature that is going \nto create financial liability for that man for at least some period of \ntime, we ask one additional question: Are you interested in getting \nmarried?\n  If both answer yes, for example, what a caseworker could do is pull \nout a card and say: Here is a card and here is a list of 10 people, 10 \norganizations who do marriage counseling. If you call one of these \norganizations and you show up for an appointment, we will pay for your \ncounseling to help you get through this difficult time and stressful \ntime in your life.\n  Believe it or not, there are people who are saying this is a right-\nwing agenda to try to get people to get married, as if that is a \nhorrible thing to actually have mothers and fathers of children \nactually get married; that is some sort of secret plan to destroy the \nworld. I do not understand it.\n  What we are trying to do is help two people who at the time have a \ncommitment and have a product of that commitment called a child who \nneeds love and support from as many people as that child can get--\noptimally, a mother and a father. All we are saying is give this child \na chance; hopefully, a better chance. At least try. At least try to \nhelp people who want to be helped. Not force it on them, just try to \nhelp people who have, at least at the moment of the time they are \nlooking at the face of this new creation, who actually still dream and \nhope of a better life with that child and together to pour some water \non that seed to nurture it instead of folding up that piece of paper \nand saying: I got your money. That is all I came for. I am here from \nthe Government, and I got your money. I got your signature, and that is \nall I am here to do. And look down at that child and say: I know what \nis going to happen, but what do I care? I have no requirement to care \nabout whether mothers and fathers stay together and raise and nurture \nthat child. It is not my job.\n  I will be offering an amendment, if we get a chance to offer \namendments, to actually increase to the President's budget figure the \namount of money in this program because I do believe that Government \nshould be on the side of children in creating at least a chance for \nthem to be raised in a stable two-parent family.\n  What happens to the poverty rate? If you increase the marriage rate, \nthe poverty rate drops not some but very dramatically. So the keys in \nthis legislation of work and marriage are the two strongest indicators \nof a reduction in poverty. The other factors many others suggest are \nkeys to reducing poverty is increased education. It helps, but it is \nnot anywhere as powerful as the focus of this bill. Reduced family \nsize? Again, the more children you have the higher the chance you are \ngoing to be in poverty. So if you have fewer children, it helps--again, \nnot as much as the focus of this bill. The interesting thing is, if you \nfactor all these four things together, look what happens to the poverty \nlevel: Work; marriage, which allows in many cases the opportunity for \neducation; and reduced family size--dramatic reduction in poverty. Can \nyou imagine, for the longest time we didn't want to do this? And we \nstill don't do this. The results are powerful.\n\n  What do some on the other side still hold to? I underscore ``some'' \nbecause thankfully we have had bipartisan support in much of what we \nhave done here. What do some on the other side see as the answer? Spend \nmore money. If we want to get people out of poverty, just increase the \namount of money you give people in poverty and, guess what, you get \nthem out of poverty.\n  Here is doubling the welfare benefit. If we doubled the welfare \nbenefit, what would happen? Hardly any decrease in poverty. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts might say it is obvious on its face, if we give \npeople more money--in fact, it isn't that he might say it; yes, he did \nsay it. He said it is obvious, if you give people more money, if you \nraise the minimum wage, of course poverty is going to go down. We are \nnot talking about raising the minimum wage here; we are talking about \ndoubling the welfare benefit. It makes barely a scratch. So I guess it \nisn't all that obvious, is it?\n  I guess, just like the rest of us, people who are experiencing \npoverty in their lives are as complex as the rest of us and have a lot \nof factors that go into whether they are poor, not just how much money \ncomes in the door. There are a lot of factors that go into whether \npeople rise in society. What we know works is work and marriage and \nfamilies. We know that works. You know what. America knows it works. \nThat is obvious. It is obvious to me and hopefully it will be obvious \nto my colleagues as we proceed here today. Instead of focusing on \nminimum wage--again, it has its time and place, but there is no \nevidence at all that has been put forward that it does anything to \nreduce poverty. In fact, straight cash assistance--not identical with \nthe minimum wage, but the same idea behind it--doesn't significantly \naffect poverty.\n  What we are doing in this bill works. It works from an analytical \npoint of view; it works from a moral point of view; it works from a \ncommonsense point of view. It is all about what we Americans value and \nunderstand and revere--at least we have throughout the history of this \ncountry.\n  So I am hopeful we can move forward, that we can get an agreement to \nsomehow or another dispose of the Kennedy amendment, either in this \nbill or at some future time, and move to passage of this very important \npiece of legislation which is going to have a dramatic impact in taking \nthis number and numbers like it, the poverty rate among Black children, \nof all children--it has not just been among African-American children; \nit has been among all children as well as mothers--down, and down \nfurther.\n  We have an obligation if we know something is working to make it \npermanent and extend it and make it better, to do more of what we know \nworks. That is what this bill does. I am hopeful the Senate will give \nits support to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor nearly a week ago to \ntalk about high energy prices. I know several of my colleagues have \nbeen speaking about this issue today. At the time I spoke last week, I \noutlined a series of suggestions, 13 concrete actions I was urging the \nadministration and particularly the President take to begin addressing \nthis problem, both of high price of gas but also the high price of \nnatural gas and the impact that is having on American families and on \nour economy.\n  The figures are fairly startling. Today, energy prices are at \nhistoric highs. Some analysts estimate that energy price shocks this \nyear could cost American consumers more than $40 billion. Speaking very \nfrankly, we cannot afford this kind of expense. We need to maintain a \nhealthy pace of growth in our gross domestic product, and high energy \nprices dampen that growth. Clearly we need to give attention to this.\n  I was encouraged by some of the reaction we received to my statement \nlast week. I did receive a letter from the National Association of \nConvenience Stores, particularly endorsing the suggestion that we begin \nto address this boutique fuels problem, the proliferation of boutique \nfuels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I was also encouraged by the comments of \nmy colleague from New Mexico and others who have come to the floor \nendorsing some very similar suggestions. It is important that we speak \ntoday about this issue because of the OPEC meeting that is about to \noccur in Vienna, Austria. I want to reiterate that it is extremely \nimportant that the administration assert pressure on OPEC, the OPEC \nmembers who are meeting in Vienna, to forego their proposed 1 million \nbarrel-per-day production cut. We do need to rein in high oil and gas \nprices and we need to send a strong message that cutting production of \noil in OPEC is not the way to do that.\n  OPEC has the ability to affect price in two important ways: They can \nadd to supply or they can talk down the price of oil on the world \nmarket. We have seen them do both in previous periods. I don't see any \nreal action to affect the price of oil on either front at this point. \nWe have been out of the price band--this is, I believe, this $22 to $28 \nband that OPEC has talked about--for quite some time now. At the same \ntime that we have been way above that band, some OPEC members are \ntalking about not only keeping production steady but actually cutting \nproduction.\n  This would be a very wrong-headed move. It would have adverse \nconsequences on American consumers. I hope very much they will \nreconsider and I hope our administration will use its very best efforts \nin the next day or two to ensure that OPEC in fact does not cut \nproduction.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                        of Convenience Stores,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the retail members of the \n     National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), I would \n     like to express our appreciation for your comments yesterday \n     regarding the proliferation of boutique fuels. As the \n     representative of an industry that sells more than 75 percent \n     of the gasoline consumed in the United States every year, \n     NACS has long advocated for a comprehensive fuels policy that \n     would restore gasoline fungibility to the system without \n     sacrificing supply.\n       The problems associated with the proliferation of boutique \n     fuels are significant. As you noted yesterday, these \n     specifications have ``greatly reduced the overall flexibility \n     and efficiency of our fuels system.'' We could not agree with \n     you more. America's motor fuels system, including the \n     refining, pipeline and storage infrastructure, was not \n     designed to accommodate dozens of unique, non-fungible fuel \n     blends.\n       Last year, NACS commissioned a study that analyzed the \n     impact these boutique fuels have on the nation's gasoline \n     supply and assessed the effect possible adjustments to the \n     fuels regulatory system might have on refining capacity. Our \n     study revealed that reducing the number of boutique fuel \n     blends, while maintaining or improving environmental quality, \n     will improve fungibility. However, it will also reduce the \n     production capacity of the domestic refining system by \n     requiring the production of more environmentally sensitive \n     blends, which are more difficult to produce. For this reason, \n     an approach to boutique fuels must be carefully balanced with \n     the preservation of supply.\n       Your acknowledgement of the challenges facing the petroleum \n     industry and your interest in overcoming these challenges is \n     greatly appreciated by the convenience store industry. We \n     look forward to working with you and your colleagues in a \n     non-partisan, policy-specific effort to restore efficiency \n     and flexibility to the gasoline marketplace.\n       Thank you and please let me know how NACS might be of \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John Eichberger,\n                                            Director, Motor Fuels.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains of the 5 minutes I \nrequested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3346-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3346-S3347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IRAQI AND AFGHANISTAN LIBERATION MEDALS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a bill to honor \nour service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan who have served and \ncontinue to serve their country by working for a fee, independent and \nstable Iraq and a new Afghanistan. These missions have been difficult \nand the cost has been high; nearly 600 Americans have been killed and \nalmost 3,000 Americans have been injured in Iraq, while more than 500 \nAmericans have been injured and more than 100 U.S. servicemen and women \nhave been lost in Afghanistan.\n  More than a year after the initial invasion, nearly 110,000 troops \nare still stationed in Iraq, working to build a new, stable beacon of \nfreedom in the region. My fellow Senators, the liberation of Iraq is \nturning out to be the most significant military occupation and \nreconstruction effort since the end of World War II. We cannot \nunderstate the importance of the work being done there today.\n  The administration's focus on Iraq leaves the mission in Afghanistan \nincomplete. Despite constant progress there, the fighting is still not \nover. Recent assassinations of government officials, car bombings, and \nthe lingering presence of terrorist forces and former Taliban fighters \nforce thousands of our troops to stay in-country.\n  For their courageous efforts, the Department of Defense has decided \nto award our brave young men and women with the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal--GWOT--and no other medal. This is despite the fact \nthat G.W.O.T. medal is meant for any individual who has served overseas \nduring the war on terror and may have come within a few hundred miles \nof a combat zone. The dangers of serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are \ngreater; therefore, along with my colleagues, Senators Lott, Landrieu, \nInhofe, and Lugar, I propose to correct this mistake by passing \nlegislation authorizing the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals in \naddition to the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on this war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from active duty, National Guard and Reserves \nare all volunteers and exemplify the very essence of what it means to \nbe a patriot. We believe that what they are doing in Iraq and \nAfghanistan today differs from military expeditionary activities such \nas peacekeeping operations or no-fly zone enforcement.\n  They continue to serve, even though they do not know when they will \nreturn home to family and friends. They continue to serve despite the \nconstant threat to their lives and the tremendous hardships they face.\n  There is a difference between an Expeditionary Medal and a Campaign \nmedal. We only need to look at an excerpt from U.S. Army Qualifications \nfor the Armed Forces Expeditionary medal and Kosovo Campaign medal. In \norder to receive the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, you don't need \nto go to war. You only need to be ``placed in such a position that in \nthe opinion of the Joint Chief of Staff, hostile action by foreign \narmed forces was imminent even though it does not materialize.''\n  To earn the Kosovo Campaign medal, the standard is higher. A military \nmember must:\n\n       Be engaged in actual combat, or duty that is equally \n     hazardous as combat duty, during the Operation with armed \n     opposition, regardless of time in the Area of Engagement. Or \n     while participating in the Operation, regardless of time, \n     [the service member] is wounded or injured and required \n     medical evacuation from the Area of Engagement.\n\n  Many within the military agree that there is a difference. According \nto the Army Times, ``Campaign medals help establish an immediate \nrapport with individuals checking into a unit.'' An expeditionary medal \nlike the GWOT does not necessarily denote combat. A campaign medal is \ndesigned to recognize military personnel who have risked their lives in \ncombat.\n  Campaign medals matter.\n\n       ``When a Marine shows up at a new duty station, commanders \n     look first at his decorations and his physical fitness \n     score--the first to see where he's been, the second to see if \n     he can hang. They show what you've done and how serious you \n     are,'' said Gunnery Sgt. James Cuneo. ``If you're a good \n     Marine, people are going to award you when it comes time. . . \n     .''\n\n  My fellow colleagues, it is time.\n  We must recognize the sacrifice of our young men and women who \nliberated Iraq, including great Americans like Army Specialist Joseph \nHudson from Alamogordo, NM, who was held as a prisoner of war. The \nNation was captivated as we watched Specialist Hudson being \ninterrogated by the enemy.\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\nAsked to divulge his military occupation, Specialist Hudson stared \ndefiantly into the camera and said, ``I follow orders.'' Those of \nus with sons and daughters were united in worry with Specialist \nHudson's family. The entire nation rejoiced when he was liberated.\n\n  We have also asked much from our Reserve and National Guard forces. \nThe reconstruction of Iraq would not be possible without the commitment \nand sacrifice of the 170,000 Guard and Reservists currently on active \nduty.\n  My colleagues, Senators Lott, Landrieu, Inhofe, Lugar, and I are \ncommitted to honoring our over 200,000 heroes who liberated Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We believe that current administration policy does a \ndisservice to our fighting men and women. Therefore we propose, in \naddition to the GWOT medal, new decorations that characterize the real \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan, two that are distinctive and honor \ntheir sacrifice, the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation medals.\n  What we do today is not without precedent; Congress has been \nresponsible for recognizing the sacrifice and courage of our military \nforces throughout history. Congress has had a significant and \nhistorically central role in authorizing military decoration. Our \nNation's highest military decorations were authorized by Congress, \nincluding: the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Air Force Cross, the \nNavy Cross, the Army's Distinctive Service Cross, the Silver Star, and \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  We have also authorized campaign and liberation medals similar to \nwhat we hope to accomplish with this legislation. A partial list \nincludes the Spanish War Service Medal, the Army Occupation of Germany \nMedal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Berlin Airlift Medal, the \nKorean Service Medal and the Prisoner of War Medal.\n  The list goes on and on. The great men an women of our military \nforces are doing their jobs every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is \ntime to do our job and honor them with an award that truly stands for \ntheir heroic service, the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3347-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3347-S3359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on the war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from Active Duty, from the National Guard, \nand from the Reserves, are all volunteers. They exemplify the very \nessence of what it means to be patriotic.\n  It is extremely important that we take action. Many in this body will \nremember that we proposed to do this last year as we were considering \nthe Defense authorization bill. Our effort was not successful, although \nmany Senators voted to go ahead with this legislative provision. The \nadministration was not in favor, and the amendment failed.\n  I am glad we are able to reintroduce it this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with us to find an \nappropriate time when we can bring it up for a vote, or we can add it \nas an amendment to one of the bills that will be working its way \nthrough the Senate later this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak on the welfare reform bill.\n  This has been an extraordinarily successful initiative which we began \na few years ago. Its success is tied with the fact that States have \nbeen given a great deal more flexibility in the area of how they handle \ntheir welfare account. The fact is, we have set up as a purpose, as a \ngovernment, that people who are on welfare will be given the \nopportunity, the skills, and the incentives to move off of welfare and \nmove into a work environment, which is something that gives them \npersonal credibility and personal self-respect, and at the same time \nassists us in reducing the public welfare rolls. It has been a huge and \noverwhelming success.\n  One of the elements of moving off of welfare, of course, is the need \nof parents to have transitional support, especially single mothers as \nthey go into the workforce while dealing with their children during the \ntime they are working; in other words, some sort of childcare \nassistance.\n  As part of this bill, we intend to offer an amendment for \nreauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant Program, \ncalled the Caring for Children Act of 2003.\n  This amendment came out of the committee which I chair, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee, unanimously. It came out with \nbipartisan support, obviously.\n  It is an attempt to update our childcare block grant initiative and \nmake it more meaningful for the issues of today. It also gives the \ndollars it needs to be effective.\n  The bill will not only stress increased spending, it has $1 billion \nof new funding from the discretionary accounts.\n  Earlier today, there was a vote on an initiative to add $6 billion \nover 5 years to the childcare development grant. That money would be \nmandatory, and it was not paid for; it was outside the budget. There \nwas a euphemistic attempt to pay for it--a superficial attempt--\nactually, what amounted to the ultimate shell game attempt as an offset \nwhich was cited and which has been used on, I believe, 17 different \noccasions as a claimed offset in this body.\n  The real effect of the bill was to go way outside the budget and add \na huge new tranche of dollars beyond the budget which would be fine had \nit been realistically offset. But it wasn't.\n  This bill has in it a true increase which is an appropriate increase \nof $1 billion over that period of the bill. That is a significant \ninfusion of new funds. Plus it addresses some of the concerns of the \nprogram, one of the concerns being as children are getting childcare \nthey should also be getting some sort of development in the capacity of \nlearning. Obviously, these are very young children. But they should \nhave a learning component in their childcare experience, something that \nwill put them in a position where they will be able to be at a level \nwhere their peers are--other young children who are receiving \nchildcare.\n  It has language in it which encourages the States to include a \nvoluntary guideline initiative in the area of prereading and language \nskills. The absolutely critical essence of learning is language skills \nand the ability to do phonics and identify letters and be able to get \nready for reading. This bill has in it that language.\n  It also has in it a commitment to low-income parents. At least 70 \npercent of these dollars has the flow-through stage, actually, to the \nparents--in many cases a single parent. So the parent is getting the \nbenefits. And we aren't simply siphoning it off into the bureaucracy, \nwhich often happens, regrettably, through administrative overhead but, \nrather, directing this money to the hands of the parents, especially \nthe low-income parent so the parent can use this to assist them in \ntransitioning off the welfare rolls by taking care of their children \nduring the workday.\n\n  It gives parents a significant amount of choice. They can use \ndifferent daycare types of facilities. Some which are faith-based are \nallowed to be used, or they can use it even if it is being provided by \nrelatives and neighbors. That is important.\n  Further, the bill addresses a need to make sure that States focus on \nimproving the quality of childcare. This is a very significant concern \nthat many of us have, which is that a lot of the childcare today is, \nunfortunately, not of a quality that gives the child the support \nservices they need or the academic assistance they might need in order \nto be brought up to speed with peers who are in different childcare \ndelivery systems.\n  It allows States to set aside a certain percentage of the money in \norder to assess quality and try to improve quality. This gives the \nStates more flexibility in this area, but it also gives them an impetus \nto go in the right direction.\n  It is, therefore, a bill which does a lot of good.\n  As I mentioned, it was reported out of our committee unanimously. It \nwill be, hopefully, added to the base bill either by a formal vote or \nas part of the managers' amendment.\n  But we have to get back to the fundamental quandary which confronts \nus today, which is that the base welfare reform bill that is pending \nbefore the Congress is being held up by the other side of the aisle.\n  This is becoming a pattern of obstruction which we have seen \nthroughout this session of the Congress, and it appears its intensity \nis actually increasing. Bills are coming to the floor\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nnow which are important pieces of legislation on which there is a \ngeneral consensus.\n  As I mentioned, this language reported out of our committee to \nstrengthen the block grants for childcare was reported unanimously. Yet \nthese bills are being stopped dead in their tracks by the insistence of \nthe other side of the aisle to put on these bills extraneous issues \nwhich are of a politically charged nature, the purpose of which is not \nto pass them but simply to generate a political vote which can be used \nin the coming election.\n  We all do that. We all set up the political votes. But they should \nnot be used as aggressively as they are today by the Democratic Party \nas a means of stopping legitimate legislation. The obstruction coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle is unconscionable.\n  Last week, for example, a bill which would have corrected the \nproblems which many of our manufacturers in this country are going to \nconfront, specifically a duty that is going to be assessed on their \ngoods sold overseas, a duty which could go up as high as 18 percent--\nand that duty was a function of the fact we lost a World Trade court \ndecision which allows this duty to go forward--that bill which would \nhave corrected that, put an end to the duty and thus allow \nmanufacturing jobs and service-oriented jobs in the United States to \ncontinue to expand and flourish, that bill was killed in this Senate \nbecause of extraneous issues which the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocratic Party, decided they wanted to bring forward. They would not \nallow the bill to go forward without those extraneous issues being \nvoted on.\n  The bill had absolute consensus. There was a belief, there is a \nbelief, there should be a belief, that American jobs should not be lost \nas a result of our tax laws being found illegal by a body which we \nsubscribe to, the World Trade Organization, and that we should correct \nthat problem, and we can correct it rather effectively, and that \ncorrection will save jobs in the United States. That will not happen \nnow because of the obstruction coming from the other side of the aisle. \nIt is one in a series of obstructions.\n  Now we see the exact same thing happen in the area of welfare reform. \nLiterally, in the last 5 years, there have been very few laws as \nsuccessful that this Congress has passed as welfare reform. It was so \nsuccessful--it was an idea put forward on this side of the aisle--once \nit passed and started to work, it was immediately adopted by the other \nside of the aisle as theirs.\n  President Clinton had the right to take credit; he was President when \nthe bill was passed. He was President and takes credit as one of the \nstrong elements of service of his Presidency. And I am glad he takes \ncredit.\n  Now when we try to reauthorize and improve it significantly through \nthe block grant proposal which we brought out of our bipartisan \ncommittee, now when we try to move the bill forward so we can continue \nwith the welfare reform experience of the last few years and make sure \nthat experience continues to allow people to move from public \nassistance to work and give people self-confidence, self-respect, and \nself-esteem as a result of attaining work, that bill has been stopped \nonce again by the Democratic membership of this body coming forward and \nsaying they want to cast a political vote on an unrelated issue.\n  It is these actions that one has to question the purpose. Why, when \nbills have been agreed to which will significantly improve the \nlifestyle of Americans, the number of jobs Americans have in the case \nof the tax bill which was just stopped last week, or the number of \npeople moving from welfare to work, which is getting good jobs and \nmoving out of a public assistance situation and getting self-respect, \nwhy are these bills being stopped for purely political purposes by the \nother side of the aisle bringing forward extraneous amendments.\n\n  It is an unconscionable action, in my opinion. It is regrettable that \nthe childcare block grant proposal, the reauthorization of which came \nout of our committee unanimously and which represents a significant \nimprovement, especially in this area of trying to get learning into the \nchildcare experience, trying to get quality in the childcare \nexperience, giving States more flexibility and putting more money into \nthe program in the context of a responsible budget bill, why that would \nbe stopped also is beyond me. It is not beyond me; it is fairly \nobvious. The purpose here is to make a political statement. It is a \npolitical statement, come heck or high water. It does not matter that \nthe making of the political statement will cost people jobs and make it \nharder to move from welfare to work, creating a poorer and a less well-\nfinanced childcare block grant program.\n  It is unfortunate. It is the politics of the day. I know the American \npeople do not focus too much on what we do in the Senate in the day-to-\nday regime. I hope the American people take the time to learn what has \ntranspired in this body in the last 6 to 8 months. The obstructionism \non the other side of the aisle has become the cause of the day, the \npurpose of every event. This obstructionism continues and grows as we \nmove closer to the election. The practical effect of this \nobstructionism coming from the other side of the aisle is that good \nthings which help working Americans keep jobs, move from welfare to \nwork, ensuring their kids have quality daycare, good things like that \nare being stopped as a result of this unrequited obstructionism coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Nevada Champions\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, \nand I will take a couple of minutes and exercise our privileges as \nSenators to brag a little bit about our State and the recent \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada basketball team and their \nrise to the Sweet 16.\n  The Nevada Wolf Pack brought a lot of pride to our State. It is not a \nschool known for basketball. Certainly, they had more football success \nin the years past. However, this year they surprised many in the \nNation. It was obviously a heart-breaking loss to Georgia Tech last \nweek. But Coach Trent Johnson, the whole Wolf Pack team and all the \npeople surrounded with the program deserve a lot of credit for the \nseason they put together. We expect big things from them in the future.\n  For a school such as the University of Nevada, a school that does not \nhave the reputation of the University of Connecticut or Duke, it is \nmore difficult to get the kind of players to go up to Reno to play \nbasketball. They have players from Virginia City, Elko, and some of the \nother small towns around Nevada.\n  Coach Johnson crafted a team providing a good lesson for all of us to \nlearn. If you can work together as a team, you can achieve true \ngreatness. That is what his team did this year. Earlier in the year \nthey beat the University of Kansas, beat them very soundly. Then \nthrough the March Madness, they made it all the way through the Sweet \n16.\n  It was funny to listen to the various announcers talk about our team \nand trash them, not even understanding how to pronounce ``Nevada.'' We \ndo not use their pronunciation. It was funny to listen to them saying \nthey did not have a chance; they did not know how to play basketball. \nCertainly the coach from the University of Nevada and the rest of the \nplayers proved them wrong.\n  I rise today to congratulate them on a great season and look forward \nto their success.\n  I also wish the Lady Rebels from the University of Nevada Las Vegas \nsuccess tonight. They are in the WNIT championship. We have a lot to be \nproud of in our State. I join my colleague, Senator Harry Reid, in \ncongratulating especially the Nevada Wolf Pack for what they have \nachieved. Hopefully, we will be able to talk about the championship the \nLady Rebels will achieve tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hope Senator Ensign and I are able to be on the same team \nworking here in the Senate as the University of Nevada at Reno was \nduring this basketball season. We strive to do that. They have set a \ngood example for us and for everyone.\n  We may be outnumbered in the State of Nevada. There may be a lot of \nStates with more people than we have, but Senator Ensign and I realize \nevery State only has two Senators. We believe as a result of that, of \nour working together, we can have the same\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nstrength and power some of the more populated States have. I have \nenjoyed and appreciated working as a team with Senator Ensign during \nhis tenure in the Senate.\n  I also today want to extend my congratulations to Coach Trent Johnson \nand the basketball team at the University of Nevada. We have in recent \nyears reached goals in our athletic programs at the University of \nNevada, but for Coach Ault and his football team, they have been good.\n  I remember going to Georgia Southern to watch UNR play them for the \nnational championship, in Division II. And though we lost that game, it \nwas a great thrill to reach that level, which was significant for the \nuniversity.\n\n  Since that time, the University of Nevada football has moved into \nDivision I. Basketball has always been Division I.\n  Now, many years ago, the Wolf Pack was known all over the country. It \nhad, at one time, three All-Americans on its football team. We had \nMarion Motley, who is now a member of the Football Hall of Fame, who \nplayed football at the University of Nevada, at Reno. And we had other \ngreat players, Dick Trachok, Tommy Kaminer, and many others, but that \nis many years ago.\n  So what Senator Ensign said about the Wolf Pack Basketball Team is \nsignificant. They had not been to an NCAA tournament for 19 years. They \nhad never, in the history of the school, won an NCAA game.\n  This year they were forecast, by all the prognosticators, to continue \nthat ``never to win a game.'' The first team they played was the great \nMichigan State. They beat Michigan State. Then the prognosticators \nsaid: Well, that was a fluke. There is no way in the world they will \nbeat the highest ranked Gonzaga team. Gonzaga, all year, had lost one \ngame. That game was not close. UNR moved through there very quickly.\n  Then they moved on to the Sweet Sixteen. They played Georgia Tech. \nThey led Georgia Tech at half time, and it was really an exciting game. \nThey lost. But other than my being disappointed because they did not go \nto the Final Four, I join my colleague in expressing my congratulations \nto this great basketball team.\n  We have focused so much attention, in years past, with the UNLV \nbasketball team, the Runnin' Rebels, that has overshadowed the \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada, at Reno. But that will no \nlonger ever be said as a result of the great accomplishment made by \nthis team.\n  I want to say something about the importance of coaching. Trent \nJohnson came from Stanford. He was an assistant coach over there. He \ncame 5 years ago. He accepted the challenge of being a head coach of a \nDivision I school. But, frankly, the record that he was given was \npretty dismal. The year that he took over, he looked back to see that \nthe prior year they had won 8 games and lost 18. This year they won 24 \ngames. That is the turnaround.\n  As Senator Ensign mentioned, they beat Kansas, which was ranked No. 1 \nat the time. Early in the year, people knew they would be pretty good \nbecause they almost beat Connecticut, which, at that time, was also \nranked No. 1.\n  Few people thought they could make the strides that they did except \ntheir coach, Trent Johnson. He is an outstanding coach. It is my \nunderstanding and my hope that the people in Reno have done everything \nthey can to make him happy. He is a great coach, and this record of his \nwill only continue.\n  I want to reflect a little bit on this team. It was led by the player \nof the year in the Western Athletic Conference, a man by the name of \nKirk Snyder. He is a junior. If he wants to go pro, he will be drafted \nin the first round.\n  During the times I have watched him during the games this year, and \nlistened to the games, the sportscasters always focused on this man who \nwas so good.\n  They also had a point guard by the name of Todd Okeson, someone who \nis a senior, and was the sparkplug of that team. He was the point \nguard, but he also scored very well.\n\n  There were other fine players on that team. They may not have scored \nover 20 points a game as did Kirk Snyder, but they did many other good \nthings. Gary Hill-Thomas was a great defender. Kevin Pinkney was one of \nthe great rebounders. And then there was a young man by the name of \nNick Fazekas, who is almost 7 feet tall, a freshman, and has a soft \ntouch. He stepped in at very crucial times during the tournament and \nmade key baskets, and came to the free throw line and always came \nthrough.\n  But we also had players from Nevada. They are not all out-of-Staters. \nFor example, Sean Paul, the ``Elko Enforcer,'' comes from the town of \nElko in northeastern Nevada. And there were other players: Jermaine \nWashington and Marcelus Kemp.\n  These players have made Coach Johnson proud. I am confident that is \none reason Coach Johnson is going to stay at the University of Nevada, \nat Reno. We want him, and I certainly hope he stays. I am confident \nthat he will.\n  All these players, and especially the coach, have made Nevadans \nproud.\n  Sometimes when a team loses in a tournament, people say: ``Wait until \nnext year.'' But I think everyone in Nevada is going to dwell on the \nfact that this team did well, and we are going to savor this remarkable \nseason by UNR, and not dwell on next year.\n  Senator Ensign mentioned, and I also want to mention, that we also \nhave a great coach at UNLV. She coaches the UNLV Runnin' Rebels. The \nLady Rebels are very good. They came within one point of going to the \nNCAA tournament. They are now in the National Invitation Tournament, \nand they are in the finals. They are going to play Creighton tonight \nfor the National Invitation Championship. They have done great.\n  I love to watch the Lady Rebels. I have gone and met with these young \nwomen and have spoken with the coach. So I congratulate Coach Miller \nand her Lady Rebels for the great notoriety they have focused on the \nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas this year and wish them well in their \ntournament game tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2945\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \npending amendment offered by the Senators from California and \nMassachusetts; namely, the minimum wage amendment. I would like to \npoint out the effect of the current minimum wage on people today, and \nparticularly as to where they are with respect to poverty in America.\n  Let me refer to this chart. This chart represents the relationship \nbetween the minimum wage and the poverty line for a family of two, \nbeginning in the year 1988, and up through the year 2002.\n  From this chart you can see, quite visibly, frankly--with the minimum \nwage represented in green and the poverty line being the line just \nbelow the blue--that as the minimum wage increased in 1989, and in a \nstep sort of function up to 1998, that for a person who had a job, with \na family of two--let's say a single mom had a full-time job but made \nthe minimum wage--they were still below the Federal poverty level, \nuntil about 1998, and then they could just barely surpass the poverty \nlevel.\n  I point this out because it does not seem right that a person who has \na full-time job at a minimum wage still lives in poverty.\n  Now, that is bad enough. But let me show you how much worse it gets. \nThis next chart shows the relationship between the minimum wage and \npoverty for a family of three: let's say a mom and dad and a child. By \nthis chart one can tell very easily that the gap between the poverty \nline and the minimum wage is much greater for a family of three than it \neven is for a family of two. In fact, if I have my numbers correct, the \namount is about $3,681. That is the gap.\n  I point out, again, for a family of three, with one breadwinner--say \nwith a father who is at the minimum wage--that family of three will \nfind itself, on average, over a year's time, about $3,600 of income \nless than the Federal poverty level. That family is living in poverty \neven though the breadwinner of that family is working full time.\n  And it gets worse, as you might expect.\n  Let's take a family of four, say a father and a mother, and two \nchildren. Say one parent is working full time at a minimum wage job. \nBecause the increase in the minimum wage has been\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nso slow, the gap between what that family earns and the Federal poverty \nlevel is even greater.\n  In fact, it is about twice as much, which means that a family of four \nwith one wage earner at the minimum wage is earning about half of what \nthe Federal poverty level is. I don't think that is right. I frankly \ndon't understand why some people do not want a significant increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Let me tell you a personal story. Personal stories sometimes are out \nof context, but it meant a lot to me. One year I was walking across my \nState in Montana campaigning. To be honest, I learned an awful lot just \nby talking to people who I just happened to meet walking down the roads \nand highways and visiting in people's homes. A lot of it had to do with \nwelfare. I remember talking to many people on welfare who told me they \ndid not want to be on welfare. They hated it. They wanted to be off \nwelfare.\n  One of the main factors they mentioned to me as to why it is so \ndifficult to get off of welfare is because of the minimum wage laws. \nThey are working maybe at McDonald's or someplace else in a minimum \nwage job, but because the minimum wage rates were so low, they couldn't \nmake ends meet.\n  It is hard to know when to believe people. It is hard to know when to \nthink what people say is right or not, but you have to read between the \nlines. You have to get a sense of what is going on. It was very clear \nto me that these people were speaking the truth, certainly as they \nperceived it. If there were a significant increase in their wages, they \ncould then get off of welfare.\n  It is tied to the earlier debate on childcare. I ran into a lot of \nwomen, single moms who said the same thing to me. They were really \nearnest. I wish you could have seen the expressions on their faces \nsaying that they wanted to stay off of welfare.\n  One young single mom explained to me that she slept on her mother's \nsofa so she could avoid having to pay for a room someplace. She had a \nminimum wage job. Her childcare expenses were so high she could not \nhandle it anymore and she had to go back on to welfare. She hated it.\n  In those few instances, people I talked to just by happenstance--\nchance encounters--that is what they have said to me.\n  We have to make judgments sometimes. One of the judgments I have made \nis that our current minimum wage is too low. For a civilized country, \nthe United States of America, we can do a heck of a lot better.\n  Sometimes you hear business people say it will increase their cost of \nbusiness. It probably will slightly. But if everybody is getting paid \nmore, more dollars flow into the economy. People are more likely to not \nbe on welfare, and they are more likely to have a little more self-\nesteem. They are more likely to be able to advance themselves. Most \npeople want to advance themselves. They want a better life for their \nfamilies and their kids. Some just find themselves caught in difficult \nsituations.\n  I hope people will look at these charts and see how dramatic the \ndifference is between the minimum wage income on the one hand and the \nFederal poverty level on the other. The income of someone on the \nminimum wage is much below the Federal poverty level. It does not seem \nright that a person working full time, whether he or she has one child, \nor is married, or whether he or she has three in the family or four, \nshould live so far below the Federal poverty level. That is not right. \nIf they are going to work full time, they should be able to live \noutside of poverty.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, after watching the harsh acrimony \ngenerated by the September 11 Commission--which, let me say at the \noutset, is made up of good and able members--I have come to seriously \nquestion this panel's usefulness. I believe it will ultimately play a \nrole in doing great harm to this country, for its unintended \nconsequences, I fear, will be to energize our enemies and demoralize \nour troops.\n  After being drowned in a tidal wave of all who didn't do enough \nbefore 9/11, I have come to believe that the Commission should issue a \nreport that says: No one did enough. In the past, no one did near \nenough. And then thank everybody for serving, send them home, and let's \nget on with the job of protecting this country in the future.\n  Tragically, these hearings have proved to be a very divisive \ndiversion for this country. Tragically, they have devoured valuable \ntime looking backward instead of looking forward. Can you imagine \nhandling the attack on Pearl Harbor this way? Can you imagine Congress, \nthe media, and the public standing for this kind of political \ngamesmanship and finger-pointing after that day of infamy in 1941?\n  Some partisans tried that ploy, but they were soon quieted by the \npatriots who understood how important it was to get on with the war and \ntake the battle to America's enemies and not dwell on what FDR knew, \nwhen. You see, back then the highest priority was to win a war, not to \nwin an election. That is what made them the greatest generation.\n  I realize that many well-meaning Americans see the hearings as \ndemocracy in action. Years ago when I was teaching political science, I \nprobably would have had my class watching it live on television and \nusing that very same phrase with them.\n  There are also the not-so-well-meaning political operatives who see \nthese hearings as an opportunity to score cheap points. And then there \nare the media meddlers who see this as great theater that can be played \nout on the evening news and on endless talk shows for a week or more.\n  Congressional hearings have long been one of Washington's most \nentertaining pastimes. Joe McCarthy, Watergate, Iran-Contra--they all \nkept us glued to the TV and made for conversations around the water \ncoolers or arguments over a beer at the corner pub.\n  A congressional hearing in Washington, DC is the ultimate aphrodisiac \nfor political groupies and partisan punks. But it is not the groupies, \npunks, and television-sotted American public that I am worried about. \nThis latter crowd can get excited and divided over just about anything, \nwhether it is some off-key wannabe dreaming of being the American idol, \nor what brainless bimbo ``The Bachelor'' or ``Average Joe'' will \nchoose, or who Donald Trump will fire next week. No, it is the real \nenemies of America that I am concerned about. These evil killers who \nright now are gleefully watching the shrill partisan finger-pointing of \nthese hearings and grinning like a mule eating briars.\n  They see this as a major split within the great Satan, America. They \nsee anger. They see division, instability, bickering, peevishness, and \ndissension. They see the President of the United States hammered \nunmercifully. They see all this, and they are greatly encouraged.\n  We should not be doing anything to encourage our enemies in this \nbattle between good and evil. Yet these hearings, in my opinion, are \ndoing just that. We are playing with fire. We are playing directly into \nthe hands of our enemy by allowing these hearings to become the great \ndivider they have become.\n  Dick Clarke's book and its release coinciding with these hearings \nhave done this country a tremendous disservice and some day we will \nreap its whirlwind.\n  Long ago, Sir Walter Scott observed that revenge is ``the sweetest \nmorsel that ever was cooked in hell.''\n  The vindictive Clarke has now had his revenge, but what kind of hell \nhas he, his CBS publisher, and his axe-to-grind advocates unleashed?\n  These hearings, coming on the heels of the election the terrorists \ninfluenced in Spain, bolster and energize our evil enemies as they have \nnot been energized since 9/11.\n  Chances are very good that these evil enemies of America will attempt \nto influence our 2004 election in a similar dramatic way as they did \nSpain's. And to think that could never be in this country is to stick \nyour head in the sand.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n  That is why the sooner we stop this endless bickering over the past \nand join together to prepare for the future, the better off this \ncountry will be. There are some things--whether this city believes it \nor not--that are just more important than political campaigns.\n  The recent past is so ripe for political second-guessing, ``gotcha,'' \nand Monday morning quarterbacking. And it is so tempting in an election \nyear. We should not allow ourselves to indulge that temptation. We \nshould put our country first.\n  Every administration, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, bears some \nof the blame. Dick Clarke bears a big heap of it, because it was he who \nwas in the catbird's seat to do something about it for more than a \ndecade. Tragically, it was the decade in which we did the least.\n  We did nothing after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in \n1993, killing six and injuring more than a thousand Americans.\n  We did nothing in 1996 when 16 U.S. servicemen were killed in the \nbombing of the Khobar Towers.\n  When our embassies were attacked in 1998, killing 263 people, our \nonly response was to fire a few missiles on an empty tent.\n  Is it any wonder that after that decade of weak-willed responses to \nthat murderous terror, our enemies thought we would never fight back?\n  In the 1990s is when Dick Clarke should have resigned. In the 1990s \nis when he should have apologized. That is when he should have written \nhis book--that is, if he really had America's best interests at heart.\n  Now, I know some will say we owe it to the families to get more \ninformation about what happened in the past, and I can understand that. \nBut no amount of finger-pointing will bring our victims back.\n  So now we owe it to the future families and all of America now in \njeopardy not to encourage more terrorists, resulting in even more \ngrieving families--perhaps many times over the ones of 9/11.\n  It is obvious to me that this country is rapidly dividing itself into \ntwo camps--the wimps and the warriors: the ones who want to argue and \nassess and appease, and the ones who want to carry this fight to our \nenemies and kill them before they kill us. In case you have not figured \nit out, I proudly belong to the latter.\n  This is a time like no other time in the history of this country. \nThis country is being crippled with petty partisan politics of the \nworst possible kind. In time of war, it is not just unpatriotic; it is \nstupid; it is criminal.\n  So I pray that all this time, all this energy, all this talk, and all \nof the attention could be focused on the future instead of the past.\n\n  I pray we would stop pointing fingers and assigning blame and \nwringing our hands about what happened on that day David AcUology has \ncalled ``the worst day in all our history'' more than 2 years ago, and \ninstead, pour all our energy into how we can kill these terrorists \nbefore they kill us--again.\n  Make no mistake about it: They are watching these hearings and they \nare scheming and smiling about the distraction and the divisiveness \nthat they see in America. And while they might not know who said it \nyears ago in America, they know instinctively that a house divided \ncannot stand.\n  There is one other group that we should remember is listening to all \nof this--our troops.\n  I was in Iraq in January. One day, when I was meeting with the 1st \nArmored Division, a unit with a proud history, known as Old Ironsides, \nwe were discussing troop morale, and the commanding general said it was \ntop notch.\n  I turned to the division's sergeant major, the top enlisted man in \nthe division, a big, burly 6-foot-3, 240 pound African American, and I \nsaid: ``That's good, but how do you sustain that kind of morale?''\n  Without hesitation, he narrowed his eyes, and he looked at me and \nsaid: ``The morale will stay high just as long as these troops know the \npeople back home support us.''\n  Just as long as the people back home support us. What kind of message \nare these hearings and the outrageously political speeches on the floor \nof the Senate yesterday sending to the marvelous young Americans in the \nuniform of our country?\n  I say: Unite America before it is too late. Put aside these petty \npartisan differences when it comes to the protection of our people. \nArgue and argue and argue, debate and debate and debate over all the \nother things, such as jobs, education, the deficit, and the \nenvironment; but please, please do not use the lives of Americans and \nthe security of this country as a cheap-shot political talking point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \noutstanding comments. There is a war going on and he made some \noutstanding points. I have heard several of his speeches and learned a \nlot from each of them.\n  I am going to speak now on, I believe, the pending amendment, the \nBoxer-Kennedy amendment. I will share my thoughts about raising the \nFederal minimum wage. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep \ntalking about the loss of American jobs, but their actions don't match \nup to their words.\n  If my colleagues are so concerned about unemployment, why would they \ndo something that would eliminate jobs in this country? If my \ncolleagues are so concerned about helping poor families, why would they \ndo something that hurts poor families the most? Their effort to \nincrease the minimum wage, while attacking the President on job \ncreation, is not based on sound policy and economics.\n  There is an effort underway to put a smokescreen of unrelated \namendments that mask election year politics in misleading rhetoric. It \nis being done on the reauthorization of the welfare bill.\n  It is time for us to look beyond the smokescreen and see who is \nreally helped and who is really hurt by Senator Kennedy's amendment to \nraise the Federal minimum wage.\n  Every student who has taken an economics course knows if you increase \nthe price of something--in this case, the minimum wage job--you \ndecrease the demand for those jobs. A survey of members of the American \nEconomic Association revealed that 77 percent of economists believe \nthat a minimum wage hike causes job loss.\n  For small businesses, where most of the job creation in this country \nis generated, a minimum wage increase is particularly harmful. Having \nowned a small business in Wyoming, I can speak from personal experience \nabout how detrimental a minimum wage increase would be for small \nbusinesses and job growth.\n  I need to explain something. Very few people in the shoe business I \nwas in were working at the minimum wage, which my wife and I preferred \nto call the level of minimum skills. Those are the people who first \ncame in and did not have any capability in the kind of job they were \ngoing to be doing and we had a starting wage, a starting skills wage. \nAnybody who was in that wage more than 3 months was not paying \nattention, and that is the way with most of the businesses in this \ncountry.\n  The minimum wage is the minimum skills wage, and it is the starting \nwage. It does have an effect on other wages as well. When we raise the \nminimum wage, then to keep the proper spread between employees of \ndifferent skills, other jobs get raises, too. Of course, when that \nhappens, there has to be a way to pay for it, and the way to pay for \nthat almost always comes from raising prices. If you raise prices and \nwages, there is not much gain.\n  How do I explain to my constituents, most of whom rely on small \nbusiness for their livelihood, that Congress wants to do something that \nwould foster job loss instead of job creation?\n  Every day I read letters to the editors of the Wyoming newspapers. \nOne appeared in the Casper Star from one of my constituents about his \nconcerns in September 2002. I came across this letter again. It was \nwritten by Imo Harned of Douglas, WY, about the effects of a minimum \nwage increase. It is a reminder about the true cost of minimum wage \nincreases.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       That's Like no Help at All\n\n       Editor: I first became interested in the effects of raising \n     minimum wage in the 1960s.\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n     An employer I knew fired three men he'd employed as watchmen. \n     He remarked that it was worth something to have warm bodies \n     around, but not at 75 cents an hour. Since then I have made \n     it a habit from time to time to ask an employer if raising \n     minimum wage makes a difference to his business. No matter if \n     he pays one person or dozens, the answer is always the same. \n     ``There are X number of dollars in the budget and I can't \n     exceed that amount. If it means cutting hours or firing \n     workers, I have to do it to stay within the budget.'' \n     Personal observations show that within a week of a raise in \n     minimum wage, groceries will raise enough to absorb the \n     increase. Also, people who make more than minimum have to pay \n     the increased costs too, so it amounts to a cut in pay for \n     those who make more.\n       Several years ago the Wall Street Journal did a study \n     showing that living standards have remained unchanged for \n     people earning minimum wage since that wage was 50 cents an \n     hour! The only difference was that those poor people were in \n     a higher tax bracket and had to pay more taxes.\n       A person who begins working at minimum wage, who works hard \n     and earns an increase in pay should not be penalized by being \n     returned to the beginning again. Neither should anyone be \n     penalized by having to pay the increased food and utilities \n     that follow every time the minimum wage is increased.\n                                              Imo Harned, Douglas.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have listened to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who support a minimum wage increase. I have \nseen their charts and heard their arguments. However, none of their \ncharts or arguments can refute the commonsense and real world \nobservation of Imo Harned from Douglas, WY.\n  Mr. Harned writes--I am quoting part of it and the whole letter is \nprinted in the Record. I am sure my colleagues will want to read it:\n\n     . . . I have made it a habit from time to time to ask an \n     employer if raising minimum wage makes a difference to his \n     business. No matter if he pays one person or dozens, the \n     answer is always the same: ``There are X number of dollars in \n     the budget and I can't exceed that amount. If it means \n     cutting hours or firing workers, I have to do it to stay \n     within the budget.'' Personal observations show that within a \n     week of a raise in minimum wage, groceries will raise enough \n     to absorb the increase. Also, people who make more than \n     minimum have to pay the increased costs, too, so it amounts \n     to a cut in pay for those who make more.\n\n  Mr. Harned saw through the phony economics of a minimum wage \nincrease. He reached the same conclusion as two Stanford economists: A \nminimum wage increase is paid for by higher prices that hurt poor \nfamilies the most. Some argue that we need to increase the minimum wage \nto help poor families. However, the 2001 study conducted by Stanford \nUniversity economists found that only one in four of the poorest 20 \npercent of families would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. \nThree in four of the poorest workers would be hurt by a wage hike \nbecause they would shoulder the costs of resulting higher prices. A \nFederal wage hike will hurt the very people the underlying welfare \nreauthorization bill is designed to help: America's poor families.\n  I have held on to Mr. Harned's letter as a reminder of the dangers of \na ``Washington knows best'' and a ``one size fits all'' mentality. An \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage is a classic lesson that \nWashington does not know best and one size does not fit all.\n  A Federal wage mandate does not account for the cost of living that \nvaries across the country. It costs over twice as much to live in New \nYork City than in Cheyenne, WY. However, a Federal minimum wage hike \nthat applies coast to coast is like saying a bag of groceries in New \nYork City must cost the same as a bag of groceries in Cheyenne. Local \nlabor market conditions and the cost of living determines pay rates, \nnot Federal minimum wage laws dictated from Washington.\n  I support an increase for all wages, but that increase should be \nfueled by a strong, free market economy, not by an artificial Federal \nmandate that hurts business and workers alike. Artificial wage hikes \ndrive prices up. We should not trick workers into thinking they are \nearning more when they still cannot pay the bills at the end of the \nmonth. We should not trick the American people into believing that the \nphony economics of a minimum wage increase will improve the standard of \nliving in this country. Nor should we trick the American people into \nbelieving that a minimum wage increase is without cost.\n  The smoke and mirrors of a minimum wage increase is not the way for \nAmerican workers to find and keep well-paying jobs. We have to \nencourage, not discourage, job creation, and we have to equip our \nworkers with the skills needed to compete in the new global economy.\n\n  It is one of my goals to make sure that the unfilled higher paying \njobs can be filled by Americans. I talked about the minimum wage being \na minimum skills wage. There are higher paying jobs out there, but you \nhave to have the skills for them. How do you get the skills for them? \nWe have a bill. It is called the Workforce Investment Act. It \nreauthorizes the Nation's job training and employment system, and it \nupdates it to the modern jobs. It allows people to be working in the \nareas of highest need in this country, instead of forcing those jobs \noverseas.\n  That bill passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee unanimously. We passed it on the Senate floor by unanimous \nconsent last November. That means nobody wanted to amend it and nobody \nobjected to what was in the bill. That is as bipartisan as you can get.\n  Where is that bill now? It is languishing around here because the \nminority party will not let us get a conference committee appointed to \nresolve the differences with the House, the final step for the bill. \nThe House has passed a bill. It is a little different from the Senate \nbill. But we need to meet and work out the differences and get that \nfinal bill.\n  What does this mean in the way of jobs? Training for 900,000 jobs a \nyear. That is pretty significant, training for 900,000 jobs a year. I \nkind of get the feeling we do not want to resolve that until after \nNovember so that it can be a part of the politics of the Presidency. \nThat is wrong. It ought to be worked out now. We ought to have a \nconference committee. We ought to get it done. If we want to take care \nof jobs in this country, if we want people to be making more and to be \nmaking more real money, we ought to get them trained into the skilled \npositions in the jobs that are vacant in this country right now before \nwe ship them over to another country. We need to have a conference \ncommittee. That would provide jobs. That will provide increased wages. \nThat will provide real increased wages, not just inflationary wages \nthat will drive up the price of all of the goods and absorb, as Mr. \nHarned said, in 1 week the amount of the raise.\n  I owe Mr. Harned and all my constituents sound policy, not election \nyear rhetoric. I owe it to Mr. Harned and all of my constituents to \nremove the smokescreen around the minimum wage debate and expose its \ntrue cost.\n  The Boxer-Kennedy amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage ignores \nthe true cost of a minimum wage increase on America's workers and \nbusinessmen.\n  I hope we can put this debate, which is unrelated to the underlying \nbill, behind us. I hope we can move beyond election year theatrics and \nget to the real work of helping America's low-income families.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boxer-Kennedy amendment and to \nread the letter of Mr. Harned in full.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa \ngiving me the opportunity to sit in this august chair he so ably \noccupies on more than just a few occasions on the Senate floor where we \nseem to have Finance Committee bills on a pretty frequent basis. He \nworks diligently. He has been called away to do some other things so I \nam going to take this opportunity to speak, as we are stuck on an \namendment that is nongermane to this bill, and which was offered with \nthe full knowledge that this would severely jeopardize this bill being \nmoved to passage.\n  Earlier today we had a good debate on daycare funding. We passed an \namendment that added $6 billion more in daycare funding to this bill. \nCurrent funding for the Child Care and Development Fund is $4.8 \nbillion. The committee added $1 billion more. Why did we add this \nincrease in funding? Because in the bill we increased the work \nrequirement by 20 percent.\n  Now I would make the argument we did not actually increase it by 20 \npercent because we give partial credit to the States, so it is probably \nnot a 20-\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\npercent increase. At most, we increase the work requirement in this \nbill by 20 percent. So we also increased the daycare funding.\n  Candidly, there is probably not even that much of a direct \ncorrelation. It is probably not even going to be required to have 20 \npercent more to meet this work requirement, but we did it, anyway.\n  The HELP Committee comes forward with a proposal that is $2.3 billion \nmore in childcare that will be in this bill, and then today we add $6 \nbillion more. That is a 100-percent increase in daycare funding for a \n20-percent increase in work requirements. I am starting to rethink the \nwork requirements at the rate this is costing us.\n  In addition, there is almost $1.5 billion in money the States now \nhold that can only be used for cash assistance. When we passed the 1996 \nwelfare bill, one of the concerns on the left was this money for cash \nassistance be used for cash assistance and it is not to be taken out \nand used for other purposes. So we have a pipeline which only funds \ncash assistance.\n  What we do in this bill is allow this $1.5 billion to be used for \ndaycare. So it is not a $1 billion increase on top of a $2.3 billion \nincrease on top of a $6 billion increase, but on top of a $1.5 billion \nincrease on top of that. This is how much money we now have in this \nbill for childcare. I oppose that. I think that is an extraordinary \nexpansion of a program that, while it has benefits and I certainly \nsupport it, and in the 1996 bill I supported the final compromise which \nadded $1 billion to the daycare funding to get this bill originally \nenacted, but this is excessive and unwarranted, and I would argue not \ngood policy for a variety of different reasons.\n  There is some good policy in this bill, and it is being blocked. I \nthink when the Senator from California offered this amendment, she \nunderstood what was going to happen if she offered this amendment, and \nthat was this bill would be shut down, as the last bill was because of \na blocking amendment on the JOBS bill to create more manufacturing \njobs.\n  What we would like to see done is a limitation of amendments. I would \nfrankly be happy to deal with all relevant amendments to this bill, no \nlimitation on any relevant amendments, but a limitation on political \namendments. Clearly, minimum wage is a political amendment that has \nbeen offered numerous times in the past, always seeming to wait until \nright before election. We never see minimum wage increases offered in \nodd-numbered years. I do not know if my colleagues noticed that, but it \nseems to be offered in even-numbered years. So we have even-numbered \nelection issues that are brought up by Senators Boxer and Kennedy, who \nsaid they would like to see this bill pass. They say they would like to \nsee this extended.\n\n  I tell my colleagues that the Senator from California in 1996 said: I \ncannot support legislation--she was referring to the 1996 welfare \nreform act--which will throw countless children into poverty. No one \nexpects us to solve the welfare problem by punishing children for being \npoor. That is what she said in 1996.\n  So did this bill punish children for being poor? Let us look at the \nblack child poverty rate. The highest rates of poverty in America are \namong black children, at least they have been. At the time Senator \nBoxer made that statement, the poverty rate among African-American \nchildren was 45 percent. She said this bill will punish children by \nthrowing them into poverty, will punish them because we are going to \nrequire their mothers to go to work, we are going to require and put \ntime limits on the amount of time people can spend on welfare because \nwe have an expectation that if one is able-bodied they can work, they \nshould work, and it is beneficial to them and their children if they do \nwork.\n  So we did a whole bunch of things to create not only a stick to get \npeople to work, but a lot of incentives or carrots to make work pay. We \ninvested a lot of money: Daycare, yes; transportation; EIC. We can go \non down the list. We put in a lot of incentives over the last several \nyears to make work pay.\n  What happened? We have the lowest rate of black child poverty ever in \nAmerica. Now, one might ask, well, did the other side learn a lesson? \nDid they understand that actually they were wrong? I know the Senator \nfrom California had a picture, and I know the Senator from Illinois at \nthe time, Ms. Moseley-Braun, had pictures of people in breadlines and \npeople sleeping on grates. Have we now admitted this concept of work \nand the concept of time limitations was, in fact, not a punishment but \nthe real punishment was locking people into dependency and poverty? \nThat is punishing. That is hopelessness.\n  What we provided in this bill was hope. Have they learned? Well, the \nproof is in the pudding. The Senator from California comes forward and \noffers an amendment, shuts down the bill. She will have ample \nopportunities over the next several weeks to offer an amendment on this \nissue.\n  By the way, there have been ample opportunities in the past 15 months \nto offer a minimum wage increase, and yet on a bill everybody is for, \nthat we want to reauthorize--they say they are not trying to block this \nbill--15 months go by in the session and we are going to offer an \namendment to try to sink this bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to offer germane \namendments, to withdraw this amendment, let's get to the substance of \nthis issue. This is an important battle to provide hope and opportunity \nfor the poor in our society, to bring dignity into the lives of \ncommunities that have been struggling to make ends meet.\n  Let's stick to this issue and get it done. Let's show the Senate can \nwork on important issues of the day.\n  One of the things I wanted to talk about--I had talked at length \nabout the general welfare bill and I had mentioned the issue briefly, \nbut I wanted to focus a little more attention on it, the issue the \nPresident proposed on marriage.\n  There has been a lot of debate about marriage in America over the \npast several months. What I am talking about here is the role of the \nGovernment to encourage and promote healthy marriages. The President \nhas a healthy and stable marriage initiative he has put forward.\n  Why do we want to do this? Do we want to force people into bad \nmarriages? Or bring out the shotgun again and get people to marry even \nthough they may not want to? No. That is not what this is about. No one \nis suggesting or has suggested we force anybody into marriage. But here \nis what we have done. The President, and many of us who have been \nworking on this issue for a long time, actually decided to look into \nthe benefits of marriage to children and to women and to men in \npoverty, and determine what and if there are any benefits. Should the \nGovernment be neutral on this issue? Should we stay out of it? Or are \nthere things we can look to that would encourage us to encourage \nmarriage?\n  Here are some of the benefits we have identified in looking at the \ndata. Children in married homes do better in school. They drop out \nless. They have fewer emotional and behavioral problems, less substance \nabuse, less abuse or neglect, including physical abuse, less criminal \nactivity, less early sexual activity, and fewer out-of-wedlock births.\n  If I said I had a drug that could accomplish all these things for \nchildren, we would prescribe it for every child in America. Yet when we \nsay we want to have a program in the welfare system where we are \ndealing with the poorest children in America who, in most cases, are in \nsome of the worst neighborhoods of America, in the roughest communities \nin America, who are living in many cases in very difficult family \nsituations--if we say we want to provide these benefits to them, you \nget the responses: Why do you want to force some rightwing religious \nagenda on us?\n  There are actually people who are opposed to the President's \nproposals, who are opposed to the President's proposals in the face of \nthe benefit to those who we hear a lot about here on the floor of the \nSenate, how we need more for children. We get a lot of proposals from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts that we can help children by increasing \nthe minimum wage while in fact he provides absolutely no evidence that \nis the case. In fact, when we had the discussion today, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said things were better in the 1960s and 1970s and \n1980s, when the minimum wage was high.\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\n  If you go back to the previous chart on black poverty, I will tell \nyou what else is high: Poverty among African-American children. So if \nthere were a connection between the rate of poverty and the minimum \nwage, you would think during this time, when the value of the minimum \nwage was actually going down, black poverty would be going up. Just the \nopposite is the case. Why? Because most people who earn the minimum \nwage aren't the heads of households so there is very little connection \nbetween increasing the minimum wage and poverty. Why? Because poverty \nisn't about a little bit more money.\n  You think: That makes no sense, Senator. Of course it is about more \nmoney.\n  No, it is not. It is about a lot of factors. People who are poor have \nlives that are just as complicated as those of people who are not. It \nis about the status of their mothers and fathers. It is about the \nfamily unit around them. It is about a whole host of issues that \ndetermines whether they will be raised in or out of poverty. To look at \none little factor that has no correlation with poverty is the kind of \nwrongheaded thinking we have suffered under for far too long in this \ninstitution.\n  But in 1996 we changed it. We went to a different model in welfare. \nNow we are trying to change it again. We know that work works. We also \nknow from the data families work.\n  If you look at child poverty, it dramatically increases outside of \nintact marriages. If you have an intact marriage, the percent of time \nin poverty for the average child is 7 percent, if that child's parents \nare married.\n  As we all know, upon divorce many women end up with the children. \nThat is the case certainly the vast majority of time. Many times they \nalso end up on welfare, they end up in poverty, as a result of \nseparation and divorce. That is the case for children born out of \nwedlock.\n  This represents children born within wedlock. Some stay, others get \ndivorced.\n  Here is the situation where children are born out of wedlock and the \nmother subsequently gets married. The child poverty rate is high, but \nnot as high as in the case where mom never gets married. In that case, \nthe percentage of time children spend in poverty is 51 percent of their \nchildhood, on average.\n  So we have a situation where we know marriage has a positive impact \non poverty. Again, we want to focus on poverty and the health of \nchildren. The Senator from Massachusetts spoke about the minimum wage \nand how important it was, and provided no evidence as to how minimum \nwage increases would help reduce poverty among children. Let's look at \nwhat happens, when marriage is involved, to poverty among children. \nMarried families are five times less likely to be in poverty than are \nsingle-parent families. Again, the poverty rate among those who are \nmarried: Among all, 13 percent; among single families, 35 percent of \nsingle-parent families in America are living in poverty.\n  Shouldn't we have a program that at least suggests when a mother has \na child and she is not married and the father is there in the hospital, \nthat we simply ask the question: Are you interested in being married? \nIf both say yes, refer them for counseling to a nonprofit in the \ncommunity, maybe a faith-based organization in the community, somebody \nwho is there to nurture that relationship at a very stressful time in \ntheir lives where, without the proper support and help--and in many \ncases in this situation you don't have a whole lot of family support, \nyou certainly don't have popular culture support for fathers nurturing \nand caring for their children--can't the Government at least suggest \nwhen someone expresses an intent to get married they be given a little \nhelp in working through that process, given the demonstrable benefits \nthat would accrue to them and to their children from an economic point \nof view?\n  But there is more than economics. Children living with two parents \nare 44 percent less likely to be physically abused; 47 percent less \nlikely to suffer physical neglect; 43 percent less likely to suffer \nemotional neglect; 55 percent less likely to suffer from some form of \nchild abuse than children living with a single parent.\n  There are people who will come here to the floor and say the \nGovernment should be neutral with respect to this. In spite of this \nrather strong statement in support of marriage being the optimal place, \na married household being the optimal place in which to raise a child, \nthey will say the Government has no business in this. Yet they will \ncome here and have the Government spend billions of dollars to get \nresults that are one-twentieth of what these results would be in the \nlife of a child.\n  We will spend billions here to reduce neglect by 2 percent, or 5 \npercent. That is OK if we spend billions. That is all right. But if we \ndo something as simple as to say, If you are interested in marriage, we \nwill refer you to counseling because we want to actually help you, if \nyou want to be married, to get married and to stay married, that is \nwrong. Spending billions of dollars on violence prevention programs, \nthat is OK. But the best violence prevention program for a child is a \nhealthy marriage. Spending any money on that, Well, wait, this is a \nright-wing religious attempt to influence people with a religious \nagenda. I think we all know from the debate that is going on that \nmarriage is not just a religious event. It is a civil event. It is a \npublic event. It is a State-sponsored event. It is one that is vitally \nimportant to the future of our society.\n  There is another piece of legislation Senator Bayh, Senator Domenici, \nand I have been working on for quite some time. I am hopeful this will \nnot be as controversial as marriage--that is, fathers should \nparticipate in their children's lives.\n  We actually are going to have some money in this bill that will \nencourage responsible fathers. It is called the Responsible Fatherhood \nInitiative which Senator Bayh of Indiana, Senator Domenici of New \nMexico, and I have been working on for several years. We are able to \nget some money in this bill to promote that.\n  Why? I guess it is obvious. Obviously, we would like to have children \nhave some presence of a father in their lives. We understand there is a \npotential benefit. We also understand there are a lot of fathers \nunfortunately who are not necessarily good fathers, who may not \nnecessarily be a good influence on children's lives. But there is money \nto help those fathers become a positive influence in their lives; to \ntake responsibility for not only providing for them economically, which \nall the previous welfare bills had never focused on--which is getting \nchild support--but actually try to support them in ways beyond the \npaycheck they happen to bring home that day.\n  Why? If you look again at the information we have been able to gather \nabout the difference between children being raised with fathers' \ninvolvement as opposed to fathers being absent, if you have a father \ninvolved in your life versus if you do not have a father involved in \nyour life--if you do not have a father involved, you are two times more \nlikely to abuse drugs and two times more likely to be abused. Why? \nUnfortunately, in far too many relationships, the boyfriend tends to be \nthe greatest abuser of the child who is not his own. You are two times \nmore likely to become involved in a crime, three times more likely to \nfail in school, three times more likely to take your own life, and five \ntimes more likely to live in poverty.\n  Again, if we had a program we were funding here in the Federal \nGovernment out of the Great Society program that could accomplish all \nthese things, we would be pouring billions in this baby. I mean, there \nwould be cries over here to say, if you have this program that can do \nall of this, then we are going to spend--you can't outbid us on this \nbecause we are going to go home and talk about how we are saving lives, \nreducing drug dependency, reducing abuse, reducing crime, improving \neducation, and solving the poverty problem.\n  But then you mention, Oh, by the way, this program has to do with \nfathers taking responsibility. No, wait a minute, we are not going to \ndo that. You are messing around with families here. No. If you have a \nGovernment program that we can hire somebody to fill that role, fine, \nbut we can't encourage fathers. Why would we want to do that? Who are \nwe to be judgmental about getting fathers involved with children's \nlives? That is not the role of the Government. What is the role of\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nGovernment to mess around with the family?\n  Because we know what works. Americans know what works. We have known \nit for 200-plus years. We know that stable families is the place which \nhas the greatest opportunity to produce stable young children and \nadults. Yet somehow we can't be on the side to save the family, we \ncan't be on the side of marriage and responsible fathers. At least we \nhaven't been in the past.\n  I am hopeful that we have an opportunity in this bill to come down on \nthe side of the family, to come down on the side of mothers and fathers \ntaking responsibility for their children from the very beginning. And \nthe Government should be there to simply ask and encourage and provide \nsupport if they want to, not to force anybody into anything.\n  We have an obligation if we know what works to do it. If we know what \nworks and we can have some positive impact on the lives of children, \nthen we have an obligation to do it. We are doing it here with a very \nsmall amount of money. The marriage proposal I think is $100 million \nFederal, $100 million matched by the States, and then a separate $100 \nmillion. It is $300 million. Excuse me. It is $100 million from Federal \nand $100 million from the States over 5 years, which is $1.5 billion. I \nargue that is a fairly modest sum of money for the tremendous benefit \nthat will accrue not just to the children, but which is going to accrue \nto fathers who will take responsibility for their children.\n  Imagine the change in neighborhoods. Imagine the change in \nneighborhoods where 70 percent of kids, 80 percent of kids are born out \nof wedlock, and within a year 90 to 95 percent of those kids have no \nfather involvement in their lives. Imagine the change in the \nneighborhood, which is permeated by single mothers and fathers who are \nattached to nothing except other irresponsible fathers--we call those \ngangs--or they are not attached to that neighborhood at all because \nthey are in jail. Imagine the neighborhoods with fathers in the homes. \nImagine the neighborhoods with role models of responsible manhood and \nfatherhood.\n  I have talked to so many people who grew up in neighborhoods with \nhigh concentrations of fatherlessness and how they were inspired by the \none or two fathers they knew who weren't their own, but the one or two \nmen in the community who were responsible fathers who gave them hope \nand who taught them responsibility. Imagine how we could change \nneighborhoods if we simply brought mothers and fathers back together in \nthose neighborhoods, and how that dynamic would change.\n  Dare we come down on that side? Dare we invest in trying to change \ntheir pathology that has attacked so many neighborhoods in our society? \nI say yes. I say we have an obligation to do that.\n  Let me get to the economics of this. Fatherhood involvement increases \nchild support. The States that, unfortunately as a result of the 1996 \nWofford law, are concerned about establishing paternity and getting the \nmoney, I say to the States, which will be the instrument by which these \nprograms will be implemented, they will have to play a part. They will \nhave to put up some money to do this.\n  I make the argument it is to their financial benefit to do it. Even \nthough it will cost some money for the programs, I make the argument to \nthe States that if you can get fathers involved in the lives of their \nchildren, you will not have to spend as much time chasing down fathers \nto provide child support, and in many cases not getting that child \nsupport, but you will have a better connection with your children which \nmeans a better life, and we will actually save the States some money.\n  I hate to make the economic arguments to the States, but those are \nthe facts. I am hopeful the States will understand this is not just \ngood for their neighborhood, this is not just good for men, it is not \njust good for women and for children, and for society at large, it is \nalso good for their bottom line and their ability to provide services \nto the poor.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. It is not perfect. There are \nthings in this bill I do not like. But we move the ball forward. We \nincrease work a modest amount, a responsible amount. As someone who was \nin this chair leading the fight in 1996 for this bill and wanting the \ntough requirements on work, I am not someone who believes we need to \ndramatically increase that requirement. I know there will be an \namendment potentially if we ever get to this bill to increase the work \nrequirement to 40 hours. I will vote against that. The reason is \nbecause we do in this bill increase the actual work requirement from 20 \nhours to 24.\n  What does that mean? That means the amount of hours someone must be \nin work in order to be eligible for this program, assuming they did not \nget off the program to work themselves, they are actually on welfare \nbut working, is increased from 20 to 24 hours. Then we have an \nadditional 10 hours that was in the 1996 act that stays the same, an \nadditional 10 hours to bring the total up to 34 hours. That 10 hours \nbeing sort of wraparound issues, whether it is job search or other \ntypes of improvement that individuals may be working on to get a better \njob, to increase their educational skills, get their GED, whatever the \ncase may be.\n  It is important to have a tougher work requirement to take single \nmothers out of the home for 40 hours a week, of which 16 of those hours \nwill not be actually working--I don't see the benefit. What we have \nseen from all the studies is the thing that works the most is work. \nWhile these women--it is predominantly, overwhelmingly women--are not \nin a job outside of welfare, not on a payroll outside of welfare, they \nstill are working and getting work experience.\n  The additional time is well spent to actually find a job outside of \nwelfare, but I don't think at least at that point in time, because of \nthe transition of a 40-hour requirement, that is going to be beneficial \nin the long term for these women. I will not support that.\n  I would have supported a modest increase in daycare funding. What we \nhave done is fundamentally change the expectation of what daycare is. \nThis is more money than people on welfare could ever hope to need when \nit comes to daycare. This is a whole other agenda trying to be advanced \non the bill in the name of welfare to work. But it is simply universal \ndaycare under a different guise. I will not support that.\n  But we have a lot of steps taken in the right direction in this bill. \nI am hopeful, again, we can get bipartisan cooperation from people who \nunderstand the importance of this legislation in getting it passed and \nputting those work requirements back on 28 States that right now do not \nhave them so we can begin the process again in turning lives around and \nimproving the quality of lives of children in the poorest neighborhoods \nin our society.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  HARRY BURK REID, MY 15TH GRANDCHILD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish the people I work with in the Senate \nknew my father. My father was named Harry Reid, the same name I have. I \nalways looked up to my dad. My dad was uneducated. He didn't graduate \nfrom eighth grade, but he was very smart. My father read a lot and he \ncould do things people in college could not do.\n  For example, he was a miner and he could go underground with a \ncompass, come above ground and do a map. People in college cannot do \nthat. He could do underground mapping. He was a carpenter. He could \ncompletely overhaul an engine, a valve job, the whole works. He was a \nblacksmith, hit tempered steel, all that kind of stuff. And he was a \nmuch bigger man than I. I always admired his physical strength. He \ncould put a 50-gallon drum full of water or gas, whatever, in the back \nof a truck by himself.\n\n  The reason I mention Harry Reid tonight, my father, is last night my \n15th grandchild was born, a little boy. As I said, I have 15 \ngrandchildren now. The reason I mention my father is because my son \ntold me, this morning, that they have named my grandson after me. So I \nhave a little grandson named Harry Reid.\n  I hope, as the years go by, that little boy will look at his \ngrandfather in the same way that I looked at my dad.\n  I am proud of the name Harry Reid. I even sign my ``H'' like my dad \ndid. My\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\ndad said once he saw on a window an ``H'' like that, like I sign my \nname. So that is the way children are in looking up to their parents \nand grandparents.\n  As I said, I hope I can set an example that my grandson will respect \nand admire. I know it is a burden, and I say this seriously, to have \nthe name Harry Reid, because I have a lot of people who like me, but I \nhave a lot of people who do not like me because of my political stands.\n  But separate and apart from all that, I hope my grandson will have an \nexample set by me that is one he will believe in--family and keeping \nfamilies together--and being a young man who conducts himself in a \nproper manner, and that, hopefully, some of the things I have done and \nwill do will be something he will look to as a role model that maybe he \nwill adhere to.\n  So I want the Record to reflect how much I appreciate my son Josh and \nhis lovely wife Tamsen for giving me this great honor and to have \nsomeone who, through all generations of time, will be the third Harry \nReid. I am not a junior because my dad had no middle name. And this \nlittle boy is not a junior, or could not be anyway, because I am not \nhis father. His name is different. He has a different middle name, \nBurk, named after his other grandparents, their last name.\n  So anyway, I am flattered and respectful of my son and daughter-in-\nlaw for naming the child after me. I want the Record to reflect how \nmuch I love and appreciate my son Josh and all my children who have \ndone so much to honor me with their exemplary lives, at least from a \nparent's perspective.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently discussing plans both for \nlater tonight and tomorrow and the next 2 weeks. I had the opportunity \nto talk to the Democratic leader, and that discussion will go on for a \nwhile. While we are in, and have been in a quorum call, I wanted to \ntake the opportunity to address an issue that has to do with gasoline \nprices, energy policy, something that every single American who drives \nor benefits from driving is feeling; that is, the price at the gasoline \npump.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was in the news this \nmorning expressing his concern about rising gasoline prices. He is \nright to be concerned. We are all concerned. But what he should be \nconcerned about is his own dismal record in terms of addressing this \nvery issue. Again and again, he has taken positions that result not in \nwhat Americans want--that is, lower gas prices--but again and again in \nhis position as a Senator and before, he has been on the other side and \nengaged in policies and supporting policies that drive the price of \ngasoline higher and higher.\n  The Senate record is familiar to most, but in 1983, when he was \nLieutenant Governor in Massachusetts, the Dukakis-Kerry administration \nsupported a $50 million gas tax hike on the citizens of Massachusetts. \nIn 1993, in the Senate, he voted for the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history, the Clinton tax bill, which increased the Federal \ngasoline tax by 4.3 cents. He also voted twice for the Clinton-Gore Btu \ntax which, had it been signed into law, would have increased gas taxes \nby another 7.5 cents per gallon.\n  The following year he backed a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for \nall Americans. He wrote a letter at that time to the Boston Globe \nexpressing his disappointment that a scorecard issued by a deficit \nreduction organization in Washington did not accurately reflect his \nsupport for this half-dollar gas tax increase.\n  The list goes on. The Senator from Massachusetts also wants the \nUnited States to accept the Kyoto Protocol which, according to Wharton \nEconomic Forecasting Associates, would raise gasoline prices an \nadditional 65 cents per gallon. And just last year, Senator Kerry voted \nfor climate change legislation which would have imposed a Kyoto-style \nregulation on 80 percent of the U.S. economy and would have raised \ngasoline prices by 40 cents a gallon.\n  That is a little bit of the history and the background for this new \nconcern about gasoline prices by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Put aside a moment the impact that these proposals would have had on \nan issue that we have talked a lot about on the floor today, and that \nis jobs and the importance of job creation. The most immediate impact, \nthe most immediate result of Senator Kerry's positions would be to \nforce America's consumers to pay at least a dollar more for each gallon \nof gasoline they purchase, and that is a conservative estimate.\n  It is also worth noting that Senator Kerry has consistently opposed \nany increase in domestic production of energy and any proposal that \nwould reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The Energy bill, which we \nall know fell two votes short in the Senate last year, is probably the \nmost recent example. Senator Kerry has expressed opposition to this \nmeasure, although he was not present in the Senate when we cast that \ncritical vote on the conference report.\n\n  In opposing the Energy bill, Senator Kerry is opposing not just the \ncreation of 800,000 new jobs, he is opposing the development of new \ndomestic resources, new resources that come in the United States, \nincluding such things as renewable resources such as wind and solar \nenergy. To that you could add clean burning ethanol, and to that you \ncould add advanced coal technology or zero emission nuclear energy and, \nyes, the development of domestic oil and gas resources as well.\n  I come to the floor to mention all of this, especially mentioning his \nrecord on the floor of the Senate, because it is simply very difficult \nto take seriously Senator Kerry when he says he is concerned about high \ngas prices and then blames others for not having addressed them. \nThroughout his career, Senator Kerry has consistently taken positions \nthat will result in even higher gas prices and lower domestic supplies \nof energy and jobs lost.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts, indeed, wants to engage in a \nserious discussion about energy policy, I ask that he come back to the \nSenate and help us do what we should be doing, and that is pass an \nEnergy bill which he and his party unfortunately have been blocking for \nmonths.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to review the record since we had this \navailable time. I do challenge Senator Kerry to engage in a serious \ndiscussion about helping us pass that very policy which we know would \nlower gasoline prices in the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, having just heard the majority leader come \nto the floor of the Senate and discuss the record of my colleague, \nSenator John Kerry, I thought it might be useful to respond just a bit.\n  This Chamber, given some of the dialog--and especially the dialog I \nheard a few minutes ago--only lacks the balloons, the buttons, and the \nbrass band for being a political convention in a full-scale support of \na candidate in a Presidential operation, a Presidential campaign.\n  It is not my desire nor my intent to talk about the Presidential \nrace. But when I hear people come to the floor and decide to talk about \nJohn Kerry's record on energy as a Member of the Senate, I think it is \nimportant to respond.\n  There are a great many allegations being made about Senator John \nKerry's record and many--most that I have heard recently--have been \nflat out untrue, just wrong. One of the great things about the First \nAmendment in this country is you can say whatever you want to say and, \nin politics, you can misrepresent someone's record and nobody seems to \ncare very much.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  Let me talk for a couple of minutes about these issues. First of all, \nlet's talk about the energy bill. We don't have an energy bill right \nnow. Do you know why? It failed by two votes in the Senate. I voted for \nit. So did the minority leader. Do you know why it failed by two votes \nin the Senate? Because the majority leader in the U.S. House stuck a \nprovision in that bill that cost him four, or five, or six votes \nagainst the bill in the Senate. Now I hear the majority leader of the \nU.S. House blame Senator Daschle for us not having an energy bill. I \nlooked at that in the paper and I thought, what on earth can he be \nthinking about? He killed the energy bill by sticking in this insidious \nprovision, a retroactive waiver on MTBE liability. He stuck that \nprovision in. He demanded it. It was killed on the floor of the Senate \nby two votes.\n  That bill would have passed the Senate easily without that provision \nstuck in by the majority leader of the U.S. House. So to have him talk \nabout Senator Daschle as somehow holding up the energy bill in this \ncountry doesn't make much sense to me. It is just wrong. He is the one \nwho killed that bill on the floor of the Senate with this provision \nthat he inserted.\n  As to the comments this evening, we have the majority leader come to \nthe floor of the Senate and he seems to imply that my colleague, John \nKerry, is against production, against conservation, against efficiency, \nagainst renewables. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. I can tell you what \nSenator Kerry is for. I sat in meeting after meeting with him over \nrecent years on energy policy, most of which I agree with him on. \nSometimes we disagreed.\n  I will tell you something. This is a man who is very concerned about \nenergy policy in this country. When we talk about these issues, it \nseems to me it would best behoove us to talk seriously about serious \nissues.\n  That has not been the case with respect to Senator Kerry's record on \nenergy, as misrepresented on the floor of the Senate this evening. So \nlet's talk about a couple of these issues.\n  Renewable energy: Senator Kerry supports renewable energy--wind \nenergy, biodiesel energy, a whole series of areas of renewable energy--\nthat will improve this country's energy supply and extend America's \nenergy supply. He supports it.\n  Efficiency titles in the Energy bill: Senator Kerry very much \nsupports improved efficiency of all the appliances we use every single \nday.\n  Conservation: Senator Kerry has a very strong record on conservation, \nand the same is true with respect to production.\n  There has been a lot of misrepresentation. In fact, I heard some \nmisrepresentation recently that Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-a-\ngallon gas tax increase. That is totally untrue, just wrong, flat out \nwrong.\n  Talk is cheap so people can come here and assert whatever they like, \nbut when I hear it, I am going to come to the floor of the Senate and \nsay it is not true.\n  The fact is, this country chooses its leader by going to the ballot \nbox, and this country is owed a serious debate about serious issues. \nRegrettably, it too seldom gets a serious debate about serious issues. \nYes, energy is a serious issue and we have a very serious energy \nproblem and we need an Energy bill passed in the U.S. Congress. Do not \nblame Democrats for the failure to pass an Energy bill. It failed in \nthe Senate by two votes. It passed the House and failed in the Senate \nby two votes, and everyone here understands that at least four or five \nof those two votes that would have been used to pass that bill resulted \nin a negative vote because of what the majority leader in the House \ndid. Everyone understands that. All you have to do is read a newspaper \nand you will understand that. People are concerned about the price of \ngasoline in this country, and they should be. When I say we need an \nenergy policy, we are now close to 60 percent of our oil coming from \noff our shores, often from troubled parts of the world. That is \ndangerous. The fact is, our economy is reliant on energy sources from \nparts of the world that are very troubled. If we want to keep importing \noil from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, and other parts of the \nworld, the fact is it will injure us inevitably, it will injure our \neconomy, and it will injure our opportunity to create new jobs, expand \nand provide hope and opportunity for the American people.\n  We need to go much further than the kind of debate we traditionally \nheld on energy issues, and that is where Senator Kerry talked about the \nfuture. We need to talk about issues such as hydrogen and fuel cells \nand pole-vault over some of this to talk about how we are going to \navoid in the future putting gasoline through carburetors and being \ndependent on OPEC countries.\n  Tomorrow there is a meeting of OPEC ministers. They already cut \nproduction and are talking about cutting production again. This country \nought to jawbone and use the leverage we have to say we need increased \nproduction. We have gas prices that are going through the roof.\n  I do not know what the President is going to do, whether he is going \nto involve himself and try to jawbone OPEC, but I think he should. We \nhave a serious problem, and it is not just the current spike in gas \nprices. That happens. It is now happening because of a series of \nfactors. One is the cutback in OPEC production. The second is an \nimbalance with respect to fuels that are coming into refineries and the \nlack of refinery capacity. There is a whole series of factors. Even as \nwe address the shorter term, we have to think about the longer term.\n\n  I will say to those who want to be critical of Senator Kerry's \nrecord, there is nobody in the Senate, in my judgment, who has cared \nmore and worked harder for longer term solutions for an energy policy \nin this country. It does not serve the country or responsible political \ndebate to come to the Senate and slap people around with bad \ninformation. I am sick and tired of that. If you want to turn this into \na political convention, get some balloons, bunting, put up crepe paper, \nhire a brass band, and pretend this is a political convention. But it \nis not a political convention. This is the Chamber of the United States \nSenate, and we ought to, it seems to me, talk about what the real \npolicy positions are of the respective candidates and have a \ncompetition of ideas.\n  I, frankly, think both political parties have something good to offer \nthis country, and the interaction of both parties and responsible \ndebate over a long period of time strengthens our country. But I get a \nlittle weary of this machine that is so relentless in trying to \nmisrepresent someone's position and slap that misrepresentation around \nfor a while. That is not the way this Presidential campaign ought to be \nwaged. It is not fair to Senator Kerry, who is not in this Chamber, for \npeople to come and mischaracterize his record. I understand people have \nthe right to do it. I am just saying it is not fair. So I hope as we \nbegin to think through some of these issues in the future that we \nunderstand there is a place for a political campaign for the Presidency \nin this country. It is in Ohio, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, Texas, \nand California--all around America--and there the bands do play, and \nthere the balloons are used to great effect, and people love the \npolitical system. That is fine. But I worry a lot about the Senate \nChamber being used to misrepresent someone's position on an issue that \nis as important as this.\n  What bothered me and persuaded me to come to the Senate floor this \nmoment are two things: One is something I read in the newspaper about 2 \nor 3 days ago in which the allegation by the majority leader of the \nother body was it was Senator Daschle who was holding up an Energy \nbill. Nonsense. The majority leader of the other body is the one who \nkilled the Energy bill by putting in this insidious provision, a \nretroactive waiver of MTBE liability. That is a plain fact.\n  Second, I heard a speech on the floor of the Senate a moment ago that \nwas just a pure campaign speech that had nothing to do with the merits \non one side. It had everything to do with misrepresenting the merits on \nthe other side. That is unfair. I am going to come to the floor again \nwhen I hear this done.\n  I hope the American people are treated to a serious debate about \nserious issues. Energy is a serious issue. John Kerry is a serious \ncandidate for the Presidency, and he has strong positions, I think \ndefensible positions, on energy dealing with production, conservation, \nefficiency, renewables, and more. I am sure if he were here to\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nstand up and speak in response to the majority leader, he would want to \ndo that.\n  I came to the floor simply to say I hope the American people are \ntreated to a debate that is accurate about energy positions and energy \npolicy by the two candidates. I, for one, feel very comfortable with \nthe long-term view of energy policy as advocated by Senator John Kerry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not been able to hear all of the \nstatement of the Senator from North Dakota, but I am sure, as always, \nit was right on the point. There is something I would like to direct in \nthe form of a question to him.\n  I was asked to appear on a television show this afternoon, and I was \nhappy to do that. The reason I appeared on the show was to respond to \nsome TV ads that are starting tomorrow where the Bush campaign is \npaying millions of dollars to run an ad around the country that is \nabsolutely fabricated. The ad said Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax increase. Is the Senator aware that this statement \nis baseless, never happened, and that millions of dollars are going to \nbe spent starting tomorrow saying Senator Kerry has previously in the \nSenate voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in taxes for gasoline?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say in response to the question from the \nSenator from Nevada, I have done what little research I could, because \nI understood this ad was being set to run across the country that said \nSenator Kerry has voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase. My \nunderstanding is it is simply untrue. If somebody has evidence of which \nI am not aware, bring it to the floor. My understanding is it is not \ntrue.\n  It is similarly not true that Senator Kerry is opposed to renewable \nfuels, opposed to conservation, opposed to increased efficiency of \nappliances which was alleged a few minutes ago on the Senate floor. \nThey are not grounded in fact.\n  As I said, everybody has a right to say these things. It is the \npolitical system. This is the floor of the Senate, and those of us who \nhear something we know is demonstrably false also have a right to come \nto the floor to say this is not the best of what this system has to \noffer the American people. This ought to be a competition of ideas of \nboth sides using facts and saying here is where one stands and here is \nwhere the other stands, and here is why and take your pick. That is \nwhat the political system ought to be about.\n  To the extent there are exaggerations--and there sure are in \npolitics; they occur on the political stage all around the country--\nthat is fine as well; that is politics.\n  It is a bit different especially to come to the Senate floor and \nmisrepresent the record of Senator Kerry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment 2943, which is \nthe Cornyn-Bingaman amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This amendment is very simple. It would correct a \ntechnical problem caused during the passage of the Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996. Section 411 of the welfare \nlaw reads that State and local governments may not use their own \nresources to provide nonemergency health services to nonqualified \nimmigrants unless the State has passed new legislation authorizing such \nexpenditures.\n  This provision has caused quite a bit of confusion. As a matter of \nfact, when I was Attorney General of Texas I was asked to interpret \nthis provision. It was during the course of that official action that I \ndiscovered the Federal law, because our State legislature had not \nacted, had unintended consequences. It is safe to say this provision \nhas been read by State and local governments with varying \ninterpretations.\n  Essentially, the current law imposes a double standard on State and \nlocal governments. Because certain Federal public health programs are \nexempt from this requirement, identical State and local government \nhealth programs are not. The end result is more legal and \nadministrative costs on State and local governments, even though the \nprovision has no enforcement mechanism. Even without the confusion, \nsection 411 makes no practical sense. We should not put up more \nroadblocks for those who want to provide preventive treatment, \nespecially when it comes to potential community problems such as \ninfectious diseases.\n  By giving localities control over preventive services, here again at \ntheir own expense, not at Federal taxpayers' expense, we ensure local \nfunds are spent where the people who know best believe they should be \nspent. Ultimately, this will have the effect of driving down health \ncare costs by preventing treatable illnesses before they become acute \nand before they require expensive taxpayer-supported care, usually in \nan emergency room where anyone, no matter who they are, knows they can \nbe treated and indeed must be treated according to a Federal mandate \nwhich I know is an interest of the presiding Senator, particularly \nbecause it is an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  Our amendment would simply strike the word ``health'' from section \n411 of the welfare law. This step clarifies that State and local \ngovernments can use their own funds to provide health services to \nimmigrants, including primary and preventive health care and infectious \ndisease services, without enacting a new law. It is a commonsense step \nand one I hope my colleagues will support.\n  This amendment is also widely supported by several well-respected \nnational associations, including the American Hospital Association, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals and Public Health Systems, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Catholic Health Association.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  I also want to briefly discuss another amendment, No. 2942. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Lieberman be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Connecticut has a deep understanding of \nthe importance of child support enforcement, and I like me, learned \nabout how critical that issue is during his service as his State's \nattorney general, as I did during my service as attorney general of my \nState.\n  This amendment features two positive reforms for child support \nenforcement. It encourages States to adopt electronic payment systems \nby 2008. While States can opt out of that if they choose to, it will \nhelp get payments to custodial parents more quickly than is currently \ndone now. It creates an option for States to centralize all child \nsupport payments to reduce confusion among employers who withhold child \nsupport payments from the wages of their employees, and it will ensure \nchildren get the financial support they need on time which, of course, \nis our universal goal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this second amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from each of these \norganizations be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                                                   March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Bingaman: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Counties (NACo), I would like to \n     express our support for the Cornyn-Bingaman amendment to the \n     Personal Responsibility, Work, and Family Promotion Act of \n     2003. The amendment, as you know, would clarify that states\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n     and counties may use their own funds to provide critical \n     preventative health care services to immigrants.\n       NACo is the only national organization representing county \n     governments. Many of our country's 3066 counties own and \n     operate hospitals and other health care facilities. Without \n     the passage of this amendment, county governments are placed \n     in a precarious position if they decide to provide \n     preventative care to unqualified immigrants in order to \n     protect the local community's health. As has been repeatedly \n     demonstrated, the provision of preventative care is less \n     costly over time than providing evasive services in emergency \n     rooms. However, the cost savings to preventative care are far \n     outweighed by the protection provided to the community's \n     public health as a whole.\n       Counties serve as safety-net providers, ultimately \n     financing and providing care for our Medicaid ineligible and \n     un-enrolled populations. We support the ability to finance \n     this care in the most appropriate manner.\n       Thank you for your leadership and efforts to ensure that \n     counties are able to protect the health of our local \n     communities. We look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The Catholic Health\n\n\n                             Association of the United States,\n\n                                    St. Louis, MO, March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA), the national \n     leadership organization of more then 2,000 Catholic health \n     care sponsors, systems, facilities, and related \n     organizations, I am writing in support of your efforts to \n     ensure that state and local governments have the ability to \n     use their funds to provide non-emergency health services to \n     legal and undocumented immigrants.\n       Specifically, CHA supports your amendment to strike the \n     word ``health'' from Section 411 of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (PRWORA), which has been interpreted by some states to \n     prohibit the use of any state and local funds to provide \n     lifesaving health care to immigrants. This interpretation \n     stands in sharp contrast to the thrust of PRWORA, which \n     generally gave states greater authority to determine welfare \n     rules, and the resulting confusion has had a negative impact \n     on the health of immigrants in many states.\n       By clarifying that states and local governments may use \n     their own funds to provide health services to immigrants, \n     including important preventive care, your amendment can help \n     ensure that hospitals and clinics have the clarity they need \n     to serve the best interest of all of their patients. As \n     organizations founded in a faith tradition and committed to \n     the principles of Catholic social justice teaching, Catholic \n     hospitals recognize and affirm the inherent dignity of every \n     human being. Your amendment helps to further that principle.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to ensure that state and \n     local governments have the certainty they need to use their \n     own funds to provide appropriate health care to all \n     immigrants. If we can be of any assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Rev. Michael D. Place, STD,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, on the passage of her amendment to increase the \nmandatory funding levels for the Child Care and Development Fund by $6 \nbillion over 5 years. I enthusiastically support this amendment, as it \nis designed to help so many families with young children by ensuring \nthat those children are properly cared for while their parents are at \nwork.\n  Unfortunately, we know that more than 10 million children in the \nUnited States are left unsupervised after school on a regular basis. We \nknow that the welfare rolls have been cut nearly 60 percent since 1996, \nand therefore, this statistic will only continue to grow as more and \nmore parents work. Further, with cuts in State childcare funding, many \nworking families are faced with no care for their children due to \nwaiting lists and higher childcare costs.\n  But, with the passage of this amendment, my home State of Ohio alone \nwould receive over $34 million in additional childcare funds next \nfiscal year and more than $266 million over the next 5 years. This \ntranslates into more children receiving care and more parents with the \npeace of mind that their children are being properly attended to while \nthey cannot be at home.\n  Again, I commend Senator Snowe for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in discussion now determining the \nbest pathway to completion on the underlying bill, the welfare bill, an \nimportant bill that I know both sides of the aisle do want to \nappropriately address, through amendments and through the debate \nprocess, and we are working on the best way to accomplish that.\n  As I set out really 3 weeks ago, but in the early part of last week, \nwe have set this week aside to address welfare and we are doing just \nthat. But I really need to do everything possible to see that we do \ncomplete it this weekend. To help accomplish that, I will be sending a \ncloture motion to the desk on the pending committee substitute.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 305, H.R. 4, an act to reauthorize \n     and improve the program of block grants to States for \n     temporary assistance for needy families, improve access to \n     quality child care, and for other purposes.\n\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

Hatch, Mike Enzi, Mitch McConnell, Ted \n           Stevens, Norm Coleman, James M. Inhofe, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3347-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3347-S3359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on the war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from Active Duty, from the National Guard, \nand from the Reserves, are all volunteers. They exemplify the very \nessence of what it means to be patriotic.\n  It is extremely important that we take action. Many in this body will \nremember that we proposed to do this last year as we were considering \nthe Defense authorization bill. Our effort was not successful, although \nmany Senators voted to go ahead with this legislative provision. The \nadministration was not in favor, and the amendment failed.\n  I am glad we are able to reintroduce it this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with us to find an \nappropriate time when we can bring it up for a vote, or we can add it \nas an amendment to one of the bills that will be working its way \nthrough the Senate later this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak on the welfare reform bill.\n  This has been an extraordinarily successful initiative which we began \na few years ago. Its success is tied with the fact that States have \nbeen given a great deal more flexibility in the area of how they handle \ntheir welfare account. The fact is, we have set up as a purpose, as a \ngovernment, that people who are on welfare will be given the \nopportunity, the skills, and the incentives to move off of welfare and \nmove into a work environment, which is something that gives them \npersonal credibility and personal self-respect, and at the same time \nassists us in reducing the public welfare rolls. It has been a huge and \noverwhelming success.\n  One of the elements of moving off of welfare, of course, is the need \nof parents to have transitional support, especially single mothers as \nthey go into the workforce while dealing with their children during the \ntime they are working; in other words, some sort of childcare \nassistance.\n  As part of this bill, we intend to offer an amendment for \nreauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant Program, \ncalled the Caring for Children Act of 2003.\n  This amendment came out of the committee which I chair, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee, unanimously. It came out with \nbipartisan support, obviously.\n  It is an attempt to update our childcare block grant initiative and \nmake it more meaningful for the issues of today. It also gives the \ndollars it needs to be effective.\n  The bill will not only stress increased spending, it has $1 billion \nof new funding from the discretionary accounts.\n  Earlier today, there was a vote on an initiative to add $6 billion \nover 5 years to the childcare development grant. That money would be \nmandatory, and it was not paid for; it was outside the budget. There \nwas a euphemistic attempt to pay for it--a superficial attempt--\nactually, what amounted to the ultimate shell game attempt as an offset \nwhich was cited and which has been used on, I believe, 17 different \noccasions as a claimed offset in this body.\n  The real effect of the bill was to go way outside the budget and add \na huge new tranche of dollars beyond the budget which would be fine had \nit been realistically offset. But it wasn't.\n  This bill has in it a true increase which is an appropriate increase \nof $1 billion over that period of the bill. That is a significant \ninfusion of new funds. Plus it addresses some of the concerns of the \nprogram, one of the concerns being as children are getting childcare \nthey should also be getting some sort of development in the capacity of \nlearning. Obviously, these are very young children. But they should \nhave a learning component in their childcare experience, something that \nwill put them in a position where they will be able to be at a level \nwhere their peers are--other young children who are receiving \nchildcare.\n  It has language in it which encourages the States to include a \nvoluntary guideline initiative in the area of prereading and language \nskills. The absolutely critical essence of learning is language skills \nand the ability to do phonics and identify letters and be able to get \nready for reading. This bill has in it that language.\n  It also has in it a commitment to low-income parents. At least 70 \npercent of these dollars has the flow-through stage, actually, to the \nparents--in many cases a single parent. So the parent is getting the \nbenefits. And we aren't simply siphoning it off into the bureaucracy, \nwhich often happens, regrettably, through administrative overhead but, \nrather, directing this money to the hands of the parents, especially \nthe low-income parent so the parent can use this to assist them in \ntransitioning off the welfare rolls by taking care of their children \nduring the workday.\n\n  It gives parents a significant amount of choice. They can use \ndifferent daycare types of facilities. Some which are faith-based are \nallowed to be used, or they can use it even if it is being provided by \nrelatives and neighbors. That is important.\n  Further, the bill addresses a need to make sure that States focus on \nimproving the quality of childcare. This is a very significant concern \nthat many of us have, which is that a lot of the childcare today is, \nunfortunately, not of a quality that gives the child the support \nservices they need or the academic assistance they might need in order \nto be brought up to speed with peers who are in different childcare \ndelivery systems.\n  It allows States to set aside a certain percentage of the money in \norder to assess quality and try to improve quality. This gives the \nStates more flexibility in this area, but it also gives them an impetus \nto go in the right direction.\n  It is, therefore, a bill which does a lot of good.\n  As I mentioned, it was reported out of our committee unanimously. It \nwill be, hopefully, added to the base bill either by a formal vote or \nas part of the managers' amendment.\n  But we have to get back to the fundamental quandary which confronts \nus today, which is that the base welfare reform bill that is pending \nbefore the Congress is being held up by the other side of the aisle.\n  This is becoming a pattern of obstruction which we have seen \nthroughout this session of the Congress, and it appears its intensity \nis actually increasing. Bills are coming to the floor\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nnow which are important pieces of legislation on which there is a \ngeneral consensus.\n  As I mentioned, this language reported out of our committee to \nstrengthen the block grants for childcare was reported unanimously. Yet \nthese bills are being stopped dead in their tracks by the insistence of \nthe other side of the aisle to put on these bills extraneous issues \nwhich are of a politically charged nature, the purpose of which is not \nto pass them but simply to generate a political vote which can be used \nin the coming election.\n  We all do that. We all set up the political votes. But they should \nnot be used as aggressively as they are today by the Democratic Party \nas a means of stopping legitimate legislation. The obstruction coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle is unconscionable.\n  Last week, for example, a bill which would have corrected the \nproblems which many of our manufacturers in this country are going to \nconfront, specifically a duty that is going to be assessed on their \ngoods sold overseas, a duty which could go up as high as 18 percent--\nand that duty was a function of the fact we lost a World Trade court \ndecision which allows this duty to go forward--that bill which would \nhave corrected that, put an end to the duty and thus allow \nmanufacturing jobs and service-oriented jobs in the United States to \ncontinue to expand and flourish, that bill was killed in this Senate \nbecause of extraneous issues which the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocratic Party, decided they wanted to bring forward. They would not \nallow the bill to go forward without those extraneous issues being \nvoted on.\n  The bill had absolute consensus. There was a belief, there is a \nbelief, there should be a belief, that American jobs should not be lost \nas a result of our tax laws being found illegal by a body which we \nsubscribe to, the World Trade Organization, and that we should correct \nthat problem, and we can correct it rather effectively, and that \ncorrection will save jobs in the United States. That will not happen \nnow because of the obstruction coming from the other side of the aisle. \nIt is one in a series of obstructions.\n  Now we see the exact same thing happen in the area of welfare reform. \nLiterally, in the last 5 years, there have been very few laws as \nsuccessful that this Congress has passed as welfare reform. It was so \nsuccessful--it was an idea put forward on this side of the aisle--once \nit passed and started to work, it was immediately adopted by the other \nside of the aisle as theirs.\n  President Clinton had the right to take credit; he was President when \nthe bill was passed. He was President and takes credit as one of the \nstrong elements of service of his Presidency. And I am glad he takes \ncredit.\n  Now when we try to reauthorize and improve it significantly through \nthe block grant proposal which we brought out of our bipartisan \ncommittee, now when we try to move the bill forward so we can continue \nwith the welfare reform experience of the last few years and make sure \nthat experience continues to allow people to move from public \nassistance to work and give people self-confidence, self-respect, and \nself-esteem as a result of attaining work, that bill has been stopped \nonce again by the Democratic membership of this body coming forward and \nsaying they want to cast a political vote on an unrelated issue.\n  It is these actions that one has to question the purpose. Why, when \nbills have been agreed to which will significantly improve the \nlifestyle of Americans, the number of jobs Americans have in the case \nof the tax bill which was just stopped last week, or the number of \npeople moving from welfare to work, which is getting good jobs and \nmoving out of a public assistance situation and getting self-respect, \nwhy are these bills being stopped for purely political purposes by the \nother side of the aisle bringing forward extraneous amendments.\n\n  It is an unconscionable action, in my opinion. It is regrettable that \nthe childcare block grant proposal, the reauthorization of which came \nout of our committee unanimously and which represents a significant \nimprovement, especially in this area of trying to get learning into the \nchildcare experience, trying to get quality in the childcare \nexperience, giving States more flexibility and putting more money into \nthe program in the context of a responsible budget bill, why that would \nbe stopped also is beyond me. It is not beyond me; it is fairly \nobvious. The purpose here is to make a political statement. It is a \npolitical statement, come heck or high water. It does not matter that \nthe making of the political statement will cost people jobs and make it \nharder to move from welfare to work, creating a poorer and a less well-\nfinanced childcare block grant program.\n  It is unfortunate. It is the politics of the day. I know the American \npeople do not focus too much on what we do in the Senate in the day-to-\nday regime. I hope the American people take the time to learn what has \ntranspired in this body in the last 6 to 8 months. The obstructionism \non the other side of the aisle has become the cause of the day, the \npurpose of every event. This obstructionism continues and grows as we \nmove closer to the election. The practical effect of this \nobstructionism coming from the other side of the aisle is that good \nthings which help working Americans keep jobs, move from welfare to \nwork, ensuring their kids have quality daycare, good things like that \nare being stopped as a result of this unrequited obstructionism coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Nevada Champions\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, \nand I will take a couple of minutes and exercise our privileges as \nSenators to brag a little bit about our State and the recent \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada basketball team and their \nrise to the Sweet 16.\n  The Nevada Wolf Pack brought a lot of pride to our State. It is not a \nschool known for basketball. Certainly, they had more football success \nin the years past. However, this year they surprised many in the \nNation. It was obviously a heart-breaking loss to Georgia Tech last \nweek. But Coach Trent Johnson, the whole Wolf Pack team and all the \npeople surrounded with the program deserve a lot of credit for the \nseason they put together. We expect big things from them in the future.\n  For a school such as the University of Nevada, a school that does not \nhave the reputation of the University of Connecticut or Duke, it is \nmore difficult to get the kind of players to go up to Reno to play \nbasketball. They have players from Virginia City, Elko, and some of the \nother small towns around Nevada.\n  Coach Johnson crafted a team providing a good lesson for all of us to \nlearn. If you can work together as a team, you can achieve true \ngreatness. That is what his team did this year. Earlier in the year \nthey beat the University of Kansas, beat them very soundly. Then \nthrough the March Madness, they made it all the way through the Sweet \n16.\n  It was funny to listen to the various announcers talk about our team \nand trash them, not even understanding how to pronounce ``Nevada.'' We \ndo not use their pronunciation. It was funny to listen to them saying \nthey did not have a chance; they did not know how to play basketball. \nCertainly the coach from the University of Nevada and the rest of the \nplayers proved them wrong.\n  I rise today to congratulate them on a great season and look forward \nto their success.\n  I also wish the Lady Rebels from the University of Nevada Las Vegas \nsuccess tonight. They are in the WNIT championship. We have a lot to be \nproud of in our State. I join my colleague, Senator Harry Reid, in \ncongratulating especially the Nevada Wolf Pack for what they have \nachieved. Hopefully, we will be able to talk about the championship the \nLady Rebels will achieve tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hope Senator Ensign and I are able to be on the same team \nworking here in the Senate as the University of Nevada at Reno was \nduring this basketball season. We strive to do that. They have set a \ngood example for us and for everyone.\n  We may be outnumbered in the State of Nevada. There may be a lot of \nStates with more people than we have, but Senator Ensign and I realize \nevery State only has two Senators. We believe as a result of that, of \nour working together, we can have the same\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nstrength and power some of the more populated States have. I have \nenjoyed and appreciated working as a team with Senator Ensign during \nhis tenure in the Senate.\n  I also today want to extend my congratulations to Coach Trent Johnson \nand the basketball team at the University of Nevada. We have in recent \nyears reached goals in our athletic programs at the University of \nNevada, but for Coach Ault and his football team, they have been good.\n  I remember going to Georgia Southern to watch UNR play them for the \nnational championship, in Division II. And though we lost that game, it \nwas a great thrill to reach that level, which was significant for the \nuniversity.\n\n  Since that time, the University of Nevada football has moved into \nDivision I. Basketball has always been Division I.\n  Now, many years ago, the Wolf Pack was known all over the country. It \nhad, at one time, three All-Americans on its football team. We had \nMarion Motley, who is now a member of the Football Hall of Fame, who \nplayed football at the University of Nevada, at Reno. And we had other \ngreat players, Dick Trachok, Tommy Kaminer, and many others, but that \nis many years ago.\n  So what Senator Ensign said about the Wolf Pack Basketball Team is \nsignificant. They had not been to an NCAA tournament for 19 years. They \nhad never, in the history of the school, won an NCAA game.\n  This year they were forecast, by all the prognosticators, to continue \nthat ``never to win a game.'' The first team they played was the great \nMichigan State. They beat Michigan State. Then the prognosticators \nsaid: Well, that was a fluke. There is no way in the world they will \nbeat the highest ranked Gonzaga team. Gonzaga, all year, had lost one \ngame. That game was not close. UNR moved through there very quickly.\n  Then they moved on to the Sweet Sixteen. They played Georgia Tech. \nThey led Georgia Tech at half time, and it was really an exciting game. \nThey lost. But other than my being disappointed because they did not go \nto the Final Four, I join my colleague in expressing my congratulations \nto this great basketball team.\n  We have focused so much attention, in years past, with the UNLV \nbasketball team, the Runnin' Rebels, that has overshadowed the \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada, at Reno. But that will no \nlonger ever be said as a result of the great accomplishment made by \nthis team.\n  I want to say something about the importance of coaching. Trent \nJohnson came from Stanford. He was an assistant coach over there. He \ncame 5 years ago. He accepted the challenge of being a head coach of a \nDivision I school. But, frankly, the record that he was given was \npretty dismal. The year that he took over, he looked back to see that \nthe prior year they had won 8 games and lost 18. This year they won 24 \ngames. That is the turnaround.\n  As Senator Ensign mentioned, they beat Kansas, which was ranked No. 1 \nat the time. Early in the year, people knew they would be pretty good \nbecause they almost beat Connecticut, which, at that time, was also \nranked No. 1.\n  Few people thought they could make the strides that they did except \ntheir coach, Trent Johnson. He is an outstanding coach. It is my \nunderstanding and my hope that the people in Reno have done everything \nthey can to make him happy. He is a great coach, and this record of his \nwill only continue.\n  I want to reflect a little bit on this team. It was led by the player \nof the year in the Western Athletic Conference, a man by the name of \nKirk Snyder. He is a junior. If he wants to go pro, he will be drafted \nin the first round.\n  During the times I have watched him during the games this year, and \nlistened to the games, the sportscasters always focused on this man who \nwas so good.\n  They also had a point guard by the name of Todd Okeson, someone who \nis a senior, and was the sparkplug of that team. He was the point \nguard, but he also scored very well.\n\n  There were other fine players on that team. They may not have scored \nover 20 points a game as did Kirk Snyder, but they did many other good \nthings. Gary Hill-Thomas was a great defender. Kevin Pinkney was one of \nthe great rebounders. And then there was a young man by the name of \nNick Fazekas, who is almost 7 feet tall, a freshman, and has a soft \ntouch. He stepped in at very crucial times during the tournament and \nmade key baskets, and came to the free throw line and always came \nthrough.\n  But we also had players from Nevada. They are not all out-of-Staters. \nFor example, Sean Paul, the ``Elko Enforcer,'' comes from the town of \nElko in northeastern Nevada. And there were other players: Jermaine \nWashington and Marcelus Kemp.\n  These players have made Coach Johnson proud. I am confident that is \none reason Coach Johnson is going to stay at the University of Nevada, \nat Reno. We want him, and I certainly hope he stays. I am confident \nthat he will.\n  All these players, and especially the coach, have made Nevadans \nproud.\n  Sometimes when a team loses in a tournament, people say: ``Wait until \nnext year.'' But I think everyone in Nevada is going to dwell on the \nfact that this team did well, and we are going to savor this remarkable \nseason by UNR, and not dwell on next year.\n  Senator Ensign mentioned, and I also want to mention, that we also \nhave a great coach at UNLV. She coaches the UNLV Runnin' Rebels. The \nLady Rebels are very good. They came within one point of going to the \nNCAA tournament. They are now in the National Invitation Tournament, \nand they are in the finals. They are going to play Creighton tonight \nfor the National Invitation Championship. They have done great.\n  I love to watch the Lady Rebels. I have gone and met with these young \nwomen and have spoken with the coach. So I congratulate Coach Miller \nand her Lady Rebels for the great notoriety they have focused on the \nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas this year and wish them well in their \ntournament game tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2945\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \npending amendment offered by the Senators from California and \nMassachusetts; namely, the minimum wage amendment. I would like to \npoint out the effect of the current minimum wage on people today, and \nparticularly as to where they are with respect to poverty in America.\n  Let me refer to this chart. This chart represents the relationship \nbetween the minimum wage and the poverty line for a family of two, \nbeginning in the year 1988, and up through the year 2002.\n  From this chart you can see, quite visibly, frankly--with the minimum \nwage represented in green and the poverty line being the line just \nbelow the blue--that as the minimum wage increased in 1989, and in a \nstep sort of function up to 1998, that for a person who had a job, with \na family of two--let's say a single mom had a full-time job but made \nthe minimum wage--they were still below the Federal poverty level, \nuntil about 1998, and then they could just barely surpass the poverty \nlevel.\n  I point this out because it does not seem right that a person who has \na full-time job at a minimum wage still lives in poverty.\n  Now, that is bad enough. But let me show you how much worse it gets. \nThis next chart shows the relationship between the minimum wage and \npoverty for a family of three: let's say a mom and dad and a child. By \nthis chart one can tell very easily that the gap between the poverty \nline and the minimum wage is much greater for a family of three than it \neven is for a family of two. In fact, if I have my numbers correct, the \namount is about $3,681. That is the gap.\n  I point out, again, for a family of three, with one breadwinner--say \nwith a father who is at the minimum wage--that family of three will \nfind itself, on average, over a year's time, about $3,600 of income \nless than the Federal poverty level. That family is living in poverty \neven though the breadwinner of that family is working full time.\n  And it gets worse, as you might expect.\n  Let's take a family of four, say a father and a mother, and two \nchildren. Say one parent is working full time at a minimum wage job. \nBecause the increase in the minimum wage has been\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nso slow, the gap between what that family earns and the Federal poverty \nlevel is even greater.\n  In fact, it is about twice as much, which means that a family of four \nwith one wage earner at the minimum wage is earning about half of what \nthe Federal poverty level is. I don't think that is right. I frankly \ndon't understand why some people do not want a significant increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Let me tell you a personal story. Personal stories sometimes are out \nof context, but it meant a lot to me. One year I was walking across my \nState in Montana campaigning. To be honest, I learned an awful lot just \nby talking to people who I just happened to meet walking down the roads \nand highways and visiting in people's homes. A lot of it had to do with \nwelfare. I remember talking to many people on welfare who told me they \ndid not want to be on welfare. They hated it. They wanted to be off \nwelfare.\n  One of the main factors they mentioned to me as to why it is so \ndifficult to get off of welfare is because of the minimum wage laws. \nThey are working maybe at McDonald's or someplace else in a minimum \nwage job, but because the minimum wage rates were so low, they couldn't \nmake ends meet.\n  It is hard to know when to believe people. It is hard to know when to \nthink what people say is right or not, but you have to read between the \nlines. You have to get a sense of what is going on. It was very clear \nto me that these people were speaking the truth, certainly as they \nperceived it. If there were a significant increase in their wages, they \ncould then get off of welfare.\n  It is tied to the earlier debate on childcare. I ran into a lot of \nwomen, single moms who said the same thing to me. They were really \nearnest. I wish you could have seen the expressions on their faces \nsaying that they wanted to stay off of welfare.\n  One young single mom explained to me that she slept on her mother's \nsofa so she could avoid having to pay for a room someplace. She had a \nminimum wage job. Her childcare expenses were so high she could not \nhandle it anymore and she had to go back on to welfare. She hated it.\n  In those few instances, people I talked to just by happenstance--\nchance encounters--that is what they have said to me.\n  We have to make judgments sometimes. One of the judgments I have made \nis that our current minimum wage is too low. For a civilized country, \nthe United States of America, we can do a heck of a lot better.\n  Sometimes you hear business people say it will increase their cost of \nbusiness. It probably will slightly. But if everybody is getting paid \nmore, more dollars flow into the economy. People are more likely to not \nbe on welfare, and they are more likely to have a little more self-\nesteem. They are more likely to be able to advance themselves. Most \npeople want to advance themselves. They want a better life for their \nfamilies and their kids. Some just find themselves caught in difficult \nsituations.\n  I hope people will look at these charts and see how dramatic the \ndifference is between the minimum wage income on the one hand and the \nFederal poverty level on the other. The income of someone on the \nminimum wage is much below the Federal poverty level. It does not seem \nright that a person working full time, whether he or she has one child, \nor is married, or whether he or she has three in the family or four, \nshould live so far below the Federal poverty level. That is not right. \nIf they are going to work full time, they should be able to live \noutside of poverty.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, after watching the harsh acrimony \ngenerated by the September 11 Commission--which, let me say at the \noutset, is made up of good and able members--I have come to seriously \nquestion this panel's usefulness. I believe it will ultimately play a \nrole in doing great harm to this country, for its unintended \nconsequences, I fear, will be to energize our enemies and demoralize \nour troops.\n  After being drowned in a tidal wave of all who didn't do enough \nbefore 9/11, I have come to believe that the Commission should issue a \nreport that says: No one did enough. In the past, no one did near \nenough. And then thank everybody for serving, send them home, and let's \nget on with the job of protecting this country in the future.\n  Tragically, these hearings have proved to be a very divisive \ndiversion for this country. Tragically, they have devoured valuable \ntime looking backward instead of looking forward. Can you imagine \nhandling the attack on Pearl Harbor this way? Can you imagine Congress, \nthe media, and the public standing for this kind of political \ngamesmanship and finger-pointing after that day of infamy in 1941?\n  Some partisans tried that ploy, but they were soon quieted by the \npatriots who understood how important it was to get on with the war and \ntake the battle to America's enemies and not dwell on what FDR knew, \nwhen. You see, back then the highest priority was to win a war, not to \nwin an election. That is what made them the greatest generation.\n  I realize that many well-meaning Americans see the hearings as \ndemocracy in action. Years ago when I was teaching political science, I \nprobably would have had my class watching it live on television and \nusing that very same phrase with them.\n  There are also the not-so-well-meaning political operatives who see \nthese hearings as an opportunity to score cheap points. And then there \nare the media meddlers who see this as great theater that can be played \nout on the evening news and on endless talk shows for a week or more.\n  Congressional hearings have long been one of Washington's most \nentertaining pastimes. Joe McCarthy, Watergate, Iran-Contra--they all \nkept us glued to the TV and made for conversations around the water \ncoolers or arguments over a beer at the corner pub.\n  A congressional hearing in Washington, DC is the ultimate aphrodisiac \nfor political groupies and partisan punks. But it is not the groupies, \npunks, and television-sotted American public that I am worried about. \nThis latter crowd can get excited and divided over just about anything, \nwhether it is some off-key wannabe dreaming of being the American idol, \nor what brainless bimbo ``The Bachelor'' or ``Average Joe'' will \nchoose, or who Donald Trump will fire next week. No, it is the real \nenemies of America that I am concerned about. These evil killers who \nright now are gleefully watching the shrill partisan finger-pointing of \nthese hearings and grinning like a mule eating briars.\n  They see this as a major split within the great Satan, America. They \nsee anger. They see division, instability, bickering, peevishness, and \ndissension. They see the President of the United States hammered \nunmercifully. They see all this, and they are greatly encouraged.\n  We should not be doing anything to encourage our enemies in this \nbattle between good and evil. Yet these hearings, in my opinion, are \ndoing just that. We are playing with fire. We are playing directly into \nthe hands of our enemy by allowing these hearings to become the great \ndivider they have become.\n  Dick Clarke's book and its release coinciding with these hearings \nhave done this country a tremendous disservice and some day we will \nreap its whirlwind.\n  Long ago, Sir Walter Scott observed that revenge is ``the sweetest \nmorsel that ever was cooked in hell.''\n  The vindictive Clarke has now had his revenge, but what kind of hell \nhas he, his CBS publisher, and his axe-to-grind advocates unleashed?\n  These hearings, coming on the heels of the election the terrorists \ninfluenced in Spain, bolster and energize our evil enemies as they have \nnot been energized since 9/11.\n  Chances are very good that these evil enemies of America will attempt \nto influence our 2004 election in a similar dramatic way as they did \nSpain's. And to think that could never be in this country is to stick \nyour head in the sand.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n  That is why the sooner we stop this endless bickering over the past \nand join together to prepare for the future, the better off this \ncountry will be. There are some things--whether this city believes it \nor not--that are just more important than political campaigns.\n  The recent past is so ripe for political second-guessing, ``gotcha,'' \nand Monday morning quarterbacking. And it is so tempting in an election \nyear. We should not allow ourselves to indulge that temptation. We \nshould put our country first.\n  Every administration, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, bears some \nof the blame. Dick Clarke bears a big heap of it, because it was he who \nwas in the catbird's seat to do something about it for more than a \ndecade. Tragically, it was the decade in which we did the least.\n  We did nothing after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in \n1993, killing six and injuring more than a thousand Americans.\n  We did nothing in 1996 when 16 U.S. servicemen were killed in the \nbombing of the Khobar Towers.\n  When our embassies were attacked in 1998, killing 263 people, our \nonly response was to fire a few missiles on an empty tent.\n  Is it any wonder that after that decade of weak-willed responses to \nthat murderous terror, our enemies thought we would never fight back?\n  In the 1990s is when Dick Clarke should have resigned. In the 1990s \nis when he should have apologized. That is when he should have written \nhis book--that is, if he really had America's best interests at heart.\n  Now, I know some will say we owe it to the families to get more \ninformation about what happened in the past, and I can understand that. \nBut no amount of finger-pointing will bring our victims back.\n  So now we owe it to the future families and all of America now in \njeopardy not to encourage more terrorists, resulting in even more \ngrieving families--perhaps many times over the ones of 9/11.\n  It is obvious to me that this country is rapidly dividing itself into \ntwo camps--the wimps and the warriors: the ones who want to argue and \nassess and appease, and the ones who want to carry this fight to our \nenemies and kill them before they kill us. In case you have not figured \nit out, I proudly belong to the latter.\n  This is a time like no other time in the history of this country. \nThis country is being crippled with petty partisan politics of the \nworst possible kind. In time of war, it is not just unpatriotic; it is \nstupid; it is criminal.\n  So I pray that all this time, all this energy, all this talk, and all \nof the attention could be focused on the future instead of the past.\n\n  I pray we would stop pointing fingers and assigning blame and \nwringing our hands about what happened on that day David AcUology has \ncalled ``the worst day in all our history'' more than 2 years ago, and \ninstead, pour all our energy into how we can kill these terrorists \nbefore they kill us--again.\n  Make no mistake about it: They are watching these hearings and they \nare scheming and smiling about the distraction and the divisiveness \nthat they see in America. And while they might not know who said it \nyears ago in America, they know instinctively that a house divided \ncannot stand.\n  There is one other group that we should remember is listening to all \nof this--our troops.\n  I was in Iraq in January. One day, when I was meeting with the 1st \nArmored Division, a unit with a proud history, known as Old Ironsides, \nwe were discussing troop morale, and the commanding general said it was \ntop notch.\n  I turned to the division's sergeant major, the top enlisted man in \nthe division, a big, burly 6-foot-3, 240 pound African American, and I \nsaid: ``That's good, but how do you sustain that kind of morale?''\n  Without hesitation, he narrowed his eyes, and he looked at me and \nsaid: ``The morale will stay high just as long as these troops know the \npeople back home support us.''\n  Just as long as the people back home support us. What kind of message \nare these hearings and the outrageously political speeches on the floor \nof the Senate yesterday sending to the marvelous young Americans in the \nuniform of our country?\n  I say: Unite America before it is too late. Put aside these petty \npartisan differences when it comes to the protection of our people. \nArgue and argue and argue, debate and debate and debate over all the \nother things, such as jobs, education, the deficit, and the \nenvironment; but please, please do not use the lives of Americans and \nthe security of this country as a cheap-shot political talking point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \noutstanding comments. There is a war going on and he made some \noutstanding points. I have heard several of his speeches and learned a \nlot from each of them.\n  I am going to speak now on, I believe, the pending amendment, the \nBoxer-Kennedy amendment. I will share my thoughts about raising the \nFederal minimum wage. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep \ntalking about the loss of American jobs, but their actions don't match \nup to their words.\n  If my colleagues are so concerned about unemployment, why would they \ndo something that would eliminate jobs in this country? If my \ncolleagues are so concerned about helping poor families, why would they \ndo something that hurts poor families the most? Their effort to \nincrease the minimum wage, while attacking the President on job \ncreation, is not based on sound policy and economics.\n  There is an effort underway to put a smokescreen of unrelated \namendments that mask election year politics in misleading rhetoric. It \nis being done on the reauthorization of the welfare bill.\n  It is time for us to look beyond the smokescreen and see who is \nreally helped and who is really hurt by Senator Kennedy's amendment to \nraise the Federal minimum wage.\n  Every student who has taken an economics course knows if you increase \nthe price of something--in this case, the minimum wage job--you \ndecrease the demand for those jobs. A survey of members of the American \nEconomic Association revealed that 77 percent of economists believe \nthat a minimum wage hike causes job loss.\n  For small businesses, where most of the job creation in this country \nis generated, a minimum wage increase is particularly harmful. Having \nowned a small business in Wyoming, I can speak from personal experience \nabout how detrimental a minimum wage increase would be for small \nbusinesses and job growth.\n  I need to explain something. Very few people in the shoe business I \nwas in were working at the minimum wage, which my wife and I preferred \nto call the level of minimum skills. Those are the people who first \ncame in and did not have any capability in the kind of job they were \ngoing to be doing and we had a starting wage, a starting skills wage. \nAnybody who was in that wage more than 3 months was not paying \nattention, and that is the way with most of the businesses in this \ncountry.\n  The minimum wage is the minimum skills wage, and it is the starting \nwage. It does have an effect on other wages as well. When we raise the \nminimum wage, then to keep the proper spread between employees of \ndifferent skills, other jobs get raises, too. Of course, when that \nhappens, there has to be a way to pay for it, and the way to pay for \nthat almost always comes from raising prices. If you raise prices and \nwages, there is not much gain.\n  How do I explain to my constituents, most of whom rely on small \nbusiness for their livelihood, that Congress wants to do something that \nwould foster job loss instead of job creation?\n  Every day I read letters to the editors of the Wyoming newspapers. \nOne appeared in the Casper Star from one of my constituents about his \nconcerns in September 2002. I came across this letter again. It was \nwritten by Imo Harned of Douglas, WY, about the effects of a minimum \nwage increase. It is a reminder about the true cost of minimum wage \nincreases.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       That's Like no Help at All\n\n       Editor: I first became interested in the effects of raising \n     minimum wage in the 1960s.\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n     An employer I knew fired three men he'd employed as watchmen. \n     He remarked that it was worth something to have warm bodies \n     around, but not at 75 cents an hour. Since then I have made \n     it a habit from time to time to ask an employer if raising \n     minimum wage makes a difference to his business. No matter if \n     he pays one person or dozens, the answer is always the same. \n     ``There are X number of dollars in the budget and I can't \n     exceed that amount. If it means cutting hours or firing \n     workers, I have to do it to stay within the budget.'' \n     Personal observations show that within a week of a raise in \n     minimum wage, groceries will raise enough to absorb the \n     increase. Also, people who make more than minimum have to pay \n     the increased costs too, so it amounts to a cut in pay for \n     those who make more.\n       Several years ago the Wall Street Journal did a study \n     showing that living standards have remained unchanged for \n     people earning minimum wage since that wage was 50 cents an \n     hour! The only difference was that those poor people were in \n     a higher tax bracket and had to pay more taxes.\n       A person who begins working at minimum wage, who works hard \n     and earns an increase in pay should not be penalized by being \n     returned to the beginning again. Neither should anyone be \n     penalized by having to pay the increased food and utilities \n     that follow every time the minimum wage is increased.\n                                              Imo Harned, Douglas.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have listened to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who support a minimum wage increase. I have \nseen their charts and heard their arguments. However, none of their \ncharts or arguments can refute the commonsense and real world \nobservation of Imo Harned from Douglas, WY.\n  Mr. Harned writes--I am quoting part of it and the whole letter is \nprinted in the Record. I am sure my colleagues will want to read it:\n\n     . . . I have made it a habit from time to time to ask an \n     employer if raising minimum wage makes a difference to his \n     business. No matter if he pays one person or dozens, the \n     answer is always the same: ``There are X number of dollars in \n     the budget and I can't exceed that amount. If it means \n     cutting hours or firing workers, I have to do it to stay \n     within the budget.'' Personal observations show that within a \n     week of a raise in minimum wage, groceries will raise enough \n     to absorb the increase. Also, people who make more than \n     minimum have to pay the increased costs, too, so it amounts \n     to a cut in pay for those who make more.\n\n  Mr. Harned saw through the phony economics of a minimum wage \nincrease. He reached the same conclusion as two Stanford economists: A \nminimum wage increase is paid for by higher prices that hurt poor \nfamilies the most. Some argue that we need to increase the minimum wage \nto help poor families. However, the 2001 study conducted by Stanford \nUniversity economists found that only one in four of the poorest 20 \npercent of families would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. \nThree in four of the poorest workers would be hurt by a wage hike \nbecause they would shoulder the costs of resulting higher prices. A \nFederal wage hike will hurt the very people the underlying welfare \nreauthorization bill is designed to help: America's poor families.\n  I have held on to Mr. Harned's letter as a reminder of the dangers of \na ``Washington knows best'' and a ``one size fits all'' mentality. An \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage is a classic lesson that \nWashington does not know best and one size does not fit all.\n  A Federal wage mandate does not account for the cost of living that \nvaries across the country. It costs over twice as much to live in New \nYork City than in Cheyenne, WY. However, a Federal minimum wage hike \nthat applies coast to coast is like saying a bag of groceries in New \nYork City must cost the same as a bag of groceries in Cheyenne. Local \nlabor market conditions and the cost of living determines pay rates, \nnot Federal minimum wage laws dictated from Washington.\n  I support an increase for all wages, but that increase should be \nfueled by a strong, free market economy, not by an artificial Federal \nmandate that hurts business and workers alike. Artificial wage hikes \ndrive prices up. We should not trick workers into thinking they are \nearning more when they still cannot pay the bills at the end of the \nmonth. We should not trick the American people into believing that the \nphony economics of a minimum wage increase will improve the standard of \nliving in this country. Nor should we trick the American people into \nbelieving that a minimum wage increase is without cost.\n  The smoke and mirrors of a minimum wage increase is not the way for \nAmerican workers to find and keep well-paying jobs. We have to \nencourage, not discourage, job creation, and we have to equip our \nworkers with the skills needed to compete in the new global economy.\n\n  It is one of my goals to make sure that the unfilled higher paying \njobs can be filled by Americans. I talked about the minimum wage being \na minimum skills wage. There are higher paying jobs out there, but you \nhave to have the skills for them. How do you get the skills for them? \nWe have a bill. It is called the Workforce Investment Act. It \nreauthorizes the Nation's job training and employment system, and it \nupdates it to the modern jobs. It allows people to be working in the \nareas of highest need in this country, instead of forcing those jobs \noverseas.\n  That bill passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee unanimously. We passed it on the Senate floor by unanimous \nconsent last November. That means nobody wanted to amend it and nobody \nobjected to what was in the bill. That is as bipartisan as you can get.\n  Where is that bill now? It is languishing around here because the \nminority party will not let us get a conference committee appointed to \nresolve the differences with the House, the final step for the bill. \nThe House has passed a bill. It is a little different from the Senate \nbill. But we need to meet and work out the differences and get that \nfinal bill.\n  What does this mean in the way of jobs? Training for 900,000 jobs a \nyear. That is pretty significant, training for 900,000 jobs a year. I \nkind of get the feeling we do not want to resolve that until after \nNovember so that it can be a part of the politics of the Presidency. \nThat is wrong. It ought to be worked out now. We ought to have a \nconference committee. We ought to get it done. If we want to take care \nof jobs in this country, if we want people to be making more and to be \nmaking more real money, we ought to get them trained into the skilled \npositions in the jobs that are vacant in this country right now before \nwe ship them over to another country. We need to have a conference \ncommittee. That would provide jobs. That will provide increased wages. \nThat will provide real increased wages, not just inflationary wages \nthat will drive up the price of all of the goods and absorb, as Mr. \nHarned said, in 1 week the amount of the raise.\n  I owe Mr. Harned and all my constituents sound policy, not election \nyear rhetoric. I owe it to Mr. Harned and all of my constituents to \nremove the smokescreen around the minimum wage debate and expose its \ntrue cost.\n  The Boxer-Kennedy amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage ignores \nthe true cost of a minimum wage increase on America's workers and \nbusinessmen.\n  I hope we can put this debate, which is unrelated to the underlying \nbill, behind us. I hope we can move beyond election year theatrics and \nget to the real work of helping America's low-income families.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boxer-Kennedy amendment and to \nread the letter of Mr. Harned in full.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa \ngiving me the opportunity to sit in this august chair he so ably \noccupies on more than just a few occasions on the Senate floor where we \nseem to have Finance Committee bills on a pretty frequent basis. He \nworks diligently. He has been called away to do some other things so I \nam going to take this opportunity to speak, as we are stuck on an \namendment that is nongermane to this bill, and which was offered with \nthe full knowledge that this would severely jeopardize this bill being \nmoved to passage.\n  Earlier today we had a good debate on daycare funding. We passed an \namendment that added $6 billion more in daycare funding to this bill. \nCurrent funding for the Child Care and Development Fund is $4.8 \nbillion. The committee added $1 billion more. Why did we add this \nincrease in funding? Because in the bill we increased the work \nrequirement by 20 percent.\n  Now I would make the argument we did not actually increase it by 20 \npercent because we give partial credit to the States, so it is probably \nnot a 20-\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\npercent increase. At most, we increase the work requirement in this \nbill by 20 percent. So we also increased the daycare funding.\n  Candidly, there is probably not even that much of a direct \ncorrelation. It is probably not even going to be required to have 20 \npercent more to meet this work requirement, but we did it, anyway.\n  The HELP Committee comes forward with a proposal that is $2.3 billion \nmore in childcare that will be in this bill, and then today we add $6 \nbillion more. That is a 100-percent increase in daycare funding for a \n20-percent increase in work requirements. I am starting to rethink the \nwork requirements at the rate this is costing us.\n  In addition, there is almost $1.5 billion in money the States now \nhold that can only be used for cash assistance. When we passed the 1996 \nwelfare bill, one of the concerns on the left was this money for cash \nassistance be used for cash assistance and it is not to be taken out \nand used for other purposes. So we have a pipeline which only funds \ncash assistance.\n  What we do in this bill is allow this $1.5 billion to be used for \ndaycare. So it is not a $1 billion increase on top of a $2.3 billion \nincrease on top of a $6 billion increase, but on top of a $1.5 billion \nincrease on top of that. This is how much money we now have in this \nbill for childcare. I oppose that. I think that is an extraordinary \nexpansion of a program that, while it has benefits and I certainly \nsupport it, and in the 1996 bill I supported the final compromise which \nadded $1 billion to the daycare funding to get this bill originally \nenacted, but this is excessive and unwarranted, and I would argue not \ngood policy for a variety of different reasons.\n  There is some good policy in this bill, and it is being blocked. I \nthink when the Senator from California offered this amendment, she \nunderstood what was going to happen if she offered this amendment, and \nthat was this bill would be shut down, as the last bill was because of \na blocking amendment on the JOBS bill to create more manufacturing \njobs.\n  What we would like to see done is a limitation of amendments. I would \nfrankly be happy to deal with all relevant amendments to this bill, no \nlimitation on any relevant amendments, but a limitation on political \namendments. Clearly, minimum wage is a political amendment that has \nbeen offered numerous times in the past, always seeming to wait until \nright before election. We never see minimum wage increases offered in \nodd-numbered years. I do not know if my colleagues noticed that, but it \nseems to be offered in even-numbered years. So we have even-numbered \nelection issues that are brought up by Senators Boxer and Kennedy, who \nsaid they would like to see this bill pass. They say they would like to \nsee this extended.\n\n  I tell my colleagues that the Senator from California in 1996 said: I \ncannot support legislation--she was referring to the 1996 welfare \nreform act--which will throw countless children into poverty. No one \nexpects us to solve the welfare problem by punishing children for being \npoor. That is what she said in 1996.\n  So did this bill punish children for being poor? Let us look at the \nblack child poverty rate. The highest rates of poverty in America are \namong black children, at least they have been. At the time Senator \nBoxer made that statement, the poverty rate among African-American \nchildren was 45 percent. She said this bill will punish children by \nthrowing them into poverty, will punish them because we are going to \nrequire their mothers to go to work, we are going to require and put \ntime limits on the amount of time people can spend on welfare because \nwe have an expectation that if one is able-bodied they can work, they \nshould work, and it is beneficial to them and their children if they do \nwork.\n  So we did a whole bunch of things to create not only a stick to get \npeople to work, but a lot of incentives or carrots to make work pay. We \ninvested a lot of money: Daycare, yes; transportation; EIC. We can go \non down the list. We put in a lot of incentives over the last several \nyears to make work pay.\n  What happened? We have the lowest rate of black child poverty ever in \nAmerica. Now, one might ask, well, did the other side learn a lesson? \nDid they understand that actually they were wrong? I know the Senator \nfrom California had a picture, and I know the Senator from Illinois at \nthe time, Ms. Moseley-Braun, had pictures of people in breadlines and \npeople sleeping on grates. Have we now admitted this concept of work \nand the concept of time limitations was, in fact, not a punishment but \nthe real punishment was locking people into dependency and poverty? \nThat is punishing. That is hopelessness.\n  What we provided in this bill was hope. Have they learned? Well, the \nproof is in the pudding. The Senator from California comes forward and \noffers an amendment, shuts down the bill. She will have ample \nopportunities over the next several weeks to offer an amendment on this \nissue.\n  By the way, there have been ample opportunities in the past 15 months \nto offer a minimum wage increase, and yet on a bill everybody is for, \nthat we want to reauthorize--they say they are not trying to block this \nbill--15 months go by in the session and we are going to offer an \namendment to try to sink this bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to offer germane \namendments, to withdraw this amendment, let's get to the substance of \nthis issue. This is an important battle to provide hope and opportunity \nfor the poor in our society, to bring dignity into the lives of \ncommunities that have been struggling to make ends meet.\n  Let's stick to this issue and get it done. Let's show the Senate can \nwork on important issues of the day.\n  One of the things I wanted to talk about--I had talked at length \nabout the general welfare bill and I had mentioned the issue briefly, \nbut I wanted to focus a little more attention on it, the issue the \nPresident proposed on marriage.\n  There has been a lot of debate about marriage in America over the \npast several months. What I am talking about here is the role of the \nGovernment to encourage and promote healthy marriages. The President \nhas a healthy and stable marriage initiative he has put forward.\n  Why do we want to do this? Do we want to force people into bad \nmarriages? Or bring out the shotgun again and get people to marry even \nthough they may not want to? No. That is not what this is about. No one \nis suggesting or has suggested we force anybody into marriage. But here \nis what we have done. The President, and many of us who have been \nworking on this issue for a long time, actually decided to look into \nthe benefits of marriage to children and to women and to men in \npoverty, and determine what and if there are any benefits. Should the \nGovernment be neutral on this issue? Should we stay out of it? Or are \nthere things we can look to that would encourage us to encourage \nmarriage?\n  Here are some of the benefits we have identified in looking at the \ndata. Children in married homes do better in school. They drop out \nless. They have fewer emotional and behavioral problems, less substance \nabuse, less abuse or neglect, including physical abuse, less criminal \nactivity, less early sexual activity, and fewer out-of-wedlock births.\n  If I said I had a drug that could accomplish all these things for \nchildren, we would prescribe it for every child in America. Yet when we \nsay we want to have a program in the welfare system where we are \ndealing with the poorest children in America who, in most cases, are in \nsome of the worst neighborhoods of America, in the roughest communities \nin America, who are living in many cases in very difficult family \nsituations--if we say we want to provide these benefits to them, you \nget the responses: Why do you want to force some rightwing religious \nagenda on us?\n  There are actually people who are opposed to the President's \nproposals, who are opposed to the President's proposals in the face of \nthe benefit to those who we hear a lot about here on the floor of the \nSenate, how we need more for children. We get a lot of proposals from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts that we can help children by increasing \nthe minimum wage while in fact he provides absolutely no evidence that \nis the case. In fact, when we had the discussion today, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said things were better in the 1960s and 1970s and \n1980s, when the minimum wage was high.\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\n  If you go back to the previous chart on black poverty, I will tell \nyou what else is high: Poverty among African-American children. So if \nthere were a connection between the rate of poverty and the minimum \nwage, you would think during this time, when the value of the minimum \nwage was actually going down, black poverty would be going up. Just the \nopposite is the case. Why? Because most people who earn the minimum \nwage aren't the heads of households so there is very little connection \nbetween increasing the minimum wage and poverty. Why? Because poverty \nisn't about a little bit more money.\n  You think: That makes no sense, Senator. Of course it is about more \nmoney.\n  No, it is not. It is about a lot of factors. People who are poor have \nlives that are just as complicated as those of people who are not. It \nis about the status of their mothers and fathers. It is about the \nfamily unit around them. It is about a whole host of issues that \ndetermines whether they will be raised in or out of poverty. To look at \none little factor that has no correlation with poverty is the kind of \nwrongheaded thinking we have suffered under for far too long in this \ninstitution.\n  But in 1996 we changed it. We went to a different model in welfare. \nNow we are trying to change it again. We know that work works. We also \nknow from the data families work.\n  If you look at child poverty, it dramatically increases outside of \nintact marriages. If you have an intact marriage, the percent of time \nin poverty for the average child is 7 percent, if that child's parents \nare married.\n  As we all know, upon divorce many women end up with the children. \nThat is the case certainly the vast majority of time. Many times they \nalso end up on welfare, they end up in poverty, as a result of \nseparation and divorce. That is the case for children born out of \nwedlock.\n  This represents children born within wedlock. Some stay, others get \ndivorced.\n  Here is the situation where children are born out of wedlock and the \nmother subsequently gets married. The child poverty rate is high, but \nnot as high as in the case where mom never gets married. In that case, \nthe percentage of time children spend in poverty is 51 percent of their \nchildhood, on average.\n  So we have a situation where we know marriage has a positive impact \non poverty. Again, we want to focus on poverty and the health of \nchildren. The Senator from Massachusetts spoke about the minimum wage \nand how important it was, and provided no evidence as to how minimum \nwage increases would help reduce poverty among children. Let's look at \nwhat happens, when marriage is involved, to poverty among children. \nMarried families are five times less likely to be in poverty than are \nsingle-parent families. Again, the poverty rate among those who are \nmarried: Among all, 13 percent; among single families, 35 percent of \nsingle-parent families in America are living in poverty.\n  Shouldn't we have a program that at least suggests when a mother has \na child and she is not married and the father is there in the hospital, \nthat we simply ask the question: Are you interested in being married? \nIf both say yes, refer them for counseling to a nonprofit in the \ncommunity, maybe a faith-based organization in the community, somebody \nwho is there to nurture that relationship at a very stressful time in \ntheir lives where, without the proper support and help--and in many \ncases in this situation you don't have a whole lot of family support, \nyou certainly don't have popular culture support for fathers nurturing \nand caring for their children--can't the Government at least suggest \nwhen someone expresses an intent to get married they be given a little \nhelp in working through that process, given the demonstrable benefits \nthat would accrue to them and to their children from an economic point \nof view?\n  But there is more than economics. Children living with two parents \nare 44 percent less likely to be physically abused; 47 percent less \nlikely to suffer physical neglect; 43 percent less likely to suffer \nemotional neglect; 55 percent less likely to suffer from some form of \nchild abuse than children living with a single parent.\n  There are people who will come here to the floor and say the \nGovernment should be neutral with respect to this. In spite of this \nrather strong statement in support of marriage being the optimal place, \na married household being the optimal place in which to raise a child, \nthey will say the Government has no business in this. Yet they will \ncome here and have the Government spend billions of dollars to get \nresults that are one-twentieth of what these results would be in the \nlife of a child.\n  We will spend billions here to reduce neglect by 2 percent, or 5 \npercent. That is OK if we spend billions. That is all right. But if we \ndo something as simple as to say, If you are interested in marriage, we \nwill refer you to counseling because we want to actually help you, if \nyou want to be married, to get married and to stay married, that is \nwrong. Spending billions of dollars on violence prevention programs, \nthat is OK. But the best violence prevention program for a child is a \nhealthy marriage. Spending any money on that, Well, wait, this is a \nright-wing religious attempt to influence people with a religious \nagenda. I think we all know from the debate that is going on that \nmarriage is not just a religious event. It is a civil event. It is a \npublic event. It is a State-sponsored event. It is one that is vitally \nimportant to the future of our society.\n  There is another piece of legislation Senator Bayh, Senator Domenici, \nand I have been working on for quite some time. I am hopeful this will \nnot be as controversial as marriage--that is, fathers should \nparticipate in their children's lives.\n  We actually are going to have some money in this bill that will \nencourage responsible fathers. It is called the Responsible Fatherhood \nInitiative which Senator Bayh of Indiana, Senator Domenici of New \nMexico, and I have been working on for several years. We are able to \nget some money in this bill to promote that.\n  Why? I guess it is obvious. Obviously, we would like to have children \nhave some presence of a father in their lives. We understand there is a \npotential benefit. We also understand there are a lot of fathers \nunfortunately who are not necessarily good fathers, who may not \nnecessarily be a good influence on children's lives. But there is money \nto help those fathers become a positive influence in their lives; to \ntake responsibility for not only providing for them economically, which \nall the previous welfare bills had never focused on--which is getting \nchild support--but actually try to support them in ways beyond the \npaycheck they happen to bring home that day.\n  Why? If you look again at the information we have been able to gather \nabout the difference between children being raised with fathers' \ninvolvement as opposed to fathers being absent, if you have a father \ninvolved in your life versus if you do not have a father involved in \nyour life--if you do not have a father involved, you are two times more \nlikely to abuse drugs and two times more likely to be abused. Why? \nUnfortunately, in far too many relationships, the boyfriend tends to be \nthe greatest abuser of the child who is not his own. You are two times \nmore likely to become involved in a crime, three times more likely to \nfail in school, three times more likely to take your own life, and five \ntimes more likely to live in poverty.\n  Again, if we had a program we were funding here in the Federal \nGovernment out of the Great Society program that could accomplish all \nthese things, we would be pouring billions in this baby. I mean, there \nwould be cries over here to say, if you have this program that can do \nall of this, then we are going to spend--you can't outbid us on this \nbecause we are going to go home and talk about how we are saving lives, \nreducing drug dependency, reducing abuse, reducing crime, improving \neducation, and solving the poverty problem.\n  But then you mention, Oh, by the way, this program has to do with \nfathers taking responsibility. No, wait a minute, we are not going to \ndo that. You are messing around with families here. No. If you have a \nGovernment program that we can hire somebody to fill that role, fine, \nbut we can't encourage fathers. Why would we want to do that? Who are \nwe to be judgmental about getting fathers involved with children's \nlives? That is not the role of the Government. What is the role of\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nGovernment to mess around with the family?\n  Because we know what works. Americans know what works. We have known \nit for 200-plus years. We know that stable families is the place which \nhas the greatest opportunity to produce stable young children and \nadults. Yet somehow we can't be on the side to save the family, we \ncan't be on the side of marriage and responsible fathers. At least we \nhaven't been in the past.\n  I am hopeful that we have an opportunity in this bill to come down on \nthe side of the family, to come down on the side of mothers and fathers \ntaking responsibility for their children from the very beginning. And \nthe Government should be there to simply ask and encourage and provide \nsupport if they want to, not to force anybody into anything.\n  We have an obligation if we know what works to do it. If we know what \nworks and we can have some positive impact on the lives of children, \nthen we have an obligation to do it. We are doing it here with a very \nsmall amount of money. The marriage proposal I think is $100 million \nFederal, $100 million matched by the States, and then a separate $100 \nmillion. It is $300 million. Excuse me. It is $100 million from Federal \nand $100 million from the States over 5 years, which is $1.5 billion. I \nargue that is a fairly modest sum of money for the tremendous benefit \nthat will accrue not just to the children, but which is going to accrue \nto fathers who will take responsibility for their children.\n  Imagine the change in neighborhoods. Imagine the change in \nneighborhoods where 70 percent of kids, 80 percent of kids are born out \nof wedlock, and within a year 90 to 95 percent of those kids have no \nfather involvement in their lives. Imagine the change in the \nneighborhood, which is permeated by single mothers and fathers who are \nattached to nothing except other irresponsible fathers--we call those \ngangs--or they are not attached to that neighborhood at all because \nthey are in jail. Imagine the neighborhoods with fathers in the homes. \nImagine the neighborhoods with role models of responsible manhood and \nfatherhood.\n  I have talked to so many people who grew up in neighborhoods with \nhigh concentrations of fatherlessness and how they were inspired by the \none or two fathers they knew who weren't their own, but the one or two \nmen in the community who were responsible fathers who gave them hope \nand who taught them responsibility. Imagine how we could change \nneighborhoods if we simply brought mothers and fathers back together in \nthose neighborhoods, and how that dynamic would change.\n  Dare we come down on that side? Dare we invest in trying to change \ntheir pathology that has attacked so many neighborhoods in our society? \nI say yes. I say we have an obligation to do that.\n  Let me get to the economics of this. Fatherhood involvement increases \nchild support. The States that, unfortunately as a result of the 1996 \nWofford law, are concerned about establishing paternity and getting the \nmoney, I say to the States, which will be the instrument by which these \nprograms will be implemented, they will have to play a part. They will \nhave to put up some money to do this.\n  I make the argument it is to their financial benefit to do it. Even \nthough it will cost some money for the programs, I make the argument to \nthe States that if you can get fathers involved in the lives of their \nchildren, you will not have to spend as much time chasing down fathers \nto provide child support, and in many cases not getting that child \nsupport, but you will have a better connection with your children which \nmeans a better life, and we will actually save the States some money.\n  I hate to make the economic arguments to the States, but those are \nthe facts. I am hopeful the States will understand this is not just \ngood for their neighborhood, this is not just good for men, it is not \njust good for women and for children, and for society at large, it is \nalso good for their bottom line and their ability to provide services \nto the poor.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. It is not perfect. There are \nthings in this bill I do not like. But we move the ball forward. We \nincrease work a modest amount, a responsible amount. As someone who was \nin this chair leading the fight in 1996 for this bill and wanting the \ntough requirements on work, I am not someone who believes we need to \ndramatically increase that requirement. I know there will be an \namendment potentially if we ever get to this bill to increase the work \nrequirement to 40 hours. I will vote against that. The reason is \nbecause we do in this bill increase the actual work requirement from 20 \nhours to 24.\n  What does that mean? That means the amount of hours someone must be \nin work in order to be eligible for this program, assuming they did not \nget off the program to work themselves, they are actually on welfare \nbut working, is increased from 20 to 24 hours. Then we have an \nadditional 10 hours that was in the 1996 act that stays the same, an \nadditional 10 hours to bring the total up to 34 hours. That 10 hours \nbeing sort of wraparound issues, whether it is job search or other \ntypes of improvement that individuals may be working on to get a better \njob, to increase their educational skills, get their GED, whatever the \ncase may be.\n  It is important to have a tougher work requirement to take single \nmothers out of the home for 40 hours a week, of which 16 of those hours \nwill not be actually working--I don't see the benefit. What we have \nseen from all the studies is the thing that works the most is work. \nWhile these women--it is predominantly, overwhelmingly women--are not \nin a job outside of welfare, not on a payroll outside of welfare, they \nstill are working and getting work experience.\n  The additional time is well spent to actually find a job outside of \nwelfare, but I don't think at least at that point in time, because of \nthe transition of a 40-hour requirement, that is going to be beneficial \nin the long term for these women. I will not support that.\n  I would have supported a modest increase in daycare funding. What we \nhave done is fundamentally change the expectation of what daycare is. \nThis is more money than people on welfare could ever hope to need when \nit comes to daycare. This is a whole other agenda trying to be advanced \non the bill in the name of welfare to work. But it is simply universal \ndaycare under a different guise. I will not support that.\n  But we have a lot of steps taken in the right direction in this bill. \nI am hopeful, again, we can get bipartisan cooperation from people who \nunderstand the importance of this legislation in getting it passed and \nputting those work requirements back on 28 States that right now do not \nhave them so we can begin the process again in turning lives around and \nimproving the quality of lives of children in the poorest neighborhoods \nin our society.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  HARRY BURK REID, MY 15TH GRANDCHILD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish the people I work with in the Senate \nknew my father. My father was named Harry Reid, the same name I have. I \nalways looked up to my dad. My dad was uneducated. He didn't graduate \nfrom eighth grade, but he was very smart. My father read a lot and he \ncould do things people in college could not do.\n  For example, he was a miner and he could go underground with a \ncompass, come above ground and do a map. People in college cannot do \nthat. He could do underground mapping. He was a carpenter. He could \ncompletely overhaul an engine, a valve job, the whole works. He was a \nblacksmith, hit tempered steel, all that kind of stuff. And he was a \nmuch bigger man than I. I always admired his physical strength. He \ncould put a 50-gallon drum full of water or gas, whatever, in the back \nof a truck by himself.\n\n  The reason I mention Harry Reid tonight, my father, is last night my \n15th grandchild was born, a little boy. As I said, I have 15 \ngrandchildren now. The reason I mention my father is because my son \ntold me, this morning, that they have named my grandson after me. So I \nhave a little grandson named Harry Reid.\n  I hope, as the years go by, that little boy will look at his \ngrandfather in the same way that I looked at my dad.\n  I am proud of the name Harry Reid. I even sign my ``H'' like my dad \ndid. My\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\ndad said once he saw on a window an ``H'' like that, like I sign my \nname. So that is the way children are in looking up to their parents \nand grandparents.\n  As I said, I hope I can set an example that my grandson will respect \nand admire. I know it is a burden, and I say this seriously, to have \nthe name Harry Reid, because I have a lot of people who like me, but I \nhave a lot of people who do not like me because of my political stands.\n  But separate and apart from all that, I hope my grandson will have an \nexample set by me that is one he will believe in--family and keeping \nfamilies together--and being a young man who conducts himself in a \nproper manner, and that, hopefully, some of the things I have done and \nwill do will be something he will look to as a role model that maybe he \nwill adhere to.\n  So I want the Record to reflect how much I appreciate my son Josh and \nhis lovely wife Tamsen for giving me this great honor and to have \nsomeone who, through all generations of time, will be the third Harry \nReid. I am not a junior because my dad had no middle name. And this \nlittle boy is not a junior, or could not be anyway, because I am not \nhis father. His name is different. He has a different middle name, \nBurk, named after his other grandparents, their last name.\n  So anyway, I am flattered and respectful of my son and daughter-in-\nlaw for naming the child after me. I want the Record to reflect how \nmuch I love and appreciate my son Josh and all my children who have \ndone so much to honor me with their exemplary lives, at least from a \nparent's perspective.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently discussing plans both for \nlater tonight and tomorrow and the next 2 weeks. I had the opportunity \nto talk to the Democratic leader, and that discussion will go on for a \nwhile. While we are in, and have been in a quorum call, I wanted to \ntake the opportunity to address an issue that has to do with gasoline \nprices, energy policy, something that every single American who drives \nor benefits from driving is feeling; that is, the price at the gasoline \npump.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was in the news this \nmorning expressing his concern about rising gasoline prices. He is \nright to be concerned. We are all concerned. But what he should be \nconcerned about is his own dismal record in terms of addressing this \nvery issue. Again and again, he has taken positions that result not in \nwhat Americans want--that is, lower gas prices--but again and again in \nhis position as a Senator and before, he has been on the other side and \nengaged in policies and supporting policies that drive the price of \ngasoline higher and higher.\n  The Senate record is familiar to most, but in 1983, when he was \nLieutenant Governor in Massachusetts, the Dukakis-Kerry administration \nsupported a $50 million gas tax hike on the citizens of Massachusetts. \nIn 1993, in the Senate, he voted for the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history, the Clinton tax bill, which increased the Federal \ngasoline tax by 4.3 cents. He also voted twice for the Clinton-Gore Btu \ntax which, had it been signed into law, would have increased gas taxes \nby another 7.5 cents per gallon.\n  The following year he backed a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for \nall Americans. He wrote a letter at that time to the Boston Globe \nexpressing his disappointment that a scorecard issued by a deficit \nreduction organization in Washington did not accurately reflect his \nsupport for this half-dollar gas tax increase.\n  The list goes on. The Senator from Massachusetts also wants the \nUnited States to accept the Kyoto Protocol which, according to Wharton \nEconomic Forecasting Associates, would raise gasoline prices an \nadditional 65 cents per gallon. And just last year, Senator Kerry voted \nfor climate change legislation which would have imposed a Kyoto-style \nregulation on 80 percent of the U.S. economy and would have raised \ngasoline prices by 40 cents a gallon.\n  That is a little bit of the history and the background for this new \nconcern about gasoline prices by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Put aside a moment the impact that these proposals would have had on \nan issue that we have talked a lot about on the floor today, and that \nis jobs and the importance of job creation. The most immediate impact, \nthe most immediate result of Senator Kerry's positions would be to \nforce America's consumers to pay at least a dollar more for each gallon \nof gasoline they purchase, and that is a conservative estimate.\n  It is also worth noting that Senator Kerry has consistently opposed \nany increase in domestic production of energy and any proposal that \nwould reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The Energy bill, which we \nall know fell two votes short in the Senate last year, is probably the \nmost recent example. Senator Kerry has expressed opposition to this \nmeasure, although he was not present in the Senate when we cast that \ncritical vote on the conference report.\n\n  In opposing the Energy bill, Senator Kerry is opposing not just the \ncreation of 800,000 new jobs, he is opposing the development of new \ndomestic resources, new resources that come in the United States, \nincluding such things as renewable resources such as wind and solar \nenergy. To that you could add clean burning ethanol, and to that you \ncould add advanced coal technology or zero emission nuclear energy and, \nyes, the development of domestic oil and gas resources as well.\n  I come to the floor to mention all of this, especially mentioning his \nrecord on the floor of the Senate, because it is simply very difficult \nto take seriously Senator Kerry when he says he is concerned about high \ngas prices and then blames others for not having addressed them. \nThroughout his career, Senator Kerry has consistently taken positions \nthat will result in even higher gas prices and lower domestic supplies \nof energy and jobs lost.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts, indeed, wants to engage in a \nserious discussion about energy policy, I ask that he come back to the \nSenate and help us do what we should be doing, and that is pass an \nEnergy bill which he and his party unfortunately have been blocking for \nmonths.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to review the record since we had this \navailable time. I do challenge Senator Kerry to engage in a serious \ndiscussion about helping us pass that very policy which we know would \nlower gasoline prices in the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, having just heard the majority leader come \nto the floor of the Senate and discuss the record of my colleague, \nSenator John Kerry, I thought it might be useful to respond just a bit.\n  This Chamber, given some of the dialog--and especially the dialog I \nheard a few minutes ago--only lacks the balloons, the buttons, and the \nbrass band for being a political convention in a full-scale support of \na candidate in a Presidential operation, a Presidential campaign.\n  It is not my desire nor my intent to talk about the Presidential \nrace. But when I hear people come to the floor and decide to talk about \nJohn Kerry's record on energy as a Member of the Senate, I think it is \nimportant to respond.\n  There are a great many allegations being made about Senator John \nKerry's record and many--most that I have heard recently--have been \nflat out untrue, just wrong. One of the great things about the First \nAmendment in this country is you can say whatever you want to say and, \nin politics, you can misrepresent someone's record and nobody seems to \ncare very much.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  Let me talk for a couple of minutes about these issues. First of all, \nlet's talk about the energy bill. We don't have an energy bill right \nnow. Do you know why? It failed by two votes in the Senate. I voted for \nit. So did the minority leader. Do you know why it failed by two votes \nin the Senate? Because the majority leader in the U.S. House stuck a \nprovision in that bill that cost him four, or five, or six votes \nagainst the bill in the Senate. Now I hear the majority leader of the \nU.S. House blame Senator Daschle for us not having an energy bill. I \nlooked at that in the paper and I thought, what on earth can he be \nthinking about? He killed the energy bill by sticking in this insidious \nprovision, a retroactive waiver on MTBE liability. He stuck that \nprovision in. He demanded it. It was killed on the floor of the Senate \nby two votes.\n  That bill would have passed the Senate easily without that provision \nstuck in by the majority leader of the U.S. House. So to have him talk \nabout Senator Daschle as somehow holding up the energy bill in this \ncountry doesn't make much sense to me. It is just wrong. He is the one \nwho killed that bill on the floor of the Senate with this provision \nthat he inserted.\n  As to the comments this evening, we have the majority leader come to \nthe floor of the Senate and he seems to imply that my colleague, John \nKerry, is against production, against conservation, against efficiency, \nagainst renewables. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. I can tell you what \nSenator Kerry is for. I sat in meeting after meeting with him over \nrecent years on energy policy, most of which I agree with him on. \nSometimes we disagreed.\n  I will tell you something. This is a man who is very concerned about \nenergy policy in this country. When we talk about these issues, it \nseems to me it would best behoove us to talk seriously about serious \nissues.\n  That has not been the case with respect to Senator Kerry's record on \nenergy, as misrepresented on the floor of the Senate this evening. So \nlet's talk about a couple of these issues.\n  Renewable energy: Senator Kerry supports renewable energy--wind \nenergy, biodiesel energy, a whole series of areas of renewable energy--\nthat will improve this country's energy supply and extend America's \nenergy supply. He supports it.\n  Efficiency titles in the Energy bill: Senator Kerry very much \nsupports improved efficiency of all the appliances we use every single \nday.\n  Conservation: Senator Kerry has a very strong record on conservation, \nand the same is true with respect to production.\n  There has been a lot of misrepresentation. In fact, I heard some \nmisrepresentation recently that Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-a-\ngallon gas tax increase. That is totally untrue, just wrong, flat out \nwrong.\n  Talk is cheap so people can come here and assert whatever they like, \nbut when I hear it, I am going to come to the floor of the Senate and \nsay it is not true.\n  The fact is, this country chooses its leader by going to the ballot \nbox, and this country is owed a serious debate about serious issues. \nRegrettably, it too seldom gets a serious debate about serious issues. \nYes, energy is a serious issue and we have a very serious energy \nproblem and we need an Energy bill passed in the U.S. Congress. Do not \nblame Democrats for the failure to pass an Energy bill. It failed in \nthe Senate by two votes. It passed the House and failed in the Senate \nby two votes, and everyone here understands that at least four or five \nof those two votes that would have been used to pass that bill resulted \nin a negative vote because of what the majority leader in the House \ndid. Everyone understands that. All you have to do is read a newspaper \nand you will understand that. People are concerned about the price of \ngasoline in this country, and they should be. When I say we need an \nenergy policy, we are now close to 60 percent of our oil coming from \noff our shores, often from troubled parts of the world. That is \ndangerous. The fact is, our economy is reliant on energy sources from \nparts of the world that are very troubled. If we want to keep importing \noil from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, and other parts of the \nworld, the fact is it will injure us inevitably, it will injure our \neconomy, and it will injure our opportunity to create new jobs, expand \nand provide hope and opportunity for the American people.\n  We need to go much further than the kind of debate we traditionally \nheld on energy issues, and that is where Senator Kerry talked about the \nfuture. We need to talk about issues such as hydrogen and fuel cells \nand pole-vault over some of this to talk about how we are going to \navoid in the future putting gasoline through carburetors and being \ndependent on OPEC countries.\n  Tomorrow there is a meeting of OPEC ministers. They already cut \nproduction and are talking about cutting production again. This country \nought to jawbone and use the leverage we have to say we need increased \nproduction. We have gas prices that are going through the roof.\n  I do not know what the President is going to do, whether he is going \nto involve himself and try to jawbone OPEC, but I think he should. We \nhave a serious problem, and it is not just the current spike in gas \nprices. That happens. It is now happening because of a series of \nfactors. One is the cutback in OPEC production. The second is an \nimbalance with respect to fuels that are coming into refineries and the \nlack of refinery capacity. There is a whole series of factors. Even as \nwe address the shorter term, we have to think about the longer term.\n\n  I will say to those who want to be critical of Senator Kerry's \nrecord, there is nobody in the Senate, in my judgment, who has cared \nmore and worked harder for longer term solutions for an energy policy \nin this country. It does not serve the country or responsible political \ndebate to come to the Senate and slap people around with bad \ninformation. I am sick and tired of that. If you want to turn this into \na political convention, get some balloons, bunting, put up crepe paper, \nhire a brass band, and pretend this is a political convention. But it \nis not a political convention. This is the Chamber of the United States \nSenate, and we ought to, it seems to me, talk about what the real \npolicy positions are of the respective candidates and have a \ncompetition of ideas.\n  I, frankly, think both political parties have something good to offer \nthis country, and the interaction of both parties and responsible \ndebate over a long period of time strengthens our country. But I get a \nlittle weary of this machine that is so relentless in trying to \nmisrepresent someone's position and slap that misrepresentation around \nfor a while. That is not the way this Presidential campaign ought to be \nwaged. It is not fair to Senator Kerry, who is not in this Chamber, for \npeople to come and mischaracterize his record. I understand people have \nthe right to do it. I am just saying it is not fair. So I hope as we \nbegin to think through some of these issues in the future that we \nunderstand there is a place for a political campaign for the Presidency \nin this country. It is in Ohio, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, Texas, \nand California--all around America--and there the bands do play, and \nthere the balloons are used to great effect, and people love the \npolitical system. That is fine. But I worry a lot about the Senate \nChamber being used to misrepresent someone's position on an issue that \nis as important as this.\n  What bothered me and persuaded me to come to the Senate floor this \nmoment are two things: One is something I read in the newspaper about 2 \nor 3 days ago in which the allegation by the majority leader of the \nother body was it was Senator Daschle who was holding up an Energy \nbill. Nonsense. The majority leader of the other body is the one who \nkilled the Energy bill by putting in this insidious provision, a \nretroactive waiver of MTBE liability. That is a plain fact.\n  Second, I heard a speech on the floor of the Senate a moment ago that \nwas just a pure campaign speech that had nothing to do with the merits \non one side. It had everything to do with misrepresenting the merits on \nthe other side. That is unfair. I am going to come to the floor again \nwhen I hear this done.\n  I hope the American people are treated to a serious debate about \nserious issues. Energy is a serious issue. John Kerry is a serious \ncandidate for the Presidency, and he has strong positions, I think \ndefensible positions, on energy dealing with production, conservation, \nefficiency, renewables, and more. I am sure if he were here to\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nstand up and speak in response to the majority leader, he would want to \ndo that.\n  I came to the floor simply to say I hope the American people are \ntreated to a debate that is accurate about energy positions and energy \npolicy by the two candidates. I, for one, feel very comfortable with \nthe long-term view of energy policy as advocated by Senator John Kerry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not been able to hear all of the \nstatement of the Senator from North Dakota, but I am sure, as always, \nit was right on the point. There is something I would like to direct in \nthe form of a question to him.\n  I was asked to appear on a television show this afternoon, and I was \nhappy to do that. The reason I appeared on the show was to respond to \nsome TV ads that are starting tomorrow where the Bush campaign is \npaying millions of dollars to run an ad around the country that is \nabsolutely fabricated. The ad said Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax increase. Is the Senator aware that this statement \nis baseless, never happened, and that millions of dollars are going to \nbe spent starting tomorrow saying Senator Kerry has previously in the \nSenate voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in taxes for gasoline?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say in response to the question from the \nSenator from Nevada, I have done what little research I could, because \nI understood this ad was being set to run across the country that said \nSenator Kerry has voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase. My \nunderstanding is it is simply untrue. If somebody has evidence of which \nI am not aware, bring it to the floor. My understanding is it is not \ntrue.\n  It is similarly not true that Senator Kerry is opposed to renewable \nfuels, opposed to conservation, opposed to increased efficiency of \nappliances which was alleged a few minutes ago on the Senate floor. \nThey are not grounded in fact.\n  As I said, everybody has a right to say these things. It is the \npolitical system. This is the floor of the Senate, and those of us who \nhear something we know is demonstrably false also have a right to come \nto the floor to say this is not the best of what this system has to \noffer the American people. This ought to be a competition of ideas of \nboth sides using facts and saying here is where one stands and here is \nwhere the other stands, and here is why and take your pick. That is \nwhat the political system ought to be about.\n  To the extent there are exaggerations--and there sure are in \npolitics; they occur on the political stage all around the country--\nthat is fine as well; that is politics.\n  It is a bit different especially to come to the Senate floor and \nmisrepresent the record of Senator Kerry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment 2943, which is \nthe Cornyn-Bingaman amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This amendment is very simple. It would correct a \ntechnical problem caused during the passage of the Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996. Section 411 of the welfare \nlaw reads that State and local governments may not use their own \nresources to provide nonemergency health services to nonqualified \nimmigrants unless the State has passed new legislation authorizing such \nexpenditures.\n  This provision has caused quite a bit of confusion. As a matter of \nfact, when I was Attorney General of Texas I was asked to interpret \nthis provision. It was during the course of that official action that I \ndiscovered the Federal law, because our State legislature had not \nacted, had unintended consequences. It is safe to say this provision \nhas been read by State and local governments with varying \ninterpretations.\n  Essentially, the current law imposes a double standard on State and \nlocal governments. Because certain Federal public health programs are \nexempt from this requirement, identical State and local government \nhealth programs are not. The end result is more legal and \nadministrative costs on State and local governments, even though the \nprovision has no enforcement mechanism. Even without the confusion, \nsection 411 makes no practical sense. We should not put up more \nroadblocks for those who want to provide preventive treatment, \nespecially when it comes to potential community problems such as \ninfectious diseases.\n  By giving localities control over preventive services, here again at \ntheir own expense, not at Federal taxpayers' expense, we ensure local \nfunds are spent where the people who know best believe they should be \nspent. Ultimately, this will have the effect of driving down health \ncare costs by preventing treatable illnesses before they become acute \nand before they require expensive taxpayer-supported care, usually in \nan emergency room where anyone, no matter who they are, knows they can \nbe treated and indeed must be treated according to a Federal mandate \nwhich I know is an interest of the presiding Senator, particularly \nbecause it is an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  Our amendment would simply strike the word ``health'' from section \n411 of the welfare law. This step clarifies that State and local \ngovernments can use their own funds to provide health services to \nimmigrants, including primary and preventive health care and infectious \ndisease services, without enacting a new law. It is a commonsense step \nand one I hope my colleagues will support.\n  This amendment is also widely supported by several well-respected \nnational associations, including the American Hospital Association, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals and Public Health Systems, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Catholic Health Association.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  I also want to briefly discuss another amendment, No. 2942. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Lieberman be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Connecticut has a deep understanding of \nthe importance of child support enforcement, and I like me, learned \nabout how critical that issue is during his service as his State's \nattorney general, as I did during my service as attorney general of my \nState.\n  This amendment features two positive reforms for child support \nenforcement. It encourages States to adopt electronic payment systems \nby 2008. While States can opt out of that if they choose to, it will \nhelp get payments to custodial parents more quickly than is currently \ndone now. It creates an option for States to centralize all child \nsupport payments to reduce confusion among employers who withhold child \nsupport payments from the wages of their employees, and it will ensure \nchildren get the financial support they need on time which, of course, \nis our universal goal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this second amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from each of these \norganizations be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                                                   March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Bingaman: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Counties (NACo), I would like to \n     express our support for the Cornyn-Bingaman amendment to the \n     Personal Responsibility, Work, and Family Promotion Act of \n     2003. The amendment, as you know, would clarify that states\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n     and counties may use their own funds to provide critical \n     preventative health care services to immigrants.\n       NACo is the only national organization representing county \n     governments. Many of our country's 3066 counties own and \n     operate hospitals and other health care facilities. Without \n     the passage of this amendment, county governments are placed \n     in a precarious position if they decide to provide \n     preventative care to unqualified immigrants in order to \n     protect the local community's health. As has been repeatedly \n     demonstrated, the provision of preventative care is less \n     costly over time than providing evasive services in emergency \n     rooms. However, the cost savings to preventative care are far \n     outweighed by the protection provided to the community's \n     public health as a whole.\n       Counties serve as safety-net providers, ultimately \n     financing and providing care for our Medicaid ineligible and \n     un-enrolled populations. We support the ability to finance \n     this care in the most appropriate manner.\n       Thank you for your leadership and efforts to ensure that \n     counties are able to protect the health of our local \n     communities. We look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The Catholic Health\n\n\n                             Association of the United States,\n\n                                    St. Louis, MO, March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA), the national \n     leadership organization of more then 2,000 Catholic health \n     care sponsors, systems, facilities, and related \n     organizations, I am writing in support of your efforts to \n     ensure that state and local governments have the ability to \n     use their funds to provide non-emergency health services to \n     legal and undocumented immigrants.\n       Specifically, CHA supports your amendment to strike the \n     word ``health'' from Section 411 of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (PRWORA), which has been interpreted by some states to \n     prohibit the use of any state and local funds to provide \n     lifesaving health care to immigrants. This interpretation \n     stands in sharp contrast to the thrust of PRWORA, which \n     generally gave states greater authority to determine welfare \n     rules, and the resulting confusion has had a negative impact \n     on the health of immigrants in many states.\n       By clarifying that states and local governments may use \n     their own funds to provide health services to immigrants, \n     including important preventive care, your amendment can help \n     ensure that hospitals and clinics have the clarity they need \n     to serve the best interest of all of their patients. As \n     organizations founded in a faith tradition and committed to \n     the principles of Catholic social justice teaching, Catholic \n     hospitals recognize and affirm the inherent dignity of every \n     human being. Your amendment helps to further that principle.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to ensure that state and \n     local governments have the certainty they need to use their \n     own funds to provide appropriate health care to all \n     immigrants. If we can be of any assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Rev. Michael D. Place, STD,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, on the passage of her amendment to increase the \nmandatory funding levels for the Child Care and Development Fund by $6 \nbillion over 5 years. I enthusiastically support this amendment, as it \nis designed to help so many families with young children by ensuring \nthat those children are properly cared for while their parents are at \nwork.\n  Unfortunately, we know that more than 10 million children in the \nUnited States are left unsupervised after school on a regular basis. We \nknow that the welfare rolls have been cut nearly 60 percent since 1996, \nand therefore, this statistic will only continue to grow as more and \nmore parents work. Further, with cuts in State childcare funding, many \nworking families are faced with no care for their children due to \nwaiting lists and higher childcare costs.\n  But, with the passage of this amendment, my home State of Ohio alone \nwould receive over $34 million in additional childcare funds next \nfiscal year and more than $266 million over the next 5 years. This \ntranslates into more children receiving care and more parents with the \npeace of mind that their children are being properly attended to while \nthey cannot be at home.\n  Again, I commend Senator Snowe for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in discussion now determining the \nbest pathway to completion on the underlying bill, the welfare bill, an \nimportant bill that I know both sides of the aisle do want to \nappropriately address, through amendments and through the debate \nprocess, and we are working on the best way to accomplish that.\n  As I set out really 3 weeks ago, but in the early part of last week, \nwe have set this week aside to address welfare and we are doing just \nthat. But I really need to do everything possible to see that we do \ncomplete it this weekend. To help accomplish that, I will be sending a \ncloture motion to the desk on the pending committee substitute.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 305, H.R. 4, an act to reauthorize \n     and improve the program of block grants to States for \n     temporary assistance for needy families, improve access to \n     quality child care, and for other purposes.\n\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

I ask unanimous consent the quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3347-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3347-S3359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on the war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from Active Duty, from the National Guard, \nand from the Reserves, are all volunteers. They exemplify the very \nessence of what it means to be patriotic.\n  It is extremely important that we take action. Many in this body will \nremember that we proposed to do this last year as we were considering \nthe Defense authorization bill. Our effort was not successful, although \nmany Senators voted to go ahead with this legislative provision. The \nadministration was not in favor, and the amendment failed.\n  I am glad we are able to reintroduce it this year. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with us to find an \nappropriate time when we can bring it up for a vote, or we can add it \nas an amendment to one of the bills that will be working its way \nthrough the Senate later this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak on the welfare reform bill.\n  This has been an extraordinarily successful initiative which we began \na few years ago. Its success is tied with the fact that States have \nbeen given a great deal more flexibility in the area of how they handle \ntheir welfare account. The fact is, we have set up as a purpose, as a \ngovernment, that people who are on welfare will be given the \nopportunity, the skills, and the incentives to move off of welfare and \nmove into a work environment, which is something that gives them \npersonal credibility and personal self-respect, and at the same time \nassists us in reducing the public welfare rolls. It has been a huge and \noverwhelming success.\n  One of the elements of moving off of welfare, of course, is the need \nof parents to have transitional support, especially single mothers as \nthey go into the workforce while dealing with their children during the \ntime they are working; in other words, some sort of childcare \nassistance.\n  As part of this bill, we intend to offer an amendment for \nreauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant Program, \ncalled the Caring for Children Act of 2003.\n  This amendment came out of the committee which I chair, the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee, unanimously. It came out with \nbipartisan support, obviously.\n  It is an attempt to update our childcare block grant initiative and \nmake it more meaningful for the issues of today. It also gives the \ndollars it needs to be effective.\n  The bill will not only stress increased spending, it has $1 billion \nof new funding from the discretionary accounts.\n  Earlier today, there was a vote on an initiative to add $6 billion \nover 5 years to the childcare development grant. That money would be \nmandatory, and it was not paid for; it was outside the budget. There \nwas a euphemistic attempt to pay for it--a superficial attempt--\nactually, what amounted to the ultimate shell game attempt as an offset \nwhich was cited and which has been used on, I believe, 17 different \noccasions as a claimed offset in this body.\n  The real effect of the bill was to go way outside the budget and add \na huge new tranche of dollars beyond the budget which would be fine had \nit been realistically offset. But it wasn't.\n  This bill has in it a true increase which is an appropriate increase \nof $1 billion over that period of the bill. That is a significant \ninfusion of new funds. Plus it addresses some of the concerns of the \nprogram, one of the concerns being as children are getting childcare \nthey should also be getting some sort of development in the capacity of \nlearning. Obviously, these are very young children. But they should \nhave a learning component in their childcare experience, something that \nwill put them in a position where they will be able to be at a level \nwhere their peers are--other young children who are receiving \nchildcare.\n  It has language in it which encourages the States to include a \nvoluntary guideline initiative in the area of prereading and language \nskills. The absolutely critical essence of learning is language skills \nand the ability to do phonics and identify letters and be able to get \nready for reading. This bill has in it that language.\n  It also has in it a commitment to low-income parents. At least 70 \npercent of these dollars has the flow-through stage, actually, to the \nparents--in many cases a single parent. So the parent is getting the \nbenefits. And we aren't simply siphoning it off into the bureaucracy, \nwhich often happens, regrettably, through administrative overhead but, \nrather, directing this money to the hands of the parents, especially \nthe low-income parent so the parent can use this to assist them in \ntransitioning off the welfare rolls by taking care of their children \nduring the workday.\n\n  It gives parents a significant amount of choice. They can use \ndifferent daycare types of facilities. Some which are faith-based are \nallowed to be used, or they can use it even if it is being provided by \nrelatives and neighbors. That is important.\n  Further, the bill addresses a need to make sure that States focus on \nimproving the quality of childcare. This is a very significant concern \nthat many of us have, which is that a lot of the childcare today is, \nunfortunately, not of a quality that gives the child the support \nservices they need or the academic assistance they might need in order \nto be brought up to speed with peers who are in different childcare \ndelivery systems.\n  It allows States to set aside a certain percentage of the money in \norder to assess quality and try to improve quality. This gives the \nStates more flexibility in this area, but it also gives them an impetus \nto go in the right direction.\n  It is, therefore, a bill which does a lot of good.\n  As I mentioned, it was reported out of our committee unanimously. It \nwill be, hopefully, added to the base bill either by a formal vote or \nas part of the managers' amendment.\n  But we have to get back to the fundamental quandary which confronts \nus today, which is that the base welfare reform bill that is pending \nbefore the Congress is being held up by the other side of the aisle.\n  This is becoming a pattern of obstruction which we have seen \nthroughout this session of the Congress, and it appears its intensity \nis actually increasing. Bills are coming to the floor\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nnow which are important pieces of legislation on which there is a \ngeneral consensus.\n  As I mentioned, this language reported out of our committee to \nstrengthen the block grants for childcare was reported unanimously. Yet \nthese bills are being stopped dead in their tracks by the insistence of \nthe other side of the aisle to put on these bills extraneous issues \nwhich are of a politically charged nature, the purpose of which is not \nto pass them but simply to generate a political vote which can be used \nin the coming election.\n  We all do that. We all set up the political votes. But they should \nnot be used as aggressively as they are today by the Democratic Party \nas a means of stopping legitimate legislation. The obstruction coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle is unconscionable.\n  Last week, for example, a bill which would have corrected the \nproblems which many of our manufacturers in this country are going to \nconfront, specifically a duty that is going to be assessed on their \ngoods sold overseas, a duty which could go up as high as 18 percent--\nand that duty was a function of the fact we lost a World Trade court \ndecision which allows this duty to go forward--that bill which would \nhave corrected that, put an end to the duty and thus allow \nmanufacturing jobs and service-oriented jobs in the United States to \ncontinue to expand and flourish, that bill was killed in this Senate \nbecause of extraneous issues which the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocratic Party, decided they wanted to bring forward. They would not \nallow the bill to go forward without those extraneous issues being \nvoted on.\n  The bill had absolute consensus. There was a belief, there is a \nbelief, there should be a belief, that American jobs should not be lost \nas a result of our tax laws being found illegal by a body which we \nsubscribe to, the World Trade Organization, and that we should correct \nthat problem, and we can correct it rather effectively, and that \ncorrection will save jobs in the United States. That will not happen \nnow because of the obstruction coming from the other side of the aisle. \nIt is one in a series of obstructions.\n  Now we see the exact same thing happen in the area of welfare reform. \nLiterally, in the last 5 years, there have been very few laws as \nsuccessful that this Congress has passed as welfare reform. It was so \nsuccessful--it was an idea put forward on this side of the aisle--once \nit passed and started to work, it was immediately adopted by the other \nside of the aisle as theirs.\n  President Clinton had the right to take credit; he was President when \nthe bill was passed. He was President and takes credit as one of the \nstrong elements of service of his Presidency. And I am glad he takes \ncredit.\n  Now when we try to reauthorize and improve it significantly through \nthe block grant proposal which we brought out of our bipartisan \ncommittee, now when we try to move the bill forward so we can continue \nwith the welfare reform experience of the last few years and make sure \nthat experience continues to allow people to move from public \nassistance to work and give people self-confidence, self-respect, and \nself-esteem as a result of attaining work, that bill has been stopped \nonce again by the Democratic membership of this body coming forward and \nsaying they want to cast a political vote on an unrelated issue.\n  It is these actions that one has to question the purpose. Why, when \nbills have been agreed to which will significantly improve the \nlifestyle of Americans, the number of jobs Americans have in the case \nof the tax bill which was just stopped last week, or the number of \npeople moving from welfare to work, which is getting good jobs and \nmoving out of a public assistance situation and getting self-respect, \nwhy are these bills being stopped for purely political purposes by the \nother side of the aisle bringing forward extraneous amendments.\n\n  It is an unconscionable action, in my opinion. It is regrettable that \nthe childcare block grant proposal, the reauthorization of which came \nout of our committee unanimously and which represents a significant \nimprovement, especially in this area of trying to get learning into the \nchildcare experience, trying to get quality in the childcare \nexperience, giving States more flexibility and putting more money into \nthe program in the context of a responsible budget bill, why that would \nbe stopped also is beyond me. It is not beyond me; it is fairly \nobvious. The purpose here is to make a political statement. It is a \npolitical statement, come heck or high water. It does not matter that \nthe making of the political statement will cost people jobs and make it \nharder to move from welfare to work, creating a poorer and a less well-\nfinanced childcare block grant program.\n  It is unfortunate. It is the politics of the day. I know the American \npeople do not focus too much on what we do in the Senate in the day-to-\nday regime. I hope the American people take the time to learn what has \ntranspired in this body in the last 6 to 8 months. The obstructionism \non the other side of the aisle has become the cause of the day, the \npurpose of every event. This obstructionism continues and grows as we \nmove closer to the election. The practical effect of this \nobstructionism coming from the other side of the aisle is that good \nthings which help working Americans keep jobs, move from welfare to \nwork, ensuring their kids have quality daycare, good things like that \nare being stopped as a result of this unrequited obstructionism coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Nevada Champions\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, \nand I will take a couple of minutes and exercise our privileges as \nSenators to brag a little bit about our State and the recent \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada basketball team and their \nrise to the Sweet 16.\n  The Nevada Wolf Pack brought a lot of pride to our State. It is not a \nschool known for basketball. Certainly, they had more football success \nin the years past. However, this year they surprised many in the \nNation. It was obviously a heart-breaking loss to Georgia Tech last \nweek. But Coach Trent Johnson, the whole Wolf Pack team and all the \npeople surrounded with the program deserve a lot of credit for the \nseason they put together. We expect big things from them in the future.\n  For a school such as the University of Nevada, a school that does not \nhave the reputation of the University of Connecticut or Duke, it is \nmore difficult to get the kind of players to go up to Reno to play \nbasketball. They have players from Virginia City, Elko, and some of the \nother small towns around Nevada.\n  Coach Johnson crafted a team providing a good lesson for all of us to \nlearn. If you can work together as a team, you can achieve true \ngreatness. That is what his team did this year. Earlier in the year \nthey beat the University of Kansas, beat them very soundly. Then \nthrough the March Madness, they made it all the way through the Sweet \n16.\n  It was funny to listen to the various announcers talk about our team \nand trash them, not even understanding how to pronounce ``Nevada.'' We \ndo not use their pronunciation. It was funny to listen to them saying \nthey did not have a chance; they did not know how to play basketball. \nCertainly the coach from the University of Nevada and the rest of the \nplayers proved them wrong.\n  I rise today to congratulate them on a great season and look forward \nto their success.\n  I also wish the Lady Rebels from the University of Nevada Las Vegas \nsuccess tonight. They are in the WNIT championship. We have a lot to be \nproud of in our State. I join my colleague, Senator Harry Reid, in \ncongratulating especially the Nevada Wolf Pack for what they have \nachieved. Hopefully, we will be able to talk about the championship the \nLady Rebels will achieve tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hope Senator Ensign and I are able to be on the same team \nworking here in the Senate as the University of Nevada at Reno was \nduring this basketball season. We strive to do that. They have set a \ngood example for us and for everyone.\n  We may be outnumbered in the State of Nevada. There may be a lot of \nStates with more people than we have, but Senator Ensign and I realize \nevery State only has two Senators. We believe as a result of that, of \nour working together, we can have the same\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nstrength and power some of the more populated States have. I have \nenjoyed and appreciated working as a team with Senator Ensign during \nhis tenure in the Senate.\n  I also today want to extend my congratulations to Coach Trent Johnson \nand the basketball team at the University of Nevada. We have in recent \nyears reached goals in our athletic programs at the University of \nNevada, but for Coach Ault and his football team, they have been good.\n  I remember going to Georgia Southern to watch UNR play them for the \nnational championship, in Division II. And though we lost that game, it \nwas a great thrill to reach that level, which was significant for the \nuniversity.\n\n  Since that time, the University of Nevada football has moved into \nDivision I. Basketball has always been Division I.\n  Now, many years ago, the Wolf Pack was known all over the country. It \nhad, at one time, three All-Americans on its football team. We had \nMarion Motley, who is now a member of the Football Hall of Fame, who \nplayed football at the University of Nevada, at Reno. And we had other \ngreat players, Dick Trachok, Tommy Kaminer, and many others, but that \nis many years ago.\n  So what Senator Ensign said about the Wolf Pack Basketball Team is \nsignificant. They had not been to an NCAA tournament for 19 years. They \nhad never, in the history of the school, won an NCAA game.\n  This year they were forecast, by all the prognosticators, to continue \nthat ``never to win a game.'' The first team they played was the great \nMichigan State. They beat Michigan State. Then the prognosticators \nsaid: Well, that was a fluke. There is no way in the world they will \nbeat the highest ranked Gonzaga team. Gonzaga, all year, had lost one \ngame. That game was not close. UNR moved through there very quickly.\n  Then they moved on to the Sweet Sixteen. They played Georgia Tech. \nThey led Georgia Tech at half time, and it was really an exciting game. \nThey lost. But other than my being disappointed because they did not go \nto the Final Four, I join my colleague in expressing my congratulations \nto this great basketball team.\n  We have focused so much attention, in years past, with the UNLV \nbasketball team, the Runnin' Rebels, that has overshadowed the \naccomplishments of the University of Nevada, at Reno. But that will no \nlonger ever be said as a result of the great accomplishment made by \nthis team.\n  I want to say something about the importance of coaching. Trent \nJohnson came from Stanford. He was an assistant coach over there. He \ncame 5 years ago. He accepted the challenge of being a head coach of a \nDivision I school. But, frankly, the record that he was given was \npretty dismal. The year that he took over, he looked back to see that \nthe prior year they had won 8 games and lost 18. This year they won 24 \ngames. That is the turnaround.\n  As Senator Ensign mentioned, they beat Kansas, which was ranked No. 1 \nat the time. Early in the year, people knew they would be pretty good \nbecause they almost beat Connecticut, which, at that time, was also \nranked No. 1.\n  Few people thought they could make the strides that they did except \ntheir coach, Trent Johnson. He is an outstanding coach. It is my \nunderstanding and my hope that the people in Reno have done everything \nthey can to make him happy. He is a great coach, and this record of his \nwill only continue.\n  I want to reflect a little bit on this team. It was led by the player \nof the year in the Western Athletic Conference, a man by the name of \nKirk Snyder. He is a junior. If he wants to go pro, he will be drafted \nin the first round.\n  During the times I have watched him during the games this year, and \nlistened to the games, the sportscasters always focused on this man who \nwas so good.\n  They also had a point guard by the name of Todd Okeson, someone who \nis a senior, and was the sparkplug of that team. He was the point \nguard, but he also scored very well.\n\n  There were other fine players on that team. They may not have scored \nover 20 points a game as did Kirk Snyder, but they did many other good \nthings. Gary Hill-Thomas was a great defender. Kevin Pinkney was one of \nthe great rebounders. And then there was a young man by the name of \nNick Fazekas, who is almost 7 feet tall, a freshman, and has a soft \ntouch. He stepped in at very crucial times during the tournament and \nmade key baskets, and came to the free throw line and always came \nthrough.\n  But we also had players from Nevada. They are not all out-of-Staters. \nFor example, Sean Paul, the ``Elko Enforcer,'' comes from the town of \nElko in northeastern Nevada. And there were other players: Jermaine \nWashington and Marcelus Kemp.\n  These players have made Coach Johnson proud. I am confident that is \none reason Coach Johnson is going to stay at the University of Nevada, \nat Reno. We want him, and I certainly hope he stays. I am confident \nthat he will.\n  All these players, and especially the coach, have made Nevadans \nproud.\n  Sometimes when a team loses in a tournament, people say: ``Wait until \nnext year.'' But I think everyone in Nevada is going to dwell on the \nfact that this team did well, and we are going to savor this remarkable \nseason by UNR, and not dwell on next year.\n  Senator Ensign mentioned, and I also want to mention, that we also \nhave a great coach at UNLV. She coaches the UNLV Runnin' Rebels. The \nLady Rebels are very good. They came within one point of going to the \nNCAA tournament. They are now in the National Invitation Tournament, \nand they are in the finals. They are going to play Creighton tonight \nfor the National Invitation Championship. They have done great.\n  I love to watch the Lady Rebels. I have gone and met with these young \nwomen and have spoken with the coach. So I congratulate Coach Miller \nand her Lady Rebels for the great notoriety they have focused on the \nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas this year and wish them well in their \ntournament game tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2945\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \npending amendment offered by the Senators from California and \nMassachusetts; namely, the minimum wage amendment. I would like to \npoint out the effect of the current minimum wage on people today, and \nparticularly as to where they are with respect to poverty in America.\n  Let me refer to this chart. This chart represents the relationship \nbetween the minimum wage and the poverty line for a family of two, \nbeginning in the year 1988, and up through the year 2002.\n  From this chart you can see, quite visibly, frankly--with the minimum \nwage represented in green and the poverty line being the line just \nbelow the blue--that as the minimum wage increased in 1989, and in a \nstep sort of function up to 1998, that for a person who had a job, with \na family of two--let's say a single mom had a full-time job but made \nthe minimum wage--they were still below the Federal poverty level, \nuntil about 1998, and then they could just barely surpass the poverty \nlevel.\n  I point this out because it does not seem right that a person who has \na full-time job at a minimum wage still lives in poverty.\n  Now, that is bad enough. But let me show you how much worse it gets. \nThis next chart shows the relationship between the minimum wage and \npoverty for a family of three: let's say a mom and dad and a child. By \nthis chart one can tell very easily that the gap between the poverty \nline and the minimum wage is much greater for a family of three than it \neven is for a family of two. In fact, if I have my numbers correct, the \namount is about $3,681. That is the gap.\n  I point out, again, for a family of three, with one breadwinner--say \nwith a father who is at the minimum wage--that family of three will \nfind itself, on average, over a year's time, about $3,600 of income \nless than the Federal poverty level. That family is living in poverty \neven though the breadwinner of that family is working full time.\n  And it gets worse, as you might expect.\n  Let's take a family of four, say a father and a mother, and two \nchildren. Say one parent is working full time at a minimum wage job. \nBecause the increase in the minimum wage has been\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nso slow, the gap between what that family earns and the Federal poverty \nlevel is even greater.\n  In fact, it is about twice as much, which means that a family of four \nwith one wage earner at the minimum wage is earning about half of what \nthe Federal poverty level is. I don't think that is right. I frankly \ndon't understand why some people do not want a significant increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  Let me tell you a personal story. Personal stories sometimes are out \nof context, but it meant a lot to me. One year I was walking across my \nState in Montana campaigning. To be honest, I learned an awful lot just \nby talking to people who I just happened to meet walking down the roads \nand highways and visiting in people's homes. A lot of it had to do with \nwelfare. I remember talking to many people on welfare who told me they \ndid not want to be on welfare. They hated it. They wanted to be off \nwelfare.\n  One of the main factors they mentioned to me as to why it is so \ndifficult to get off of welfare is because of the minimum wage laws. \nThey are working maybe at McDonald's or someplace else in a minimum \nwage job, but because the minimum wage rates were so low, they couldn't \nmake ends meet.\n  It is hard to know when to believe people. It is hard to know when to \nthink what people say is right or not, but you have to read between the \nlines. You have to get a sense of what is going on. It was very clear \nto me that these people were speaking the truth, certainly as they \nperceived it. If there were a significant increase in their wages, they \ncould then get off of welfare.\n  It is tied to the earlier debate on childcare. I ran into a lot of \nwomen, single moms who said the same thing to me. They were really \nearnest. I wish you could have seen the expressions on their faces \nsaying that they wanted to stay off of welfare.\n  One young single mom explained to me that she slept on her mother's \nsofa so she could avoid having to pay for a room someplace. She had a \nminimum wage job. Her childcare expenses were so high she could not \nhandle it anymore and she had to go back on to welfare. She hated it.\n  In those few instances, people I talked to just by happenstance--\nchance encounters--that is what they have said to me.\n  We have to make judgments sometimes. One of the judgments I have made \nis that our current minimum wage is too low. For a civilized country, \nthe United States of America, we can do a heck of a lot better.\n  Sometimes you hear business people say it will increase their cost of \nbusiness. It probably will slightly. But if everybody is getting paid \nmore, more dollars flow into the economy. People are more likely to not \nbe on welfare, and they are more likely to have a little more self-\nesteem. They are more likely to be able to advance themselves. Most \npeople want to advance themselves. They want a better life for their \nfamilies and their kids. Some just find themselves caught in difficult \nsituations.\n  I hope people will look at these charts and see how dramatic the \ndifference is between the minimum wage income on the one hand and the \nFederal poverty level on the other. The income of someone on the \nminimum wage is much below the Federal poverty level. It does not seem \nright that a person working full time, whether he or she has one child, \nor is married, or whether he or she has three in the family or four, \nshould live so far below the Federal poverty level. That is not right. \nIf they are going to work full time, they should be able to live \noutside of poverty.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, after watching the harsh acrimony \ngenerated by the September 11 Commission--which, let me say at the \noutset, is made up of good and able members--I have come to seriously \nquestion this panel's usefulness. I believe it will ultimately play a \nrole in doing great harm to this country, for its unintended \nconsequences, I fear, will be to energize our enemies and demoralize \nour troops.\n  After being drowned in a tidal wave of all who didn't do enough \nbefore 9/11, I have come to believe that the Commission should issue a \nreport that says: No one did enough. In the past, no one did near \nenough. And then thank everybody for serving, send them home, and let's \nget on with the job of protecting this country in the future.\n  Tragically, these hearings have proved to be a very divisive \ndiversion for this country. Tragically, they have devoured valuable \ntime looking backward instead of looking forward. Can you imagine \nhandling the attack on Pearl Harbor this way? Can you imagine Congress, \nthe media, and the public standing for this kind of political \ngamesmanship and finger-pointing after that day of infamy in 1941?\n  Some partisans tried that ploy, but they were soon quieted by the \npatriots who understood how important it was to get on with the war and \ntake the battle to America's enemies and not dwell on what FDR knew, \nwhen. You see, back then the highest priority was to win a war, not to \nwin an election. That is what made them the greatest generation.\n  I realize that many well-meaning Americans see the hearings as \ndemocracy in action. Years ago when I was teaching political science, I \nprobably would have had my class watching it live on television and \nusing that very same phrase with them.\n  There are also the not-so-well-meaning political operatives who see \nthese hearings as an opportunity to score cheap points. And then there \nare the media meddlers who see this as great theater that can be played \nout on the evening news and on endless talk shows for a week or more.\n  Congressional hearings have long been one of Washington's most \nentertaining pastimes. Joe McCarthy, Watergate, Iran-Contra--they all \nkept us glued to the TV and made for conversations around the water \ncoolers or arguments over a beer at the corner pub.\n  A congressional hearing in Washington, DC is the ultimate aphrodisiac \nfor political groupies and partisan punks. But it is not the groupies, \npunks, and television-sotted American public that I am worried about. \nThis latter crowd can get excited and divided over just about anything, \nwhether it is some off-key wannabe dreaming of being the American idol, \nor what brainless bimbo ``The Bachelor'' or ``Average Joe'' will \nchoose, or who Donald Trump will fire next week. No, it is the real \nenemies of America that I am concerned about. These evil killers who \nright now are gleefully watching the shrill partisan finger-pointing of \nthese hearings and grinning like a mule eating briars.\n  They see this as a major split within the great Satan, America. They \nsee anger. They see division, instability, bickering, peevishness, and \ndissension. They see the President of the United States hammered \nunmercifully. They see all this, and they are greatly encouraged.\n  We should not be doing anything to encourage our enemies in this \nbattle between good and evil. Yet these hearings, in my opinion, are \ndoing just that. We are playing with fire. We are playing directly into \nthe hands of our enemy by allowing these hearings to become the great \ndivider they have become.\n  Dick Clarke's book and its release coinciding with these hearings \nhave done this country a tremendous disservice and some day we will \nreap its whirlwind.\n  Long ago, Sir Walter Scott observed that revenge is ``the sweetest \nmorsel that ever was cooked in hell.''\n  The vindictive Clarke has now had his revenge, but what kind of hell \nhas he, his CBS publisher, and his axe-to-grind advocates unleashed?\n  These hearings, coming on the heels of the election the terrorists \ninfluenced in Spain, bolster and energize our evil enemies as they have \nnot been energized since 9/11.\n  Chances are very good that these evil enemies of America will attempt \nto influence our 2004 election in a similar dramatic way as they did \nSpain's. And to think that could never be in this country is to stick \nyour head in the sand.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n  That is why the sooner we stop this endless bickering over the past \nand join together to prepare for the future, the better off this \ncountry will be. There are some things--whether this city believes it \nor not--that are just more important than political campaigns.\n  The recent past is so ripe for political second-guessing, ``gotcha,'' \nand Monday morning quarterbacking. And it is so tempting in an election \nyear. We should not allow ourselves to indulge that temptation. We \nshould put our country first.\n  Every administration, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, bears some \nof the blame. Dick Clarke bears a big heap of it, because it was he who \nwas in the catbird's seat to do something about it for more than a \ndecade. Tragically, it was the decade in which we did the least.\n  We did nothing after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in \n1993, killing six and injuring more than a thousand Americans.\n  We did nothing in 1996 when 16 U.S. servicemen were killed in the \nbombing of the Khobar Towers.\n  When our embassies were attacked in 1998, killing 263 people, our \nonly response was to fire a few missiles on an empty tent.\n  Is it any wonder that after that decade of weak-willed responses to \nthat murderous terror, our enemies thought we would never fight back?\n  In the 1990s is when Dick Clarke should have resigned. In the 1990s \nis when he should have apologized. That is when he should have written \nhis book--that is, if he really had America's best interests at heart.\n  Now, I know some will say we owe it to the families to get more \ninformation about what happened in the past, and I can understand that. \nBut no amount of finger-pointing will bring our victims back.\n  So now we owe it to the future families and all of America now in \njeopardy not to encourage more terrorists, resulting in even more \ngrieving families--perhaps many times over the ones of 9/11.\n  It is obvious to me that this country is rapidly dividing itself into \ntwo camps--the wimps and the warriors: the ones who want to argue and \nassess and appease, and the ones who want to carry this fight to our \nenemies and kill them before they kill us. In case you have not figured \nit out, I proudly belong to the latter.\n  This is a time like no other time in the history of this country. \nThis country is being crippled with petty partisan politics of the \nworst possible kind. In time of war, it is not just unpatriotic; it is \nstupid; it is criminal.\n  So I pray that all this time, all this energy, all this talk, and all \nof the attention could be focused on the future instead of the past.\n\n  I pray we would stop pointing fingers and assigning blame and \nwringing our hands about what happened on that day David AcUology has \ncalled ``the worst day in all our history'' more than 2 years ago, and \ninstead, pour all our energy into how we can kill these terrorists \nbefore they kill us--again.\n  Make no mistake about it: They are watching these hearings and they \nare scheming and smiling about the distraction and the divisiveness \nthat they see in America. And while they might not know who said it \nyears ago in America, they know instinctively that a house divided \ncannot stand.\n  There is one other group that we should remember is listening to all \nof this--our troops.\n  I was in Iraq in January. One day, when I was meeting with the 1st \nArmored Division, a unit with a proud history, known as Old Ironsides, \nwe were discussing troop morale, and the commanding general said it was \ntop notch.\n  I turned to the division's sergeant major, the top enlisted man in \nthe division, a big, burly 6-foot-3, 240 pound African American, and I \nsaid: ``That's good, but how do you sustain that kind of morale?''\n  Without hesitation, he narrowed his eyes, and he looked at me and \nsaid: ``The morale will stay high just as long as these troops know the \npeople back home support us.''\n  Just as long as the people back home support us. What kind of message \nare these hearings and the outrageously political speeches on the floor \nof the Senate yesterday sending to the marvelous young Americans in the \nuniform of our country?\n  I say: Unite America before it is too late. Put aside these petty \npartisan differences when it comes to the protection of our people. \nArgue and argue and argue, debate and debate and debate over all the \nother things, such as jobs, education, the deficit, and the \nenvironment; but please, please do not use the lives of Americans and \nthe security of this country as a cheap-shot political talking point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \noutstanding comments. There is a war going on and he made some \noutstanding points. I have heard several of his speeches and learned a \nlot from each of them.\n  I am going to speak now on, I believe, the pending amendment, the \nBoxer-Kennedy amendment. I will share my thoughts about raising the \nFederal minimum wage. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep \ntalking about the loss of American jobs, but their actions don't match \nup to their words.\n  If my colleagues are so concerned about unemployment, why would they \ndo something that would eliminate jobs in this country? If my \ncolleagues are so concerned about helping poor families, why would they \ndo something that hurts poor families the most? Their effort to \nincrease the minimum wage, while attacking the President on job \ncreation, is not based on sound policy and economics.\n  There is an effort underway to put a smokescreen of unrelated \namendments that mask election year politics in misleading rhetoric. It \nis being done on the reauthorization of the welfare bill.\n  It is time for us to look beyond the smokescreen and see who is \nreally helped and who is really hurt by Senator Kennedy's amendment to \nraise the Federal minimum wage.\n  Every student who has taken an economics course knows if you increase \nthe price of something--in this case, the minimum wage job--you \ndecrease the demand for those jobs. A survey of members of the American \nEconomic Association revealed that 77 percent of economists believe \nthat a minimum wage hike causes job loss.\n  For small businesses, where most of the job creation in this country \nis generated, a minimum wage increase is particularly harmful. Having \nowned a small business in Wyoming, I can speak from personal experience \nabout how detrimental a minimum wage increase would be for small \nbusinesses and job growth.\n  I need to explain something. Very few people in the shoe business I \nwas in were working at the minimum wage, which my wife and I preferred \nto call the level of minimum skills. Those are the people who first \ncame in and did not have any capability in the kind of job they were \ngoing to be doing and we had a starting wage, a starting skills wage. \nAnybody who was in that wage more than 3 months was not paying \nattention, and that is the way with most of the businesses in this \ncountry.\n  The minimum wage is the minimum skills wage, and it is the starting \nwage. It does have an effect on other wages as well. When we raise the \nminimum wage, then to keep the proper spread between employees of \ndifferent skills, other jobs get raises, too. Of course, when that \nhappens, there has to be a way to pay for it, and the way to pay for \nthat almost always comes from raising prices. If you raise prices and \nwages, there is not much gain.\n  How do I explain to my constituents, most of whom rely on small \nbusiness for their livelihood, that Congress wants to do something that \nwould foster job loss instead of job creation?\n  Every day I read letters to the editors of the Wyoming newspapers. \nOne appeared in the Casper Star from one of my constituents about his \nconcerns in September 2002. I came across this letter again. It was \nwritten by Imo Harned of Douglas, WY, about the effects of a minimum \nwage increase. It is a reminder about the true cost of minimum wage \nincreases.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       That's Like no Help at All\n\n       Editor: I first became interested in the effects of raising \n     minimum wage in the 1960s.\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\n     An employer I knew fired three men he'd employed as watchmen. \n     He remarked that it was worth something to have warm bodies \n     around, but not at 75 cents an hour. Since then I have made \n     it a habit from time to time to ask an employer if raising \n     minimum wage makes a difference to his business. No matter if \n     he pays one person or dozens, the answer is always the same. \n     ``There are X number of dollars in the budget and I can't \n     exceed that amount. If it means cutting hours or firing \n     workers, I have to do it to stay within the budget.'' \n     Personal observations show that within a week of a raise in \n     minimum wage, groceries will raise enough to absorb the \n     increase. Also, people who make more than minimum have to pay \n     the increased costs too, so it amounts to a cut in pay for \n     those who make more.\n       Several years ago the Wall Street Journal did a study \n     showing that living standards have remained unchanged for \n     people earning minimum wage since that wage was 50 cents an \n     hour! The only difference was that those poor people were in \n     a higher tax bracket and had to pay more taxes.\n       A person who begins working at minimum wage, who works hard \n     and earns an increase in pay should not be penalized by being \n     returned to the beginning again. Neither should anyone be \n     penalized by having to pay the increased food and utilities \n     that follow every time the minimum wage is increased.\n                                              Imo Harned, Douglas.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have listened to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who support a minimum wage increase. I have \nseen their charts and heard their arguments. However, none of their \ncharts or arguments can refute the commonsense and real world \nobservation of Imo Harned from Douglas, WY.\n  Mr. Harned writes--I am quoting part of it and the whole letter is \nprinted in the Record. I am sure my colleagues will want to read it:\n\n     . . . I have made it a habit from time to time to ask an \n     employer if raising minimum wage makes a difference to his \n     business. No matter if he pays one person or dozens, the \n     answer is always the same: ``There are X number of dollars in \n     the budget and I can't exceed that amount. If it means \n     cutting hours or firing workers, I have to do it to stay \n     within the budget.'' Personal observations show that within a \n     week of a raise in minimum wage, groceries will raise enough \n     to absorb the increase. Also, people who make more than \n     minimum have to pay the increased costs, too, so it amounts \n     to a cut in pay for those who make more.\n\n  Mr. Harned saw through the phony economics of a minimum wage \nincrease. He reached the same conclusion as two Stanford economists: A \nminimum wage increase is paid for by higher prices that hurt poor \nfamilies the most. Some argue that we need to increase the minimum wage \nto help poor families. However, the 2001 study conducted by Stanford \nUniversity economists found that only one in four of the poorest 20 \npercent of families would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. \nThree in four of the poorest workers would be hurt by a wage hike \nbecause they would shoulder the costs of resulting higher prices. A \nFederal wage hike will hurt the very people the underlying welfare \nreauthorization bill is designed to help: America's poor families.\n  I have held on to Mr. Harned's letter as a reminder of the dangers of \na ``Washington knows best'' and a ``one size fits all'' mentality. An \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage is a classic lesson that \nWashington does not know best and one size does not fit all.\n  A Federal wage mandate does not account for the cost of living that \nvaries across the country. It costs over twice as much to live in New \nYork City than in Cheyenne, WY. However, a Federal minimum wage hike \nthat applies coast to coast is like saying a bag of groceries in New \nYork City must cost the same as a bag of groceries in Cheyenne. Local \nlabor market conditions and the cost of living determines pay rates, \nnot Federal minimum wage laws dictated from Washington.\n  I support an increase for all wages, but that increase should be \nfueled by a strong, free market economy, not by an artificial Federal \nmandate that hurts business and workers alike. Artificial wage hikes \ndrive prices up. We should not trick workers into thinking they are \nearning more when they still cannot pay the bills at the end of the \nmonth. We should not trick the American people into believing that the \nphony economics of a minimum wage increase will improve the standard of \nliving in this country. Nor should we trick the American people into \nbelieving that a minimum wage increase is without cost.\n  The smoke and mirrors of a minimum wage increase is not the way for \nAmerican workers to find and keep well-paying jobs. We have to \nencourage, not discourage, job creation, and we have to equip our \nworkers with the skills needed to compete in the new global economy.\n\n  It is one of my goals to make sure that the unfilled higher paying \njobs can be filled by Americans. I talked about the minimum wage being \na minimum skills wage. There are higher paying jobs out there, but you \nhave to have the skills for them. How do you get the skills for them? \nWe have a bill. It is called the Workforce Investment Act. It \nreauthorizes the Nation's job training and employment system, and it \nupdates it to the modern jobs. It allows people to be working in the \nareas of highest need in this country, instead of forcing those jobs \noverseas.\n  That bill passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee unanimously. We passed it on the Senate floor by unanimous \nconsent last November. That means nobody wanted to amend it and nobody \nobjected to what was in the bill. That is as bipartisan as you can get.\n  Where is that bill now? It is languishing around here because the \nminority party will not let us get a conference committee appointed to \nresolve the differences with the House, the final step for the bill. \nThe House has passed a bill. It is a little different from the Senate \nbill. But we need to meet and work out the differences and get that \nfinal bill.\n  What does this mean in the way of jobs? Training for 900,000 jobs a \nyear. That is pretty significant, training for 900,000 jobs a year. I \nkind of get the feeling we do not want to resolve that until after \nNovember so that it can be a part of the politics of the Presidency. \nThat is wrong. It ought to be worked out now. We ought to have a \nconference committee. We ought to get it done. If we want to take care \nof jobs in this country, if we want people to be making more and to be \nmaking more real money, we ought to get them trained into the skilled \npositions in the jobs that are vacant in this country right now before \nwe ship them over to another country. We need to have a conference \ncommittee. That would provide jobs. That will provide increased wages. \nThat will provide real increased wages, not just inflationary wages \nthat will drive up the price of all of the goods and absorb, as Mr. \nHarned said, in 1 week the amount of the raise.\n  I owe Mr. Harned and all my constituents sound policy, not election \nyear rhetoric. I owe it to Mr. Harned and all of my constituents to \nremove the smokescreen around the minimum wage debate and expose its \ntrue cost.\n  The Boxer-Kennedy amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage ignores \nthe true cost of a minimum wage increase on America's workers and \nbusinessmen.\n  I hope we can put this debate, which is unrelated to the underlying \nbill, behind us. I hope we can move beyond election year theatrics and \nget to the real work of helping America's low-income families.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boxer-Kennedy amendment and to \nread the letter of Mr. Harned in full.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa \ngiving me the opportunity to sit in this august chair he so ably \noccupies on more than just a few occasions on the Senate floor where we \nseem to have Finance Committee bills on a pretty frequent basis. He \nworks diligently. He has been called away to do some other things so I \nam going to take this opportunity to speak, as we are stuck on an \namendment that is nongermane to this bill, and which was offered with \nthe full knowledge that this would severely jeopardize this bill being \nmoved to passage.\n  Earlier today we had a good debate on daycare funding. We passed an \namendment that added $6 billion more in daycare funding to this bill. \nCurrent funding for the Child Care and Development Fund is $4.8 \nbillion. The committee added $1 billion more. Why did we add this \nincrease in funding? Because in the bill we increased the work \nrequirement by 20 percent.\n  Now I would make the argument we did not actually increase it by 20 \npercent because we give partial credit to the States, so it is probably \nnot a 20-\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\npercent increase. At most, we increase the work requirement in this \nbill by 20 percent. So we also increased the daycare funding.\n  Candidly, there is probably not even that much of a direct \ncorrelation. It is probably not even going to be required to have 20 \npercent more to meet this work requirement, but we did it, anyway.\n  The HELP Committee comes forward with a proposal that is $2.3 billion \nmore in childcare that will be in this bill, and then today we add $6 \nbillion more. That is a 100-percent increase in daycare funding for a \n20-percent increase in work requirements. I am starting to rethink the \nwork requirements at the rate this is costing us.\n  In addition, there is almost $1.5 billion in money the States now \nhold that can only be used for cash assistance. When we passed the 1996 \nwelfare bill, one of the concerns on the left was this money for cash \nassistance be used for cash assistance and it is not to be taken out \nand used for other purposes. So we have a pipeline which only funds \ncash assistance.\n  What we do in this bill is allow this $1.5 billion to be used for \ndaycare. So it is not a $1 billion increase on top of a $2.3 billion \nincrease on top of a $6 billion increase, but on top of a $1.5 billion \nincrease on top of that. This is how much money we now have in this \nbill for childcare. I oppose that. I think that is an extraordinary \nexpansion of a program that, while it has benefits and I certainly \nsupport it, and in the 1996 bill I supported the final compromise which \nadded $1 billion to the daycare funding to get this bill originally \nenacted, but this is excessive and unwarranted, and I would argue not \ngood policy for a variety of different reasons.\n  There is some good policy in this bill, and it is being blocked. I \nthink when the Senator from California offered this amendment, she \nunderstood what was going to happen if she offered this amendment, and \nthat was this bill would be shut down, as the last bill was because of \na blocking amendment on the JOBS bill to create more manufacturing \njobs.\n  What we would like to see done is a limitation of amendments. I would \nfrankly be happy to deal with all relevant amendments to this bill, no \nlimitation on any relevant amendments, but a limitation on political \namendments. Clearly, minimum wage is a political amendment that has \nbeen offered numerous times in the past, always seeming to wait until \nright before election. We never see minimum wage increases offered in \nodd-numbered years. I do not know if my colleagues noticed that, but it \nseems to be offered in even-numbered years. So we have even-numbered \nelection issues that are brought up by Senators Boxer and Kennedy, who \nsaid they would like to see this bill pass. They say they would like to \nsee this extended.\n\n  I tell my colleagues that the Senator from California in 1996 said: I \ncannot support legislation--she was referring to the 1996 welfare \nreform act--which will throw countless children into poverty. No one \nexpects us to solve the welfare problem by punishing children for being \npoor. That is what she said in 1996.\n  So did this bill punish children for being poor? Let us look at the \nblack child poverty rate. The highest rates of poverty in America are \namong black children, at least they have been. At the time Senator \nBoxer made that statement, the poverty rate among African-American \nchildren was 45 percent. She said this bill will punish children by \nthrowing them into poverty, will punish them because we are going to \nrequire their mothers to go to work, we are going to require and put \ntime limits on the amount of time people can spend on welfare because \nwe have an expectation that if one is able-bodied they can work, they \nshould work, and it is beneficial to them and their children if they do \nwork.\n  So we did a whole bunch of things to create not only a stick to get \npeople to work, but a lot of incentives or carrots to make work pay. We \ninvested a lot of money: Daycare, yes; transportation; EIC. We can go \non down the list. We put in a lot of incentives over the last several \nyears to make work pay.\n  What happened? We have the lowest rate of black child poverty ever in \nAmerica. Now, one might ask, well, did the other side learn a lesson? \nDid they understand that actually they were wrong? I know the Senator \nfrom California had a picture, and I know the Senator from Illinois at \nthe time, Ms. Moseley-Braun, had pictures of people in breadlines and \npeople sleeping on grates. Have we now admitted this concept of work \nand the concept of time limitations was, in fact, not a punishment but \nthe real punishment was locking people into dependency and poverty? \nThat is punishing. That is hopelessness.\n  What we provided in this bill was hope. Have they learned? Well, the \nproof is in the pudding. The Senator from California comes forward and \noffers an amendment, shuts down the bill. She will have ample \nopportunities over the next several weeks to offer an amendment on this \nissue.\n  By the way, there have been ample opportunities in the past 15 months \nto offer a minimum wage increase, and yet on a bill everybody is for, \nthat we want to reauthorize--they say they are not trying to block this \nbill--15 months go by in the session and we are going to offer an \namendment to try to sink this bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to offer germane \namendments, to withdraw this amendment, let's get to the substance of \nthis issue. This is an important battle to provide hope and opportunity \nfor the poor in our society, to bring dignity into the lives of \ncommunities that have been struggling to make ends meet.\n  Let's stick to this issue and get it done. Let's show the Senate can \nwork on important issues of the day.\n  One of the things I wanted to talk about--I had talked at length \nabout the general welfare bill and I had mentioned the issue briefly, \nbut I wanted to focus a little more attention on it, the issue the \nPresident proposed on marriage.\n  There has been a lot of debate about marriage in America over the \npast several months. What I am talking about here is the role of the \nGovernment to encourage and promote healthy marriages. The President \nhas a healthy and stable marriage initiative he has put forward.\n  Why do we want to do this? Do we want to force people into bad \nmarriages? Or bring out the shotgun again and get people to marry even \nthough they may not want to? No. That is not what this is about. No one \nis suggesting or has suggested we force anybody into marriage. But here \nis what we have done. The President, and many of us who have been \nworking on this issue for a long time, actually decided to look into \nthe benefits of marriage to children and to women and to men in \npoverty, and determine what and if there are any benefits. Should the \nGovernment be neutral on this issue? Should we stay out of it? Or are \nthere things we can look to that would encourage us to encourage \nmarriage?\n  Here are some of the benefits we have identified in looking at the \ndata. Children in married homes do better in school. They drop out \nless. They have fewer emotional and behavioral problems, less substance \nabuse, less abuse or neglect, including physical abuse, less criminal \nactivity, less early sexual activity, and fewer out-of-wedlock births.\n  If I said I had a drug that could accomplish all these things for \nchildren, we would prescribe it for every child in America. Yet when we \nsay we want to have a program in the welfare system where we are \ndealing with the poorest children in America who, in most cases, are in \nsome of the worst neighborhoods of America, in the roughest communities \nin America, who are living in many cases in very difficult family \nsituations--if we say we want to provide these benefits to them, you \nget the responses: Why do you want to force some rightwing religious \nagenda on us?\n  There are actually people who are opposed to the President's \nproposals, who are opposed to the President's proposals in the face of \nthe benefit to those who we hear a lot about here on the floor of the \nSenate, how we need more for children. We get a lot of proposals from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts that we can help children by increasing \nthe minimum wage while in fact he provides absolutely no evidence that \nis the case. In fact, when we had the discussion today, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said things were better in the 1960s and 1970s and \n1980s, when the minimum wage was high.\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\n  If you go back to the previous chart on black poverty, I will tell \nyou what else is high: Poverty among African-American children. So if \nthere were a connection between the rate of poverty and the minimum \nwage, you would think during this time, when the value of the minimum \nwage was actually going down, black poverty would be going up. Just the \nopposite is the case. Why? Because most people who earn the minimum \nwage aren't the heads of households so there is very little connection \nbetween increasing the minimum wage and poverty. Why? Because poverty \nisn't about a little bit more money.\n  You think: That makes no sense, Senator. Of course it is about more \nmoney.\n  No, it is not. It is about a lot of factors. People who are poor have \nlives that are just as complicated as those of people who are not. It \nis about the status of their mothers and fathers. It is about the \nfamily unit around them. It is about a whole host of issues that \ndetermines whether they will be raised in or out of poverty. To look at \none little factor that has no correlation with poverty is the kind of \nwrongheaded thinking we have suffered under for far too long in this \ninstitution.\n  But in 1996 we changed it. We went to a different model in welfare. \nNow we are trying to change it again. We know that work works. We also \nknow from the data families work.\n  If you look at child poverty, it dramatically increases outside of \nintact marriages. If you have an intact marriage, the percent of time \nin poverty for the average child is 7 percent, if that child's parents \nare married.\n  As we all know, upon divorce many women end up with the children. \nThat is the case certainly the vast majority of time. Many times they \nalso end up on welfare, they end up in poverty, as a result of \nseparation and divorce. That is the case for children born out of \nwedlock.\n  This represents children born within wedlock. Some stay, others get \ndivorced.\n  Here is the situation where children are born out of wedlock and the \nmother subsequently gets married. The child poverty rate is high, but \nnot as high as in the case where mom never gets married. In that case, \nthe percentage of time children spend in poverty is 51 percent of their \nchildhood, on average.\n  So we have a situation where we know marriage has a positive impact \non poverty. Again, we want to focus on poverty and the health of \nchildren. The Senator from Massachusetts spoke about the minimum wage \nand how important it was, and provided no evidence as to how minimum \nwage increases would help reduce poverty among children. Let's look at \nwhat happens, when marriage is involved, to poverty among children. \nMarried families are five times less likely to be in poverty than are \nsingle-parent families. Again, the poverty rate among those who are \nmarried: Among all, 13 percent; among single families, 35 percent of \nsingle-parent families in America are living in poverty.\n  Shouldn't we have a program that at least suggests when a mother has \na child and she is not married and the father is there in the hospital, \nthat we simply ask the question: Are you interested in being married? \nIf both say yes, refer them for counseling to a nonprofit in the \ncommunity, maybe a faith-based organization in the community, somebody \nwho is there to nurture that relationship at a very stressful time in \ntheir lives where, without the proper support and help--and in many \ncases in this situation you don't have a whole lot of family support, \nyou certainly don't have popular culture support for fathers nurturing \nand caring for their children--can't the Government at least suggest \nwhen someone expresses an intent to get married they be given a little \nhelp in working through that process, given the demonstrable benefits \nthat would accrue to them and to their children from an economic point \nof view?\n  But there is more than economics. Children living with two parents \nare 44 percent less likely to be physically abused; 47 percent less \nlikely to suffer physical neglect; 43 percent less likely to suffer \nemotional neglect; 55 percent less likely to suffer from some form of \nchild abuse than children living with a single parent.\n  There are people who will come here to the floor and say the \nGovernment should be neutral with respect to this. In spite of this \nrather strong statement in support of marriage being the optimal place, \na married household being the optimal place in which to raise a child, \nthey will say the Government has no business in this. Yet they will \ncome here and have the Government spend billions of dollars to get \nresults that are one-twentieth of what these results would be in the \nlife of a child.\n  We will spend billions here to reduce neglect by 2 percent, or 5 \npercent. That is OK if we spend billions. That is all right. But if we \ndo something as simple as to say, If you are interested in marriage, we \nwill refer you to counseling because we want to actually help you, if \nyou want to be married, to get married and to stay married, that is \nwrong. Spending billions of dollars on violence prevention programs, \nthat is OK. But the best violence prevention program for a child is a \nhealthy marriage. Spending any money on that, Well, wait, this is a \nright-wing religious attempt to influence people with a religious \nagenda. I think we all know from the debate that is going on that \nmarriage is not just a religious event. It is a civil event. It is a \npublic event. It is a State-sponsored event. It is one that is vitally \nimportant to the future of our society.\n  There is another piece of legislation Senator Bayh, Senator Domenici, \nand I have been working on for quite some time. I am hopeful this will \nnot be as controversial as marriage--that is, fathers should \nparticipate in their children's lives.\n  We actually are going to have some money in this bill that will \nencourage responsible fathers. It is called the Responsible Fatherhood \nInitiative which Senator Bayh of Indiana, Senator Domenici of New \nMexico, and I have been working on for several years. We are able to \nget some money in this bill to promote that.\n  Why? I guess it is obvious. Obviously, we would like to have children \nhave some presence of a father in their lives. We understand there is a \npotential benefit. We also understand there are a lot of fathers \nunfortunately who are not necessarily good fathers, who may not \nnecessarily be a good influence on children's lives. But there is money \nto help those fathers become a positive influence in their lives; to \ntake responsibility for not only providing for them economically, which \nall the previous welfare bills had never focused on--which is getting \nchild support--but actually try to support them in ways beyond the \npaycheck they happen to bring home that day.\n  Why? If you look again at the information we have been able to gather \nabout the difference between children being raised with fathers' \ninvolvement as opposed to fathers being absent, if you have a father \ninvolved in your life versus if you do not have a father involved in \nyour life--if you do not have a father involved, you are two times more \nlikely to abuse drugs and two times more likely to be abused. Why? \nUnfortunately, in far too many relationships, the boyfriend tends to be \nthe greatest abuser of the child who is not his own. You are two times \nmore likely to become involved in a crime, three times more likely to \nfail in school, three times more likely to take your own life, and five \ntimes more likely to live in poverty.\n  Again, if we had a program we were funding here in the Federal \nGovernment out of the Great Society program that could accomplish all \nthese things, we would be pouring billions in this baby. I mean, there \nwould be cries over here to say, if you have this program that can do \nall of this, then we are going to spend--you can't outbid us on this \nbecause we are going to go home and talk about how we are saving lives, \nreducing drug dependency, reducing abuse, reducing crime, improving \neducation, and solving the poverty problem.\n  But then you mention, Oh, by the way, this program has to do with \nfathers taking responsibility. No, wait a minute, we are not going to \ndo that. You are messing around with families here. No. If you have a \nGovernment program that we can hire somebody to fill that role, fine, \nbut we can't encourage fathers. Why would we want to do that? Who are \nwe to be judgmental about getting fathers involved with children's \nlives? That is not the role of the Government. What is the role of\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\nGovernment to mess around with the family?\n  Because we know what works. Americans know what works. We have known \nit for 200-plus years. We know that stable families is the place which \nhas the greatest opportunity to produce stable young children and \nadults. Yet somehow we can't be on the side to save the family, we \ncan't be on the side of marriage and responsible fathers. At least we \nhaven't been in the past.\n  I am hopeful that we have an opportunity in this bill to come down on \nthe side of the family, to come down on the side of mothers and fathers \ntaking responsibility for their children from the very beginning. And \nthe Government should be there to simply ask and encourage and provide \nsupport if they want to, not to force anybody into anything.\n  We have an obligation if we know what works to do it. If we know what \nworks and we can have some positive impact on the lives of children, \nthen we have an obligation to do it. We are doing it here with a very \nsmall amount of money. The marriage proposal I think is $100 million \nFederal, $100 million matched by the States, and then a separate $100 \nmillion. It is $300 million. Excuse me. It is $100 million from Federal \nand $100 million from the States over 5 years, which is $1.5 billion. I \nargue that is a fairly modest sum of money for the tremendous benefit \nthat will accrue not just to the children, but which is going to accrue \nto fathers who will take responsibility for their children.\n  Imagine the change in neighborhoods. Imagine the change in \nneighborhoods where 70 percent of kids, 80 percent of kids are born out \nof wedlock, and within a year 90 to 95 percent of those kids have no \nfather involvement in their lives. Imagine the change in the \nneighborhood, which is permeated by single mothers and fathers who are \nattached to nothing except other irresponsible fathers--we call those \ngangs--or they are not attached to that neighborhood at all because \nthey are in jail. Imagine the neighborhoods with fathers in the homes. \nImagine the neighborhoods with role models of responsible manhood and \nfatherhood.\n  I have talked to so many people who grew up in neighborhoods with \nhigh concentrations of fatherlessness and how they were inspired by the \none or two fathers they knew who weren't their own, but the one or two \nmen in the community who were responsible fathers who gave them hope \nand who taught them responsibility. Imagine how we could change \nneighborhoods if we simply brought mothers and fathers back together in \nthose neighborhoods, and how that dynamic would change.\n  Dare we come down on that side? Dare we invest in trying to change \ntheir pathology that has attacked so many neighborhoods in our society? \nI say yes. I say we have an obligation to do that.\n  Let me get to the economics of this. Fatherhood involvement increases \nchild support. The States that, unfortunately as a result of the 1996 \nWofford law, are concerned about establishing paternity and getting the \nmoney, I say to the States, which will be the instrument by which these \nprograms will be implemented, they will have to play a part. They will \nhave to put up some money to do this.\n  I make the argument it is to their financial benefit to do it. Even \nthough it will cost some money for the programs, I make the argument to \nthe States that if you can get fathers involved in the lives of their \nchildren, you will not have to spend as much time chasing down fathers \nto provide child support, and in many cases not getting that child \nsupport, but you will have a better connection with your children which \nmeans a better life, and we will actually save the States some money.\n  I hate to make the economic arguments to the States, but those are \nthe facts. I am hopeful the States will understand this is not just \ngood for their neighborhood, this is not just good for men, it is not \njust good for women and for children, and for society at large, it is \nalso good for their bottom line and their ability to provide services \nto the poor.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. It is not perfect. There are \nthings in this bill I do not like. But we move the ball forward. We \nincrease work a modest amount, a responsible amount. As someone who was \nin this chair leading the fight in 1996 for this bill and wanting the \ntough requirements on work, I am not someone who believes we need to \ndramatically increase that requirement. I know there will be an \namendment potentially if we ever get to this bill to increase the work \nrequirement to 40 hours. I will vote against that. The reason is \nbecause we do in this bill increase the actual work requirement from 20 \nhours to 24.\n  What does that mean? That means the amount of hours someone must be \nin work in order to be eligible for this program, assuming they did not \nget off the program to work themselves, they are actually on welfare \nbut working, is increased from 20 to 24 hours. Then we have an \nadditional 10 hours that was in the 1996 act that stays the same, an \nadditional 10 hours to bring the total up to 34 hours. That 10 hours \nbeing sort of wraparound issues, whether it is job search or other \ntypes of improvement that individuals may be working on to get a better \njob, to increase their educational skills, get their GED, whatever the \ncase may be.\n  It is important to have a tougher work requirement to take single \nmothers out of the home for 40 hours a week, of which 16 of those hours \nwill not be actually working--I don't see the benefit. What we have \nseen from all the studies is the thing that works the most is work. \nWhile these women--it is predominantly, overwhelmingly women--are not \nin a job outside of welfare, not on a payroll outside of welfare, they \nstill are working and getting work experience.\n  The additional time is well spent to actually find a job outside of \nwelfare, but I don't think at least at that point in time, because of \nthe transition of a 40-hour requirement, that is going to be beneficial \nin the long term for these women. I will not support that.\n  I would have supported a modest increase in daycare funding. What we \nhave done is fundamentally change the expectation of what daycare is. \nThis is more money than people on welfare could ever hope to need when \nit comes to daycare. This is a whole other agenda trying to be advanced \non the bill in the name of welfare to work. But it is simply universal \ndaycare under a different guise. I will not support that.\n  But we have a lot of steps taken in the right direction in this bill. \nI am hopeful, again, we can get bipartisan cooperation from people who \nunderstand the importance of this legislation in getting it passed and \nputting those work requirements back on 28 States that right now do not \nhave them so we can begin the process again in turning lives around and \nimproving the quality of lives of children in the poorest neighborhoods \nin our society.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  HARRY BURK REID, MY 15TH GRANDCHILD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish the people I work with in the Senate \nknew my father. My father was named Harry Reid, the same name I have. I \nalways looked up to my dad. My dad was uneducated. He didn't graduate \nfrom eighth grade, but he was very smart. My father read a lot and he \ncould do things people in college could not do.\n  For example, he was a miner and he could go underground with a \ncompass, come above ground and do a map. People in college cannot do \nthat. He could do underground mapping. He was a carpenter. He could \ncompletely overhaul an engine, a valve job, the whole works. He was a \nblacksmith, hit tempered steel, all that kind of stuff. And he was a \nmuch bigger man than I. I always admired his physical strength. He \ncould put a 50-gallon drum full of water or gas, whatever, in the back \nof a truck by himself.\n\n  The reason I mention Harry Reid tonight, my father, is last night my \n15th grandchild was born, a little boy. As I said, I have 15 \ngrandchildren now. The reason I mention my father is because my son \ntold me, this morning, that they have named my grandson after me. So I \nhave a little grandson named Harry Reid.\n  I hope, as the years go by, that little boy will look at his \ngrandfather in the same way that I looked at my dad.\n  I am proud of the name Harry Reid. I even sign my ``H'' like my dad \ndid. My\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\ndad said once he saw on a window an ``H'' like that, like I sign my \nname. So that is the way children are in looking up to their parents \nand grandparents.\n  As I said, I hope I can set an example that my grandson will respect \nand admire. I know it is a burden, and I say this seriously, to have \nthe name Harry Reid, because I have a lot of people who like me, but I \nhave a lot of people who do not like me because of my political stands.\n  But separate and apart from all that, I hope my grandson will have an \nexample set by me that is one he will believe in--family and keeping \nfamilies together--and being a young man who conducts himself in a \nproper manner, and that, hopefully, some of the things I have done and \nwill do will be something he will look to as a role model that maybe he \nwill adhere to.\n  So I want the Record to reflect how much I appreciate my son Josh and \nhis lovely wife Tamsen for giving me this great honor and to have \nsomeone who, through all generations of time, will be the third Harry \nReid. I am not a junior because my dad had no middle name. And this \nlittle boy is not a junior, or could not be anyway, because I am not \nhis father. His name is different. He has a different middle name, \nBurk, named after his other grandparents, their last name.\n  So anyway, I am flattered and respectful of my son and daughter-in-\nlaw for naming the child after me. I want the Record to reflect how \nmuch I love and appreciate my son Josh and all my children who have \ndone so much to honor me with their exemplary lives, at least from a \nparent's perspective.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently discussing plans both for \nlater tonight and tomorrow and the next 2 weeks. I had the opportunity \nto talk to the Democratic leader, and that discussion will go on for a \nwhile. While we are in, and have been in a quorum call, I wanted to \ntake the opportunity to address an issue that has to do with gasoline \nprices, energy policy, something that every single American who drives \nor benefits from driving is feeling; that is, the price at the gasoline \npump.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was in the news this \nmorning expressing his concern about rising gasoline prices. He is \nright to be concerned. We are all concerned. But what he should be \nconcerned about is his own dismal record in terms of addressing this \nvery issue. Again and again, he has taken positions that result not in \nwhat Americans want--that is, lower gas prices--but again and again in \nhis position as a Senator and before, he has been on the other side and \nengaged in policies and supporting policies that drive the price of \ngasoline higher and higher.\n  The Senate record is familiar to most, but in 1983, when he was \nLieutenant Governor in Massachusetts, the Dukakis-Kerry administration \nsupported a $50 million gas tax hike on the citizens of Massachusetts. \nIn 1993, in the Senate, he voted for the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history, the Clinton tax bill, which increased the Federal \ngasoline tax by 4.3 cents. He also voted twice for the Clinton-Gore Btu \ntax which, had it been signed into law, would have increased gas taxes \nby another 7.5 cents per gallon.\n  The following year he backed a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for \nall Americans. He wrote a letter at that time to the Boston Globe \nexpressing his disappointment that a scorecard issued by a deficit \nreduction organization in Washington did not accurately reflect his \nsupport for this half-dollar gas tax increase.\n  The list goes on. The Senator from Massachusetts also wants the \nUnited States to accept the Kyoto Protocol which, according to Wharton \nEconomic Forecasting Associates, would raise gasoline prices an \nadditional 65 cents per gallon. And just last year, Senator Kerry voted \nfor climate change legislation which would have imposed a Kyoto-style \nregulation on 80 percent of the U.S. economy and would have raised \ngasoline prices by 40 cents a gallon.\n  That is a little bit of the history and the background for this new \nconcern about gasoline prices by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Put aside a moment the impact that these proposals would have had on \nan issue that we have talked a lot about on the floor today, and that \nis jobs and the importance of job creation. The most immediate impact, \nthe most immediate result of Senator Kerry's positions would be to \nforce America's consumers to pay at least a dollar more for each gallon \nof gasoline they purchase, and that is a conservative estimate.\n  It is also worth noting that Senator Kerry has consistently opposed \nany increase in domestic production of energy and any proposal that \nwould reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The Energy bill, which we \nall know fell two votes short in the Senate last year, is probably the \nmost recent example. Senator Kerry has expressed opposition to this \nmeasure, although he was not present in the Senate when we cast that \ncritical vote on the conference report.\n\n  In opposing the Energy bill, Senator Kerry is opposing not just the \ncreation of 800,000 new jobs, he is opposing the development of new \ndomestic resources, new resources that come in the United States, \nincluding such things as renewable resources such as wind and solar \nenergy. To that you could add clean burning ethanol, and to that you \ncould add advanced coal technology or zero emission nuclear energy and, \nyes, the development of domestic oil and gas resources as well.\n  I come to the floor to mention all of this, especially mentioning his \nrecord on the floor of the Senate, because it is simply very difficult \nto take seriously Senator Kerry when he says he is concerned about high \ngas prices and then blames others for not having addressed them. \nThroughout his career, Senator Kerry has consistently taken positions \nthat will result in even higher gas prices and lower domestic supplies \nof energy and jobs lost.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts, indeed, wants to engage in a \nserious discussion about energy policy, I ask that he come back to the \nSenate and help us do what we should be doing, and that is pass an \nEnergy bill which he and his party unfortunately have been blocking for \nmonths.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to review the record since we had this \navailable time. I do challenge Senator Kerry to engage in a serious \ndiscussion about helping us pass that very policy which we know would \nlower gasoline prices in the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry's Record\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, having just heard the majority leader come \nto the floor of the Senate and discuss the record of my colleague, \nSenator John Kerry, I thought it might be useful to respond just a bit.\n  This Chamber, given some of the dialog--and especially the dialog I \nheard a few minutes ago--only lacks the balloons, the buttons, and the \nbrass band for being a political convention in a full-scale support of \na candidate in a Presidential operation, a Presidential campaign.\n  It is not my desire nor my intent to talk about the Presidential \nrace. But when I hear people come to the floor and decide to talk about \nJohn Kerry's record on energy as a Member of the Senate, I think it is \nimportant to respond.\n  There are a great many allegations being made about Senator John \nKerry's record and many--most that I have heard recently--have been \nflat out untrue, just wrong. One of the great things about the First \nAmendment in this country is you can say whatever you want to say and, \nin politics, you can misrepresent someone's record and nobody seems to \ncare very much.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  Let me talk for a couple of minutes about these issues. First of all, \nlet's talk about the energy bill. We don't have an energy bill right \nnow. Do you know why? It failed by two votes in the Senate. I voted for \nit. So did the minority leader. Do you know why it failed by two votes \nin the Senate? Because the majority leader in the U.S. House stuck a \nprovision in that bill that cost him four, or five, or six votes \nagainst the bill in the Senate. Now I hear the majority leader of the \nU.S. House blame Senator Daschle for us not having an energy bill. I \nlooked at that in the paper and I thought, what on earth can he be \nthinking about? He killed the energy bill by sticking in this insidious \nprovision, a retroactive waiver on MTBE liability. He stuck that \nprovision in. He demanded it. It was killed on the floor of the Senate \nby two votes.\n  That bill would have passed the Senate easily without that provision \nstuck in by the majority leader of the U.S. House. So to have him talk \nabout Senator Daschle as somehow holding up the energy bill in this \ncountry doesn't make much sense to me. It is just wrong. He is the one \nwho killed that bill on the floor of the Senate with this provision \nthat he inserted.\n  As to the comments this evening, we have the majority leader come to \nthe floor of the Senate and he seems to imply that my colleague, John \nKerry, is against production, against conservation, against efficiency, \nagainst renewables. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. I can tell you what \nSenator Kerry is for. I sat in meeting after meeting with him over \nrecent years on energy policy, most of which I agree with him on. \nSometimes we disagreed.\n  I will tell you something. This is a man who is very concerned about \nenergy policy in this country. When we talk about these issues, it \nseems to me it would best behoove us to talk seriously about serious \nissues.\n  That has not been the case with respect to Senator Kerry's record on \nenergy, as misrepresented on the floor of the Senate this evening. So \nlet's talk about a couple of these issues.\n  Renewable energy: Senator Kerry supports renewable energy--wind \nenergy, biodiesel energy, a whole series of areas of renewable energy--\nthat will improve this country's energy supply and extend America's \nenergy supply. He supports it.\n  Efficiency titles in the Energy bill: Senator Kerry very much \nsupports improved efficiency of all the appliances we use every single \nday.\n  Conservation: Senator Kerry has a very strong record on conservation, \nand the same is true with respect to production.\n  There has been a lot of misrepresentation. In fact, I heard some \nmisrepresentation recently that Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-a-\ngallon gas tax increase. That is totally untrue, just wrong, flat out \nwrong.\n  Talk is cheap so people can come here and assert whatever they like, \nbut when I hear it, I am going to come to the floor of the Senate and \nsay it is not true.\n  The fact is, this country chooses its leader by going to the ballot \nbox, and this country is owed a serious debate about serious issues. \nRegrettably, it too seldom gets a serious debate about serious issues. \nYes, energy is a serious issue and we have a very serious energy \nproblem and we need an Energy bill passed in the U.S. Congress. Do not \nblame Democrats for the failure to pass an Energy bill. It failed in \nthe Senate by two votes. It passed the House and failed in the Senate \nby two votes, and everyone here understands that at least four or five \nof those two votes that would have been used to pass that bill resulted \nin a negative vote because of what the majority leader in the House \ndid. Everyone understands that. All you have to do is read a newspaper \nand you will understand that. People are concerned about the price of \ngasoline in this country, and they should be. When I say we need an \nenergy policy, we are now close to 60 percent of our oil coming from \noff our shores, often from troubled parts of the world. That is \ndangerous. The fact is, our economy is reliant on energy sources from \nparts of the world that are very troubled. If we want to keep importing \noil from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, and other parts of the \nworld, the fact is it will injure us inevitably, it will injure our \neconomy, and it will injure our opportunity to create new jobs, expand \nand provide hope and opportunity for the American people.\n  We need to go much further than the kind of debate we traditionally \nheld on energy issues, and that is where Senator Kerry talked about the \nfuture. We need to talk about issues such as hydrogen and fuel cells \nand pole-vault over some of this to talk about how we are going to \navoid in the future putting gasoline through carburetors and being \ndependent on OPEC countries.\n  Tomorrow there is a meeting of OPEC ministers. They already cut \nproduction and are talking about cutting production again. This country \nought to jawbone and use the leverage we have to say we need increased \nproduction. We have gas prices that are going through the roof.\n  I do not know what the President is going to do, whether he is going \nto involve himself and try to jawbone OPEC, but I think he should. We \nhave a serious problem, and it is not just the current spike in gas \nprices. That happens. It is now happening because of a series of \nfactors. One is the cutback in OPEC production. The second is an \nimbalance with respect to fuels that are coming into refineries and the \nlack of refinery capacity. There is a whole series of factors. Even as \nwe address the shorter term, we have to think about the longer term.\n\n  I will say to those who want to be critical of Senator Kerry's \nrecord, there is nobody in the Senate, in my judgment, who has cared \nmore and worked harder for longer term solutions for an energy policy \nin this country. It does not serve the country or responsible political \ndebate to come to the Senate and slap people around with bad \ninformation. I am sick and tired of that. If you want to turn this into \na political convention, get some balloons, bunting, put up crepe paper, \nhire a brass band, and pretend this is a political convention. But it \nis not a political convention. This is the Chamber of the United States \nSenate, and we ought to, it seems to me, talk about what the real \npolicy positions are of the respective candidates and have a \ncompetition of ideas.\n  I, frankly, think both political parties have something good to offer \nthis country, and the interaction of both parties and responsible \ndebate over a long period of time strengthens our country. But I get a \nlittle weary of this machine that is so relentless in trying to \nmisrepresent someone's position and slap that misrepresentation around \nfor a while. That is not the way this Presidential campaign ought to be \nwaged. It is not fair to Senator Kerry, who is not in this Chamber, for \npeople to come and mischaracterize his record. I understand people have \nthe right to do it. I am just saying it is not fair. So I hope as we \nbegin to think through some of these issues in the future that we \nunderstand there is a place for a political campaign for the Presidency \nin this country. It is in Ohio, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, Texas, \nand California--all around America--and there the bands do play, and \nthere the balloons are used to great effect, and people love the \npolitical system. That is fine. But I worry a lot about the Senate \nChamber being used to misrepresent someone's position on an issue that \nis as important as this.\n  What bothered me and persuaded me to come to the Senate floor this \nmoment are two things: One is something I read in the newspaper about 2 \nor 3 days ago in which the allegation by the majority leader of the \nother body was it was Senator Daschle who was holding up an Energy \nbill. Nonsense. The majority leader of the other body is the one who \nkilled the Energy bill by putting in this insidious provision, a \nretroactive waiver of MTBE liability. That is a plain fact.\n  Second, I heard a speech on the floor of the Senate a moment ago that \nwas just a pure campaign speech that had nothing to do with the merits \non one side. It had everything to do with misrepresenting the merits on \nthe other side. That is unfair. I am going to come to the floor again \nwhen I hear this done.\n  I hope the American people are treated to a serious debate about \nserious issues. Energy is a serious issue. John Kerry is a serious \ncandidate for the Presidency, and he has strong positions, I think \ndefensible positions, on energy dealing with production, conservation, \nefficiency, renewables, and more. I am sure if he were here to\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nstand up and speak in response to the majority leader, he would want to \ndo that.\n  I came to the floor simply to say I hope the American people are \ntreated to a debate that is accurate about energy positions and energy \npolicy by the two candidates. I, for one, feel very comfortable with \nthe long-term view of energy policy as advocated by Senator John Kerry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not been able to hear all of the \nstatement of the Senator from North Dakota, but I am sure, as always, \nit was right on the point. There is something I would like to direct in \nthe form of a question to him.\n  I was asked to appear on a television show this afternoon, and I was \nhappy to do that. The reason I appeared on the show was to respond to \nsome TV ads that are starting tomorrow where the Bush campaign is \npaying millions of dollars to run an ad around the country that is \nabsolutely fabricated. The ad said Senator Kerry voted for a 50-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax increase. Is the Senator aware that this statement \nis baseless, never happened, and that millions of dollars are going to \nbe spent starting tomorrow saying Senator Kerry has previously in the \nSenate voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon increase in taxes for gasoline?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say in response to the question from the \nSenator from Nevada, I have done what little research I could, because \nI understood this ad was being set to run across the country that said \nSenator Kerry has voted for a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase. My \nunderstanding is it is simply untrue. If somebody has evidence of which \nI am not aware, bring it to the floor. My understanding is it is not \ntrue.\n  It is similarly not true that Senator Kerry is opposed to renewable \nfuels, opposed to conservation, opposed to increased efficiency of \nappliances which was alleged a few minutes ago on the Senate floor. \nThey are not grounded in fact.\n  As I said, everybody has a right to say these things. It is the \npolitical system. This is the floor of the Senate, and those of us who \nhear something we know is demonstrably false also have a right to come \nto the floor to say this is not the best of what this system has to \noffer the American people. This ought to be a competition of ideas of \nboth sides using facts and saying here is where one stands and here is \nwhere the other stands, and here is why and take your pick. That is \nwhat the political system ought to be about.\n  To the extent there are exaggerations--and there sure are in \npolitics; they occur on the political stage all around the country--\nthat is fine as well; that is politics.\n  It is a bit different especially to come to the Senate floor and \nmisrepresent the record of Senator Kerry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment 2943, which is \nthe Cornyn-Bingaman amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This amendment is very simple. It would correct a \ntechnical problem caused during the passage of the Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996. Section 411 of the welfare \nlaw reads that State and local governments may not use their own \nresources to provide nonemergency health services to nonqualified \nimmigrants unless the State has passed new legislation authorizing such \nexpenditures.\n  This provision has caused quite a bit of confusion. As a matter of \nfact, when I was Attorney General of Texas I was asked to interpret \nthis provision. It was during the course of that official action that I \ndiscovered the Federal law, because our State legislature had not \nacted, had unintended consequences. It is safe to say this provision \nhas been read by State and local governments with varying \ninterpretations.\n  Essentially, the current law imposes a double standard on State and \nlocal governments. Because certain Federal public health programs are \nexempt from this requirement, identical State and local government \nhealth programs are not. The end result is more legal and \nadministrative costs on State and local governments, even though the \nprovision has no enforcement mechanism. Even without the confusion, \nsection 411 makes no practical sense. We should not put up more \nroadblocks for those who want to provide preventive treatment, \nespecially when it comes to potential community problems such as \ninfectious diseases.\n  By giving localities control over preventive services, here again at \ntheir own expense, not at Federal taxpayers' expense, we ensure local \nfunds are spent where the people who know best believe they should be \nspent. Ultimately, this will have the effect of driving down health \ncare costs by preventing treatable illnesses before they become acute \nand before they require expensive taxpayer-supported care, usually in \nan emergency room where anyone, no matter who they are, knows they can \nbe treated and indeed must be treated according to a Federal mandate \nwhich I know is an interest of the presiding Senator, particularly \nbecause it is an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  Our amendment would simply strike the word ``health'' from section \n411 of the welfare law. This step clarifies that State and local \ngovernments can use their own funds to provide health services to \nimmigrants, including primary and preventive health care and infectious \ndisease services, without enacting a new law. It is a commonsense step \nand one I hope my colleagues will support.\n  This amendment is also widely supported by several well-respected \nnational associations, including the American Hospital Association, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals and Public Health Systems, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Catholic Health Association.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n  I also want to briefly discuss another amendment, No. 2942. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Lieberman be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Connecticut has a deep understanding of \nthe importance of child support enforcement, and I like me, learned \nabout how critical that issue is during his service as his State's \nattorney general, as I did during my service as attorney general of my \nState.\n  This amendment features two positive reforms for child support \nenforcement. It encourages States to adopt electronic payment systems \nby 2008. While States can opt out of that if they choose to, it will \nhelp get payments to custodial parents more quickly than is currently \ndone now. It creates an option for States to centralize all child \nsupport payments to reduce confusion among employers who withhold child \nsupport payments from the wages of their employees, and it will ensure \nchildren get the financial support they need on time which, of course, \nis our universal goal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this second amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from each of these \norganizations be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                                                   March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Bingaman: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Counties (NACo), I would like to \n     express our support for the Cornyn-Bingaman amendment to the \n     Personal Responsibility, Work, and Family Promotion Act of \n     2003. The amendment, as you know, would clarify that states\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n     and counties may use their own funds to provide critical \n     preventative health care services to immigrants.\n       NACo is the only national organization representing county \n     governments. Many of our country's 3066 counties own and \n     operate hospitals and other health care facilities. Without \n     the passage of this amendment, county governments are placed \n     in a precarious position if they decide to provide \n     preventative care to unqualified immigrants in order to \n     protect the local community's health. As has been repeatedly \n     demonstrated, the provision of preventative care is less \n     costly over time than providing evasive services in emergency \n     rooms. However, the cost savings to preventative care are far \n     outweighed by the protection provided to the community's \n     public health as a whole.\n       Counties serve as safety-net providers, ultimately \n     financing and providing care for our Medicaid ineligible and \n     un-enrolled populations. We support the ability to finance \n     this care in the most appropriate manner.\n       Thank you for your leadership and efforts to ensure that \n     counties are able to protect the health of our local \n     communities. We look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               The Catholic Health\n\n\n                             Association of the United States,\n\n                                    St. Louis, MO, March 30, 2004.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA), the national \n     leadership organization of more then 2,000 Catholic health \n     care sponsors, systems, facilities, and related \n     organizations, I am writing in support of your efforts to \n     ensure that state and local governments have the ability to \n     use their funds to provide non-emergency health services to \n     legal and undocumented immigrants.\n       Specifically, CHA supports your amendment to strike the \n     word ``health'' from Section 411 of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (PRWORA), which has been interpreted by some states to \n     prohibit the use of any state and local funds to provide \n     lifesaving health care to immigrants. This interpretation \n     stands in sharp contrast to the thrust of PRWORA, which \n     generally gave states greater authority to determine welfare \n     rules, and the resulting confusion has had a negative impact \n     on the health of immigrants in many states.\n       By clarifying that states and local governments may use \n     their own funds to provide health services to immigrants, \n     including important preventive care, your amendment can help \n     ensure that hospitals and clinics have the clarity they need \n     to serve the best interest of all of their patients. As \n     organizations founded in a faith tradition and committed to \n     the principles of Catholic social justice teaching, Catholic \n     hospitals recognize and affirm the inherent dignity of every \n     human being. Your amendment helps to further that principle.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to ensure that state and \n     local governments have the certainty they need to use their \n     own funds to provide appropriate health care to all \n     immigrants. If we can be of any assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Rev. Michael D. Place, STD,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, on the passage of her amendment to increase the \nmandatory funding levels for the Child Care and Development Fund by $6 \nbillion over 5 years. I enthusiastically support this amendment, as it \nis designed to help so many families with young children by ensuring \nthat those children are properly cared for while their parents are at \nwork.\n  Unfortunately, we know that more than 10 million children in the \nUnited States are left unsupervised after school on a regular basis. We \nknow that the welfare rolls have been cut nearly 60 percent since 1996, \nand therefore, this statistic will only continue to grow as more and \nmore parents work. Further, with cuts in State childcare funding, many \nworking families are faced with no care for their children due to \nwaiting lists and higher childcare costs.\n  But, with the passage of this amendment, my home State of Ohio alone \nwould receive over $34 million in additional childcare funds next \nfiscal year and more than $266 million over the next 5 years. This \ntranslates into more children receiving care and more parents with the \npeace of mind that their children are being properly attended to while \nthey cannot be at home.\n  Again, I commend Senator Snowe for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in discussion now determining the \nbest pathway to completion on the underlying bill, the welfare bill, an \nimportant bill that I know both sides of the aisle do want to \nappropriately address, through amendments and through the debate \nprocess, and we are working on the best way to accomplish that.\n  As I set out really 3 weeks ago, but in the early part of last week, \nwe have set this week aside to address welfare and we are doing just \nthat. But I really need to do everything possible to see that we do \ncomplete it this weekend. To help accomplish that, I will be sending a \ncloture motion to the desk on the pending committee substitute.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 305, H.R. 4, an act to reauthorize \n     and improve the program of block grants to States for \n     temporary assistance for needy families, improve access to \n     quality child care, and for other purposes.\n\n         Bill Frist, Charles E.

Mr. President, every year, hundreds of thousands of high \nschool students participate in team sports and other extra curricular \nactivities. Through these activities, many young people learn the value \nof working together with others, and the meaning of hard work \nsacrifice.\n  These activities also teach our Nation's students to set their sights \nhigh,\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\nby demonstrating that remarkable achievements come only with hard work \nand dedication. Today, I pay tribute to a group of young women from \nMadison High School in Madison, SD, who have proved this fact time and \ntime again, most recently by extending one of the more remarkable \nwinning streaks in our Nation.\n  On February 20, 2004, the girls' gymnastics team at Madison High won \nthe Class A state title for the tenth consecutive season.\n  For the first seven titles, the Bulldogs were led ably by coach Linda \nCollignon. Since then, Madison has come full circle, having been led to \nthe last three titles by Maridee Weise, a member of that first \nchampionship team.\n  It has been a long road for the Madison High team. In the early days \nof the gymnastics program at Madison High, many of the student-athletes \nwould make the 90-mile round trip from Madison to train at a gymnastics \nfacility is Sioux Falls. In time--and under the leadership of Coach \nCollignon--members of the Madison community volunteered to build a \ntraining facility on the high school campus, saving the school district \nmore than $100,000. It is that kind of community involvement and \ninterest in its youth that has helped establish Madison's tradition in \nthe sport.\n  Each day at practice, these student-athletes are motivated by a \ndrawing of the classic World War II symbol, Rosie the Riveter, and the \nphrase ``We Can Do It!'' They have not only come to recognize the truth \nin those words, they have lived up to them.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting these student-athletes and \ntheir coaches on their latest championship, and on their truly \nremarkable run.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  A high school senior in Perry, IA, was harassed for 4 years by \nstudents who believed him to be gay. The high school student was \nrepeatedly pushed, shoved, and verbally attacked with anti-gay \nepithets. Students had also urinated on the high school senior in the \nshower after wrestling practice.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3360-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO DOROTHY HEIGHT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week Dr. Dorothy Height was awarded \nthe Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony in the Capital rotunda, on \nher 92nd birthday.\n  Dr. Height is a living legend. She is widely recognized as one of the \npreeminent civil rights leaders of modern history. Dr. Height has been \na tireless advocate for equal rights for women, African Americans, and \nothers for more than 65 years. From 1944 and until 1977, Dr. Height \nserved on the National Board of the Young Women's Christian Association \nYWCA. In 1965, she launched the Center for Racial Justice at the YWCA, \nand she served as its director until 1977.\n  Currently the Chair and President Emerita of the National Council of \nNegro Women, Dr. Height became its fourth president in 1957. Under her \nleadership, the NCNW made substantial contributions and advances--both \nfor the greater community of African American women and as an \norganization. Dr. Height led the NCNW to establish the first \ninstitution devoted to Black women's history, secure the Mary Bethune \nCouncil House designation as a national historic sited, achieve tax \nexempt status for the NCNW, and bring the NCNW to national prominence.\n  Dr. Height played an active leadership role in virtually every major \ncivil and human rights cause since the 1960s. She was the only woman at \nthe table when Dr. Martin Luther King and the ``Big Six'' civil rights \nleaders made plans for he civil rights movement. Her life of \ndistinguished service has been recognized with over 50 awards, \nincluding the National Council of Jewish Women's John F. Kennedy \nMemorial Award, the Congressional Black Caucus's William L. Dawson \nAward, the Ladies Home Journal's `Women of Year,'' the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom from President Clinton, and now the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  It is rare that Congress comes together to grant this award, but Dr. \nHeight's life's work epitomizes the distinguished commitment to serve \nfor which it was created to recognize. I congratulate Dr. Dorothy \nHeight for nearly a century of remarkable leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3360-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3360-S3361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the ongoing crisis \nin Darfur, a region in western Sudan that has been the site of \natrocities for months. A recent report from the International Crisis \nGroup spells out the horrifying facts of the situation. The report \nindicates that 830,000 people have been displaced as a result of the \nconflict, and thousands have been killed. Government-supported militias \nhave deliberately targeted civilians, sometimes focusing on unprotected \nvillages with no apparent link to the rebels other than their ethnic \nprofile. According to credible reports, militia atrocities have \nincluded indiscriminate killing and mutilation, rape on a massive \nscale, and the looting and destruction of food reserves and other \nproperty. Outright and indiscriminate government bombing has also been \nverifiably reported since the conflict began.\n  We must ask ourselves two questions. First, what can be done to help \nthe innocent men, women, and children caught up in this nightmare? The \nU.S. must work with the international community to signal our \ncollective resolve and to insist that the Government of Sudan stop \nplaying games with humanitarian access. Khartoum needs to feel the \npressure, and all parties need to work urgently for a settlement.\n  But we must also ask, what do these developments in Darfur tell us \nabout the Government of Sudan? The reports from the region seem to \nconfirm that the Government of Sudan has no qualms about backing \nattacks on innocent civilians.\n  I want the administration's extremely laudable peace initiative in \nSudan to succeed. Many dedicated professionals have devoted countless \nhours to this enterprise, and many courageous Sudanese have taken \ndifficult steps in the pursuit of a just peace. But my doubts about the \nprospects for a future of peace and cooperation are growing, rather \nthan dissipating, at each new report on the Darfur crisis. I doubt the \nstability and sustainability of a peace agreed to by a party that \naccepts organized atrocities as just one more tool in its toolbox of \ngoverning. What kind of peace can be achieved with this kind of \npartner? Can we truly have confidence in this government's good faith? \nWhat kind of future cooperation can we realistically expect?\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, I have been engaged on issues relating to Sudan for \nmany years. I was proud to work with my colleague on that subcommittee \nfor several years, Senator Frist, on the Sudan Peace Act. I recognize \nthe complexity of Sudanese dynamics, and I certainly understand that \nthe situation in Darfur is different from the conflict between the \nGovernment of Sudan and\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\nthe forces of the south, most prominently the Sudanese People's \nLiberation Movement. But some of the elements of the Darfur crisis are, \nunfortunately, quite familiar. We have seen obstacles thrown up to \nhumanitarian access, we have seen the near-total abdication of \nresponsibility for the basic security and well-being of Sudanese \ncivilians, and we see government-backed militias employed to keep some \nof the dirtiest of the dirty working at some token distance from \nofficials.\n  On December 16, 2003, the State Department issued a statement \nexpressing ``deep concern'' about the humanitarian and security \nsituation in Darfur. The statement indicated that:\n\n       the United States calls on the Government of Sudan to take \n     concrete steps to control the militia groups it has armed, to \n     avoid attacks against civilians and to fully facilitate the \n     efforts of the international humanitarian community to \n     respond to civilian needs.\n\n  But it then contained this final sentence:\n\n       The fighting in Darfur is not linked to the ongoing peace \n     talks between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Army in Kenya.\n\n  I am among many observers who fear that this sentence was interpreted \nin Khartoum as a signal that the disincentives articulated by the U.S. \nin the context of the peace talks will not be applied because of abuses \nin Darfur.\n  I urge the administration to insist that the Civilian Protection \nMonitoring Team be permitted to investigate alleged attacks on \ncivilians throughout the country, including attacks in Darfur. The \nGovernment of Sudan should have no formal or informal veto power over \nthis team's investigations. The team was established as a confidence-\nbuilding measure, and it was agreed to by all parties. But to suggest \nthat the Government of Sudan should be able to pick and choose areas in \nwhich the team is permitted to conduct its inquiries undermines \nconfidence.\n  I do respect the fact that delicate diplomacy is ongoing, and I want \nto be able to celebrate a lasting end to Sudan's north-south civil war \nas much as any Member of this body. But none of that changes the fact \nthat what is happening in Darfur is inexcusable, it is undermining the \nNaivasha peace process, and it is casting a pall over the future of \nSudan at a time when light had finally begun to shine on that long-\nsuffering country. It is time to stop expressing quiet concern, and to \nstart treating this crisis with the urgency it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3361-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3361-S3362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in conjunction with the March celebration \nof Women's History Month, I rise today to salute a number of women who \nhave dedicated themselves to the fight against global AIDS and HIV.\n  This year the theme of Women's History Month is ``Women Inspiring \nHope and Possibility.'' It may seem that phrase is too broad--and a \nmonth is too short--to fully recognize or appreciate the many and \nvaried accomplishments of women throughout the years. From the medical \nprofessional who administers compassion along with her care, to the \neducator who inspires her pupils and allows them to achieve, to the \nmother who installs in her children feelings of worth and value, women \nfoster hope and opportunity in their everyday actions.\n  While traditionally this month is used to commemorate women from the \npast, it seems fitting that we take some time to look at modern-day \nheroines. Today, the women we honor are busy ensuring that HIV/AIDS \nwill soon be relegated to a chapter in history--a terrible and \nsorrowful chapter but history nonetheless.\n  There are 42 million people throughout the world living with HIV/\nAIDS. We saw more than 3 million AIDS-related deaths in 2003. Each \nyear, AIDS deaths claim more than the entire population of Chicago. \nLife expectancy has dropped below 40 years of age in 10 countries in \nsub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has already erased 15 years of progress in the \nworse affected countries. Despite our efforts to date, this epidemic \ncontinues its deadly spread across the globe.\n  More than 30 million HIV/AIDS sufferers are located in sub-Saharan \nAfrica or Southeast Asia, where more than 60 percent of those infected \nare women. At especially high risk are teenage girls, who frequently \nmarry older men at a very young age, and have little control over their \ndestiny. This, in turn, puts the next generation of children in a \nposition or susceptibility, as each year about 120,000 HIV-positive \nwomen become pregnant.\n  As Americans, it is sometimes hard to see that the AIDS epidemic is \nnot just across the ocean, it is in every part of this world. It is in \nour own backyard and poses a threat from every direction. Once a person \nhas seen its devastation face to face, he or she will never be the \nsame.\n\n  Three years ago, I went to Africa and saw it myself. I saw it in \nUganda, where I sat on a porch with mothers who were HIV-positive. They \nwere gathering scrapbooks, photos, notes, and little memorabilia of \ntheir lives to leave to their children who were in the yard playing, \nchildren who had been orphaned already, or who, having lost one parent, \nwere about to lose their second parent.\n  I saw it as I traveled through Botswana and South Africa. A senior \ngovernmental official confided to me that whenever she travels from her \nbusy capital to her home district, she loads up a large van with \ncoffins and tents, and spends her time helping her constituents, one \nafter another, bury their loved ones and grieve for their dead. She \nattends funerals, not parades. She gives away coffins, not bumper \nstickers. There are the politics of Africa in the era of AIDS.\n  Most recently, as I traveled to India and Bangladesh, I witnessed the \nplight of the rural, female AIDS sufferer, and I saw those who were \nworking to help her. I firmly believe that the future of India lies in \nthe hands of its women.\n  When you meet the victims of AIDS, when you see their courage, and \nsee what little it takes to fight this AIDS epidemic successfully, as \nthey have in Uganda and a few other countries, you realize that our \nleadership and our commitment at this moment in history can make such a \ndifference.\n  Two women, Dr. Helene Gayle and Dr. Amy Pollack, head organizations \ndedicated to providing that leadership and to preventing the spread of \nthe disease through multifaceted intervention and family planning.\n  Dr. Gayle, who cochairs the Global HIV Prevention Working Group for \nthe Gates Foundation, previously worked for the Centers for Disease \nControl, CDC. There, she initiated HIV-prevention programs built around \nU.S. communities, as well as the CDC's global AIDS initiative. It is \nher belief that a comprehensive approach that includes prevention \nservices, such as STD treatment, behavioral risk reduction, and \nvoluntary HIV testing, along with HIV treatment and care for affected \npopulations, is the cornerstone of stemming the AIDS pandemic. Wielding \nthe influence of the Gates Foundation name and funding, she is in a \nunique position to ensure implementation of these methods, and she has \ndone so with great success.\n  Dr. Pollack's EngenderHealth organization was a 2002 United Nations \nPopulation Award laureate. Through her trips to Africa, Dr. Pollack, \nhas borne witness to EngenderHealth's unique family planning \ninitiatives, concentrating on the gap between the desire for \ncontraception and access to it. With a goal of reducing the number of \nHIV-infected children and orphans, EngenderHealth assists clinics to \nclose this gap.\n  I salute the vision of Dr. Gayle and Dr. Pollack and commend them for \ntheir dedication and perseverance.\n  As Americans become more aware of the pandemic proportions of this \ndisease, especially in Africa and South Asia, increasing numbers of \nwomen are working for AIDS awareness, treatment and prevention.\n  Sixteen years ago, three American women whose lives had been touched \nby this horrific disease sat around a kitchen table in Santa Monica, \nCA. Recognizing that there was a huge gap in understanding how infected \nchildren were affected by HIV/AIDS, they cofounded an organization to \nfund research for pediatric AIDS.\n  Today, that organization, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation, is the premier not-for-profit in its field. Although \nElizabeth Glaser, who cofounded the organization with Susan DeLaurentis \nand Susie Zeegan, passed away in 1994, her dream--and her name--live on \nthrough the foundation.\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nToday we honor the legacy of Elizabeth Glaser and the work of these \nthree women.\n  I said at the outset of these remarks that it is traditional to honor \nthe great historical contributions of women in connection with Women's \nHistory Month. The thousands of women working to find a cure, to help \nthose who are suffering, or to cope with this disease in their own \nlives are surely making a lasting and positive impact on the history of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, today I have paid tribute to just a few of these \nwomen. My only regret is that I cannot give much deserved thanks and \nrecognition to all the women who have dealt with, or are dealing with, \nHIV/AIDS in their own lives, in their communities and around the world. \nIn celebrating Women's History Month, we say to them: Thank you. Thank \nyou for your commitment, your compassion, and your courage. Thank you \nfor leading us into a better future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3362-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MICHAEL A. HUGHES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, I express my gratitude to a \nmember of my staff, Michael A. Hughes, who will be returning to his \nregular job as a senior inspector in the U.S. Marshals Service after \ntomorrow. Mike has worked in my office for the past 15 months as a \nlegislative fellow, and my staff and I have been extremely fortunate to \nhave Mike's help. We will miss him.\n  Mike is a New Jersey native who was born in Jersey City. He graduated \nfrom Montclair University with a degree in political science and \ncriminal justice in 1990. After college, he joined the U.S. Marshals \nService--America's oldest federal law enforcement agency--as a deputy \nmarshal and quickly distinguished himself as an outstanding law \nenforcement official. For instance, Mike was tasked with the \nresponsibility of accompanying crime boss John Gotti to and from his \n1992 trial, and then escorting Gotti to the maximum security facility \nfor federal prisoners in Marion, Illinois, after his conviction and \nsentencing. Mike was also responsible for protecting high-ranking \nforeign dignitaries who visited the United Nations headquarters in \nManhattan.\n  Mike conducted several criminal and civil investigations and soon \nbecame an inspector in the U.S. Marshals Service's Witness Security \nProgram. Later, he became a senior inspector. Never in the 30-year \nhistory of the Witness Security Program has a cooperative participant \nor his or her family been discovered or harmed. We can attribute much \nof that recent success to Mike's dedication and professionalism.\n  It has been helpful to me over the past 15 months to have someone \nwith Mike's extensive personal knowledge of guns and law enforcement \nissues. Since Mike has been a member of my staff, he has worked on S. \n1805, the gun immunity bill; S. 1431, my bill to extend the assault \nweapons ban, and other 2nd Amendment issues. He has also made \nsignificant contributions on a number of criminal justice and homeland \nsecurity matters. Mike is committed to promoting public policies that, \nif we were to adopt them, would make our country demonstrably safer.\n  On many occasions, I have remarked that when I moved to the public \nsector after 30 years in the private sector, I was struck by the \ndedication, professionalism, and competence of federal employees. I am \ntired of hearing public sector employees belittled and denigrated in \nsome quarters. I have been impressed by the public servants I have met \nover the years, and Mike is no exception. He has performed his \ndifficult--and often dangerous--duties with distinction. I think Mike \nis an outstanding role model for young adults interested in working in \nour government.\n  Mr. President, as I thank Mike for his tremendous service and wish \nhim the best of luck in his new endeavors, I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to thank John ``Jay'' McNulty, who serves as chief of \nthe Marshals Service's Office of Congressional Affairs. Jay made it \npossible for Mike to come and work for me, and I am grateful for that. \nI have been fortunate to have Mike on my staff; the Nation is fortunate \nto have him in the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3362-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      RECOGNIZING THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR ORGAN DONATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I take a moment to recognize the \nInternational Association for Organ Donation, IAOD. The IAOD strives to \nincrease awareness of organ donation and transplantation, as well as \nbone marrow and tissue donation. This organization provides educational \nand outreach programs to the general public, with a focus on racial and \nethnic minorities.\n  Each April, the International Association for Organ Donation \ncelebrates National Donate Life Month. This year is especially \nimportant as it marks the 50th anniversary of the first successful \nliver transplant. In honor of this monumental occasion, the IAOD is \nsponsoring ``50 Years of Sharing Life'' to publicize the plight of \nthose in need of an organ transplant.\n  Today in America, 83,000 patients are currently awaiting an organ \ntransplant. Although there are 68 successful organ transplants each \nday, an additional 100 patients are added to the waiting list and \nsadly, 18 people die each day as they wait for this life-saving \nprocedure. Tissue donations, such as bone marrow, are also in short \nsupply. Nearly 3,000 people are searching the National Marrow Donor \nProgram Registry at any one time and an additional 3,000 patients are \nadded to the registry each month.\n  There is something we all can do to reduce these staggering \nstatistics. Great strides could be made if the estimated 10,000 to \n14,000 eligible Americans who die each year pledge to become organ \ndonors. The IAOD is a driving force in sharing the message that life is \na gift to share.\n  It is with great pleasure that I offer my sincerest appreciation and \nsupport to the International Association for Organ Donation as it \ncelebrates the 50th anniversary of the first successful liver \ntransplant. I give my thanks to the organization, its staff, and its \npartners as they work to fulfill their lifesaving mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3362-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3362-S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  25TH ANNIVERSARY OF SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER AND FLOM DELAWARE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom Delaware. This \norganization is celebrating a quarter century of nationally renowned \nexpertise in corporate mergers and acquisitions here in the First \nState. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom has built a reputation \nfor providing integral service throughout the Nation and in Delaware. \nIf this organization's first quarter century is any indication of what \nit will offer in the future, we have much to which to look forward.\n  Marshall Skadden, John Slate, and Les Arps founded the firm in New \nYork City on April Fool's Day, 1948. After starting with just three \nlawyers, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom has grown to more than \n1,700 lawyers in nine offices--seven in the United States, one in \nTokyo, and one in London. Few, if any, law firms in America today are \nmore highly regarded professionally or financially successful.\n  The firm's client list includes more than one-third of the Fortune \n500 companies, 10 of the top 15 U.S. commercial banks, 23 of the top 25 \nU.S. investment banks and 7 of the top 10 Japanese banks doing business \nin the United States. The organization's more than 20 individual \npractice areas serve as visible proof of the successful philosophy: \nthat the client's needs always come first; that they can and do commit \na maximum effort to provide top quality advice and timely service to \nclients; and that the law firm can and should be run as a business, \nconsistent with professional responsibilities.\n  It was 25 years ago, in May of 1979, that Rodman Ward, Jr. and Steven \nJ. Rothschild agreed to open the Wilmington, DE, office of Skadden, \nArps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, becoming the 46th and 47th partners in \nthat firm. Skadden Delaware became the first major out-of-town law firm \nto open an office in the State of Delaware.\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n  Over the past 25 years, Skadden Delaware has grown tenfold, from its \noriginal six attorneys to its present complement of nearly 60, becoming \none of the largest and most influential law offices in the State of \nDelaware, and employing more than 150 Delawareans.\n  Skadden Delaware attorneys have counseled clients in many of the \nlargest and most groundbreaking corporate transactions, including \nhighly publicized contests for corporate control, and contributed \nthereby to the reputation of the Delaware courts as the preeminent \narbiters of corporate law issues in the world, and to the State of \nDelaware's dominance as the preferred domicile for corporations large \nand small across the United States.\n  Skadden Delaware lawyers have also contributed their professional and \npersonal resources to a wide variety of civic and charitable endeavors \noutside the confines of their law practice, to the consistent benefit \nof the State of Delaware and its citizens.\n  Former Skadden Delaware lawyers have gone on to hold positions of \nhigh trust and importance in the State of Delaware, serving on the \nCourt of Chancery and the supreme court, as counsel to the Governor, as \nU.S. attorney, and as president of the Delaware bar.\n  I thank Skadden Delaware for all that they do, not only in Delaware, \nbut across the country, and I wish them a very happy 25th anniversary. \nI rise today to offer my full support and to congratulate them on a \nremarkable quarter century of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3363-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3363-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/30/senate-section/article/S3363-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 3926.

A bill to revise certain requirements for H-2B employers for \nfiscal year 2004, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Summer \nOperations and Services or ``SOS'' Relief and Reform Act, S. 2258.\n  Across our Nation, there are businesses, many of which are small, \nwhich look forward to the summer time each year as an opportunity to \nconduct their seasonal operations. From Utah to Alaska to New England \nand down to the Southern States, innkeepers, swimming pool operators, \nand fishermen rely on the income generated during the summer months to \nfeed their families, employ their neighbors, and contribute to their \nlocal economies. Individually, these businesses may not be big \noperations, but collectively, they are an integral part of the American \neconomy.\n  Because of the nature of our country's labor market, and perhaps \nbecause of the unattractiveness of seasonal versus permanent work, \nthese operations have traditionally relied upon the H-2B visa program \nto bring needed workers from abroad. For those who may not understand \nthe purpose for this program, let me explain it. An employer is only \nallowed to request an H-2B worker when no American worker is available \nfor the same job. An employer is not allowed to pay lower wages to \nthese foreign visa holders. Throughout our immigration history, the H-\n2B program has remained noncontroversial.\n  This year, perhaps as a sign of our economy's increasing vitality, \nthe H-2B annual cap of 66,000 visas has already been reached. \nMeanwhile, small businesses across the country warn that if Congress \ndoes not make some sort of accommodation, they stand to suffer \nimmeasurable losses. Failing to act would not only be detrimental to \nthese small businessowners, many of whom simply cannot afford to lose \nan entire year's worth of profit, but would hurt the Americans whose \njobs also depend on the stability of these businesses. The negative \nimpact upon the hospitality and tourism sectors would be severe as \nwell. In other words, unless we act quickly and give these seasonal \noperations the resources they need, we are facing a very bleak summer \nfor many hard-working Americans and entrepreneurs.\n  That said, as much as I want to do all that I can to save this summer \nof seasonal work, I also want to make sure that in our haste, we do not \nestablish unsound policy and set a bad precedent for the future. Many \nimmigration reformists oppose increasing numbers in any immigration \nprogram. I oppose simply raising the numbers indiscriminately. Instead, \nwhat we need is a program that is tied to the realities of our economy \nand our job market. The reform I propose in ``SOS'' will bring us \ncloser to this ultimate goal.\n  Specifically, S. 2258 does not raise the visa cap number. Instead, it \nexempts those who were admitted on an H-2B visa during the past 2 \nfiscal years from the cap for the remainder of this year. This is a \ngood reform approach for several reasons: First, the number of actual \nworkers admitted will be dictated by the strength of the economy, and \nnot by a random number that resulted from political compromise. Second, \nit gives preferential treatment to those who have used the program \nbefore, and who have complied with the law and returned to their home \ncountries at the end of the season. Third and finally, it would allow \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to delegate to the Secretary of \nLabor the specific as well as inherent authority to investigate \nfraudulent immigration and employment practices. No immigration reform \ncan be complete without addressing that issue. Of course, this bill \ndoes not represent all of the reforms that are needed, but is it a step \nin the right direction, while providing immediate relief for our \nseasonal businesses.\n  I thank Chairman Chambliss of the Judiciary Committee's Immigration \nSubcommittee for his valuable input and for being our lead cosponsor on \nthis bill. I also want to thank the administration for its contribution \nand expertise in reforming the H-2B visa program in an administratively \nfeasible manner. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the \ncontribution made by the other original cosponsors, Senators Allen, \nGregg, Collins, Murkowski, Warner, and Thomas.\n  Let me conclude by emphasizing that without our immediate attention \nto this pressing problem, local economies will face substantial losses. \nLet us work together to prioritize the health of America's seasonal \nbusinesses, and safeguard the livelihood of all the people who depend \non them. I ask my colleagues for their bipartisan cooperation in the \ntimely passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2259. A bill to provide for the protection of the flag of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 15 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court, in a \n5 to 4 decision, struck down a Texas flag protection statute. The \nSupreme Court ruled that burning an American flag was a form of \n``speech,'' and therefore protected under the first amendment of the \nConstitution.\n  I disagreed with the Court's decisions then and I still do. I don't \nbelieve that the act of desecrating a flag is an act of speech. And I \nbelieve that our flag, as our national symbol, can and should be \nprotected by law.\n  In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision, I have \nsupported Federal legislation that would make flag desecration illegal. \nYet on several occasions, I have also voted against amendments to the \nConstitution to do the same.\n  I voted that way because, while I believe that flag desecration is \ndespicable conduct that should be prohibited by law, I also believe \nthat amending our Constitution is a step that should be taken only \nrarely, and then only as a last resort.\n  In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of \nthe legal opinions and written materials published by constitutional \nscholars and courts on all sides of this issue. After that review, I \nhave concluded that there remains a way to protect our flag without \nhaving to alter the Constitution of the United States. So I am joining \nSenator Bennett today to introduce bipartisan legislation that \naccomplishes that goal.\n  The bill we introduce today protects the flag but does so without \naltering the Constitution. A number of respected constitutional \nscholars tell us they believe this type of statute will be upheld by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\nThis statute protects the flag by criminalizing flag desecration when \nits intended purpose is to incite violence.\n  I know that supporters of a constitutional amendment will be \ndisappointed by my decision to support this statutory remedy to protect \nthe flag, rather than support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I \nknow they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that \nthey and I believe was wrong.\n  I have wrestled with this issue for a long time, and I wish I were \nnot, with my decision, disappointing those, including many of my \nfriends, who passionately believe that we must amend the Constitution \nto protect the flag. But, in the end, I know that our country will be \nbetter served reserving our attempts to alter the Constitution only for \nthose things that are, in the words of James Madison, ``extraordinary \noccasion.''\n  More than 11,000 constitutional amendments have been proposed since \nour Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the \nBill of Rights in 1791 only 17 amendments have been enacted. These 17 \ninclude 3 reconstruction era amendments that abolished slavery and gave \nAfrican Americans the right to vote.\n  The amendments included giving women the right to vote, limiting \nPresidents to two terms, and establishing an order of succession in \ncase of a President's death or departure from office. The last time \nCongress considered and passed a new constitutional amendment was when \nit changed the voting age to 18, more than a quarter of a century ago. \nAll of these matters were of such scope they required a constitutional \namendment to be accomplished. They could not have been accomplished \notherwise.\n  But protecting the American flag can be accomplished without amending \nthe Constitution, and that is a critically important point.\n  The bill we are introducing today, on a bipartisan basis, outlaws \nthree types of illegal flag desecration.\n  First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent \nto incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may be punished by \na fine of up to $100,000, or up to 1 year in jail, or both. Second, \nanyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States and destroys \nor damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 \nyears, or both. And third, anyone who steals a flag may also be fined \nup to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both.\n  Constitutional scholars, including those at the Congressional \nResearch Service, the research arm of Congress, and Duke University's \nProfessor William Alstyne, have concluded that this statute passes \nconstitutional muster, because it recognizes that the same standard \nthat already applies to other forms of speech applies to burning the \nflag as well.\n  This is the same standard which makes it illegal to falsely cry \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless speech that is likely to cause \nviolence is not protected under the ``fighting words'' standard, long \nrecognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  So we are offering this bipartisan legislation with the confidence \nthat its passage would meaningfully and effectively protect our \ncherished flag.\n  I believe that future generations, and our Founding Fathers, would \nagree that it is worthwhile for us to find a way to protect our flag \nwithout altering the Constitution. And so I ask those colleagues who, \nlike me, care deeply about both our flag and our Constitution, to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2259\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection Act of \n     2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the united states\n\n       ``(a) Definition of Flag of the United States.--In this \n     section, the term `flag of the United States' means any flag \n     of the United States, or any part thereof, made of any \n     substance, in any size, in a form that is commonly displayed \n     as a flag and that would be taken to be a flag by the \n     reasonable observer.\n       ``(b) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and under circumstances in which the \n     person knows that it is reasonably likely to produce imminent \n     violence or a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more \n     than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States, and who intentionally destroys or \n     damages that flag, shall be fined not more than $250,000, \n     imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(d) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and who \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag, shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000, imprisoned not more than 2 years, or \n     both.\n       ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory, or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.''\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The chapter \n     analysis for chapter 33 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking the item relating to section 700 and \n     inserting the following:\n\n700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag \n              of the United States.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2260. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for fairness in the calculation of medicare disproportionate \nshare hospital payments for hospitals in Puerto Rico; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Medicare DSH \npayments for Puerto Rico Hospitals Fairness Act of 2004. This \nlegislation seeks to provide fairness for Puerto Rico hospitals in \ntheir qualification for disproportionate share payments under the \nMedicare Program.\n  The primary purpose of the DSH program is to reimburse hospitals for \nthe higher Medicare costs associated with treating low-income Medicare \npatients. Under current law, hospitals providing essential health care \nto low-income Medicare patients in Puerto Rico are effectively denied \nequitable reimbursement, because the law is being applied in such a way \nthat a significant portion of the low-income population served by \nPuerto Rico hospitals is not allowed to count toward DSH calculations.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would amend section \n1886(d)(9)(D)(iii) of the Social Security Act to help ensure that \nPuerto Rico's low-income Medicare beneficiaries and hospitals that \ntreat them have access to the same health care as the mainland.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2260\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare DSH Payments for \n     Puerto Rico Hospitals Fairness Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CALCULATION OF MEDICARE DSH PAYMENTS FOR PPS \n                   HOSPITALS IN PUERTO RICO.\n\n       Section 1886(d)(9)(D)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(9)(D)(iii)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(iii) Subparagraph (F) (relating to disproportionate \n     share payments), except that for this purpose--\n       ``(I) the sum described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph \n     shall be substituted for the sum referred to in paragraph \n     (5)(F)(ii)(I); and\n       ``(II) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, \n     2004, subclause (I) of paragraph (5)(F)(vi) shall be applied \n     by substituting for the numerator described in such subclause \n     the number of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital's patient \n     days for a cost reporting period that are made up of patients \n     who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of \n     this title and were recipients of aid under the State plan \n     approved under title XVI that provides for grants to States \n     for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n        Voinovich, and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 2261. A bill to expand certain preferential trade treatment for \nHaiti; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to reach out \nto the least developed country in the Western Hemisphere--we have an \nopportunity to reach out to the island nation of Haiti.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Graham of Florida, Lugar, Baucus, \nChafee, Dodd, Voinovich, and Nelson of Florida in introducing the Haiti \nEconomic Opportunity Act of 2004. I also would like to thank \nRepresentative Shaw, as well as our other House cosponsors, for their \nsupport of this bill.\n  Our bill would use trade incentives to encourage the post-Aristide \ngovernment to make much needed reforms, while encouraging foreign \ndirect investment--the most powerful, and yet underutilized, tool of \ndevelopment. The bill's provisions apply the least developed country \nprovisions of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, to Haiti--\nthe least developed country in our Hemisphere.\n  Specifically, our bill would provide duty-free entry to apparel \narticles assembled in Haiti contingent upon Presidential certification \nthat the new government is making significant political, economic, and \nsocial reforms. The bill also caps the amount of duty-free articles at \n1.5 percent of the total amount of U.S. apparel imports, growing to 3.5 \npercent over 7 years. Currently, Haiti accounts for less than one-half \nof 1 percent of all U.S. apparel imports, and although these provisions \nseem modest by U.S. standards, in Haiti they are substantial.\n  The enactment of this legislation would promote employment in Haitian \nindustry by allowing Haiti to become a garment production center again. \nHaiti has a labor advantage that makes it competitive compared to other \ncountries in the region, and at one time several years ago over 100,000 \npeople were employed in assembly jobs. Now, that number stands at just \n30,000, and regional and global economic conditions are quickly \nconverging to eliminate any chance of Haiti reestablishing a foothold \nin the garment production market.\n  Our window of opportunity to act expires at the end of the year, when \nquotas are phased out of the global market for textiles and apparel, \nand countries, such as China, are allowed to fully enter the market. In \naddition, Haiti has been largely left out of the Central American Free-\nTrade Agreement negotiations, gaining only small concessions for \ncoproduction with the Dominican Republic. These concessions are \nnecessary but far from sufficient for creating jobs.\n  I have traveled to Haiti 13 times, and there is no doubt that Haiti \nneeds this opportunity. No other nation in our hemisphere is as \nimpoverished. Today, at least 80 percent of all Haitians live in abject \npoverty, with at least 80 percent under- or unemployed. Per capita \nannual income is less than $400.\n  No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher rate of HIV/AIDS. \nToday, AIDS is the No. 1 cause of all adult deaths in Haiti, killing at \nleast 30,000 Haitians annually and orphaning 200,000 children.\n  No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher infant mortality rate \nor a lower life expectancy rate.\n  And, no other nation in our hemisphere is as environmentally \nstrapped. Haiti is an ecological disaster, with a 98-percent \ndeforestation level and extreme topsoil erosion.\n  Despite this, U.S. assistance has reached its lowest level in over a \ndecade. This needs to change. Haiti is in our backyard, inexorably \nlinked to the United States by history, geography, humanitarian \nconcerns, the illicit drug trade, and the ever-present possibility of \nwaves of incoming refugees. Haiti's problems are our problems.\n  In an environment such as this, foreign assistance is not enough to \ncreate economic opportunities, promote development, and reverse these \ndire conditions. Economic development is the answer, bringing with it \nlower unemployment, increased infrastructure development, and spillover \neffects for the rest of Haiti's population.\n  This bill is not the ``silver bullet'' for Haiti, because there is no \nsilver bullet. Rebuilding Haiti is going to require time, attention, \nand determination on the part of the people of Haiti, the countries in \nthe region, and ultimately the entire international community. This \nbill would be a powerful indicator that Haiti has the support necessary \nto move forward. I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Economic Recovery \n     Opportunity Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRADE BENEFITS TO HAITI.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act \n     (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \n     section 213 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 213A.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Violence Against Children \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) People under the age of 18 make up approximately 12 \n     percent of all crime victims known to police, including 71 \n     percent of all sex crime victims and 38 percent of all \n     kidnaping victims.\n       (2) People from the ages of 12 through 17 are over 2 times \n     more likely to be victims of violent crime than adults.\n       (3) It has been estimated that only 28 percent of crimes \n     against children are actually reported.\n       (4) Some 1,200 children die as a result of abuse each year, \n     and approximately 879,000 children are victims of abuse.\n       (5) Child abuse has long-lasting negative effects upon \n     children and families, including delayed development, \n     depression, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of \n     experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence as an adult.\n       (6) Most local agencies lack adequate resources to protect \n     and serve the needs of children and families that are brought \n     to their attention.\n       (7) Failure to pay child support is in itself a form of \n     neglect, as children who do not receive financial support are \n     more likely to live in poverty, and are therefore more likely \n     to suffer from inadequate education, a lack of quality health \n     care, and a lack of affordable housing.\n\n       TITLE I--ENHANCED FEDERAL ROLE IN CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. __04.
